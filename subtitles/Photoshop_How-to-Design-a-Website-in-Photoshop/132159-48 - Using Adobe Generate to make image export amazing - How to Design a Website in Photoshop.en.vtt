00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
Now this video is a very similar technique that we

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.830
did when we were doing the Export As feature.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.315
So we right-clicked the layer and we said export As or use the Quick Export.

00:00:09.315 --> 00:00:11.235
This one does a similar job,

00:00:11.235 --> 00:00:13.440
but it's a lot more automated and it's really great when

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.720
you are working, especially with yourself,

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.670
you're developing stuff from Photoshop as a mock up

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.620
and then you're getting essays ready and

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.690
developing it as a website and you can come

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.465
back and forth quite quickly using this Adobe Generate.

00:00:24.465 --> 00:00:27.075
First thing you need to do, is turn Adobe regenerate on.

00:00:27.075 --> 00:00:28.725
If you don't have Adobe Generate here,

00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:30.345
it means you're using an early vision,

00:00:30.345 --> 00:00:31.885
either CS6 and earlier,

00:00:31.885 --> 00:00:33.380
and you're not going to have this feature.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.870
But if you are in the any of the later versions,

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.080
we can get a file and we can turn this one that says image assets.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.855
You turn it on and nothing happens, okay.

00:00:41.855 --> 00:00:44.570
So File generate and he sees a little techniques to it.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.315
So I know it's on, it's doing something.

00:00:46.315 --> 00:00:48.620
What I'm going to do is save my document in

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.215
a special place just so I know where it is and I save on my desktop,

00:00:51.215 --> 00:00:53.900
I'm going to make a new folder for you guys just so you can see it.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.565
This is going to be my generate export folder.

00:00:58.565 --> 00:01:03.830
I'm just saving the PSD into this folder here version of it. Click "Okay".

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.230
So I'll show you here on the desktop.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.850
On my desktop it's called generate export folder and this is the PSD that I'm working on,

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.335
just sitting by itself.

00:01:12.335 --> 00:01:14.730
Make sure Generate is on, for me it's turned itself

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.445
off because of the Save As, make sure it's ticked on.

00:01:17.445 --> 00:01:18.690
Now what I want to do is,

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.285
let's say this image here I would like to save it out.

00:01:21.285 --> 00:01:22.700
With a bit of experience,

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.110
you know that it's going to be a JPG

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.690
because it doesn't need transparency and it's an image.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.255
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to name this one here, dot JPG.

00:01:32.255 --> 00:01:35.700
I've image hyphen books dot JPG.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.650
What you'll notice is, back at that same folder,

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.794
do you see magically it's created this folder called export generate essence.

00:01:41.794 --> 00:01:44.650
Here is my image, my layer export as a JPG.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.455
Okay, it's done, it all automatically.

00:01:46.455 --> 00:01:49.590
Same thing is, say if I wanted it actually to be a PNG.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.085
I can just, in my layers menu here, name it a PNG.

00:01:53.085 --> 00:01:58.055
Those over here, it's actually removed the JPG and switched it out for a PNG.

00:01:58.055 --> 00:02:03.199
Okay, so this is a really quick and easy way to export files,

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:05.900
but it's also a really nice way if you are making adjustments,

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.270
because it's a dynamic link, it's always adjusting.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.865
So it deletes the JPG and adds a PNG.

00:02:10.865 --> 00:02:15.710
So I've got this image bookings dot PNG selected and what I'm going to do is,

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.220
I'm going to add a layer effects and I'm going to add

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.940
a color overlay and I'm going to play around with,

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.315
instead of normal which is [inaudible] I'm going to switch it to multiply,

00:02:26.315 --> 00:02:30.620
pick a color, and I'll make it kind of like an old CPS style.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.900
You'll notice, as soon as I click "Okay",

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.370
if I switch out to my Images,

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.770
can you see it was getting remade as I turned up and it's

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.950
a new PNG with the new color scheme in there.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.510
If I go through and change it again,

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.525
will change into something a bit more, a bit stronger.

00:02:44.525 --> 00:02:46.575
Okay, its green. Watch it in here,

00:02:46.575 --> 00:02:48.290
it's re-making it in the green,

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.400
so it's a dynamic link.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.605
You can keep moving, it keeps making the images.

00:02:51.605 --> 00:02:54.280
So I know that one needs to be a JPG.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.310
Okay, when it comes to JPGs,

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.680
I know that it's coming through is JPG,

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.790
watch this, there it is.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.160
Now JPG that's quite big, it's 56.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.470
So what I can do is there,

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.595
is a bit of syntax that I can add to this guy to make it a different resolution.

00:03:07.595 --> 00:03:10.190
At the end, can you see down here in my last panel,

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.100
I might make this a little bit bigger so you can see on the screen-cast,

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.850
is that at the end here, I can type in.

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.390
If I type in a one and it's going to make it a 10 percent JPG and remake it.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.040
Watch this, it's remaking it 10 percent,

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.480
it is really small file size,

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.175
but it's probably bad quality.

00:03:25.175 --> 00:03:28.220
So if you know, after a bit of experience, you start knowing that.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.955
I know that if I probably go at about 40,

00:03:30.955 --> 00:03:33.440
just before the end, it's going to remake it,

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.855
it's a reasonable size, the quality is fine.

00:03:35.855 --> 00:03:38.060
Same thing happens if I want it to be a PNG.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.035
If I want it to be a PNG and I know I want to be a PNG eight,

00:03:41.035 --> 00:03:43.534
or if you know you want it to be a 24,

00:03:43.534 --> 00:03:46.025
you can type both of those in and it will make the PNG

00:03:46.025 --> 00:03:48.835
eight versus 24, whatever you need.

00:03:48.835 --> 00:03:50.870
Now there are a bunch of different syntax you can add

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.940
to the end and the beginning for quality,

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.940
emphasize, I haven't got time to go through every single one of them here.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.670
So, if you want a printable sheet for all the different syntax,

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.090
download them from this link here.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.820
One last thing before we go is,

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.360
you can start doing groups.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.320
Let's say that you've got a logo here,

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.240
but it's got a circle as part of it, okay,

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.470
there's different part to your logo and you want to export it as one big lump, okay.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.885
So it's a white spot with the word, bring your laptop.

00:04:14.885 --> 00:04:17.030
Now what you can do is, watch this,

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.585
is my ellipse and there is my bring your laptop, they're there.

00:04:21.585 --> 00:04:23.060
Because if I give these separate names,

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.290
it's going to export them separately.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.045
So what I want to do is with them selected,

00:04:26.045 --> 00:04:29.225
group them, and in this group here,

00:04:29.225 --> 00:04:30.560
I can name this group.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.275
So this one is going to be called BYOL

00:04:33.275 --> 00:04:37.615
logo and it's going to be a dot PNG and it's going to be an eight.

00:04:37.615 --> 00:04:40.025
Great, if I jump out to here,

00:04:40.025 --> 00:04:41.945
I should have logo,

00:04:41.945 --> 00:04:44.300
PNG and it's an eight, [inaudible] ,

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.490
transparency, awesome size, tiny.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.980
It's another great trick to use with Adobe Generate.
