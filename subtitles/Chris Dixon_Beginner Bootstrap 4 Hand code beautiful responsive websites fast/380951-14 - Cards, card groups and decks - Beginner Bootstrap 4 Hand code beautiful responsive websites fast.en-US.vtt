00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.125
We are now we're going to take a look at using cards in Bootstrap,

00:00:04.125 --> 00:00:08.610
and you can think of a card as a container for some information.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.895
A typical use case could be a product listing

00:00:11.895 --> 00:00:15.480
on an e-commerce store just like we see here.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.170
We can start our public listing with a class of

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.250
code wrapper and also make use of many of the classes,

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.969
which Bootstrap provides to layout our content.

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:28.620
Inside of our wrapper,

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.310
we could have a card image and then below this we can also

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.820
have a card body to wrap all of the rest of the content.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.870
Depending on the use case to the card body,

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.590
can also contain a header and a footer section.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.040
All of the rest of the information for our product such as a card title,

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.609
a subtitle and also the context for our description.

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:00.635
Along with this, we also free to provide any of the HTML markup,

00:01:00.635 --> 00:01:04.355
which you may need, such as the "buy it now" button.

00:01:04.355 --> 00:01:08.950
We can make this look and feel exactly how we want it to.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.200
Now we're going to go over to our project and apply

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.590
this card structure to our product pricing page.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.075
Mentioned for when creating our navigation links,

00:01:21.075 --> 00:01:24.560
now we need to create a Pricing and Contact Us page.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.575
We're going to get to work now on the pricing page and introduced Bootstrap cards.

00:01:29.575 --> 00:01:33.460
This is what the final pricing page is going to look like.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.625
We're going to make use of the cards to create this layout,

00:01:36.625 --> 00:01:37.795
which is going to contain

00:01:37.795 --> 00:01:43.195
our free pricing sections using some of the classes which we just looked up before.

00:01:43.195 --> 00:01:46.645
If you also want to find out more about Bootstrap cards,

00:01:46.645 --> 00:01:49.075
we can head over to the documentation,

00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:52.960
and we can find this located in the components link.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.820
Of course, feel free to take a look through these card documentation which I'm

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.690
going to jump into the project and get to work with these pricing sections.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.590
Let's start by creating our new file for

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.375
our pricing page inside the roots of our directory.

00:02:10.375 --> 00:02:14.415
We want to call this pricing HTML,

00:02:14.415 --> 00:02:17.180
since this is a HTML file.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.290
Once again, we need to bring over all of the boost up links.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.775
We're also going to be using the same header to be consistent too.

00:02:24.775 --> 00:02:29.045
I'm going to get a head start by going to the index page,

00:02:29.045 --> 00:02:35.370
selecting all grabbing it and then pasting this into our pricing page.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.265
Just above our JavaScript,

00:02:38.265 --> 00:02:41.370
we can remove the unrequired sections,

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.945
so we don't need the bottom section with the nested row.

00:02:44.945 --> 00:02:48.985
We don't need the four images so we can remove these,

00:02:48.985 --> 00:02:51.960
we don't need the section with the icons,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.500
this can also go, and finally,

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.660
we don't need the list group items.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.335
Let's give this file a save,

00:03:01.335 --> 00:03:03.530
and if we go over to the browser,

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.010
let's click on the pricing link,

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.090
and we're left with the same navigation and top header section.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.700
Next thing to do is to change the site title, open the head.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.895
On the end of this I'm going to add pricing,

00:03:18.895 --> 00:03:21.215
since this is the pricing page.

00:03:21.215 --> 00:03:25.450
Now let's scroll down and we can create our new section for all cards.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.785
At the bottom of the body section,

00:03:27.785 --> 00:03:29.390
just above our JavaScript,

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.445
we can add our new section.

00:03:31.445 --> 00:03:34.505
This is going to have the class of container,

00:03:34.505 --> 00:03:38.480
so it's a fixed size nested inside here.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.590
I'm going to create a div,

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.340
which is going to be a wrapper for the free card sections.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.990
This is going to have a class which is going to be equal to card-deck.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.855
We'll take a look at this in more detail when we have some cards to work with.

00:03:53.855 --> 00:03:56.990
For now though we can add a margin value of three on the top and

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.190
bottom and also align the text into the center.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.255
Now we can go ahead and create our first card.

00:04:05.255 --> 00:04:11.370
This is going to have a div as a wrapper with the class of card.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.975
The class of card will set the position,

00:04:14.975 --> 00:04:17.030
the display type to be flax,

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.510
the word drop on the general colors and borders.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.270
Then inside here I'm going to create some new sections.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.050
We're going to create the card header and also the card body.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.385
Let's start with the header section at the top,

00:04:30.385 --> 00:04:32.850
this is the card header.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.125
Inside here this is going to have a level four heading,

00:04:36.125 --> 00:04:38.780
with the price of the plan.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.805
The level four heading and the first price is going to be free,

00:04:43.805 --> 00:04:49.630
this also takes in a Bootstrap class of font-weight normal.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.200
Which other sounds, we'll set the phones to have a weight of normal,

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.055
and this is nested inside of our header section.

00:04:58.055 --> 00:05:02.390
This card header class is going to add a radius to the top of the card,

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.345
some spacing and also all colors.

00:05:05.345 --> 00:05:07.774
Just after this header section,

00:05:07.774 --> 00:05:10.390
we can create our body section.

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:15.815
As expected, this is going to have the class of card body which is going to

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:21.505
set the flexbox grow and shrink values along with spacing and sizing.

00:05:21.505 --> 00:05:25.265
Inside here our level two heading,

00:05:25.265 --> 00:05:28.145
which is going to have the price of the plan.

00:05:28.145 --> 00:05:31.444
A class of card title,

00:05:31.444 --> 00:05:34.834
which will add some margins to the box of our title.

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:36.470
This is a free plan,

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.250
so the price is going to be zero followed by

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.360
the small tags where we're going to have the forward slash and then month.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:51.030
This also has a class which is provided by Bootstrap and this is going to be text muted.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.915
If we say this, we can see exactly what this class is doing.

00:05:56.915 --> 00:05:59.225
Let's reload our pricing page,

00:05:59.225 --> 00:06:02.675
and this makes it smaller and a different color.

00:06:02.675 --> 00:06:05.120
After the level two heading,

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.690
we can add the card text inside of a p elements.

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.720
This class of card text when you use

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.100
a Bootstrap is used for the bulk of our texts in the card,

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.230
such as a product description,

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:24.900
and our description is going to be "try it out for free-forever".

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.445
Below this we can create our own order list.

00:06:28.445 --> 00:06:32.870
The unordered list is going to have some features about this pricing plan.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:40.480
What exactly is included on the unordered list has a Bootstrap class of list on styles.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.865
This will remove all the style inflow lists.

00:06:43.865 --> 00:06:47.630
We can add some margin on the top and bottom as a value of

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.895
four and then create our list items inside.

00:06:51.895 --> 00:06:54.560
The first feature for the free plan,

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.690
I'm going to add one terabyte of storage,

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:03.620
and we can duplicate this five more times, decrease more features.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:09.210
It's x for the second one is going to be hundreds of pre-built themes.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:14.900
As I will go ahead and add any text you would like inside of this to make it your own.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.530
I'm going to add next the calendar and scheduling.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.300
If all point is going to be reminders and alerts,

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:33.760
second to last is going to be unlimited list and pages.

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:37.840
Then finally, custom labels.

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:43.925
Remember we also said before that when using a card,

00:07:43.925 --> 00:07:47.585
we're free to add any other custom HTML which we like,

00:07:47.585 --> 00:07:53.210
we're not restricted to use the card classes and the layout which Bootstrap suggests.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.070
On the unordered list,

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:57.970
we can also add things such as buttons,

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:01.930
and this is going to be a link to get started.

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:06.870
This button is also going to have the type of button.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.920
The base puts in class of btn,

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:17.130
then btn block, which will make this the full width of the page.

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:20.200
We can see this if we save this and refresh,

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.860
this will make the button stretch the full width full of card.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:28.235
We can see this more clear if we add a button outline.

00:08:28.235 --> 00:08:34.955
I'm going to add this as the button outline info, and there we go.

00:08:34.955 --> 00:08:37.420
Since Bootstrap is mobile first,

00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:39.295
this is the full width of the page,

00:08:39.295 --> 00:08:41.455
since we only have one card.

00:08:41.455 --> 00:08:44.560
But now I'm going to go ahead and repeat this for card number 2,

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.130
and 3 and we can see what effect this will have.

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:53.600
Let's grab our card, the surrounding div.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:09:00.710
We can copy this, making sure we keep the surrounding div with the class of card deck.

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:04.420
We can paste this in it two more times.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:09.820
For the middle one, I am going to change this to be the Pro plan rather than free.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:12.355
We can change it to be pro.

00:09:12.355 --> 00:09:16.115
You pricing can be $10 per month.

00:09:16.115 --> 00:09:21.370
The card text upgrades access Pro features.

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:26.800
I'm not going to go ahead and change all of

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.490
these list items because it will make for a pretty boring video.

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:34.885
But of course, go ahead and change these if you would like to see your projects.

00:09:34.885 --> 00:09:41.000
All I'm going to do next is to change the button from "Get Started" to "Upgrade".

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.805
The third one, this can be for the business.

00:09:45.805 --> 00:09:48.160
We can change the price once more,

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.685
let's go for 29, the text,

00:09:51.685 --> 00:09:57.410
unlimited users, and extra storage,

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:03.350
and then change the button at the end to one small b upgrade.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:09.100
Since these are both paid plans on the second and third one,

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.030
I'm also going to change the button to be slightly different.

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:14.170
Rather than using the button outline,

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:17.035
I'm going to change this to be simply button info.

00:10:17.035 --> 00:10:19.455
Here was a solid background color.

00:10:19.455 --> 00:10:21.845
This is going to be on the last one,

00:10:21.845 --> 00:10:24.750
and also the one in the middle.

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:32.005
Reload and now have our free cards side-by-side on the larger view.

00:10:32.005 --> 00:10:35.230
If we scale this down to a mobile device,

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:38.120
these all now stacked vertically.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.260
You'll notice on the desktop view,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.140
these cards have some space in between them.

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:47.290
This is because of the card wrapper.

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:52.225
Early we added this card wrapper and the class of card-deck.

00:10:52.225 --> 00:10:54.310
If we take a look at this,

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:58.135
this class provides the margin around the cards which we see.

00:10:58.135 --> 00:11:02.380
If we wanted to remove this and have no space in between them,

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:05.725
we could change this to be card group instead,

00:11:05.725 --> 00:11:07.905
and go to the browser.

00:11:07.905 --> 00:11:11.315
This will now remove all of the space in between our cards,

00:11:11.315 --> 00:11:13.355
moving them closer together.

00:11:13.355 --> 00:11:16.260
This is another option, but I'm going to reinstate

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.460
the card deck of the space in between these,

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:23.030
and then to finish off this section and also this page,

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:27.295
I'm going to add a header just above this card section.

00:11:27.295 --> 00:11:30.435
Back to all card container,

00:11:30.435 --> 00:11:34.820
we need to add this just above our container. We'll just add it.

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:42.275
Let's add a div, the padding class with a value of 3 to add some spacing all rounds,

00:11:42.275 --> 00:11:45.295
and also the class of tech center.

00:11:45.295 --> 00:11:50.659
Inside of this div, we can add a level 2 heading of pricing,

00:11:50.659 --> 00:11:54.320
and also some texts just below of free to use for

00:11:54.320 --> 00:12:00.910
most users or upgrade your plan to access pro features.

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:09.245
We can also make this stand out by adding any class of lead to our text,

00:12:09.245 --> 00:12:12.710
which we've already looked at previously in this project.

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:14.660
Over to our pricing page,

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:19.420
[inaudible] very nice-looking pricing section for our projects.

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:24.679
This is how we can use Bootstrap cards to quickly lay out our contents.

00:12:24.679 --> 00:12:27.980
The real useful for use cases just like this.
