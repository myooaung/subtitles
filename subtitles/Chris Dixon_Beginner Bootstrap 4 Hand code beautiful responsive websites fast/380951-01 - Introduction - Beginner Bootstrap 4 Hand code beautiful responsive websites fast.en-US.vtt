00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.830
When building websites or applications,

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.300
Bootstrap is one of those tools which can really help out not only beginners,

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.085
but developers of all skill level to get up and running really fast.

00:00:14.085 --> 00:00:17.805
We've only known a little CSS and HTML.

00:00:17.805 --> 00:00:20.700
You can really create some amazing looking project

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.750
just by adding some simple classes to your HTML.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.720
Not only will your websites look great,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.150
there will also be fully responsive too,

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.725
meaning there will be optimized for all different screen sizes.

00:00:34.725 --> 00:00:37.740

Bootstrap is not just about the look and feel now,

00:01:04.685 --> 00:01:08.074
we can also add features such as drop-down menus,

00:01:08.074 --> 00:01:14.335
image carousels, also the ability to show and hide content and so much more,

00:01:14.335 --> 00:01:17.494
all without needing to know about JavaScript.

00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:23.200

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.345

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:45.130
breakpoints, utilities, components and working with third party libraries, the add icons.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.780

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.735
