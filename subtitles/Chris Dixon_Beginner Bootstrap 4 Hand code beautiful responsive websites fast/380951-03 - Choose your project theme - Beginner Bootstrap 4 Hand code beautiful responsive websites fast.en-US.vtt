00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.630
This project covers many of the essential features and components which Bootstrap has to

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.635
offer such as navigation bars, lists, using forms,

00:00:10.635 --> 00:00:13.200
cards, images, and so much more,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.385
all while getting to grips with the Bootstrap grid system and how we can lay out

00:00:17.385 --> 00:00:22.575
our content to be fully responsive and look great on all screen sizes.

00:00:22.575 --> 00:00:25.590
So this is the homepage for the final version,

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.360
which I'm going to build in.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.270
Up at the top we also have a pricing page,

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.435
which will take advantage of Bootstrap cards,

00:00:33.435 --> 00:00:38.770
along with a contact us page to discover how we can use forms in Bootstrap.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.330
This is just my version of the site.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.340
You can either follow along with the exact same project which I'm building,

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.780
which is perfectly fine if you just want to learn what Bootstrap has to offer,

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.240
or instead, if you have a certain idea to mind or just feeling a little creative,

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.700
you can completely change the theme and make it your own as we go.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.695
All you will need in addition to your ideas,

00:01:03.695 --> 00:01:05.570
is some images to use.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.820
If we scroll down to the section,

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.985
here now the four images which I'll be using.

00:01:10.985 --> 00:01:14.510
These have also been provided for use with this course.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.970
If choosing your own theme or design,

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.220
you can also go ahead and find some images which you want to use to replace these four.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.040
If we scroll up, we also have some icons in

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.585
a section and these are provided by the Font Awesome icon library,

00:01:29.585 --> 00:01:31.415
which we'll be adding soon.

00:01:31.415 --> 00:01:36.859
You can also easily change these icons to any of these which will suit your projects.

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:39.695
You can also change anything else on this website

00:01:39.695 --> 00:01:43.340
too by using a different component or utility,

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.670
and we will look at how to do this soon.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.675
So once you've chosen your theme and have any images which you would like to use,

00:01:50.675 --> 00:01:53.750
we can then move on to the next video where we're going

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.690
to begin to set a Bootstrap in our text editor.
