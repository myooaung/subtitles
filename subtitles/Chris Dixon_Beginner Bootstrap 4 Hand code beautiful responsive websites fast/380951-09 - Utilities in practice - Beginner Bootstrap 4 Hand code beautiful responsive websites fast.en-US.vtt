00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.610
Back over to our project,

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.130
the first thing I'm going to do in the first section at

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.910
the top is to center all of this text in the middle.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.205
We can do this with a simple class.

00:00:11.205 --> 00:00:13.665
If we go back to our first section,

00:00:13.665 --> 00:00:15.465
inside of the wrapper,

00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:19.110
all we need to do here is add the class all text-center.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.655
This will push all of the text to the center of our section.

00:00:23.655 --> 00:00:25.950
Also, if you remember from earlier,

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.530
we aligned the section in the middle by

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.250
providing a offset of three columns on the left-hand side.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.390
This is fine and perfectly okay to use,

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.850
but I'm now going to show you an alternative, using Flexbox.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.755
If we remove the offset from earlier,

00:00:42.755 --> 00:00:45.185
this means our section is still the same,

00:00:45.185 --> 00:00:49.390
six columns wide, but we have this now over on the left-hand side.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.550
If we stretch this down to the smaller size,

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.145
this of course will be the full width on smaller devices or medium.

00:00:57.145 --> 00:01:02.420
We're going to push this back into the center by adding the Flexbox to a container.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.670
The container is the row.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.940
We can set the display type to be flex and

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.480
also add the property of justify content in the center.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.289
Save this, and as expected,

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:18.965
we don't see any change on the small screen.

00:01:18.965 --> 00:01:22.205
But if we stretch this out to the medium sized devices,

00:01:22.205 --> 00:01:26.460
this is now in the center of our section to give it some spacing.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.065
We can also add some margin and padding, which we just looked at.

00:01:30.065 --> 00:01:31.820
Starting with the margin,

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.190
we build this up with m for margin,

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:40.015
the y-axis only disappears on the top and bottom and the value of five,

00:01:40.015 --> 00:01:42.240
over to the browser.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.730
This will apply on all screen sizes.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.875
Once we get to the larger screen view,

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:53.375
just like here, mostly we're going to add some padding to make this a little bit larger.

00:01:53.375 --> 00:01:58.535
This is going to apply only on the larger breakpoints on the y-axis.

00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:02.055
So lg, the value of five.

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:03.500
Now down to our text,

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.210
which is the p element.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.540
We're going to use the class of lead which you've already looked at.

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.330
This will make the paragraph text standout where you

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.695
just need font size and also the font weight.

00:02:14.695 --> 00:02:19.054
Bootstrap also has plenty of utility classes for buttons.

00:02:19.054 --> 00:02:21.365
We can add this to our link.

00:02:21.365 --> 00:02:25.520
The base class which we added to all buttons is btn.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.410
Then we can define what type of button we want to use, along with the color.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.670
The color is set with the color utilities which we've looked at before,

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.105
such as primary, secondary, danger and success.

00:02:39.105 --> 00:02:41.650
I'm going to use the class of info,

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.580
which is for a blue color.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.210
We can apply this color as a solid background color or a button outline.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.840
First of all, we have the solid color, which is btn,

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.975
followed by the color name of info,

00:02:55.975 --> 00:02:59.230
leaving us with the solid background color.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.350
If we wanted this just to be the color on the outline,

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.070
all need to do is to change this to be btn outline,

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.080
followed by the color just afterwards.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.020
We can then link these button to our pricing page,

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.030
which we we'll create very soon.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.045
Scrolling down to our next section.

00:03:18.045 --> 00:03:21.870
We can also add some utilities to this section too.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.224
That's enough with the container,

00:03:24.224 --> 00:03:27.410
we can add the margin on the top and bottom as a value

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.860
of four and then a padding value of two.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.660
This will give our section with the list a little bit of spacing.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.195
The next thing I want to do is to align these texts vertically inside of this section.

00:03:40.195 --> 00:03:45.660
We can do this by adding the CSS Flexbox, the container.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.750
We can add the display type of flex, just like we did above.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.400
Then the CSS property of align-item-center,

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.900
and this should now push our text into the middle of the div.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.930
Check this, also looks okay on the small screen.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.510
Now spacing has now been applied.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.230
This is just a first look at using the Bootstrap utilities and how we

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.230
can use them to make our site look really good and also be fully responsive.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.760
We'll also make use of plenty more of

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.480
the bootstrap utilities as we progress with our project.
