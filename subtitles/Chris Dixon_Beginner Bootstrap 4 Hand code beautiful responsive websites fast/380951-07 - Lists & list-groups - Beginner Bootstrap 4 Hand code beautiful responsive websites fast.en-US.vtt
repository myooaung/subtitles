00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
Now we have a better idea of how we can make use of the Bootstrap grid system,

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.270
we're now going to move on to adding some more content to our projects,

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.560
and more specifically, we're going to take a look at how we can use lists.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:19.035
Adding a list is just the same as any other regular HTML element,

00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:21.930
we just add our elements as we would normally do,

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.020
and then we can improve it by adding some bootstrap classes.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.035
I go to the finished version which is open here.

00:00:31.035 --> 00:00:33.735
This is the area which we added just before,

00:00:33.735 --> 00:00:36.210
and we're going to make it look a little nicer just like

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.735
this by adding some bootstrap utilities later on.

00:00:39.735 --> 00:00:44.915
But now we're going to scroll down to the next section which is this part just here.

00:00:44.915 --> 00:00:50.320
Over on the left, we're going to have some text and then a list on the right-hand side.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.270
We already know how to create this layout,

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.385
it will be two equal sections,

00:00:55.385 --> 00:00:58.580
both of them six columns wide and as ever,

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.930
it's going to be nested inside of a row and a surrounding container.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.395
Of course, if you are creating your own version of this,

00:01:06.395 --> 00:01:10.870
you can add different content or different size sections if you prefer.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.000
We're going to push on and create this list group,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.340
if you do want to find out more about lists using

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.800
bootstrap and the different types we can go

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.070
over to the documentation and this is available inside of the Components.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.040
Then if we select the List group,

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.740
this will give us some examples such as lists with borders,

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.160
list with different colors, list without borders,

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.780
you can also get horizontal ones and these are useful for nav-bars.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.410
But now I'm going to go to the project and

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.610
begin by creating a new section just underneath the last one.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.630
This section is going to have the class of container,

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.215
so it's a fixed size.

00:01:55.215 --> 00:01:58.340
Then inside here I'm going to create a div,

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.440
which is going to be our row,

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.355
which is the wrapper for our columns.

00:02:03.355 --> 00:02:08.955
This is going to have two sections both these with a class which becomes

00:02:08.955 --> 00:02:16.035
equal to col-MD-6 creativity.

00:02:16.035 --> 00:02:19.955
They appear side-by-side so again, just to recap,

00:02:19.955 --> 00:02:24.560
both of these sections would be the full width of the page on a small device.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.350
Then when this reaches the medium-sized device,

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.760
it will then it dropped down to be six columns wide.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.990
Starting with the first section,

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.300
which is the text on the left-hand side.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.720
I'm going to add this inside of a p elements with the class of lead.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.130
Lead is a bootstrap class which simply makes the paragraph standout undertakes,

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.250
which I'm going to add is all of these features,

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.340
included on all plans.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.425
This is a pretty simple section.

00:02:57.425 --> 00:03:00.320
The next one over on the right-hand side of

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.980
the page is going to be the section for our list.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.450
As ever, with bootstrap,

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.870
we begin by creating our standard HTML markup.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.065
Our unordered list and then inside we can create our list items.

00:03:14.065 --> 00:03:17.465
For the wrapper which is the unordered list,

00:03:17.465 --> 00:03:21.800
is going to receive a class of list group,

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.165
which we'll set our unordered list to hover display type of flex,

00:03:26.165 --> 00:03:28.325
flex-direction to be column.

00:03:28.325 --> 00:03:33.695
These are stacked vertically and it will also reset any padding and margin,

00:03:33.695 --> 00:03:36.095
down to our list item.

00:03:36.095 --> 00:03:38.285
We're going to add a class inside of here for

00:03:38.285 --> 00:03:42.980
each individual item and this is list-group-item.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.055
This is going to add some border and space in for each one of our list items.

00:03:48.055 --> 00:03:54.480
The first one is going to have the text of hundreds of pre-built templates.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.510
Of course, customize this to your needs too and I'm

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.395
going to copy this and paste this in former times.

00:04:03.395 --> 00:04:08.189
The second one we'll have the text of calendar and scheduling.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.620
The third one is going to be for reminders and alerts.

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:21.425
The fourth list item,

00:04:21.425 --> 00:04:30.110
which I'm going to choose is going to be unlimited lists and to do pages and finally,

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.730
the last one is going to be the text of odd custom labels to your tasks.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.885
Before we go any further, let's save this and check this out over in the browser,

00:04:44.885 --> 00:04:46.655
gives us a refresh.

00:04:46.655 --> 00:04:50.930
On the left, we have our text with the class of lead and then the right section,

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.550
which is our list group.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.050
If we right-click and inspect to go into the developer tools,

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.025
we can check out the classes which had been applied to our list.

00:05:01.025 --> 00:05:05.725
First of all, let's use inspector to hover over our list,

00:05:05.725 --> 00:05:09.965
go to select the unordered list with the class of list group.

00:05:09.965 --> 00:05:13.340
As mentioned before, this ansi display type of flex,

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.450
it sets the flex-direction and also our padding and margin.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.405
If we go down to our list group item,

00:05:20.405 --> 00:05:25.729
clicking on this will reveal all of the CSS which has been applied it to our list items.

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:31.700
We can see the effect if we uncheck any these boxes and we can see the effect which has,

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.480
as we've also seen before in the bootstrap documentation,

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.850
the direction of column can also be changed to

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.140
a row if we want this to be a horizontal menu.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:46.790
Let's go back to our unordered list where we can apply this just after this group.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.950
We can also change this to be list group

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:55.595
horizontal and this is useful for things such as navigation bars.

00:05:55.595 --> 00:05:59.420
It looks a little strange because we have some long list items here,

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.545
but this is how we can update horizontally across the page.

00:06:02.545 --> 00:06:06.470
If we want to remove the borders and also these rounded corners,

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.900
we can change this to be listed group flush.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.020
Refresh and I'm going to leave this class in place for

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.455
my project since this is something I personally before.

00:06:18.455 --> 00:06:21.995
But remember it's up to you how you want to style your project.

00:06:21.995 --> 00:06:25.820
Next, I'm going to add a tick next to each list item.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.350
Just like we see if we go to the final version just on the left-hand side here,

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.640
we're going to add this into our list items by using a span.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:41.030
The Spanish going to contain a HTML entity code so it's nothing specific to bootstrap,

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.090
it just regular HTML.

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:44.960
Inside of our list item,

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.595
just before our tax,

00:06:46.595 --> 00:06:52.265
going to add a span and the HTML entity code is the ampersands,

00:06:52.265 --> 00:06:54.860
the harsh than a value of one,

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.059
triple zero four, and then a semicolon.

00:06:58.059 --> 00:07:03.720
I'm going to grab this and paste it into the rest of our list items.

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:08.765
We have the tick next to each one of our list items in the browser.

00:07:08.765 --> 00:07:11.960
If you want changes to a different icon,

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.150
or you need to do is to do a search for

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.635
HTML entity codes and you won't be sure to have options to choose from.

00:07:18.635 --> 00:07:21.920
To stop also provides us with some background colors which you can

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.490
choose from to make these list items stand out.

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:31.910
For example, we could add a second class to our list item of list-group-item primary.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.804
This is one of the economists provided by bootstrap,

00:07:34.804 --> 00:07:36.755
and this is a blue shade.

00:07:36.755 --> 00:07:43.205
If we refresh the browser and this is one of the predefined colors set by bootstrap.

00:07:43.205 --> 00:07:45.395
There is also over close to,

00:07:45.395 --> 00:07:47.420
such as danger for red,

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.000
success for green, and do check out

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.560
the bootstrap documentation for more available colors.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.645
Include need light and dark background colors,

00:07:56.645 --> 00:07:59.960
which looked at earlier when working with containers.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:04.295
I'm now going to remove these colors since this is not needed by projects.

00:08:04.295 --> 00:08:07.475
We can, of course, include this if you prefer.

00:08:07.475 --> 00:08:12.320
So I would encourage you to have a play around with these bootstrap classes by

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:17.845
adding and removing different ones to see exactly what is possible using bootstrap.

00:08:17.845 --> 00:08:21.365
You can also check out the bootstrap documentation

00:08:21.365 --> 00:08:25.310
and see the wide range of all the classes which is available.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:30.410
I would also encourage you to dive into the developer tools when adding and

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:35.150
removing classes and then you can see exactly what is going on behind the scenes.

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:41.815
With CSS classes have been added or removed to apply the desired and look and feel.

00:08:41.815 --> 00:08:48.330
Next, we're going to take a look at using utility classes so I'll see you there.
