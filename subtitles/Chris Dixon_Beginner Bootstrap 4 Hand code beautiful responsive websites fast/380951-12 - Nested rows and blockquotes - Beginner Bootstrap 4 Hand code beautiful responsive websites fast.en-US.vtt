00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
When working with our projects so far we have looked at a structure just like this.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.495
We've added rows inside of our projects.

00:00:09.495 --> 00:00:13.635
Then we have divided up our rows into numbers of columns.

00:00:13.635 --> 00:00:21.675
For example, we've had a six parts section on the left and also six columns on the right.

00:00:21.675 --> 00:00:25.665
We divide up our row into two equal parts.

00:00:25.665 --> 00:00:32.490
What if we had a situation where we wanted to also divide up one of these sections?

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.970
If we had a row just like this.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.340
Then our six column section on the left-hand side.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.645
We sometimes have a case where we want to divide this section

00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:51.430
up and also make use of our grid system inside here.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.950
The first four would mainly be nearly exactly the same as before.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:03.455
We could add six columns on the right and then six columns on the left inside of a div.

00:01:03.455 --> 00:01:07.650
Well, this is not the way which we should do this in Bootstrap.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.705
This is because Bootstrap requires our columns to only be a direct child of a row.

00:01:14.705 --> 00:01:17.725
The correct way to approach this would be to create

00:01:17.725 --> 00:01:21.540
a new nested row inside of our columns.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.280
For example, we would have it like this.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.700
Where we will create a new div or new elements with the class of row.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.390
Then this will allow us to make use of the 12-column grid system once again.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.990
We can now divide this row up into as many sections as we would like.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.320
If we wanted to apply three different sections to our row,

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.585
we could apply our columns.

00:01:47.585 --> 00:01:49.910
This could be four part,

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.629
four parts in the center,

00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:55.920
and then four parts on the right-hand side.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.130
This is the correct way to approach nested rows and columns inside of Bootstrap.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.510
On to the finished version,

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.635
we can make use of this nested row setup here at the very bottom.

00:02:09.635 --> 00:02:12.980
I have restricted this outer section to be

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.485
only eight columns wide rather than the full width of 12 columns.

00:02:17.485 --> 00:02:20.195
Since we're using columns to achieve this,

00:02:20.195 --> 00:02:26.630
we can't directly nest these testimonials inside as equal column spaces.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.360
But instead, it's just as we discovered before,

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.720
we can create a second row nested inside and then

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.080
we have access to our full 12-column grid system,

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.390
once again inside of this row.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.320
Even though this outer wrapper is eight columns wide,

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.000
the inner nested row will still have the full 12 columns available.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.420
Let's go on to the project and create this at the very bottom of our index page.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.185
So just before our JavaScript,

00:02:55.185 --> 00:02:57.420
we create our section.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.895
I'm going to give this a container-fluid,

00:03:00.895 --> 00:03:04.175
some margin on the top and bottom,

00:03:04.175 --> 00:03:07.040
some padding on the top and bottom too.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.500
I need a light background color.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.905
The next step is to add a row inside here.

00:03:12.905 --> 00:03:15.425
This is going to be our initial row,

00:03:15.425 --> 00:03:18.065
which is going to contain the initial div,

00:03:18.065 --> 00:03:20.240
which is eight columns wide.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.225
This is going to be on the medium-sized devices.

00:03:23.225 --> 00:03:28.200
So we use the class of col-md-8 to keep this in the center.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.775
We can also provide a offset on medium devices too,

00:03:32.775 --> 00:03:34.980
on the value of 2.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:41.200
Finally, the text-center, to align our text in the middle of our section.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.290
All this is going to be inside here is a level three heading

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.345
and this is going to have the class of py dash 3,

00:03:50.345 --> 00:03:53.635
to give you some spacing on the top and bottom.

00:03:53.635 --> 00:03:57.440
The text, as we can see if we go to the final version,

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.350
is going to be what our users have to say.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.555
Let's add this into our heading,

00:04:02.555 --> 00:04:06.030
save this, and check this out in the browser.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.315
At the bottom of our page,

00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:12.015
a lower can't currently see this because of the background.

00:04:12.015 --> 00:04:14.210
This section is eight columns wide.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.375
Now to create our two sections inside,

00:04:17.375 --> 00:04:19.735
we need to create a nested row.

00:04:19.735 --> 00:04:22.275
Let's go back over to our project.

00:04:22.275 --> 00:04:25.670
We're going to add this just after our level three heading.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.990
So a div with the class of row.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.195
Inside of here we can access the full 12-column grid system.

00:04:34.195 --> 00:04:36.530
However let's keep this more narrow.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.540
I'm going to create two sections,

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.325
which are five columns each.

00:04:40.325 --> 00:04:44.845
We can do this and then offset the rest of the content with the flexbox.

00:04:44.845 --> 00:04:51.630
So first of all, we can add a div and we can add a class of simply col-5.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.620
This will set the section to be always five columns wide regardless of the breakpoints.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.930
I'm going to duplicate this to add

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.430
our two sections inside of our nested row and then we can space these,

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.930
we justify content around.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.945
This will add equal spacing around both of our sections.

00:05:09.945 --> 00:05:12.640
Since we have a light gray background color,

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.625
I'm also going to offset these with a different color.

00:05:15.625 --> 00:05:20.414
We can use bg white or our two nested sections,

00:05:20.414 --> 00:05:22.705
and also some padding all around,

00:05:22.705 --> 00:05:24.370
which is going to be a value of 4.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:30.230
I'm going to copy these two and also add these to our second section.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.980
Inside of the first section on the left-hand side,

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.935
we're going to add some reviews or some quotes.

00:05:36.935 --> 00:05:38.450
Just like we can see here,

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:44.155
we're going to add some sample text and then we can add a user who quoted it just below.

00:05:44.155 --> 00:05:46.955
We can do this with a blockquote,

00:05:46.955 --> 00:05:49.775
which is a standard HTML element.

00:05:49.775 --> 00:05:54.820
But we can also add a bootstrap class of blockquote inside of here too.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.075
Nested inside as a p element.

00:05:58.075 --> 00:06:03.485
I'm also going to add some Lorem Ipsum text is by typing lorem and then hit Tab.

00:06:03.485 --> 00:06:06.370
We can do this in Visual Studio Code.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.314
If you don't have this available,

00:06:08.314 --> 00:06:12.485
simply type out any sample text or a quote of your choice.

00:06:12.485 --> 00:06:13.850
Still when we use blockquote,

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.740
we can also add a footer,

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.440
which is going to be the bottom of our quote section

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.025
and Bootstrap also has a class available for this,

00:06:22.025 --> 00:06:24.990
which is simply blockquote-footer.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.435
This is going to be the source of our quotes.

00:06:29.435 --> 00:06:34.460
I'm going to say "Free plan user" and then we can use the site's elements,

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.505
which is HTML, to quote a user.

00:06:37.505 --> 00:06:40.710
I'm going to say "Captain anonymous".

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:46.890
Let's go over to the browser and check this out. There we go.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.990
There's our two nested sections inside of our row.

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.830
We just need to duplicate this for the right-hand side.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.315
So we already have our surrounding div for this section.

00:06:58.315 --> 00:07:03.190
Let's grab the blockquote and make use of these same classes.

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:07.130
I'm just going to change this to be a Pro plan user.

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.160
Within this footer section,

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.830
we've got a new class of blockquote footer.

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.980
This is generally used for identifying the source of

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.745
the quote and often combined with the site elements,

00:07:18.745 --> 00:07:21.850
which is used as a wrapper for the sources name.

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:25.225
Now let's save this and see how this looks.

00:07:25.225 --> 00:07:28.390
We now have our two quotes, side-by-side.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:31.760
This is how we can nest rows using Bootstrap.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:36.260
We can create as many columns or as many nested rows as we would like.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.365
But always remember that when creating new columns,

00:07:39.365 --> 00:07:42.355
we always need a parent rapper as a row.

00:07:42.355 --> 00:07:46.670
Next we're going to be focusing on how to create a responsive navigation,

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:50.310
which we are going to include at the top of our project.
