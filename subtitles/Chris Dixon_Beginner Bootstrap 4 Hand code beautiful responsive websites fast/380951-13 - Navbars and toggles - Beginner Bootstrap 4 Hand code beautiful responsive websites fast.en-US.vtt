00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
We're now going to concentrate on one of the most important factors on any web sites,

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.545
and this is the navigation.

00:00:07.545 --> 00:00:12.195
To make our site full responsive when dealing with navigations,

00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:17.475
we need a way to ensure that our navigation links not only look good,

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:21.180
books are also fully accessible and responsive too.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.955
This what we're going to focus on in this video,

00:00:23.955 --> 00:00:26.430
let's dive in and take a look.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.435
When dealing with navigations on general websites,

00:00:30.435 --> 00:00:34.440
a common approach which you may see would be something like this.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.160
On the left here we have a typical desktop view where we'd have a navigation,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.950
a logo on one side and then our navigation links on the other.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.920
When dealing with its smaller mobile size screens,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.815
we often need a different approach because there's less screen space available.

00:00:53.815 --> 00:00:58.025
What we'll commonly see up at the top is a navigation,

00:00:58.025 --> 00:01:03.120
where we have a button which we'll provide some links when we click on it,

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.535
is often the same links that we have on the full desktop view,

00:01:07.535 --> 00:01:11.220
but just hidden until we click on the bottom.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.310
How do we approach this using Bootstrap?

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.760
Well, the way this works is we basically create two sections.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.105
We have one section for all list items,

00:01:23.105 --> 00:01:26.650
and then we have a second section for our button.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.054
We then create a link between these via an ID,

00:01:31.054 --> 00:01:33.760
and we'll take a look at how to do this next.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.950
We provide this link with our ID, behind the scenes,

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.690
Bootstrap will also handle the JavaScript for this all to work separate points.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.800
Let's now head over to our project where we can now apply our navigation.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.700
Making good progress with our projects and now we're going to

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.825
go back up to the top of our project and creates the navigation.

00:01:56.825 --> 00:01:59.030
If you go to the final version,

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.070
we're going to create something which looks like this.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.620
We'll have the logo on the left hand side,

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.925
we'll also have our free links on the right-hand side for navigation.

00:02:07.925 --> 00:02:10.505
If we scroll down to a small screen,

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:12.575
we get a drop-down button,

00:02:12.575 --> 00:02:18.025
which when clicked on to reveal our links on the smaller mobile and tablet sizes,

00:02:18.025 --> 00:02:20.870
so it looks much better on smaller screens.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.565
Let's now create SNR project of the top of our body section.

00:02:25.565 --> 00:02:27.650
Back to the index page,

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.630
scroll up to our body.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.625
Let's look at the open inside, which is just here.

00:02:34.625 --> 00:02:36.965
We'll begin with a nav bar wrapper,

00:02:36.965 --> 00:02:39.805
which is going to have a site title and a logo.

00:02:39.805 --> 00:02:42.715
I'm going to use the nav element to do this.

00:02:42.715 --> 00:02:47.030
This trap also provides us with some classes we can use for navigation,

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.565
the first one is simply navbar,

00:02:49.565 --> 00:02:51.220
which we're going to add flexbox,

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.960
I'm positioning along with some padding.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.585
Next I'm going to add navbar, expands, - LG.

00:02:59.585 --> 00:03:04.465
This which is the content BD full-width view on our large screens.

00:03:04.465 --> 00:03:08.630
Of course, we can change the break point to be anything else such as MD If we

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.900
prefer and then finally add some chlorine by attend the navbar lights.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.640
Nested inside of our nav elements,

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.080
we're going to add a link,

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.210
which is for our site title,

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.390
or we can have a logo inside of the if you prefer.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.635
I'm going to begin with a class name.

00:03:26.635 --> 00:03:30.650
The class which we need to add is navbar brand,

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.560
which you're going to add our CSS for spacing and size in our site title.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.345
We can add the name of bootstrap productivity or the name of your choice.

00:03:42.345 --> 00:03:44.090
Now under our site title,

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.700
we can add our two sections we mentioned before,

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.280
which are the links and also the button,

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.605
the togglese links open and closed.

00:03:51.605 --> 00:03:54.305
Let's start with our basic button,

00:03:54.305 --> 00:03:57.540
which is going to have a type of button.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.640
This is going to control our links,

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.040
which we can add inside of this div.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.045
Let's just create an unordered list for now.

00:04:05.045 --> 00:04:08.720
Then next we can tell bootstrap that this button is to

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.240
control these list items by first adding a ID.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.845
Let's add the ID to all links.

00:04:16.845 --> 00:04:21.545
Inside of here I'm going to add the ID as navbar-nav,

00:04:21.545 --> 00:04:26.615
and then we can pass this to the button as a data target attributes.

00:04:26.615 --> 00:04:28.850
Inside the opening tag,

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.890
we add the data targets and set this equal to our ID,

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.709
so we use this just like a CSS selector.

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:42.625
We use the hash since this is a ID and then the ID name of navbar-nav.

00:04:42.625 --> 00:04:46.150
This button now controls our list items,

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.760
and we can tell it to show and hide the content by setting data-toggle, collapse.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.225
Again inside of the button,

00:04:54.225 --> 00:04:59.635
we setup our data-toggle and set this equal to collapse.

00:04:59.635 --> 00:05:01.490
With this now linked up,

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.425
the next step is basically to add

00:05:03.425 --> 00:05:05.900
the required Bootstrap classes and also

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.140
some accessibility attributes to finish things off.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.490
Starting with the button,

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.760
we can also add these onto the online so it's more readable.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.965
The next attribute is going to be for our class,

00:05:21.965 --> 00:05:25.470
and the class name is going to be navbar-toggle,

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.235
which is going to add some padding,

00:05:28.235 --> 00:05:30.530
sizing and also a border.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.135
Next time we're going to add some attributes to make our site more accessible.

00:05:35.135 --> 00:05:39.065
This is for people using screen readers or with disabilities.

00:05:39.065 --> 00:05:42.190
Make our site as accessible as possible.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.864
The first attribute we're going to add is the aria controls,

00:05:46.864 --> 00:05:51.595
and set this equal to our ID, which is navbar-nav.

00:05:51.595 --> 00:05:56.360
Making sure that this is the same name we give to the ID just below,

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.355
so it matches our links.

00:05:58.355 --> 00:06:04.465
We need to understand where button is targeting a collapsible element, i.e our list.

00:06:04.465 --> 00:06:07.675
Next up we have aria expanded.

00:06:07.675 --> 00:06:11.330
I will set this to be a value of false.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:17.480
This will tell screen readers if our list is expanded or collapsed at any given time,

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:22.955
and we set this to be false if the collapsible element is going to be closed by default,

00:06:22.955 --> 00:06:25.490
which is because our links are not going to be

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.180
expanded until a user clicks on this button.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.885
The last one we need to add is the aria label,

00:06:32.885 --> 00:06:37.020
which is going to be set to toggle navigation.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.525
This label can be any name of our choice,

00:06:41.525 --> 00:06:45.535
and this is some text provides the user with a recognizable name.

00:06:45.535 --> 00:06:49.160
The final piece of this button is to add the three lines.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.895
All these free icons which you see on the small screen view.

00:06:52.895 --> 00:06:57.395
These can be added using a span elements with a Bootstrap class.

00:06:57.395 --> 00:07:02.490
Let's add these span elements in between the button opening and closing tag.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:06.530
We don't need to add any content between our span.

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:11.160
All we need to do is to add the class of navbar toggler icon.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:20.685
Now if we give this a save and go over to the browser to all projects,

00:07:20.685 --> 00:07:25.515
it reloads, with our button and also our site title.

00:07:25.515 --> 00:07:27.930
Next we need to add in our links.

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:32.690
Let's head back over to our navigation and look for our unordered list,

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:35.945
where we're going to begin by adding a class to this wrapper.

00:07:35.945 --> 00:07:39.510
Class name is going to be navbar-nav,

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.505
which is going to control any margins and pardon,

00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:46.890
and also remove the default list [inaudible].

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:49.635
This also makes use of the flexbox too.

00:07:49.635 --> 00:07:53.060
Next, we can create our list items and again,

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:56.150
these are going to have a Bootstrap class and this is going to be

00:07:56.150 --> 00:08:00.835
nav item with an element nested inside.

00:08:00.835 --> 00:08:03.625
This also has a class too,

00:08:03.625 --> 00:08:07.310
the class name for the links is going to be nav link,

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:10.895
which is going to remove any default link chlorine,

00:08:10.895 --> 00:08:13.975
and also sets any required margin and padding.

00:08:13.975 --> 00:08:17.105
This is just going to link to our index page,

00:08:17.105 --> 00:08:19.715
so we can add in the index.html.

00:08:19.715 --> 00:08:22.430
Since this is going to be the home link,

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.755
let's grab this list item,

00:08:24.755 --> 00:08:27.610
since we are going to include this two more times.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:31.130
The second link is going to be for pricing.

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:33.425
We haven't created this page yet.

00:08:33.425 --> 00:08:37.535
For this, you're going to link to the pricing.html.

00:08:37.535 --> 00:08:44.130
Just blow this, our third and final link is going to be for contractors.

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:48.535
Again, we've not created a contact.html page,

00:08:48.535 --> 00:08:51.425
but we're going to be creating this very soon.

00:08:51.425 --> 00:08:56.570
Let's save this file now and check this out in the browser, hit reload.

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:59.810
On a small screen we see all of the content.

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:03.035
We see both the button and also the links.

00:09:03.035 --> 00:09:06.290
If we go to the large screen view button is being removed,

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:08.395
and we only see the links.

00:09:08.395 --> 00:09:13.460
We can fix this and hide these links on the smallest screen view by

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:18.650
adding need classes of collapse and that navbar collapse to the surrounding div.

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:21.120
Back to our navigation,

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.825
we need to look for our div which surrounds our links with the idea of navbar-nav,

00:09:25.825 --> 00:09:33.240
and we need to add a class of collapse and also navbar-collapse too.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:38.495
Let's head over to the browser and see if this fixes our problem.

00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:41.915
This is looking better on small screens.

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:44.045
If we expand this,

00:09:44.045 --> 00:09:48.130
we now see the button has been removed and the links appear.

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:51.780
We can try to expand this by clicking on the button,

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:55.530
and we get our links on the small screen view.

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:59.600
The final thing to do is to move our links over to

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.265
the right-hand side on the large screen view.

00:10:03.265 --> 00:10:06.560
Rather than being against the site title,

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.975
we want them over on the right-hand side.

00:10:08.975 --> 00:10:12.770
We can easily do this with the CSS flex box by adding

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:17.105
the class of justifying content end in the same deal as before,

00:10:17.105 --> 00:10:18.620
which surrounds the links.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.000
We can add this into here.

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:26.959
It's now pushes our links over to the right-hand side of the navigation.

00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:33.030
Even you would a fully responsive and accessible drop down navigation menu.
