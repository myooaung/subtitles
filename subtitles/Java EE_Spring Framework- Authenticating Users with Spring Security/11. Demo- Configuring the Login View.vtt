00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.120
We do need to add a view controller,

2
00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.870
and there's a really neat little technique we can use to do this because

3
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.700
all we want this to do is display the login page and go to our security

4
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.910
on the back end and back out to the front.

5
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.480
It used to be we had to create this default controller that did nothing.

6
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.400
Except for now,

7
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.380
we can go ahead and open up our ConferenceConfig and

8
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.940
add one method inside of here.

9
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.700
I'll just go ahead and do it below my class declaration,

10
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.400
but above everything else, It doesn't have to be there,

11
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.360
but I'll just put it up at the top so you can see it with

12
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.760
the imports and things that we're using.

13
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.260
I'm going to say @Override,

14
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:46.840
and we'll give this the signature of public void addViewControllers.

15
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:58.340
And inside of here, it has a method signature of final ViewControllerRegistry,

16
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.420
and we'll give this a variable name of registry.

17
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.980
Inside of this method,

18
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.820
we can add one line where we just say registry.addViewController,

19
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:17.820
and we'll tell it to you handle login.

20
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.060
Finish that off with a semicolon , and we're done.

21
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.810
We're ready to run our example.

22
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.440
So a lot of work to get it to this point.

23
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.150
Let's go ahead and start our server.

24
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.800
Now inside of our app, if we click Add Registration,

25
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.700
it will take us to a login page where if we enter in

26
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.990
bryan and pass and click Login, it'll log us in,

27
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.340
redirect us back to the default URL, which is our index page.

28
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.740
Click Add Registration again, we're logged in, so we're an authenticated user.

29
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.990
We're going to go ahead and build on all of this as we go

30
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.090
out through the rest of this course,

31
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.070
but your app actually now has authentication.

32
00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.100
Let's quickly look at what it took to get us there. Inside of our POM,

33
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.830
we had to add three dependencies to the bottom section here. We had

34
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.630
our spring‑boot‑starter‑security, spring‑security‑test, and our jstl

35
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.040
dependency that we had added.

36
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.730
We copied our registration page into login and added a basic form section in

37
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.580
there, which had the URL of perform_login for what we wanted to tie our request

38
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.340
to. The majority of our work was spent in this ConferenceSecurityConfig file

39
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.410
where we configured the HttpSecurity object and the

40
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.340
AuthenticationManagerBuilder and then a passwordEncoder.

41
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.200
And then, finally,

42
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.600
we added a ViewController to just redirect to that login page and handle our

43
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.200
login back and forth from the JSP page to the controller.

44
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.740
We didn't have to create a whole separate controller just for that.

45
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.140
This all enabled us to have security inside of our application.

46
00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.650
Let's continue on with the rest of the course now where we're

47
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.480
going to remove some of these default pieces and add in

48
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.000
databases, LDAP, that type of stuff, but you've added security to your application now.
