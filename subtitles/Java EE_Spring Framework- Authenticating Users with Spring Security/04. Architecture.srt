1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,710
Let's cover the architecture of Spring Security a little.

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,020
We'll go into more detail in some of the areas as we

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,430
continue throughout the course,

4
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:11,240
but I want to give you a baseline for the start of this course.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,100
Spring Security is built on top of and uses Spring.

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:21,140
It is centered around web apps and uses a filter entry point.

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,360
It is built around multiple authentication models and

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,040
handling the various roles inside an app.

9
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,310
It also encourages apps to be inherently more secure

10
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,140
through encouraging the use of salts.

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,610
If you don't know what a salt is, don't worry, we will cover it later.

12
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:43,240
But suffice it to say it helps hackers not be able to crack stored passwords.

13
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,670
One of the main reasons I began using Spring Security years ago is

14
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,700
it helped to avoid session hacking. Session hacking, or a

15
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,690
man‑in‑the‑middle attack, is where someone can fool the server

16
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,440
into thinking it is someone else.

17
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,140
Spring Security has a few mechanisms in place that help

18
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,050
safeguard against that. And, lastly,

19
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:09,350
Spring Security is very full featured, from authentication and

20
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:13,870
authorization to 'Remember me' services and email confirmation.

21
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,540
It's all baked into the framework.

22
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:22,000
Let's look at some of the prerequisites that we will need to complete this course.
