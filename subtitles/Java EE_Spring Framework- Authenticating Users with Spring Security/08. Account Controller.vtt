00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.530
To display the page we just created, we need a controller to serve up the view.

2
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:11.750
We will start off by creating a GetMapping that will simply serve up the page.

3
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.230
A side note, we could have just used a view controller and not needed

4
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.680
to create a whole separate controller, but we are going to also submit

5
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.630
back to this controller using a post.

6
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.500
The signature of our post is also here, like our get, and we will code out

7
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.540
the rest of the post for our submission of our form.

8
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:38.000
Let's first add the get method to display our page, and then the post to take those values back.
