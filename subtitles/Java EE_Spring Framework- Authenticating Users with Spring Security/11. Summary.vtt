Recapping what we learned in this module,

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.530
we went through and had to add those three dependencies for Maven,

3
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.730
and it's a little odd because they are from different group IDs,

4
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.240
so that's something to definitely watch for in your application.

5
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.920
We modified our ConferenceSecurityConfig to remove the JDBC section

6
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.440
and add the LDAP authentication, and remember that we also did a

7
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.410
password compare inside of there, utilizing the password encoder

8
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.760
that we already had defined,

9
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.040
which is bcrypt, and bcrypt is a great password encoder.

10
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.540
Then we added the application.properties,

11
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.470
and it should be noted that the application.properties is, one, how it

12
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.520
fires up that LDAP server for us, and two, that we referenced that

13
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.080
test‑server.ldif, not something that you would want to do in a

14
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.730
production database, but that's how we can easily set up our

15
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.040
application and run it how it is now.

16
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.910
Then we created that test‑server.ldif, which enabled

17
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.750
us to have that user in place,

18
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.620
which we could run against. When it's all said and done, it

19
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.460
actually executed quite well and is a simple way to go through

20
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.900
and have a secure storage for users for authenticating against,

21
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.440
which LDAP is great for that.

22
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.510
Now let's go ahead and see how we can customize our

23
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:24.000
UserDetails object to take advantage of some of these other fields that we have stored out there.
