00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.680
Wrapping sections of our UI with security is actually quite easy.

2
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.820
We can use the Spring Security tag library to determine whether

3
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.930
someone is authenticated, and once that is verified,

4
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.740
display their username or other info.

5
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.680
You can see that is what we have done here in this code.

6
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.010
We only show this if that person is authenticated,

7
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.930
as you can see where we evaluate that expression. And if they are,

8
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.040
we can then grab their name and display it.

9
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.920
Let's add that to our registration page now,

10
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.610
and we'll show basic information, whether they're logged in or not,

11
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:44.000
and how to navigate that a little differently based off of an isAuthenticated versus not authenticated status.
