The architecture or process that is associated with securing

2
00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.370
an application is typically broken down into two

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.440
parts‑‑authentication and authorization.

4
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.890
I'm going to mention this quite a few times throughout this course

5
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.450
as it really is the pieces of the application that we need to

6
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.070
configure to have a secure application,

7
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:32.000
and, subsequently, every piece that we deal with throughout this course will tie to either authentication or authorization.
