1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,830
I've shut down my server and closed all my files so we could start

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:10,450
from a fresh workspace while adding this new ConferenceUserDetails

3
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:12,540
object that we're about to create.

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,240
I'm going to go down into src, main, java,

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,670
com.pluralsigh.conference, and underneath our model directory,

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,240
we'll see we have Registration and User. I'm going to

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,470
rightâ€‘click on model and say New, Java Class.

8
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:34,780
We'll call this ConferenceUserDetails, and it's a Class,

9
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:39,570
so we'll just hit Enter on that. Now, inside of here, make sure

10
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,500
your package structure looks the same as mine.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:47,850
Say that this extends, and we're going to fully qualify

12
00:00:47,850 --> 00:01:03,630
org.springframework.security.core.userdetails, and inside

13
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:08,040
of here, we want the User object.

14
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,050
Now this is going to give us an error by default because it wants

15
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,140
a specific constructor that we don't have yet.

16
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,590
So if we hover over our red line, and click the down arrow, it

17
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,240
says to Create a constructor matching super.

18
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,740
And so we have two choices here. we have the simpler one,

19
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:33,340
which takes the string, and the string for password, and a

20
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,480
collection of authorities, and then there is a larger,

21
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,930
more complex constructor for all of the attributes.

22
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,240
I'm going to choose the simpler one, which is the first one listed here.

23
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:52,210
Click OK. And then I want to add a member variable of private, and

24
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:57,740
this is just a String, and we'll call this nickname.

25
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:02,480
Save that. Now one last thing we want to do here is generate our getters and

26
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:11,250
setters, and we can just use the keystroke for Command+End or Option+End,

27
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,480
depending on which machine you're running on, and I'm going to say Getter and

28
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:20,110
Setter, and we're going to choose nickname:String, and we'll click OK. And

29
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,610
there's our custom UserDetails object.

30
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,570
So it's under the com.pluralsight.conference.model package,

31
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:32,550
we've extended and fully qualified our path to the Spring

32
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,160
Security userdetails.User object.

33
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:43,000
We've added our basic super constructor in there, and then we've added our private variable for nickname.
