1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,820
To add security to our RegistrationController, let's open up that

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,690
file. I'm going to go to controller and then open up the

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,500
RegistrationController, and we want to do it on the Post.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,020
We could actually do it on the Get as well, we could do it

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,230
on any of the methods that we want to prohibit somebody

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,190
accessing, but for the Post,

7
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:27,510
let's say that we won't allow them to submit back to this file without

8
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:36,150
having a role of ROLE_USER. So we'll say @Secured, and inside of here it

9
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,480
just takes a string. And you can actually do an array of values as well,

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,860
but for our case we'll just say ROLE_USER, and save that. Now, I'll tell

11
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,910
you when we run this it's going to execute successfully, and the reason

12
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:54,880
for that is our user does have that ROLE_USER already assigned to them.

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,790
So if we start up our server, give that a second to refresh,

14
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,040
we'll go through the Add Registration process.

15
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,990
So here we are back to our home page again, and if we click on Add Registration,

16
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:12,140
it's going to ask us to log in, which that's what we want.

17
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:19,270
Put in a valid username and password, and Login, and now we're a logged‑in user.

18
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:26,330
If we click Add Registration again, we can put in a registration and

19
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,910
click Add Registration and it'll go through successfully.

20
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:29,290
Well,

21
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:34,840
the reason it goes through successfully is we do have that ROLE_USER

22
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,380
already associated with our account, and we can verify that by going

23
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:43,660
over to our MySQL interface and looking at the roles associated with

24
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:48,040
that person. If you'll remember, we have an extra table in there for that.

25
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:54,040
Looking at our MySQL console, if we just run a select * from authorities,

26
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,700
you'll see the results that come back are that we already

27
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:03,010
have a ROLE_USER associated with the current logged‑in user

28
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:04,170
that I have inside of there.

29
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,450
And if we didn't have this,

30
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,970
it actually wouldn't allow us to log in, so that's why by

31
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,210
default we've assigned this to everybody in here.

32
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,890
If you'll remember, when we confirmed our account,

33
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:21,000
we did add that role in there. Let's run an example now that doesn't have that, and see what it returns.
