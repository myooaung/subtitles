00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.980
The first part of the registration process is to gather the account information.

2
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.060
We're going to copy one of our other forms and create a

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.420
new page that will capture all of the account data and

4
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.640
submit it back to our controller.

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.780
As you can see here, we have the standard information, username,

6
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.600
first name, last name, email,

7
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:31.000
password, and a confirm password. To get started, let's create that JSP page, and then we can work on the controller next.
