1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,750
I've gone ahead and opened up our project,

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:06,250
how we had it from when we downloaded the scaffold application.

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:09,440
We want to open up our pom.xml.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:09,820
Now,

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:15,350
our pom.xml file has this dependency section in here where we've added in

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,650
all of the dependencies that our application needs.

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:21,170
And if you've used Maven before and you followed my other classes,

8
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,190
this shouldn't be new to you, but we'll go through it still.

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:30,440
I'm going to go down below org.hibernate.validator

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,220
and give myself some whitespace.

11
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,550
And yours should be pretty similar to this as well.

12
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,120
And I've already copied,

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,720
and I'm just going to paste these two dependencies in there,

14
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,770
and I'll walk through them with you.

15
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,440
And it's just so you don't have to watch me type these in.

16
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,750
I've got two dependencies inside of here.

17
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:49,440
I've got spring‑boot‑starter‑security and spring‑security‑test.

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,330
And you'll notice they were red for a second while they

19
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,740
downloaded those versions in there.

20
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,820
And so now I have these two pieces in here,

21
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,180
and I want to point out these two different classes,

22
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,340
what they're doing, or what these artifacts are doing for us.

23
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:08,690
We have the spring‑boot‑starter‑security which will add

24
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:12,280
some default configuration files for us.

25
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,070
In fact, we'll have a login page out of that by default,

26
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,010
and then the spring‑security‑test,

27
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,220
which will enable us to go through and write tests against our application.

28
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:26,170
Notice here on line 48 in my app, there is a scope of test in here,

29
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:31,710
so spring‑security‑test will not get bundled with our WAR when we deploy it.

30
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,740
That's what that scope is associated with inside of Maven.

31
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,080
So now we have this in here.

32
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:42,000
Let's go ahead and look at the other pieces of our app and what we're going to start wiring up.
