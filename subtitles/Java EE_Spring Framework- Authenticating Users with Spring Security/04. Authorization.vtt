00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.190
Authorization is what we can do inside of our application.

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.940
Once the app is determined who we are, it now looks to see what we can do.

3
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.620
Authorization will always follow authentication.

4
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.650
We first need to determine who we are and then determine

5
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.490
what we can do inside of that app.

6
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.370
What we can do can be very coarseâ€‘grained descriptions,

7
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:28.010
such as a web application, or it might be as fine grained as a user

8
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.440
being able to see a specific field or button on a page or possibly

9
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.340
perform a certain action inside of our application.

10
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.150
It can even be used to filter the data set we are able to view.

11
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:50.000
To set both authentication and authorization up, we need to add a few libraries in Maven in our app.
