00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.070
To display that we have successfully logged out, it's

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.010
almost exactly how we also displayed errors.

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.520
We had a div in there,

4
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.340
but I opted to show you a different example using the Twitter Bootstrap CSS.

5
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.520
So I wrapped our div with a c:if statement and put our div

6
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.240
inside of that and then used our alert alertâ€‘success

7
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.740
message from Twitter Bootstrap.

8
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.760
So as we display this, you'll see a lot cleaner message.

9
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.000
We do need to add one other anchor tag inside of our app, but we'll do both of those at the same time in our UI.
