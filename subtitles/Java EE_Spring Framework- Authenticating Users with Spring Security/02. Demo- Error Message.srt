1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,510
Let's first demonstrate the problem that we're going

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,640
to solve with this particular demo.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,710
If we fire up our application,

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,730
this is just where we left it off after the previous module,

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,130
I've just closed down all of the open files, we're going to see

6
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:18,540
that when we have an error message,

7
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:23,280
it will not display that even though we are capturing

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,870
it and returning it to the user, it won't display that error message on the UI.

9
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:32,920
And so once our application's launched, we go ahead and click Add

10
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,140
Registration and it goes to a login page, if I put in a bogus

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,280
username and password and click Login, we have a login error.

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:41,670
In fact,

13
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,960
you can see up in the address bar, it changed our parameter

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,130
to login?error, added that error parameter on the end. We

15
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,350
should be displaying something.

16
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,010
Well, we put all the code in there to do it,

17
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,900
but we haven't quite configured it yet. So let's look at what it's going to

18
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:05,000
take for us to do that and some minor changes inside of our application that will make it a little bit more user friendly.
