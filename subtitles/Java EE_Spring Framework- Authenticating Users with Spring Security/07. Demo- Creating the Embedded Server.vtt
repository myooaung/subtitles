00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.990
Picking up where we left off in our last demo,

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.860
I'm going to go ahead and exit full screen and open up src,

3
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.040
main, resources, application.properties.

4
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.010
We want to go ahead in here and add a couple of configuration

5
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.140
elements. We're going to do spring.ldap.embedded.

6
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.310
And that's what's going to signify it's starting up the embedded server for

7
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.540
us. And we're going to have this specified on our classpath.

8
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:42.940
And the name of that is going to be test‑server.ldif.

9
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:51.340
Now, the next thing that we want to add inside of here is spring.ldap.embedded,

10
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.260
and we're going to do the base‑dn, and that is going to be

11
00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:08.170
dc=pluralsight, and a comma for a dc=com, and you'll see where these

12
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.740
are specified in that LDIF file here in just a second.

13
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.990
And then the last one that we need is

14
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:23.640
spring.ldap.embedded, and we want to choose the port.

15
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:31.310
And we're going to make that =8389. Now this configuration here will start up

16
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:38.370
our embedded server for us, point to this LDIF file, load that context, and

17
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:47.000
begin our searching on this dn for any of the users that we go through inside of our application and tell it to search for.
