00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.190
Let's recap what we learned in this module as it is a

2
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.420
bigger module in our overall course.

3
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.560
The architecture of Spring Security is important to learn

4
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.480
as it will help us understand how and what to configure

5
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.650
throughout our application.

6
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.540
It helps us understand the authentication and authorization portions of our app.

7
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.720
We know that authentication is proving we are who we say we are and

8
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.640
authorization is what we can do inside of an application.

9
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.760
We then added the dependencies inside of our application through Maven

10
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.560
and showed the difference between Maven and Gradle. We are using Maven

11
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.890
in our course. We also showed the configuration of an app using XML and

12
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.190
the transition to know XML.

13
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.290
And after that, we briefly showed the minimal configuration and then broke

14
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.450
out our app into use its own separate configuration.

15
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.940
And that's what we demoed through the last portion of the course.

16
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.250
All of these concepts will help us to secure our app against a database,

17
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.000
and that's actually what we're going to do in the next module. So let's dive into that now.
