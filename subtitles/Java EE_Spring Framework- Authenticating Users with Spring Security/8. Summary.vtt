00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:06.340
This module was focused very specifically on just method‑level security.

2
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.180
To enable this,

3
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.390
we went through the configuration, and we did that

4
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.530
through enabling the method‑level security.

5
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.630
We talked about the pre and post annotations, we used the @Secured

6
00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.440
annotation, and we talked about what the JSR250 annotation is, just that

7
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.550
it will go through and do a cross‑framework annotation, which we opted to

8
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.640
just use Spring's Secured annotation.

9
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.020
Then we showed a successful implementation of security

10
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.720
and talked about how it does require you to have a role

11
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.140
user in the database, in fact,

12
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.000
your user will not log in without that role user, and we showed a

13
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.000
failure, in that it would give us a 403 error back if we didn't have permissions to access that from the server.
