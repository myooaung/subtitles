1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:05,050
One of the best reasons to use Spring Security is its integration strengths.

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,330
Its roots are in just securing web applications,

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:12,540
but it's a great client when used in a CAS installation as well.

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,610
Many people think that when using CAS that you just

5
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,340
have to use their client tools.

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,900
The hooks in Spring Security are actually great for integrating with CAS

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,770
and are one of their preferred methods. Similar to CAS, Spring Security

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,140
makes handling the tokens of OAuth great.

9
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,350
OAuth can be a very complex animal,

10
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,340
but Spring Security can help manage its complexities.

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,340
LDAP is also a great authentication mechanism.

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,020
Using Spring Security,

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,720
we can authenticate and authorize against LDAP or just use it for

14
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,840
authentication and then authorize against a database.

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,860
This is, in fact,

16
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,630
one of the most common uses of Spring Security for internal apps.

17
00:00:53,630 --> 00:01:01,000
And not to leave out web services, Spring Security is great for wrapping them with security as well.
