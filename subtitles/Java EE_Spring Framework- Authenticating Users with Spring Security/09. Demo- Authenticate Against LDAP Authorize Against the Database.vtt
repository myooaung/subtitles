00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.940
Let's open up our ConferenceSecurityConfig.

2
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.780
And at the top of this class, let's autoâ€‘wire in another variable.

3
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.740
So we'll say @Autowired,

4
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.970
and we'll make it private ConferenceUserDetailsContextMapper.

5
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.690
And for the instance name,

6
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.290
I'm going to call it ctxMapper just so we don't have a

7
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.040
crazy long instance name. We'll copy that.

8
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.850
Now we need to go down to our configure method where we configured our

9
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.290
LDAP authentication, and after that userPassword and before that

10
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.240
semicolon, we want to keep that semicolon on the end,

11
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.400
we're going to add another .and statement.

12
00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:01.840
And from there we want to say .userDetailsContextMapper and paste

13
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.940
in that context mapper that we just created.

14
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.140
That's all we had to do to inject that bean inside of this class and

15
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.400
then configure it and use it on our LDAP authentication to go ahead

16
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.550
and authenticate against LDAP but authorize and pull those other user

17
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.440
details back from our database.

18
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.440
Now we can go ahead and start up our server,

19
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.710
and once it fires up and it'll pull up our browser, we can

20
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.010
run our application, and it will pull back that user from

21
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.940
both LDAP and the database.

22
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.240
Once our app pulls up, we can click on Add Registration,

23
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:51.520
type in bryan and pass and log in, and it's still authenticating us exactly

24
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.120
how we would expect it to. In the next module, we're going to customize

25
00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.140
these pages so we can now utilize those extra columns that we've added into

26
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.360
our database and pull back out our nickname or other things that you maybe

27
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.000
added in there as well. And you'll get to see this visually take hold inside of our UI.
