00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.230
The beginning of the steps to customize our Spring Security

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.240
object is to build our own UserDetails object.

3
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.920
We actually chose to do this the more realistic approach and a

4
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.650
scenario very common to which you may run into in your own app,

5
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.220
and that is to extend the user object,

6
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.840
which is also the default object from Spring Security.

7
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.220
You can see here in this snippet of code that we had to

8
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.840
fully qualify the package to the User class.

9
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.810
The reason for this is that we already have a class

10
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:38.940
inside of our app named User, so we had to specify which one we were extending.

11
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:39.430
Also,

12
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.240
you can see in this code that we are going to add a property named nickname.

13
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.800
A nickname is a common attribute in an app because people might not always

14
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:56.000
use their given name as to what they prefer to be called. Let's create this object in our code now.
