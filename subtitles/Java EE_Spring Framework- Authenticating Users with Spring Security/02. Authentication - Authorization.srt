00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:06,050
The previous module was all about LDAP. We used LDAP for both

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:10,380
authentication and authorization. In the module before that,

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,330
we did the same thing with a MySQL database.

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:13,150
instance.

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:18,340
We used the database for both authentication and authorization.

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:18,720
Well,

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,930
in almost all the production implementations of Spring Security that I've done,

8
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:27,840
we've had to authenticate from one and authorize from the other.

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,970
The combination of LDAP plus a database is one of the wider

10
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,340
used approaches that I've experienced when creating a Spring

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,440
Securityâ€‘based application.

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,320
You may recall in one of the previous LDAP demos,

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,900
I had left my configuration set up for the database, and this

14
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,210
is the reasoning as to why. This is also where we begin

15
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:53,000
customizing our Spring Security object. Let's look at that configuration now.
