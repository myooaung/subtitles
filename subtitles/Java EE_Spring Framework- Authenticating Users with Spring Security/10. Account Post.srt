00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,640
Now we're ready to add that post back to our controller.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,240
So let's go back into that file,

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,200
and I'll shut our server down to give us a little

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,540
more real estate for full screen.

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,910
I'm going to put in the method signature here,

6
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:26,440
and import the classes that we need to use now.

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,840
Then I'll close off this method here,

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:36,260
and it's going to return us back to eventually the string

9
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:43,230
"redirect:account," and if you're not familiar with what this is,

10
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:49,710
it is a Spring MVC technique to execute a redirect back

11
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,820
to the page that you want to go to.

12
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,530
And I'm going to pseudocode out a couple of things here in the

13
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:58,280
comments just to show the layout of how you could actually

14
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,770
process things inside of your application.

15
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:06,320
To add every single step in here would make our application be way too large.

16
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,460
So one thing we could do is check for errors,

17
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,740
and we're going to actually do a lot of these steps.

18
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,710
We'll check for errors in the binding result so we can

19
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,540
look to see if result has any errors.

20
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:28,880
The next thing that we should look for is we should check for the account

21
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,720
to see if there is already one existing in this system.

22
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:44,060
So we should verify that the account and the user don't exist in our system,

23
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:53,140
and then we should also verify that the email address is valid as well.

24
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:57,300
And we could use a regular expression to' do that or a

25
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:03,140
couple other techniques to do that.

26
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,710
So those steps in there, and then from here,

27
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:13,860
we need to also encrypt the new password coming in,

28
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:25,460
as well as we want to then create the new account,

29
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:34,040
and then we're going to fire off an event for the

30
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:42,640
account creation to have us verify it.

31
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,220
That is all of these steps that have to take place for

32
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,540
us to go through and do this post.

33
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:57,340
So let's save this, and I'm going to start our server back up,

34
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:03,980
and now we can navigate to Account, and enter in some information,

35
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,450
and once we hit Submit,

36
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,030
it will go to our server and redirect us back to this page.

37
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:15,940
So it has gone full trip from the get to the JSP page,

38
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,940
back to the post, and then redirected back to this page.

39
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,800
Let's now go ahead and look at starting to flush out all those

40
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:29,000
comments we put inside of our controller, and fill in the pieces where we talk to the database.
