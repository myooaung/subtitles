00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.930
With our security enabled now, it is time for us to annotate our method.

2
00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.450
For our basic example,

3
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.590
we are going to add the @Secured annotation that you see

4
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.340
here on our addRegistration method.

5
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.590
We chose this method for a few reasons.

6
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:16.160
First,

7
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.770
a lot of the other methods that we have we actually want people to be

8
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.410
able to access without security. And 2, this is behind our login and

9
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:34.000
already is wired up in our application. Let's show a success and then a failure with these next two demos.
