00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.340
Now that we have our project set up and before we dive into code,

2
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.820
let's go through some vocabulary.

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.620
To start, the entry point of security is authentication,

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.440
and that is where we will begin defining our vocabulary.

5
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.430
Authentication is determining I am who I say I am.

6
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:24.240
After the app has authenticated us, we need to see what we are authorized to do.

7
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.940
These two pieces are the key components of our app.

8
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.940
The other things that we talk about are how we honestly do these two activities.

9
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.840
The entry point to our application is through a filter.

10
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.110
The filter is a standard JEE filter.

11
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.290
it really isn't important if you haven't written one before.

12
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.180
Just realize that it's the entry point of our app,

13
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.040
and we will configure things to utilize it.

14
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.230
Once you have entered the application,

15
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.740
you have specific roles that you can perform or

16
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.740
rights inside of the application.

17
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.940
From here, roles are defined and stored in the User.

18
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.400
This is the basic information about the loggedâ€‘in user,

19
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.640
while more specific details and the contract of what we

20
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.440
can do is accessed through UserDetails.

21
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.620
The last two items that we're going to cover aren't specific Spring

22
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.530
Security terms but, rather, more general Spring terms,

23
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.640
the first being a Service, not a web service,

24
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.440
but the Service tier where business logic is stored.

25
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.840
The second is a Repository tier, and this is how we access data and work with it.

26
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.780
This is definitely not all the terms we will work with but the main

27
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.300
points that we will cover throughout this course.

28
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:52.000
If those last two give you any concern or you don't understand what they are, you may want to revisit the Spring MVC Fundamentals course.
