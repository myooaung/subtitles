1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,770
I wanted to point out one specific difference that we made in

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,940
this module over the registration module,

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,030
and that is that we opted to make this overly secured by

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,130
requiring people to enter both the email address and

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,940
username associated with their password.

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,590
We could easily change it to just look up one or the other if

7
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,740
you only want that for your application.

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,360
But for example, we're going to use both for now.

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,870
Let's start off by creating the UI for capturing these two pieces,

10
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,910
and we will also need to create the backing model objects

11
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,030
for capturing those data fields as well.

12
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,110
I've shut down my server and closed all the open files we

13
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,210
had from previous demos just to get everything to a

14
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,360
baseline for us to start up with.

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,500
Let's open up our login.jsp page to begin with and go ahead and,

16
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,840
next to our Submit button, enter in,

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,450
we're just going to add a simple anchor tag in here that, when we click on it,

18
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,960
will request our password JSP page,

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,440
and it's going to display that text of Forgot password.

20
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,910
I'll go ahead and test this by saving this page and starting up our server

21
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,740
or restarting our server if yours is currently running,

22
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,570
and it will pull this up.

23
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,630
And when we go to click on our login,

24
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:21,520
right next to our text for the Submit button will be a Forgot password link.

25
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,060
Now when we click on our Add Registration page,

26
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,940
which is a page that requires us to log in,

27
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:33,230
you'll see that we have our text next to it that asks us if we want

28
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:37,060
to click to enable our Forgotten password page.

29
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,250
But if we click on this right now,

30
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,990
I'm going to tell you it's just going to refresh this page because,

31
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:46,130
one, we don't have security set up to allow it to go to that page,

32
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,210
and, two, we don't have a controller to capture that.

33
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,500
So let's fix both of those.

34
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,190
We'll add the security configuration to point to our Forgotten password page,

35
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,960
and we'll have a controller that's going to capture that

36
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,040
information for us and redirect us to that page as well.

37
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,140
That password controller we're going to put alongside of our other controllers.

38
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,450
Just go ahead and right‑click on our controller package and say New,

39
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:15,490
Java class, and give this a name of PasswordController.

40
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,430
Hit Enter.

41
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,180
And then inside of here, I'm going to add a method,

42
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,570
and it's just like the other ones we've done in the

43
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:27,780
AccountController or some of our other controllers that is a

44
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:33,130
GetMapping that is tied to the URL password.

45
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:37,680
And you'll notice in here that I'm asking for a password object.

46
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,620
We haven't created that object yet.

47
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,300
We're going to cause that's what's going to back the form on our page.

48
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,040
Before we create that object though,

49
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,140
let's go ahead and annotate this as a controller.

50
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:54,430
And now we can begin creating that password object, and it's really simple.

51
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:58,160
It's just like we did with the account with a few variations on the fields.

52
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,650
For that password object,

53
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,800
let's go ahead and open up our model package and right‑click on it and say New,

54
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,840
Java class, and we'll just call this Password.

55
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,820
And inside of here, we're going to add a handful of fields,

56
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:26,130
and we want to make those not null, just like we did with the account object,

57
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:29,940
and we'll also make them not empty as well.

58
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,850
So we've got our password, our matchingPassword,

59
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:35,000
our email, a username and a token.

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,730
Very similar.

61
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,040
In fact, if you wanted to,

62
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,500
you could go ahead and extract some of these up into a parent object.

63
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,170
But for the scope of what we're doing,

64
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,940
we're going to try and keep it as simple as possible.

65
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,380
I'm going to give myself some white space down here.

66
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,640
Right‑click and say Generate.

67
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,240
Getter and Setter, and I want to select all of these.

68
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:00,220
Click OK. And now we have our password object for everything that

69
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,750
we need to capture off of the screen, as well as pass around from

70
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,240
request to request. We can save this.

71
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,720
Go back to our PasswordController. Since we did use that account page,

72
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:17,910
we can actually just chop out the firstName and lastName here, as well

73
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:23,040
as the Password and Confirm Password here.

74
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,890
And we actually have the two fields that we care about inside of

75
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:32,060
here to go ahead and submit back to the page. And just make it a

76
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,150
little bit better of a user experience, let's change this value

77
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:39,240
from Submit to Reset Password,

78
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:49,340
and we'll also change this h1 and the title of the page as well.

79
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,140
Let's get all the fields inside of here changed that we want to.

80
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:58,270
We have one last piece before all of that life cycle of requesting the page

81
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:03,670
and going to the controller and going back to this JSP page that we've

82
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:10,070
created and allowing us to round trip that. We need to change our security

83
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,040
config, just one line inside of there.

84
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:20,390
So let's open that up, and we'll go to our ConferenceSecurityConfig. And inside

85
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:26,760
of here, we need to add a permission for our password page.

86
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,380
So I'm just going to grab one of those lines and give myself a

87
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:35,540
new line below that and type in password here.

88
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:43,680
And what this will do is it will display anything that matches /password*.

89
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,130
It will permit anybody to see that. We've done this a couple times now, but

90
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:54,200
just to remind you of what that's doing. Now if we restart our server, now

91
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,660
if we click on our Add Registration page again,

92
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,640
click Forgot password,

93
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:03,360
it will go through and display our password page that we've just built.

94
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,610
So we've gone through that round tripping of showing the login page,

95
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:12,510
clicking the Forgot password link, going up through our server,

96
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:15,940
which is actually going through our security that we just added,

97
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:20,550
going to the controller, and then building that password object

98
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,850
and displaying this page back out.

99
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,640
So we actually have everything put together to do our post,

100
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,710
as I just barely mentioned that we now go through those steps.

101
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:31,990
But that's going to tie in some of our service tier and firing off an event.

102
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:37,000
So let's go through a few more of those details before we just dive into that just yet.
