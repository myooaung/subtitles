00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:07.010
To add that table into our database, I've just opened up the MySQL UI,

2
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.550
and I'm going to paste this in here,

3
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.360
and I've just got the SQL of CREATE TABLE persistent_logins,

4
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:22.500
username VARCHAR 50 NOT NULL, series VARCHAR 64 PRIMARY KEY,

5
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.020
token VARCHAR 64 NOT NULL, and the last_used TIMESTAMP NOT NULL as well.

6
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.380
And then we create a foreign key to our username,

7
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.200
which references the users table and the username column inside of that.

8
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:46.740
So if we highlight this and then execute the SQL underneath the cursor,

9
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.590
it will create that table.

10
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.030
I'm going to scroll down and highlight our commit and then execute that as well.

11
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.200
And so we've now created that table and committed that to our query.

12
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.000
Let's go back to our application now, and we're ready to run our application.

13
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.340
So I'm going to exit full screen, and I'm actually going to restart my server.

14
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.100
And I want to do this because we have made changes to the database.

15
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.880
We've made changes to our Java configuration.

16
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.900
So it's a good idea for us to get a full deployment out of it.

17
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.430
And now, when we click Add Registration,

18
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.770
it will take us to our Login page where we can put in

19
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.380
here bryan and the password of pass, and I can click Remember Me.

20
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.100
When I click Login,

21
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.340
it will go out and create an entry in that table and a cookie on my local box.

22
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.750
So I'm logged in now.

23
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.920
I can switch back over to our MySQL UI,

24
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.430
and I'm going to create a little select statement inside of here and

25
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:52.500
just say select * from, and I'll just copy that persistent_logins so

26
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.740
that we don't have a spelling error here.

27
00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.540
And if I highlight that SQL statement and execute that,

28
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.530
you'll see that we now have a record created in that

29
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.120
persistent_logins table for Bryan.

30
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.570
And it has our series and token, as well as the last used date.

31
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.330
So we can set an expiry on that if we want. Or if we just close

32
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.160
our application and open it back up, that cookie will still be there,

33
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.860
and it won't require us to log in again.

34
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:33.000
So we now have our Remember Me services configured and working, and you can see that record stored in our database to do just that.
