Before we make the last changes to our application to switch it over to

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,350
JDBC, I wanted to show you just a couple of Docker tips that will help you

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:13,130
as you're running this. First, there are some Docker commands that are

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:17,330
really simple that we'll utilize throughout this, the docker‑compose up ‑d,

5
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,390
which you saw me use a minute ago,

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:24,210
is to start up a Docker container and instance. The same

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,340
thing with down effectively shuts it down.

8
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:34,630
Ps will show us the currently running processes, and the last two, inspect and

9
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:44,000
inspect with a grep, will let us look at what's currently running inside of our container and help us troubleshoot a few things.
