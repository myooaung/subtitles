The ldif file can be quite confusing to people at a first glance,

2
00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:07.530
and honestly,

3
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.220
a lot of LDAP can be a bit foreign to most people that have

4
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.020
ever worked with it before. This file here designates an

5
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.460
entry inside of it as a person,

6
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.290
and you can see it's very similar to the JDBC configuration that we had

7
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:29.530
before as far as the structure of a user ID and a password, but there's

8
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.400
also structure defining this user that's contained inside of here. So you

9
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.750
can see we have an ou, or what's referred to as an organizational unit, a

10
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.960
dc, or a directory context, there's organizational information inside of

11
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.380
here, you can see that there is our surname and that type of information

12
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.880
also defined inside of here. There is also the userPassword field,

13
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.650
and if you remember back to our ConferenceSecurityConfig file that we had,

14
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.230
there was a password attribute,

15
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.280
which we defined as a userPassword, and if you'll remember through

16
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.740
the bcrypt demonstration that we did earlier,

17
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.640
this is an encrypted password that is defined here.

18
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:21.000
So let's switch over to our IDE, and start entering this information in, and the rest of the structure that we need to create this server.
