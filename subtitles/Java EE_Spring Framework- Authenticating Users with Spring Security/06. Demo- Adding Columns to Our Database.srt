1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:06,690
I've opened up our MySQL workbench that we used earlier in the previous module.

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:11,740
I'm going to rightâ€‘click on users and say Alter Table.

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:16,740
This will bring up a table editor that I can just click to edit here.

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,340
And it will give me a column, which I'm going to call nickname.

5
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:26,840
And I'm going to change that to be a VARCHAR of 50.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,520
And by default, we don't care if this is null.

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,550
That's all I actually have to do to edit this users table.

8
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,540
I'm going to click Apply.

9
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,400
You can actually see the SQL that it's going to run to do this.

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,560
So this is just a nice, convenient helper through the UI to do this.

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,040
This is the actual SQL that gets run behind the scenes.

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,440
So now our table has that column added to it.

13
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,370
Go back to our query editor that we had earlier,

14
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,400
and I've already typed in an update statement in here,

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,840
and I can say update users set nickname = 'bigb', kind of a nickname

16
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,330
that some people call me, where username = 'bryan'.

17
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:13,300
So I'm going to highlight that line and run it here, and make sure you choose

18
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,240
the option that says to run the one that's underneath the current cursor. And

19
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,640
then I'm going to execute that commit statement again.

20
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,840
So now we should have a Select statement for users.

21
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,740
If we execute that, you'll see that it has updated that user bryan,

22
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,310
and it still has our password there,

23
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,940
even though we're going to be authenticating against LDAP now,

24
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,490
it says it's still enabled,

25
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:41,840
and it has updated the nickname to store that in there as well.

26
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,000
We have our database set up. Let's go build that custom context mapper.
