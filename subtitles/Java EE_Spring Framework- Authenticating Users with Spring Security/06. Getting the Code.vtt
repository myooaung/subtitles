In an effort to make this course shorter,

2
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.050
we've started with a preâ€‘developed application that we've

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.840
actually built in previous courses of mine.

4
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.860
There are two ways to get this code.

5
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.290
You'll need to do one or the other if you want to develop the examples,

6
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.000
as we are in the course.

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.980
I have a sample project set up and running in GitHub that you can

8
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.740
fork to your own repo and use source control.

9
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.750
If you don't want to use GitHub because it does add a

10
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.580
little more complexity to the app,

11
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.970
the source code is available in the example files section

12
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.960
under the home page for this course.

13
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.580
The instructions for setting it up there are in the ZIP

14
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.440
file for each module of the course.

15
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:51.000
Let's walk through forking the project to your own repo now and setting it up locally for your instance.
