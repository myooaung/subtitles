1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:05,400
Since our app started as a Spring Boot app, and we broke it

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,120
out to be a standalone app, we can continue to use the Spring

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,640
Boot dependencies for security.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,440
Doing this will give us a few things pre‑configured that we can build upon.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,500
There are two dependencies that we need to add‑‑spring‑boot‑starter‑security,

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,030
which has transitive dependencies for the other

7
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:28,000
libraries we need, and spring‑security‑test.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,040
This provides us with libraries that we can utilize to set up

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,240
our app and get up and running quickly.

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:41,000
Although we aren't going to utilize Gradle in this course, let me show you the same configuration using Gradle.
