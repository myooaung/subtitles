00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.350
Switching to a real database is not much more difficult

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.680
than what you already had configured.

3
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.860
Since this is an updated course, though, we are going to do something different.

4
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.730
Instead of just installing a database natively,

5
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.440
we are going to use Docker to install a container and access

6
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.220
the database through the Docker instance.

7
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.800
This really is how development is moving, and it is as simple as using Maven.

8
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.060
If you've never used Docker, don't worry,

9
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.960
it's quite easy,

10
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.100
and we will walk through the configuration of doing so with this

11
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.250
course. Just like with the inâ€‘memory configuration,

12
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.710
we need to configure the JDBC authentication, but before we make those changes,

13
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.160
let's talk about Docker.

14
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.480
You do not need to use Docker to do this course,

15
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.340
but it is the industry standard preferred way.

16
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.660
If you haven't used Docker yet,

17
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.460
you should, but if you just want to install my sequel natively,

18
00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.850
you can, or you can just watch this demo and not do it at all. You

19
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.420
will still be able to do other stuff in the course,

20
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.410
not having used Docker, so if you don't want to do this

21
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.040
section and just want to watch it, that's fine.

22
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:17.000
We are going to go walk through the Docker configuration now, though, and you can see how that all works.
