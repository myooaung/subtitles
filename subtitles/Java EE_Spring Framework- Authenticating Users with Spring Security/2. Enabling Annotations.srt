1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,680
The annotations we're going to use are already included in

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,070
the JARs that we have in the application,

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,240
but we need to enable them.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,690
First, we need to actually annotate our code to use annotations, and

5
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:18,490
we're going to enable this by adding the @EnableGlobalMethodSecurity

6
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,940
annotation to the top of our security config.

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:26,240
This actually allows us to then configure specific attributes.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,020
These attributes are the prePostEnabled, which we can use aspects to

9
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:36,540
affect our method before or after it is going to execute.

10
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,260
Next, the securedEnabled, which is the one that we are going to focus on.

11
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:46,140
This will just allow us to wrap our code with a secured element. And then

12
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,310
finally, jsr250, and this is just a different way of us doing the same

13
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:57,630
thing as Secured. Jsr250 is Java's way of adding the Secured annotation

14
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:02,000
that is generic across frameworks. Either way, it works the same.
