00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.510
We're going to start off this module with a simple in‑memory database.

2
00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.650
This is a great way to get things up and running and try

3
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.310
some things within your application,

4
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.070
but not really something that you should deploy your application to

5
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.140
production in the long run with. The good thing about it is switching

6
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.760
to a different database from the in‑memory version should require

7
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.840
very few code changes, in fact, usually just some basic configuration changes.

8
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.430
Spring enables you to add a couple lines of configuration and not need to

9
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.740
know anything else about the underlying data store.

10
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.650
And this is the code that we will configure in our app

11
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.510
using in‑memory authentication. A user named Bryan, in our

12
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.740
case, and a password of pass.

13
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:53.340
This user will also have the role of USER assigned to it.

14
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.760
We could have other roles or have a different password, as you can see,

15
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:06.000
it's just defined by us as to what we're looking for inside of this. Let's add that to our application now.
