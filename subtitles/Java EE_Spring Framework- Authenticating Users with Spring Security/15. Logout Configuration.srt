1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,710
Logout configuration is very similar to the Remember Me

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,130
configuration in our ConferenceSecurityConfiguration file.

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:13,140
We start off by defining the logout functionality. We

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,540
then have a logoutSuccessfulUrl.

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,550
And in this instance, we are returning back to the login

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:25,100
page and adding a parameter of logout=true so that we can

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,540
display a successful message.

8
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:33,640
From here, we will invalidate our session and then delete the cookie

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:39,240
associated with the login and the Remember Me services as well.

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:39,850
Lastly,

11
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:49,000
we want to allow everyone to be able to log out so we add a permitAll configuration to the end of that logout configuration.
