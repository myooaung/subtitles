00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.060
Remember me services have become essential for a good user experience.

2
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.100
You may already be getting tired of logging in as many

3
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.040
times as we have throughout this course.

4
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.130
Remember me services apply a cookie in the app to

5
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.260
verify that we are who we say we are.

6
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.790
And as long as the user allows cookies,

7
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.360
your app doesn't require you to continually log in. We're going to have

8
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.940
to add a few pieces to do this though. We're going to have to modify

9
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.250
our UI, change our security configuration, and add a table to our

10
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.350
database that it will go back and reference to see that that cookie is

11
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:45.000
in fact still valid from a login perspective. Let's start by looking at the front end.
