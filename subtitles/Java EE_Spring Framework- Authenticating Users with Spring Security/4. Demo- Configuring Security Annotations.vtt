To enable methodâ€‘level security,

2
00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.320
we want to open up our configuration, and we're going to do that by

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:12.360
opening up src, main, java, our com.pluralsight.conference package, and

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.640
then open up our ConferenceSecurityConfig.

5
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.050
I'm going to make this full screen so that we can see it a little easier. At

6
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.400
the top of our class, we have two annotations already.

7
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.740
We have our Configuration annotation and our EnableWebSecurity annotation.

8
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.120
We want to give ourselves a little space underneath that, and add one more

9
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:44.140
annotation that is @EnableGlobalMethodSecurity, and we can, by default, just

10
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.230
add that annotation like this, but we can actually specify the attributes we

11
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.330
want to enable and disable inside of here.

12
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.040
So, I'm going to add some parentheses in there, and inside of

13
00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:06.130
here, we can choose to have the prePostEenabled = true, we can

14
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.340
also have securedEnabled = true.

15
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.800
And you'll notice that as I'm typing these in, all of these, by default, were

16
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:22.300
set to false, and so adding these in here is what is going to turn on these

17
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.810
individual features because just adding that annotation by itself, everything

18
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.740
was still set to false. And then lastly,

19
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.440
we'll add the jsr250Enabled = true as well.

20
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.200
Now we have our closing parentheses, everything's good inside of here.

21
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.650
That's actually all we had to do to configure our application to

22
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.800
turn on the global method security, and part of the reason for that

23
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.940
is that we already have these annotations added to our project

24
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.960
through our Maven configuration.

25
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.110
So it didn't require us to add anything additional to our

26
00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:06.000
project, just add this to our configuration. Let's look at how we tweak our method now to access and enable the security.
