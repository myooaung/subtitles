00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:06.360
The change we'll need to make to our ConferenceSecurityConfig.java file

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.430
is very similar to what we did for jdbcAuthentication.

3
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.780
We're going to swap that out with ldapAuthentication, and we have a

4
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.460
userDnPatterns for the user ID we're going to be searching for and the

5
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.850
group or organizational unit that it will be under,

6
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.440
which is people, and our groupSearchBase.

7
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.540
And then that will build up our URL.

8
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.570
And you can see we just have in here our localhost 8389.

9
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.200
This string, I might point out,

10
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.420
could be submitted in through a JNDI lookup, through a database lookup.

11
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.180
There are a bunch of ways that this could be in here,

12
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.250
so don't think this has to be hardcoded in there,

13
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.940
but to make this example simpler,

14
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.310
we've gone ahead and just pasted this in here. And then notice

15
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.820
we're going to use the same passwordEncoder down below that we

16
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.060
used for our database configuration.

17
00:00:53.060 --> 00:01:01.000
Let's switch our code to this now and get it updated to using these configuration parameters that we have listed here.
