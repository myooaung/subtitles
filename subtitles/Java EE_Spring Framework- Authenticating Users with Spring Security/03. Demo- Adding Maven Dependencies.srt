1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,320
I've gone ahead and shut down all of the servers and everything else I had

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:10,400
running just to have a clean starting point for this module.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,040
We're going to start off by opening up our pom.xml.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,060
I'm going to go to the bottom of the dependency section,

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:22,390
and it doesn't really matter, but before the test artifact,

6
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,840
I'm going to give myself some whitespace here.

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,140
I'm going to start adding those three dependencies that we need inside of here.

8
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:35,040
So the first one is the org.springframework.ldap groupId

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,140
with the spring‑ldap‑core artifactId.

10
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:45,300
This is for our Spring application to do any type of interaction with LDAP, and

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,640
it's actually the libraries that the Spring Security artifact that we're going

12
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:55,850
to copy in here in a minute will require to do those interactions. So these two

13
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,460
are kind of dependent upon one another.

14
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,520
We're going to specify both of them.

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,790
They could be pulled in as a transit dependency,

16
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,430
but by specifying them, we're sure of which

17
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,140
libraries we're going to be importing.

18
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:14,630
The next one is the org.springframework.security groupId with the

19
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:19,210
spring‑security‑ldap artifactId. And this is just what does the

20
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,740
binds and searches and things that we're expecting underneath the

21
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,540
hood in LDAP for our Spring Security application to authenticate

22
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,140
our user against it.

23
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:38,360
And then we'll finally have one more here, and that is the unboundId artifact

24
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:44,380
for the LDAP SDK. So it's a group idea of com.unboundId and an artifact of

25
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:49,340
unboundId‑ldapsdk, a little bit of a weird name,

26
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:54,240
but it's actually the preferred LDAP server if you go researching

27
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,290
the Spring Security documentation about what to test your Spring

28
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:05,000
Security LDAP against. Let's look at the next configuration pieces that we need inside of our app.
