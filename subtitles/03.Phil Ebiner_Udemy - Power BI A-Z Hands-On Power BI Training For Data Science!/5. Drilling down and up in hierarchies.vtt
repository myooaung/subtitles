00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.110
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:07.410
Of course and part VI in the series of tural We played around with the layout of the tool and I hope

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.990
you had some time to explore it a bit further on your own.

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.620
And now that you're getting a bit more comfortable with how this all works.

5
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.140
And today we're going to learn a new technique that will help us solve the challenge for this section.

6
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.910
So let's go ahead and creating your page by clicking the plus sign are here.

7
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.310
And before we do anything else let's just quickly save our words so we're going to click the dropdown

8
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.920
menu here select Save As and so the folder where you want to say.

9
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.660
And here I'm just going to save it as a section too.

10
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.160
So it's just good practice to save your work.

11
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.660
Now you can just press control on your keyboard like that and that way your progress won't be lost.

12
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.000
All right.

13
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.610
So what do we want to do now.

14
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:58.470
We want to explore a drilling in two hierarchies and drilling out of them and say unique feature for

15
00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.140
Part B.

16
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.310
So let's have a look.

17
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:08.040
We're going to take order date drag it onto our new page and then we're going to take units and drag

18
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.410
it onto the page as well.

19
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.710
And so what we get is a bar chart.

20
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.020
So let's actually select this bar chart over here.

21
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.170
If you didn't get a barge or if you got a table.

22
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.680
Same thing just like the Bartsch or I can over there.

23
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:28.680
Let's expand this and now what you'll see is we've got two years 2014 and 2015 and that's because that

24
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.790
is how our deficit is structured.

25
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:37.980
We've got that if you go here you've got sales starting from July 2014 and they go all the way to June

26
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:38.640
2015.

27
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:46.920
So in some countries such as Australia this is a financial year it starts on the 1st of July it ends

28
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.730
on the 30th of June of the following year and hence this dataset is like that.

29
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:56.490
So it's it's a bit different to a calendar year but still has those 12 months has just shifted by six

30
00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.070
months.

31
00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:04.400
So this is one financial year of data in here and that's how it is structured and that's why all that

32
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.460
just confirms that our nation is presenting the correct results.

33
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.900
We've got 2014 entry.

34
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:15.440
Now if I click on any one of these as you can see nothing happens it just gets highlighted.

35
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.140
But what we can do is we can tell power that we want to drill into our data and there's a couple of

36
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.860
ways of doing it.

37
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.200
First of all at the top here you can see drill.

38
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.610
So once we've got this chart selected if I just click somewhere on the on the space around that then

39
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.710
that menu disappears.

40
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.390
If I just like the chart you've got this option drill.

41
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.650
So let's go ahead and click there and you can see a couple of options available to you.

42
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.900
So today we're going to explore this option and drill down.

43
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.200
You can see it here or the other way you can do it is you can select it over here so they both do the

44
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.050
same thing as you can see this one gets depressed when you press it here or to check that and I press

45
00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.860
this one.

46
00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:59.850
This one gets suppressed.

47
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.590
And basically that changes the behavior that this chart is going to exhibit when you select different

48
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.550
elements of the chart.

49
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:16.590
So now if I select 2014 watch what happens once have selected 2014 what happened is we went into 2014.

50
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.470
We've got quarter three and quarter for here of 2014 is the core 3.

51
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.250
Now we have three months July August September so I'm drilling in to the chart.

52
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.240
And now if I go into July I actually have the dates I have the fourth the 12 the 21st to.

53
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:44.130
That's when those units were sold and I can see exactly how many units on the 29th of July of quarter

54
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.810
3 of 2014 81 units were sold.

55
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.580
And here you can see how far we've drilled in on into year quarter month and day.

56
00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:01.890
And this allows us to really get a granular view of the dataset and very very powerful feature something

57
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.110
quite unique to power be-I.

58
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.900
And if you want to go back up you just click the drill button over here so you don't have to press on

59
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.950
the chart anymore because it's you don't need to specify where you want to drill up.

60
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.820
So a power guy knows exactly where draw lot.

61
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.950
It just goes back to the previous level or you can press this button here drill up back over here.

62
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.950
So there we go that's how drilling works.

63
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:31.650
Let's try another way let's say 2015 but it's sort of caught a while as they want to look at quarter

64
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:39.870
to anyone to look at may see as we can as we saw previously we drilled into this quarter and here into

65
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.340
this actual month into May.

66
00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.670
And here again there were five days when there were actual sales.

67
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:53.150
So in the fifth 90 units were sold in the 14th 22nd and the first and you can confirm that if you can.

68
00:04:53.150 --> 00:05:00.060
If you go to the data set let's just quickly go to our data set and look at May 2015 and this should

69
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.550
be only 5 dates.

70
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.610
Go here and we scroll down.

71
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.730
May 2015.

72
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.010
So that's these columns over here.

73
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:18.720
So that's this call on the row this row this row and the stroke and as you can see exactly those five

74
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.120

75
14:22 and 31.

76
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.270
And if we go and look at June there should be only three days when there were cells.

77
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:31.020
If you go back up and then you go into June you'll see this three days.

78
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.420
And if you want to stop at some point if you don't want to drill in you want to just work with a certain

79
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.410
part of your chart so you're viz..

80
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:44.430
So you want to leave it at this and you just uncheck this drilling functionality and you won't be drilling

81
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:45.560
in anymore.

82
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:52.770
So I'm going I'm just going to return back to the overall view and that's how you drill in and drill

83
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:59.140
out in power be-I I highly recommend that you play around with this little bit.

84
00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:08.730
And for example explore color of one of 2015 or quarter four of 2014 and see how many units were sold

85
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:14.670
in one of those days in one of those months and then just compared with the data source and I'll see

86
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.450
you back here on the next tutorial.

87
00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.330
Until then happy analyzing.
