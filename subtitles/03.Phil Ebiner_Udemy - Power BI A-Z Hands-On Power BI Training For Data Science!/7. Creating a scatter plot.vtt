00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:06.390
Hello and welcome back to the course on Paul VI in the person Tauriel we created this a wonderful map

2
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.370
and we learned how to create the profit margin calculated measure or a new measure.

3
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.330
And today we're going to go ahead and create a scatterplot.

4
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.390
So let's go and dive straight into it.

5
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:26.290
We're going to create a new page and we're going to like this solution scatter chart and and now we

6
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.820
just need to select what you want on the x and y axis.

7
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:38.220
So on x axis we want sales and on the y axis we want profit this fund profit yes.

8
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:45.010
And as you can see we only have one Alman because once again as we discussed in the editorial about

9
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:52.680
aggregation granularity and level of detail we haven't specified full power be-I at which level of detail

10
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.630
at which level of granularity we want this Alsation to be displayed or portrayed.

11
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:06.820
All we have here is the measure's rights of the items or the numeric values and numeric values on numeric

12
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.010
columns they get aggregated.

13
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:15.220
They don't actually specify the level of aggregation at which you want to use Alsation to be portrayed

14
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.000
to specify the level of aggregation you need to use categorical variables and other non numeric variables.

15
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.960
So how do we do that.

16
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.590
Well in our case we want we have to tell Part B at which level do we want to see this so do we want

17
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.430
to see the scatterplot at Region level.

18
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.190
Let's try that.

19
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:40.150
Let's put it into details here and see now you can see that we've got the region the north south and

20
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.020
the Central.

21
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.310
Well we don't really use regions so let's get rid of that bibulous replace it with states rights or

22
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.270
group conscious or country and country.

23
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:57.610
Now we've got a little circle for every country where we can sort of country can do city it will have

24
00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.330
way more circles.

25
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.710
Again this is pulled in the geography and it's still at country level so we can drill into the city

26
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:06.610
level like that.

27
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.040
But that's not what we're after.

28
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:15.490
The scatterplot that we actually want to show should display our customers so that from the scatterplot

29
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:21.250
we can identify which of our customers are the most profitable or the least profitable customers for

30
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.650
us.

31
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.900
So let's go ahead and do that.

32
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.810
We're going to take customer name and drag it into details.

33
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.740
And as you can see that right away we've got this wonderful scatterplot right away.

34
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.530
And now we're going to add some additional information here.

35
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.320
We can already tell that by the prophet we can see that some customers are not profitable at all so

36
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.980
they're the transactions they've made have there's all the negative profits somehow resulting positive

37
00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.510
profit but not what we're going to add is we're going to add the profit margin and we very calculated

38
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.220
this measure.

39
00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.670
And as you remember Previously we used profit margins to go back to the profit margin when we were aggregating

40
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.640
by geography right.

41
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:09.220
So we use profit margin at the level of country or state or city and because profit margin is a calculated

42
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:17.050
measure rather than a calculated column it gets automatically updated to the level of granularity of

43
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.980
our results.

44
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:24.750
Well the good news is that it doesn't have to be a Joe graphic level of granularity.

45
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:31.650
We were not limited to specifying just geographies and really into other states CDO country and then

46
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.190
profit margin would be recounted.

47
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:40.990
We can still use the same exact profit margin the same exact formula same exact calculate measure we

48
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:48.250
have here in this is a position where we are specifying the level of granularity based on the customer

49
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.940
name.

50
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.820
So if you just look at the formula at the top you'll see that some of profit order break down profits

51
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.870
are some of profit divided by some of sales.

52
00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.990
No we're here in the calculation does it say that we need to deal with geography just says that that's

53
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.170
take some of the profit at the level of granularity of your vessels.

54
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.550
So in this case per customer so some of the profits per every single customer and customers sometimes

55
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.990
make several orders and orders containing contains several items.

56
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:22.870
So some of all of the items for all of them are some of the profit for all items and all the orders

57
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.390
for for example for this customer right for this customer George Dawson.

58
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:35.570
And then let's go back to a formal formula and then take a sample of the sales for all of the items

59
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.670
and all of the orders for that same customer irrespective of country irrespective of date irrespective

60
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.040
of everything else because nothing else is here.

61
00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.300
We only have customer name and then just divide one by the other and that's exactly what we're going

62
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.630
to expect was going to happen.

63
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:55.190
And that's what's powered be-I is going to do for us and we can choose this field which is going to

64
00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.620
take this field and put it on concentration and Boyda already we have something.

65
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:08.150
So now we get to make it even more obvious which customers are have a have a positive profit margin

66
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.060
for us and which have a negative profit margin and so we're going to take data colors.

67
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:18.960
And again which is minimum red maximum that's in blue that we use last time.

68
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:25.080
This is the new version of the blue string maybe this blue to light.

69
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.340
All right.

70
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.830
So again the science about is all about the colors.

71
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:35.990
It's all about the conveying the insights and making aesthetic presentations.

72
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:41.630
All right so there we see already something interesting we can see that we've got customers up here

73
00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.340
with positive profit margins right.

74
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.160
So the greater the profit margin the better.

75
00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:52.670
Meaning that at the same level of expenses by doing business with a customer with a higher profit margin

76
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:56.300
for instance here we've got much of 0.44.

77
00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:04.580
And with this customer it's 0.30 3 so we've discussed them more by having the same amount of expenses

78
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.940
going to or and conducting business by making similar sales.

79
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:14.230
We're going to make a higher amount of profit for George Dawson than Harrison Coke.

80
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:22.820
And here we've got some customers whose profit is in the negative and it is just it just makes sense

81
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:29.720
that their profit margin is also negative because profit can be positive or negative whereas sales can

82
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:30.860
all be positive.

83
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:37.130
So if you divide a negative by positive you will get a negative and right away from here we can tell

84
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:43.730
you know which are our customers like good customers which whom we should continue doing business with

85
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:52.520
and who are the customers that are costing organization money and maybe we should you know try to improve

86
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.160
that relationship and see what products are buying.

87
00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:01.490
Maybe we should substitute those products or maybe we should find better ways of sourcing those products

88
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.790
or maybe we should just stop doing business with those customers.

89
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:11.900
If it is causing our business money and if we can afford to do that from a reputational standpoint.

90
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.210
So some decisions have to be made.

91
00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:18.370
But basically the insights are here for us to take action upon.

92
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:24.800
And there we go that's how we create a scatterplot in power be-I and moreover in this internally also

93
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:31.430
recapped on how calculated measures work so hopefully that really drives the point home and then you're

94
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:33.710
getting quite comfortable with calculated measures.

95
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:36.250
And I look forward to seeing you on the next internal.

96
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:37.620
Until then happy Anil.
