00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:07.680
Hello welcome back to the course on power be-I in this material we are going to explore our oceans.

2
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.810
All right so let's get straight to it.

3
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.470
We're going to look at three things.

4
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:19.850
First of all we're going to look at who are the most stable countries lending money to.

5
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.030
Then we're going to look at who are the most riskiest come countries boring from and then we're going

6
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.330
to take one country and just analyze that one country.

7
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.780
All right so let's get started.

8
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.190
We're going to look at the most stable countries so the great ones.

9
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.910
And so let's pick them out here.

10
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:45.200
Hold on control and select these countries so Japan Germany Britain and the United States so they where

11
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.760
they act as creditors as you can see the whole of civilization has just adjusted.

12
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.640
All right so what can we tell from here.

13
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:59.350
Well right away because of the sizes of these parts of the pies we can tell that the most lending has

14
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.830
actually been done by Japan Germany and Britain.

15
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:08.680
And we can also tell that from the tree up here we can say see that the US didn't do much lending at

16
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.410
all.

17
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.920
And the interesting thing is that these countries tend to lend money to each other.

18
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:21.040
Right so you can tell by the size of this of the start of the pathway pathway.

19
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.200
So here for instance Germany and Britain 321 billion dollars.

20
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.540
Japan and Germany eighty eight point five billion dollars.

21
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.160
But the most of the money that they are lending is going to the U.S..

22
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.250
So Japan lent United States 196 billion.

23
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.080
Germany lent them $324 and Britain lent them forty billion.

24
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.450
So that's how much money went into the U.S. And then there's some colors going into the other smaller

25
00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.630
countries by the way you can see that the colors.

26
00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:03.730
Well we'll see further down the country colors don't really hold consistent and they kind of mess up

27
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.700
a little bit as the filtering happens.

28
00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.950
And you know that's probably something that will be fixed up in Part B in the chord diagram further

29
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:11.860
down the track.

30
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.830
But now let's move on to this part of the chart.

31
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:22.400
So we've highlighted the four countries here and on the right we can see who are the countries that

32
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.900
are actually borrowing money.

33
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.350
So here we really can't how much they're lending and here we're going to be looking at how much countries

34
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.630
are borrowing from these four countries so the highest borrower by far is the United States in total

35
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.180
1.4 trillion dollars.

36
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.000
Then you've got Britain and Germany as we could see there lending money to each other.

37
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:50.410
And then you've got these smaller or European countries or they're boring small amounts.

38
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.970
And here we can see the same picture as we can see here.

39
00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.040
But in a chord diagram so you can see that the United States is by far the highest borrower and we can

40
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.780
actually see additional information.

41
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.270
So here we can see where for instance the funds for the United States came from would have to click.

42
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:13.630
And then you know restart study a new set up of our dashboard whereas here we can see that most of the

43
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.210
money for the United States is coming from Japan.

44
00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:24.350
So 96000 then Germany by the way the arrow here because of the way we set up the start of the arrow

45
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:33.010
here means that United States owes Japan so 996 here the arrow meant Japan lent United States and her

46
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.000
nearly $6 billion dollars here.

47
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.870
The United States owes Japan 796.

48
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:45.190
Here we've got United States owes Germany $324 and the United States owes Brian turn 45 so you can see

49
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.180
where.

50
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:55.060
Well kind of the way to read it is still you've got to start at the back part of the pathway and just

51
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.800
look where it goes.

52
00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.030
So this one goes into Germany and goes into Britain was Japan but then just think of it as this is how

53
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.620
much the United States owes money.

54
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:10.250
Right so then you've got other countries and kind of like similar to what you see here.

55
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.890
But in reverse.

56
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.890
Right here the small United States is small here the United States is huge here.

57
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.080
Japan is huge.

58
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.510
Whereas here Japan is tiny.

59
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.770
Right.

60
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:29.280
Because here we're focusing on how much money has been lent here folks and how much money has been borrowed.

61
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:35.500
All right now let's proceed to let's just click anywhere to reset that and let's proceed to the most

62
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.740
riskiest countries.

63
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.530
So Italy Portugal Ireland and Greece.

64
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.650
And let's see where they're borrowing money from.

65
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:43.250
All right.

66
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.560
So where is the money coming from.

67
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.430
So this is debtors So this is this is these countries that we've selected.

68
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:59.970
And you can see that if the owes the most money and that is the same thing we can see from our tree

69
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:06.250
map here but here it is more evident because we still got the other countries here that we there are

70
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:12.160
not highlighted and therefore we're comparing alongside them whereas here they're the countries we selected

71
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.930
are have been isolated and we can just compare among them.

72
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:23.320
So here we can see Italy is the most $443 billion and most of that money is owed to France by Italy.

73
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.310
And then also bit is owed to Britain.

74
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.280
Then what is this.

75
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.130
And then Italy also owes Japan eight billion dollars.

76
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.740
And Italy or Spain or old back in the time Spain.

77
00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:43.530
Nine point seven billion dollars and Italy owes the United States three point sixteen billion dollars.

78
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.530
Then comes Portugal then Ireland then Greece.

79
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.390
All right and now where are they boringness money from.

80
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.540
Surprisingly this is very interesting.

81
00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:02.540
All of these countries these four countries the most riskiest the biggest creditor for them is France.

82
00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.350
It's not Japan or the U.S. or one of these stable countries.

83
00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.020
The biggest creditor is France.

84
00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.580
So France has lent these countries.

85
00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:17.500
And you can see here most of that money has probably gone to Italy Italy France three hundred sixty

86
00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.060
six billion dollars.

87
00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.420
So very interesting.

88
00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:28.830
So this one of those insights that you can just find from data like surprising surprisingly And so you'd

89
00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.930
think that.

90
00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:39.030
Why would a country that is itself not Italy France is pouring to this data there is low risk but it's

91
00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:46.170
not stable like Germany Japan Britain and United States so why would France loan such a huge amount

92
00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:52.120
of money to Italy which at the time was considered a very high risk country.

93
00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:52.380
Right.

94
00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:57.150
So you can see that these countries seems like these countries are playing it smart lending money to

95
00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:03.510
each other and to the United States whereas France made a big loan to Italy and so they can see that

96
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:04.440
same picture.

97
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:11.380
France made a huge loan to Italy and then France also made quite a substantial loan to Greece which

98
00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:20.930
we as we know was one of the least stable countries or the most riskiest countries at the time.

99
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:21.280
OK.

100
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:24.860
So again you can derive some additional insights from here.

101
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:30.460
And finally we're going to just pick a country so let's say we could pick France for instance but really

102
00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:31.940
talked about France's Big East Germany.

103
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:32.210
Right.

104
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:39.500
Because a lot of the time I remember a lot of people saying that Germany is the driving force for Europe

105
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.930
like they're doing most of the work so let's see what's going on here.

106
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:46.070
It's a bit harder to analyze these chord diagrams when you have when you've picked one country right

107
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:52.240
a bit harder or you could actually just be Germany on the core diagram like that so it's sort of it

108
00:07:52.340 --> 00:08:00.440
adapting you could just highlight it like that and let's do that so you can see here Germany Germany

109
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:01.850
lent money.

110
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:06.460
So this is creditor's Germany lend money to Britain 321 billion.

111
00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:15.170
Germany borrowed money from France Interestingly enough so big and France is not is a low risk country

112
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.840
but still.

113
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:18.530
Why did why was that necessary.

114
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:19.490
Interesting very interesting.

115
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:25.190
I'm sure there are reasons but it's just interesting to see Germany and Ireland some money Germany will

116
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:32.750
spend some money and Germany lent the United States a big chunk of money 324 so even more than they

117
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:34.650
lent a Brit it's about the same money.

118
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:39.790
But yeah so Germany lent the United States on 24 billion dollars.

119
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:47.370
And then you can see that this diagram has adjusted as well and this is a very interesting sell here.

120
00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:52.930
So if I can click here you'll see Germany you look here is 253 billion as a dollar.

121
00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:53.600
So how much.

122
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.880
Germany owes money to other countries.

123
00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.640
But if I click here you'll see that this has changed.

124
00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:04.830
This is eight hundred eight hundred and three right so it's actually the same amount as here.

125
00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:12.950
So here we are now looking at those other countries that owe Germany so the chord diagrams are smart

126
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.840
when they adapt when they adjust.

127
00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:20.780
But at the same time it's it can be a bit confusing if you don't follow what they're doing.

128
00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:25.120
So here we're saying Germany lent money to countries right.

129
00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:33.800
When I click this diagram is now representing the countries the debtors that actually owe money to Germany.

130
00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:40.240
And so here as you can see these cores are becoming smaller as they as they go away.

131
00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:45.640
And it's hard really to tell the countries on the end whereas here now that's where they start.

132
00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:45.860
Right.

133
00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.720
So that's that's the chords.

134
00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:53.000
So the United States owes Germany 324 billion same amount as we can see here.

135
00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:01.220
Spain owes Germany five fifty seven point six so it just puts into perspective the relative sizes of

136
00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:02.870
the countries that owe money.

137
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:08.810
So you can see that the most money is on old by United States and Britain to Germany and then Greece

138
00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:15.210
Ireland Portugal and Spain suspence second largest or third largest of these three.

139
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:21.820
And you actually see the amounts here approximate amounts 324 323.

140
00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:27.090
Yeah so that's how chord diagrams work and that's how you can use them in analytics.

141
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:35.120
And as you can see we created a very powerful visualization in the end we can derive some valuable insights

142
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:41.480
and explore individual countries separately or we can explore combinations of countries just by holding

143
00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.270
down control and clicking through.

144
00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:52.370
So I really hope you enjoyed this tutorial and not only did we see how to install a custom visual but

145
00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:59.190
also we saw how to create a quite a powerful dashboard combining lots of different elements such as

146
00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:03.260
the custom visual and tree maps and also leveraging colors.

147
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.290
And also we got to explore this resolution.

148
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:12.410
So hopefully you had some fun and picked up some new skills and always remember that you've got that

149
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:15.430
arsenal of custom visuals that party supplies.

150
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.140
And I look forward to seeing you next time.

151
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:18.590
Until then happy analyzed.
