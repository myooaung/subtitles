00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,420
Hello and welcome back to the course on par be-I in today's tutorial we're going to create a distribution

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,700
for our age groups.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,520
So let's go ahead and have a look at how that's done.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,890
And the first thing we're going to do is we're going to create a new page Harrigan's called age and

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:23,580
then now if we just take simply age we can create a distribution because we need to first create bins

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,990
for this variable.

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:30,570
Right now it's just a numeric variable whereas we wants to create categories we want to create characters

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:37,440
for example from 20 to 25 years old 25 to 30 35 30 to 35 and so on.

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,990
So in order to do that you need to right click your numeric variable.

10
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:49,050
And so a group at the bottom and here instead of bin size select the BEEN size that you would want for

11
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,290
your variable.

12
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,300
So in our case we wanted to be five.

13
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,990
So five years apart and click OK.

14
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,470
And that creates these bins.

15
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:06,100
And now you can simply create two distribution using them so Jack pins into your workspace and then

16
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:13,680
select again custom ideas we did previously to understand how many people fall into each group how they

17
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,890
go that's your distribution for age.

18
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,880
It is as simple as that.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,690
So maybe you might want to add a couple of things to this distribution.

20
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:28,450
Maybe you'd like to change some things for instance if go into color.

21
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,420
You might want to change color to a bluish color.

22
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,830
That's what I would do.

23
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:43,050
So that's that's a bit too dark something that maybe then we can also.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,640
Yeah we don't want to do that because that will you can change the individual colors or every single

25
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:55,360
group we don't want to do that we want to maybe add the data labels like that may make some space so

26
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,360
that they can fit nicely if we can get them to fit.

27
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,940
Maybe we can adjust some things here so.

28
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,590
So just the size of all labels.

29
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,680
Oh that's actually.

30
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,340
Which one.

31
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,130
Everything here.

32
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:13,050
But then this text we can adjust the size here.

33
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,030
That's good.

34
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,870
So that way we know exactly how many fall in side each of those groups.

35
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:25,590
Then you can see you do fix up the formatting.

36
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:29,870
Hamid Hamid just point in this case we don't actually have decimal points.

37
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,250
Orientation and things like that.

38
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,060
So the usual things.

39
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,800
And that is pretty much it.

40
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:45,150
That's how we create bins in part b I was going to right click and select bins and then we create this

41
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:53,040
distribution chart by using the bins that we created and something that we can count which is customer

42
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,740
ID so you can confirm here that it is being counted.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,780
And one final thing that we do want to fix here is we want to change these two percentages so it's easier

44
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,700
to comprehend it's easier to grasp because that way they're kind of like normalized so if you look at

45
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:15,090
two different regions the totals might be different but percentages will be comparable.

46
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,860
So let's go ahead and customer id click the dropdown.

47
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,460
It's like quick calc and so percentage of grand total.

48
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:28,920
And this is now where we might want to actually go back and fix up the formatting so we might want to

49
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:33,110
go to data labels and say zero decimal points.

50
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:39,240
And that way it looks nice and neat here so you can see that it's automatically adjusting the color

51
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,750
of the label even when it needs to be inside the bar as opposed to when it's outside the bar.

52
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,400
OK so that's how we create our age distribution.

53
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,610
And a quick heads up in the next tutorial we're going to do the same exact thing.

54
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,150
But for our balance.

55
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:57,480
So if you want to go ahead and try that on your own before we proceed to the next tutorial then you're

56
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,190
highly encouraged to do that so that you can practice the skills and then in the next interval you can

57
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:08,560
compare to the way I'm going to do it and see if your way is exactly the same.

58
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,370
And if the result also matches up and I Lipford see you on the next tutorial until then happy analyzing.
