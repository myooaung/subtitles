00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:07.290
Hello and welcome back to the course on power be-I in the previous tutorial we finalized our wonderful

2
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.530
and amazing looking area chart or a stack to enrich our to be more precise.

3
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.390
And today we're going to talk about filters and slicers in power.

4
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.910
Very interesting lecture.

5
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.460
So let's have a look.

6
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.930
We've got our Richard here we are talking about different age groups of color and we can highlight them

7
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.710
actually what was something I noticed before we proceed I noticed that we've got two colors of the same

8
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.500
two of them are same had the same color black.

9
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.110
They go ahead and change that we were you know hard work of colors.

10
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:46.710
Let's go into different colors and let's say let's make this one purple this lower one the one that's

11
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.080
towards the bottom right now it's this one just looks similar.

12
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.910
There are different colors but they look similar.

13
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.310
Some purple maybe.

14
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.520
Is there a darker purple you can change custom colors.

15
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.680
You know I like that so I know that these two look this is similar as well so I'll play around with

16
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.650
the colors and pick something that you prefer that you like because science is not just about finding

17
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:19.410
the insides and the lyrics also about being an artist and finding wonderful colors that help you represent

18
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.840
your insights in the most engaging and convincing way.

19
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.340
So there we go.

20
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.850
Let's make it a bit darker.

21
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.530
Too close to blue.

22
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.290
All right so you're going to keep going on for a while I'm just going to select a green that I like.

23
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.900
There we go.

24
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.090
That'll do.

25
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.350
All right.

26
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.800
So today filter's right.

27
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.650
So we have different colors which we can highlight.

28
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.500
I was auditioned with and we can just like we can tell by the college and which one is which.

29
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.020
And it's good that you know they come in order so 16 to 19 20 24 and so on.

30
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.960
And it's it just makes sense right.

31
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.690
No.

32
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.810
How can we add for example gender.

33
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.900
How can we change this resolution quickly if and look at it for males and females separately.

34
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.300
Well we could recreate the same one and just have one for a male one for female.

35
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.590
Right.

36
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.240
But what we can do is we can add a filter we can just take gender and so at the bottom here in your

37
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.380
words fields tab you have an option called filters.

38
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.730
Right.

39
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:35.660
And here you already have the items that you added by default you've got age you've got period and you've

40
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:36.370
got an employer.

41
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:43.140
And here you can change these filters here but we're not going to do that right now we're going to take

42
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.670
gender and we're going to drag it into filter.

43
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.470
Right.

44
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:58.090
So in fact you can just you can just move these drop downs actually you remove the existing ones because

45
00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.810
they're part of the visualization but what you can do is now you can just look at gender.

46
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.000
And here you can specify which one you want to look at you want to look at men.

47
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.550
There's your vision or you can look at women and then you put that in.

48
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:23.950
So you can do some advanced filtering and this is like more applicable to when you have lots of different

49
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.950
items in there.

50
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:33.310
Then you might want to look at some it's whether you're item or whether your calorie contains or word

51
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.760
or stars for letter and things like that.

52
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.160
Then you can add additional conditions there but we're not going to do that.

53
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.850
That is something something more advanced you can do.

54
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:48.660
And again that's for large took care of all variables with more categories than just two.

55
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.150
So we're just going to stick to the basic filtering.

56
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.490
And basically you can just use Alsation So if you want of those four men that you might keep it like

57
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.600
this and then you might duplicate your tab and do another one just for it.

58
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.840
And in this case residuum keep it on select all or if you unselect that's the same thing.

59
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.670
So that's that's a handy approach something.

60
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.250
Good to know about something you can do with age you can just select certain age groups that you want

61
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.550
to visualize and then just keep your resolution at that.

62
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:25.180
And it's kind of like hard coding that into the resolution as you can and adjust that you can totally

63
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.670
just change it whenever you whenever you want to.

64
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.860
But the next approach on it's a bit more flexible.

65
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.830
So that's filtering in part B.

66
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:42.250
And always good to keep that in mind that you can you know control your resolution like that.

67
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:49.800
Now we're going to look at slicing So let's go ahead and duplicate this page and we just call this page

68
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.180
2.

69
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.330
And so it is a great idea to duplicate your pages when you want to add something and you're not sure

70
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.590
if it's going to be better or worse just duplicate the page and experiment on the new page and then

71
00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.390
you have the old one as a copy.

72
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.900
So we're going to reduce the size and now we're going to do something that we've never done before something

73
00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.560
you know we're going to add a another result zation onto this same workspace.

74
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.810
This is a beautiful thing in power either.

75
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.790
It's very simple to add more than one is onto one onto your workspace.

76
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.290
Well you have to do is just make sure you're not you haven't selected this position so just click somewhere

77
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.250
in the blank area on the workspace and then select a resolution you like and in this case we're going

78
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.000
to start small.

79
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.600
We're going to just start by adding a slicer because that's the topic of today's tutorial.

80
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.680
So just go ahead and click on the slice or we hear and what the slicer does is it's like a filter but

81
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:44.380
it's a visual filter it's not something that is you know some way here hidden in the parameters.

82
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.030
It's something that is like very obvious straining of his position and it's easy to control and that's

83
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:55.570
why I mentioned that when we were doing the filtering here we're kind of like hard coding the filters.

84
00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:01.900
Whereas with slicers they're right right away they're right so there on the his position and very very

85
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.110
evident very easy to control.

86
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.920
So let's go ahead and with this slicer adds the same apartment that we were talking about will to add

87
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:15.530
gender so you enter into a slicer as you can see it automatically decides what it should look like.

88
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:21.850
And now without having to configure anything at all only all you can is it's all ready.

89
00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:27.430
All you have to do now is just select which gender you would like to visualize and it's like that had

90
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:28.730
all magically adjusted chart.

91
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.410
It's like that automatic there just to check if you want to slow all.

92
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.290
Just uncheck that and there you go.

93
00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:39.880
It's so active that you can also press is Button are here clear selections and will automatically bring

94
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.180
back your full charge.

95
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:46.780
And again you can add another slicers so click on the whitespace to click anywhere not on these two

96
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:54.750
at a slicer and this time let's say you want gender not just touch in your own age.

97
00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:59.410
And here you can just like the ones that you want so if you want to select one just select selected

98
00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:05.230
if you want to select several Then hold on control and on the keyboard and you select the ones you want.

99
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:13.490
And then you go so that's a very handy way to quickly control it was all zation with slicers.

100
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:17.530
And moreover power I recently released an update.

101
00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:21.480
Now slicers look really good with dates even.

102
00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:25.540
So let's add another slicer and this time drive period into here.

103
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:31.490
And as you can see here you've got a wonderful slicer where you can just scroll around and look at the

104
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:33.340
data watch how beautiful this is.

105
00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.290
This is amazing.

106
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:42.290
This is just incredible how life it just looks really natural and integrated.

107
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:48.650
You see like adjusting and it's changing so if I want to cut it off here and see what what is happening

108
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:59.330
until 2010 so I can see that there was a climb like that or I can visualize what was happening after.

109
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:04.250
And by the way you have options here so you can click the drop down and you can see in of between you

110
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:05.230
can say before.

111
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.850
So you can look at everything that happened before and it removes that first part.

112
00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:17.980
When can you ever see that happen after you can do a list of actual elements from your dataset and just

113
00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:18.800
select them like that.

114
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:23.960
But that's probably not the best idea of dates between is probably the best option here.

115
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:28.190
And you can specify the date hardcoded in or you can choose from a calendar.

116
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:29.380
How cool is that you can actually.

117
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:34.710
It's like the dates so you don't have to hard code things and you can specify.

118
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:41.600
So you don't have to type it in manually you just go through this calendar and find whoops find the

119
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:48.020
date that you want and let's go back a bit.

120
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:53.160
So to specify the date and all are just like that.

121
00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:53.890
So there we go.

122
00:08:53.910 --> 00:09:02.010
Or you can just clear section very very handy tools these slicers and they make your session very friendly

123
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.740
very user friendly for adjusting.

124
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:12.330
So hopefully in today's tutorial and help clear on that see what inside's you can derive from by using

125
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.240
these different just slicers that we've created.

126
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.550
And I look forward to seeing you next time.

127
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:19.250
Until then happy analyzing.
