00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.150
Hello and welcome back to the course and RBI in the first tutorial we connected to our data sets and

2
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.690
joined them.

3
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:15.870
So if we go to the relationships you'll see that we've got the join and the joins performed and manage

4
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:22.930
relationships join is performed on the order ID and today we're going to create our first map.

5
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.200
Very exciting to tour ahead.

6
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.040
So let's get started.

7
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.360
So the type of map we're going crazy is this one just a simple map.

8
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.950
There's also the other option the field map.

9
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.880
We want a bubble chart on our map or circles on the map so we're going to select this map all right.

10
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:47.820
And now what do we want to do is we want to fill this map using the geographical information contained

11
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.150
here.

12
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.130
So first things first we're going to create a hierarchy.

13
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:59.940
We're going to take We'll sort of state and we'll drag it on top of country and that will create a Harkee

14
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.000
country.

15
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.350
Are you here so we can rename this hurricane.

16
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.640
We can we can call that geography.

17
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.740
And as you can see this created a hurricane with that country and then state under it.

18
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.460
Now I'll show another way to do this.

19
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.250
I'm just going to delete this.

20
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:26.070
Another way to do the same procedure is to right click your field country in this case and say new hire.

21
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.310
And that also creates a hierarchy except this time there's only one element in it.

22
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.740
For now he's just going to hold geography.

23
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:42.450
And now we're going to add the other elements so we're going to add state into this hierarchy it is

24
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.820
dragging on a of geography and then we're going to see.

25
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.900
And so if you got them in the wrong order you can always move them around but just make sure that it

26
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.600
makes sense in which order they are so your country state and city.

27
00:01:53.620 --> 00:02:01.930
Now we have another geographical element which is region but in reality region is kind of a an element

28
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.600
that we've come up with just for this data set.

29
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:11.270
It's not something that's recognized and it could be different in different.

30
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.300
It could be different in different interpretations.

31
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:23.620
So if we just have a look at it here so this the borders you'll see that region is like Central or east

32
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.350
west and so and so this is not something that's usually recognized by business intelligence tools.

33
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.680
So we're not going to use this you know sugarfree.

34
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.020
All right so there's our you know we're going to drag hierarchy onto this location and that creates

35
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.230
this map.

36
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.710
And now I'm going to show you something interesting.

37
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.890
So right now we've got these countries and.

38
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.730
Is correct.

39
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.330
We are working in Europe now.

40
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:56.250
However if I start drilling down so I want to expand the hierarchy to the next level to the state level

41
00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.720
Let's get a second to think about what's going on.

42
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.480
Again this like what you're seeing here is that nothing really happens.

43
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.800
The states we're looking at country and state but we're still seeing only one element actually.

44
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.830
In fact there are several circles you can tell by the darkness of the circle that there's several of

45
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.300
them under each other but they're just all being plotted in the same spot.

46
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.250
And also if I expand to the city level you'll see that some of our cities end up in America because

47
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.680
they are our cities with the same names in the US.

48
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:40.020
So basically what this is showing us is that there are some inefficiencies still in the way these maps

49
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.930
and hurricanes work in Palm Beach.

50
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.730
And as always part be-I are constantly working on these things and proving all the time.

51
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:55.730
So maybe even when you're watching this video these slight issues have been resolved.

52
00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:04.770
But for now the safest way to deal with maps especially maps where we were trying to plot like a scatterplot

53
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.030
or portray some information.

54
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.160
It's not just the country level but at the city or state level.

55
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.240
The best way to go about it is to use latitude along as it should.

56
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.560
And we've got the latitude and longitude inside this dataset.

57
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.500
So let's go ahead and use them.

58
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:27.540
I'm going to go back to the highest level so the country level and now I'm going to take latitude and

59
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.240
drag it onto the latitude field and longitude onto the longitude field.

60
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:39.300
Now if we look in the data set latitude and longitude are given to us for every single row meaning so

61
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.640
that this transaction was performed in Denmark Copenhagen.

62
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.910
Right.

63
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:50.640
So therefore that's the latitude and longitude of this transaction in Spain and so on.

64
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:58.280
So when you do it at a country level naturally it has to take the average and just look out for that

65
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:04.790
so sometimes you might have a country which has a weird shape and then your roads or your transactions

66
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.830
in that country were conducted in certain cities that this average might actually fall outside of the

67
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.460
country and fall into another country so you have to call for that in that case you might want to use

68
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:20.130
something like the median of the latitude and longitude so that it's not that affected by outliers.

69
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:26.130
I find that when you use the median it is better aligned with the capital of the city somehow.

70
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:33.480
So you've got stold Rome you know Helsinki Oslo and so on and so you can see that it's actually falling

71
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:34.890
in some countries not in all.

72
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.600
So here in Italy for instance falling in Rome.

73
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.790
So I'm going to undo that.

74
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.560
I'm going to press cancel that and just leave it an average.

75
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.130
But look out for that.

76
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.740
Just find the best approach for your specific situation.

77
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:55.370
So there we go that's how we've created this map now which you'll see is if we drill further down.

78
00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:02.500
Now at the state level we've got all the states so for instance in France we've got all these states

79
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.400
popping up.

80
00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:10.630
And if we're again for each state the location of this bubble is given by the average of the latitude

81
00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:16.340
and longitude for the transactions that happened in that state.

82
00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:22.570
And then if we go further down to the next level you can see again we've got even for the cities we've

83
00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.730
got all the latitude and longitude.

84
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:32.470
Correct and this time it's spot on because if a certain number of transactions happen in the same city

85
00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:38.130
they'll have the same latitude and longitude and therefore the circle will be exactly on that city.

86
00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:45.060
So that's how we create a map with our hierarchies.

87
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.820
And now we can just go back up so probably not at that level.

88
00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:51.370
That's probably not the best.

89
00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:58.530
So yeah there's still a couple of things to look out for and hopefully maps will improve probably by

90
00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:02.880
constantly improving their product and hopefully maps will improve over time.

91
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:11.350
But if you can get a latitude and longitude it's often not that hard to find those parameters based

92
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:12.780
on your data set.

93
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:18.970
It's always a good idea to just add them in and like be on the safe side and also look out for the average

94
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.360
and the median and those things that we discussed.

95
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:28.160
So there we go that's our first step to creating our map and solving this challenge and elephants here.

96
00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:29.830
Until then happy analyzing.
