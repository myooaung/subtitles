00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,750
Since the Selenium IDE is an extension built into your browser,

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:09,240
we'll need to have Chrome or Firefox installed.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,760
This is an updated version of this course.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,870
In the previous version, I had done all of my examples in Firefox,

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,440
but I have since opted to use Chrome for this one just to mix it up for people.

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,860
The same example should work just fine under Firefox,

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:30,000
though. Please make sure you have an appropriate browser already installed before proceeding to the next step.
