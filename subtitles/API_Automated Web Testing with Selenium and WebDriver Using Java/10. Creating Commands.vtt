00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.680
Now that we have our initial test created and we want to go

2
00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.240
through and be able to change this or add things to it without

3
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.870
having to rerecord that entire process, well,

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:10.900
we can obviously do that.

5
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.200
We can add more commands as we go through and edit this without having

6
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.410
to go through and rerecord that test every time.

7
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.960
The way we want to go ahead and do this is to go below our current

8
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.040
commands and go down to our command editing window here.

9
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.200
And you can select the drop‑down and scroll through all of this,

10
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.200
or you can just start typing and it will do it as well.

11
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.300
If we choose click, it takes a target.

12
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.950
We can see up above we have the various click commands

13
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.610
and the target associated with this.

14
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.140
But one nice feature is we can use this arrow here that the help

15
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.640
text is telling you, select target in page.

16
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.500
And if I click that, it tells you to select an element inside of our page.

17
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.670
So let's go ahead and come over here and choose beta,

18
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.690
and you'll see that it has set up our target to say command

19
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.380
of click with a linkText equal to beta,

20
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.040
and it's added that to the end of our current test.

21
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.430
If we rerun this test, it'll go through,

22
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.230
open up our window again, set the window size.

23
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.880
It will go through and select that CSS item,

24
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.300
select the linkText, the news text,

25
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:34.080
and now go to the assert that that text is true and then click the tag of beta.

26
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.570
So you'll notice we have a new page popped up here because it has navigated to

27
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.530
the log with a tag beta, the linkText that we chose on there.

28
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.260
If you chose something different, it'll go to that page as well.

29
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.510
But we just added another command inside of there,

30
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.510
and it's very easy to do because it will go through and

31
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.710
help us select the appropriate target.

32
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.870
And I can't tell you how much better this is now than it

33
00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.320
was in previous releases because it just basically pauses

34
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.070
the test of where you're at,

35
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.390
and it helps you determine the correct CSS or XPath or other things

36
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.040
for you to choose that right element on the page.

37
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.870
Speaking of those commands that you can use on that page or

38
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.240
specifically the options that are available on that command,

39
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.540
one thing to keep in mind is that you can click one of these commands

40
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.640
and come down and choose Reference and see what the arguments or

41
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.640
documentation is associated with that command.

42
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.160
And so I'm going to make this a little bit bigger.

43
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.230
You can see that on click it has the argument or target of locator, and

44
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.740
the definition of it that clicks on a target element,

45
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.200
example a link, button, checkbox, or radio button.

46
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.360
It has the arguments defined here for what it takes for that specific command.

47
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.040
This ends up being a great way for you to see what options you have

48
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.940
available for the command you're trying to add to that page.

49
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.670
The other option for finding those commands,

50
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.380
because it's not always easiest to just choose that drop‑down, is to

51
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:18.020
open up a browser tab and go to the selenium.dev/selenium‑ide/docs

52
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:30.000
section, and you can see an entire list of the commands available for you to use inside of the Selenium IDE.
