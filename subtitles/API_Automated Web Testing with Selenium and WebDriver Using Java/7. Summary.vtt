In this short introduction module,

2
00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.780
we showed briefly what the Selenium IDE is and the problems that we're

3
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.930
trying to solve with it and what the solution is and what we're

4
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.260
essentially going to be getting out of using it.

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.200
We also took a look at WebDriver and showed you how we could create

6
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:23.100
WebDriver tests from the Selenium IDE. We spoke about why you want to use

7
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.340
automated testing and the drawbacks of other methods,

8
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.840
and then we briefly discussed the architecture of Selenium.

9
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.950
Now we're going to dive deeper into each one of these topics, and let's

10
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.000
get started by looking more into the Selenium i d. E.
