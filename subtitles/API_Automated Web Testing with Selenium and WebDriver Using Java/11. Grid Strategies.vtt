00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.890
Now that you've seen how Grid works,

2
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.540
you're probably wondering how you could run this across multiple machines.

3
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.940
There's a few ways you could go about doing this.

4
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.480
One of the first options is just having a bunch of

5
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.690
commodity machines sitting around.

6
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.260
You could buy a bunch of Mac Minis or other commodity hardware,

7
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.940
simple desktop instances, old, reclaimed laptops.

8
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.090
They're often just sitting around idle, and you're just going

9
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.840
to use them for QA and testing purposes.

10
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.810
The other option is a VMware or VirtualBox or Hypervisor

11
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.260
instance that you go through and spin up and down an instance

12
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.540
of a server as you go to use it.

13
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.750
Another great option is Docker instances. You could look at using

14
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.040
Amazon EC2 or Azure services to spin up thread instances of those

15
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.140
operating systems as you need them.

16
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.540
So the way these work is they will be loaded on demand. It

17
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.170
takes a little bit longer for your test, and you only pay on

18
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.030
the CPU cycles that you use.

19
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.510
And then if you really wanted to get super sophisticated,

20
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.870
you could actually set up a Cloud Foundry instance for your testing environment

21
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.520
where you're procuring your own cloud instances as you need them in your own

22
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.740
cloud that you've built for your own QA environment.

23
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.300
A lot of work using your old Cloud Foundry, but if you have

24
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:20.000
some very serious heavyweight QA testing framework needs that you're trying to set up, it really is a great option.
