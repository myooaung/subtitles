00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.520
We covered quite a bit in this module.

2
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.290
We went through record and playback testing. We explored the

3
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.660
generated Selenese and spoke about how we're going to use that in

4
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.440
our web driver functionality going forward.

5
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.590
We also used assert and verify to make sure that we were getting what

6
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.590
we were expecting from our tests and whether we wanted it to halt or

7
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.770
to continue on and just report on it.

8
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.010
And then from there, we went through an exported our code and

9
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.780
showed how we can do that to save a test for future use and

10
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.840
hand it off to somebody else.

11
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.240
And finally, we went through and did some of the debugging to show

12
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.400
that we want to go through and use relative paths rather than

13
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:54.000
absolute paths so that we can export that test for different environments and use that going forward.
