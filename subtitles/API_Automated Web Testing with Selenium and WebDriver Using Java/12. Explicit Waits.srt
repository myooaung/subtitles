00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,980
In the first release of this course,

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,640
we had an image navigation that didn't show up right away,

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,740
and we had to use what was called an implicit wait.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,300
Google Images has since changed their navigation,

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,390
as well as the WebDriver API,

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,970
but we could still use a wait to verify an image is,

7
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,020
in fact, there before proceeding.

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,340
An implicit wait sets a global setting for our driver so that every

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,610
single time that we select an element on that page,

10
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,450
it's going to wait for that to time out if it can't find that element.

11
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:30,630
Under the covers,

12
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:36,540
it's actually pulling the DOM every 500 ms to see if that element exists yet.

13
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,890
Now that's useful, but it has a little bit of overhead,

14
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,300
and it can slow things down when you're writing complex tests.

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,810
We're going to look at an explicit wait as an alternative to an

16
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,180
implicit because it can be more performant.

17
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,440
The implicit wait will delay on every element of the page

18
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,790
where we have more fineâ€‘grained control over the explicit

19
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:57,160
wait, Whichever way you go is fine.

20
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,140
I just prefer to use explicit wait because I want to specifically call out when

21
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,900
something is dynamic and should be available right away. And when something

22
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,410
isn't dynamic, when it should be available slower,

23
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,500
I want it to fail fast.

24
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:19,000
I don't want to wait for 10 seconds or however long for a timeout. Let's look at how we can do this inside of our code and use an explicit wait.
