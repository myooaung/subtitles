00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.260
Our last test ended with us finishing our test on this page where we can

2
00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.040
see the search results of the keys that were entered.

3
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.590
I'm going to go ahead and modify our script to make it a little more advanced

4
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.650
where we get this images link and click on it and look at the first image

5
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.230
that's associated with it or verify that it is there.

6
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:30.740
Let's go ahead and switch back over to our IDE and modify our test to grab this.

7
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.380
I'm going to make our page full screen here for a

8
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.940
minute just to add this text in.

9
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.040
Let's give ourselves some whitespace at the bottom of our current test.

10
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.000
I'm going to grab another WebElement.

11
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.250
So I'm going to say WebElement, and it's the imagesLink, and

12
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.030
we're going to say driver.findElements.

13
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.710
Now, remember the driver is going to be referenced

14
00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.490
from where your current location is.

15
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:05.830
So you have to build upon it step by step. We want to grab our next element by

16
00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:12.740
linkText, and the linkText is going to be images. And that text is

17
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.940
case‑sensitive and exactly how it is spelled on that page.

18
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.490
So once we have that,

19
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.820
let's just go ahead and grab the first one, and it's a zero‑based index.

20
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:33.540
So we'll say .get(0). And then that images link, let's click it.

21
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.760
Let's save that.

22
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.640
I'll exit out of full screen.

23
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.220
Let's run that test again and see if it pulls that browser page up

24
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.240
and navigate through to how we just did manually.

25
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.670
And just as we expected,

26
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.550
the test ran and executed and came back with the search results of

27
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.940
the images just like we thought it would do.

28
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.020
It is really interesting to see how you have to build upon those

29
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.990
elements and use that second findElements link to return a WebElement

30
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.700
that you can click on. But you can see how you navigate through those

31
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.470
pages and can search upon various things.

32
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.190
So we've already seen how we grab a field by name and do a partial link

33
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:25.000
text search or a full link text search, they're identical, and then how we can click the Enter button by sending keys as well.
