1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:05,100
Let's create another HTML page in our application by right‑clicking on src,

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,640
main, webapp and selecting New, HTML File.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:14,150
We'll call this TableTest.html.

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:20,300
And inside of here, we're going to give it a title of Table Test.

5
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:27,040
And in the body, I'm going to add a table with a tr and,

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,900
inside of that, a td for table 1,

7
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:35,280
row 1 and inside a second td another nested table to

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,260
demonstrate our navigation of nested tables with a tr td

9
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,340
for row 1 and a tr td for row 2.

10
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,040
Now from here, let's go ahead and create our WebDriver test.

11
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:54,550
I'm going to right‑click on our com.pluralsight package underneath src,

12
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:55,710
main, java.

13
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,840
Say Java class.

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,300
And I'll call this WebDriverTables.

15
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,460
Hit Enter.

16
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,440
And like we have on our previous tests,

17
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,650
I'm going to grab that public static void main and

18
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:20,440
WebDriver from another test and copy over here.

19
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,970
Make sure we get our closing curly brace inside of here.

20
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:36,940
And let's change that path to our new TableTest.html and save that.

21
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,660
Now we're going to step through this programmatically,

22
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:44,730
and you'll see it's just not that complex for us to grab all of the

23
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,970
pieces that we need and display them to the screen.

24
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,680
Let's grab the first WebElement,

25
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:56,620
and we'll name this OuterTable. And that is equal to

26
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:04,700
driver.findElement, and we'll do that by tag name. And the tag

27
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,650
name that we'll pass in there is just table because that's what

28
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:12,300
our outer table is named. From this element,

29
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:18,240
we can go ahead and do a findElement on it. So we'll say WebElement

30
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:28,140
innerTable, and that is equal to outerTable.findElement.

31
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:41,700
And we'll also do a By.tagName on it, and that one is also named table.

32
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:48,170
Then, from the innerTable, we can say WebElement row =

33
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:55,240
innerTable.findElements. We'll do that plural, and we'll do that

34
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:03,550
by tag name, and its tag name is td. And let's just grab the

35
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:08,240
first one or the one‑based index.

36
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,380
Technically, it would be the second one. And we'll say

37
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:24,440
System.out.println, and we'll print out that row's text.

38
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,930
So since those lists are zero‑based,

39
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:31,200
grabbing the index of 1 will get us that second value. And

40
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,490
based off of our HTML, that should get us a table 2, row 2

41
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:39,540
and print that out to our console.

42
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:45,500
Let's right‑click on this main and say run WebDriverTables.main, and

43
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,110
it'll open up our browser, but it'll also dump out that value to our

44
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,340
console. And you can see at the bottom of our console, we have table 2,

45
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,470
row 2. I can show you the web page, but it's not doing anything

46
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,270
interaction‑wise based off of it.

47
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:04,870
We're just showing you how you can grab that tag of the table and

48
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:09,330
then the tag of the innerTable and then the tag of the rows and

49
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:14,700
grabbing that one at position 1, which is the second position, and

50
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:20,000
displaying that text to the screen. Let's see what this looks like using XPath now.
