00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.190
In this module,

2
00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.110
we ended up covering some of the more advanced usage of WebDriver.

3
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.460
We saw how to handle a lot of the various HTML elements,

4
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.640
such as radio buttons, checkboxes, select items,

5
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:18.530
tables and nested tables, and XPath, the advanced usage of that to

6
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.240
navigate through that nested instance of tables.

7
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.230
And then we wrapped up showing the usage of an explicit versus implicit wait

8
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.620
and how to add that implicit wait inside of our application.

9
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.000
Next,

10
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
we're going to talk about Selenium Server and how we can use it to remote execute our tests.
