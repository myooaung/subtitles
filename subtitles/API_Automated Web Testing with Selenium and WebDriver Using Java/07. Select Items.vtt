Select items are a little bit more complex than some of the other ones that

2
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.810
we've looked at here because it's actually nested elements.

3
00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.920
You have an outer select element, and then you have

4
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.440
the nested element options tags.

5
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.980
There's a couple of ways that we can do this,

6
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.870
but I'm going to show you an easy way.

7
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.550
The non easy way would be as if we got this select element first. And then

8
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.070
from there, we would select elements inside it to get all the options, and

9
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.400
then we selected that option that we wanted.

10
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.160
That's not extremely difficult, but we can use another library in

11
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.990
Selenium in order to make this even easier so that we can select

12
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:43.000
by value or by text quite easily. Let's go ahead and see how we can do that.
