00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,090
Let's plan out another test.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,530
I'm going to have our framework open up our pluralsight.com

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:11,180
page again. Scroll to the bottom of the page and find the

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:15,140
link for Authors. Select it,

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:22,710
go to the search page, and type in an author's name. Hit Enter and then

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:28,520
select that one and verify that we are on this page bio looking at some

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:34,670
text that is only existent on this author's page. We'll do so by using a

8
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:43,000
combination of the Selenium IDE and WebDriver API to build this into our page object model.
