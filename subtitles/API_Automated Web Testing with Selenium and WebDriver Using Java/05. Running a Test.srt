1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,640
Now that we have our server set up and ready to go,

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,740
let's change our test so that it will run against that server instance.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,470
We want to start off by‑‑‑ I'm going to make this full

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,340
screen so you can see it a little easier.

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,610
We want to comment out that WebDriver because we're

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:18,160
not running it locally anymore.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,940
We're going to create a new WebDriver.

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:25,290
But before we do that, I also need to set up some Chrome options.

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:32,780
And to do that, I'm going to say ChromeOptions chromeOptions = new ChromeOptions.

10
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,620
We are going to just accept the defaults.

11
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,990
This is the place where you could specify a specific version that

12
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,620
you wanted to see or some other attributes,

13
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,150
but we're good with just the defaults.

14
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:54,400
Now we will say WebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver.

15
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,190
And here is where it gets a little bit different.

16
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,970
So we'll say new URL.

17
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:08,290
And inside of here, we need to pass in our URL to our server,

18
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:23,540
and that is http://localhost:4444/wd/hub.

19
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:29,870
This is the default address and configuration by Selenium

20
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,320
for when you start up Selenium Server.

21
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,570
So these are their parameters. Don't be thinking that you missed where we

22
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,590
specify this. We didn't. This is what they have set up by default.

23
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,180
We will show you how to override this,

24
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,450
but this is the default URL. Now the other thing we need to do is

25
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:52,260
pass in our chromeOptions and close that line.

26
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:56,020
Now before we continue on here, you'll see that there's a red

27
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:00,250
underline underneath the URL, and that's because there's the

28
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,480
chance for it to throw an exception.

29
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,460
I'm just going to do the hot fix of add the exception to the method

30
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:12,640
signature. Save that, and now we have everything configured here to

31
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,840
actually run our test. I'm going to exit full screen mode.

32
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,240
Right‑click on our main and say Run.

33
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,590
And this will now go out and contact our server and run it, and I'm going

34
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:31,600
to show you two different things. So our test is running just fine. First,

35
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,960
we want to verify that our test did actually run, which looking at our

36
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:40,480
browser window that pulled up, it did. And you may notice a slight change

37
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,010
in behavior in that your browser window is no longer popping up to the

38
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,660
front of your screen when you're running it, and that's because we are

39
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:51,210
running that through the Selenium Server and not just our local instance.

40
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:54,040
So it may stay behind windows for you now.

41
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,840
Now let's also go over and look at the terminal.

42
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,000
The terminal shows a lot of information here that will be valuable for you

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,060
maybe troubleshooting some things. And it's going through and just showing

44
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,870
you what the capabilities are of this test. You can see that we passed in

45
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,300
those chromeOptions. We took the defaults,

46
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,740
but you can specify some unique characteristics for your test.

47
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,560
And you can see the communication that took place here.

48
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,720
So it's really good to look at all three.

49
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:28,210
Look at your IDE output, look at your test to see that it ran in your browser,

50
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:33,620
but also look at the terminal window to see if anything popped out

51
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,320
of there that looks uncharacteristically odd.

52
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,790
Everything here looks good.

53
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,010
It is a bunch of noise,

54
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:48,000
but there's nothing like an exception or a stack trace that was thrown on this page to show you that something abnormal happened.
