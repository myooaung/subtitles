00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,840
How do you guarantee that you don't ship software with bugs in your application?

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,680
Or better yet,

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,780
how do you know that you haven't broken something else while trying

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,740
to fix an identified bug inside your application?

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,330
Testing, regression testing,

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:18,060
and automated testing are all things that Selenium and WebDriver can help

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,440
you with in ensuring that you deliver quality software.

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,100
Hello,

9
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,150
I'm Bryan Hansen, and welcome to my course on Automated Web

10
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:29,040
Testing with Selenium and WebDriver Using Java.

11
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,170
In this course, we're going to be learning about the

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,170
web testing framework Selenium.

13
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,640
We are then going to learn about the Selenium IDE, a tool

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,670
that we use inside of our browser that allows us to record

15
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,540
scripts and play them back.

16
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,550
This is a great foundation for us to then transfer to using

17
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,000
WebDriver tests in which we can write tests and automated

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,140
tests using Java for our browser.

19
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:55,030
Once we have a solid base of WebDriver, we'll learn about more advanced

20
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,240
techniques such as Selenium Server and parallel and remote execution of tests,

21
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,950
and all of this wraps up with us creating an automation framework and

22
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:11,000
reporting on tests that we run in that framework. Let's get started by first looking at a simple Selenium test.
