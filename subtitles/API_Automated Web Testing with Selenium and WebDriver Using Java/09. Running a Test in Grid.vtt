00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.140
To run our test, we actually don't even have to change anything.

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.910
We just reference the hub,

3
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.220
and the hub selects the correct routing based off of the

4
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.400
options or configurations that we pass into it.

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.890
So we could say we want a specific version or those types of things.

6
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.150
Let's first just run our test.

7
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:27.540
I'm going to right‑click on our main method and say Run WebDriverMain.

8
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.680
It fires up and runs. It does everything that it should and exits

9
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.440
the test exactly how we would expect it to.

10
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.920
It's the same test we've seen run 100 times.

11
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.240
I'm going to show you a couple of different changes though, and that is that

12
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.780
ChromeOptions were new as of about a year ago, give or take.

13
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.200
They switched it from Desired Capability.

14
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.350
So it's not really a new concept, but rather ChromeOptions,

15
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.630
FirefoxOptions, IEOptions.

16
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.070
They set out specific options for each browser

17
00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.280
because they're a little bit different.

18
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.040
So we could come in here and, for example, say

19
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:12.840
ChromeOptions will add the options of .addArguments. And

20
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.320
inside of here, we just pass in a string,

21
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:25.920
and we can say that we want it to start‑maximized. Close that

22
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.270
quote and close that line. And when we run it now, it'll go

23
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.430
through and drive our test differently.

24
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.530
So if I fire it up,

25
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.210
it's going to start that browser in a maximized fashion and run it from there.

26
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.410
So different characteristics that you can do. You can run it in

27
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.980
incognito mode, headless. You can disable any extensions. You can

28
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.900
disable pop‑up blocking. There's some various attributes you can pass

29
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.030
through there. And some of those arguments are sent to the hub, and the

30
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.990
hub figures out which that machine is registered to execute on. And

31
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.000
that's why having that hub set up with various test clients or nodes is a great option.
