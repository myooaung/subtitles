00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.450
Let's go through the commands that were generated by

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.780
the Selenium IDE in our last test.

3
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.770
You'll see all the commands that we have in this associated IDE

4
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.260
window and their targets and subsequent values.

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.990
The first one that's out there is the open command.

6
00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.330
You can see that here. It's on line 1 inside of our IDE. And

7
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.730
the target for that is a forward slash.

8
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.020
That's used in conjunction with that base URL from up above,

9
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:38.160
so that https://www.selenium.dev. It appends that slash onto the end

10
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.560
of that, so that's a combination of those two.

11
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.710
The next one in there isn't really that impressive.

12
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.050
It's a set window size command, and that's just because we have

13
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.420
a specific window size inside of our test.

14
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.250
And it's saying that mine, for example, is 1086 x 1077.

15
00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.340
Theoretically, we could actually delete that command, but it's done as part of

16
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.410
our test so that it reformats it the same way each time.

17
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.740
So I leave it there for just the sake of making it easier to see

18
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.510
what's going on because I have these two windows tiled side by

19
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.210
side. But the next one is a click command.

20
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.440
That click command has a target,

21
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.380
which if we select it will say CSS is equal to

22
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.640
.nav‑item:nth‑child with a selection of 1.

23
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.750
Now why this is important is if we right‑click on this

24
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.640
particular command and say play to this point,

25
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.400
it'll open up our window,

26
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:47.490
navigate to clicking this item, and I can take over from here. Choose that

27
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:54.440
nav item, and this is where it's now popped up that menu.

28
00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.420
One problem or possible error‑prone thing to point out is

29
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.990
that it is selecting the first element.

30
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.950
So if they reorganize their menu structure and say they put About at the end,

31
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.660
which honestly wouldn't be an odd place for it to be.

32
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.040
A lot of sites are set up that way with their navigation.

33
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.760
If we move this around,

34
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.060
we are looking for the first element in those parentheses.

35
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.620
So nth‑child and a parentheses of 1, it's referring

36
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.150
to this first menu item structure.

37
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.490
The next command below that where we click that linkTextAbout is

38
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.520
referring to the one down in this menu here.

39
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.240
So if we go back over to our IDE and click Play,

40
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:49.710
it'll go through and click on the linkText equal to About, and I

41
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.890
didn't have a breakpoint set to where it would stop it, but you can

42
00:02:52.890 --> 00:03:00.090
see where it picks up based off that nth item selection of 1. And the

43
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.040
next piece in there is that linkText equal to About. So as it's going

44
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.670
through our menu structure, it's saying,

45
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.380
well, let's go to About. And if we inspect that element,

46
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:17.730
we can see what it's referring to here that there is this nav item. It's a

47
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.700
little tough to see. It gets lost in this HTML pretty easy.

48
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:32.120
There is a div class nav item, and it has the linkText inside of here of

49
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:40.470
About, and that's what that click CSS nav‑item:nth‑child(1) is referring to,

50
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.970
and then the link text itself of About is what this span that we're

51
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.600
highlighting right now is referring to as well.

52
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.950
From there, it will go to the same thing, which is another linkText of News.

53
00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:02.000
And then when we're finally there, we will assert that that text is equal to what we're expecting to land on.
