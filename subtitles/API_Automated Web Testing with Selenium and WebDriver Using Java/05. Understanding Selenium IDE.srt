The selenium IDE is called an IDE,

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:08,340
but it isn't maybe what you have envisioned as an IDE.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,390
As I mentioned earlier,

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,270
I was expecting to install something similar to Eclipse or

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,500
IntelliJ, but it's really a browser extension.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,810
Why call it an IDE though? That's because it's used to

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,800
record what you're doing inside the browser.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,930
Recording will effectively trace each step of what we want to do on a web

9
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:32,660
page. While recording, it will generate Selenese, or basically the script

10
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,000
of things that you did while in record mode.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,740
The script is referred to as Selenese.

12
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:44,040
It really isn't a dialect, but more of a cobbled together bunch of commands.

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,810
Once we have our Selenese,

14
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:50,050
we can then play that script and it will have automated the tests that we did

15
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,620
on our page or even multiple pages to get to that point.

16
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,080
This type of testing is often referred to as record and

17
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,840
playback testing, or clickthrough testing.

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,000
Let's look at recording our interactions on a page. Now
