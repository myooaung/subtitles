00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,060
You're now beginning to see how we can use the Selenium

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:10,900
IDE to go ahead and create pieces of our test to

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,570
incorporate back into our framework.

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:18,180
We could go ahead and start up a test using the IDE here,

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,520
like we've done all along.

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,770
And the Selenium IDE can help us gather things that we

7
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,690
want to add into our test framework.

8
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:29,620
So, for example,

9
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:35,130
I could scroll down through pluralsight.com and click on Authors,

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,210
and I can see it's starting to build stuff out for us.

11
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,460
I've already got the click for linkText=Authors.

12
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:47,340
I can do various things like start to work with the search field

13
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,890
and enter in Bryan Hansen and search on it,

14
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,840
and it's building out this case for me on the right.

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,030
I can stop that, give it a name, I can even wait till later to give it the name,

16
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:10,350
and export out that code as we learned before and,

17
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,620
in turn,

18
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:19,820
open that up and now see what I would like to add inside of

19
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,660
our WebDriver framework that we're creating.

20
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,150
So I've got all of these pieces here,

21
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:28,640
and I don't need to copy and paste this exactly in my WebDriver.

22
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,550
We would now start going through and add this to our Browser object

23
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:38,440
and our Pages objects so that we can navigate through and use these

24
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:43,170
driver.findElements or manage and that type of stuff inside of our

25
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:49,000
code base that we're creating, That's how we can use those two in conjunction with one another.
