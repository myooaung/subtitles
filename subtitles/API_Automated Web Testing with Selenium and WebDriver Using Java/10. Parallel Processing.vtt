00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.870
One thing we didn't look at is doing parallel execution,

2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.530
and that's because it's really not part of Selenium

3
00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.920
or the Grid framework itself.

4
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.530
It's a little bit confusing to some when they are expecting

5
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.870
that if they use Grid that their tests will just

6
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.360
automatically be executed in parallel.

7
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.290
And that's not necessarily the case. You have to do

8
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.940
something to make that happen.

9
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.240
So for example,

10
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.100
let's say that we wanted to run 10 test cases at a time, and maybe we

11
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.710
had 1,000 test cases or so, we would need to, in that way that we run

12
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.940
our tests, set up parallel execution.

13
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.190
So in our solution, in our IDE perhaps, we would spin off threads,

14
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.090
and we would run our threads. They are all hitting that same hub, and

15
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.280
that hub can execute them in parallel.

16
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.010
But we are actually controlling the parallelization of our tests at the

17
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.750
level where we are running them or where the driver of the test is. We can

18
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.040
cover that detail more when we get into frameworks,

19
00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:01.000
but basically, you are responsible for parallel execution. The grid makes it possible, but you have to initiate it.
