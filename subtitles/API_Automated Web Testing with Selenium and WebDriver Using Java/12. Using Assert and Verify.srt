1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,380
We've already shown an assert text because we had that up above,

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,180
but we haven't done a verify,

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,480
and we haven't shown what happens when an assertion fails.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:16,200
Let's begin by adding a verify to this test first and

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,110
show what happens in a failure on that.

6
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:18,890
To do so,

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,360
I'm going to click below our commands and hit the

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,940
record button to start recording,

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,140
and you can see we automatically get a icon flashing in our

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,310
browser telling us that it's recording.

11
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:35,370
And we can come over here inside of here and say Selenium IDE,

12
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,440
Verify, and let's just verify the title.

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,940
Now we have a verified title for beta, and I can stop this test.

14
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:51,020
And instead of running the entire test each time,

15
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:57,240
I'm just going to click on the command above it and say play from here.

16
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:02,660
That's just one quick way to go through and see how that's going to run.

17
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,460
You have to go through the entire test harness each time.

18
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,980
Let's change that though to see what it does when we have something incorrect.

19
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:16,230
So let's add bbbeta and run it from there again.

20
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:20,240
So I'm going to go a command above there and say play from here.

21
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,240
And you can see that we have a failure, and it's highlighted that line in red.

22
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:24,960
Well that's great,

23
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,810
but we don't know if the test will continue going if we hit a

24
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,470
verification error or what happens from there.

25
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:42,440
So let's actually go up to our assert text and say play to this point.

26
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:47,080
It's going to go through and run our test down to that command,

27
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,640
and we have our assertion here.

28
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,690
We're going to assert text, and we have the target.

29
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,450
We have the value.

30
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:00,030
Let's change that and just make another spelling error inside of here. And so

31
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:07,930
we'll say PPPublic and run this test. And as we get on here,

32
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:11,840
you'll see it's hit that and it's failed.

33
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,340
Let's change that text back so that it will continue to run

34
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,270
and go through and run to this point again.

35
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:27,120
So we'll say play to this point. That will stop on our

36
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:35,790
assert text. And from here, we can stop the execution and

37
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,140
say that we want to record from here.

38
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,090
So it'll go through and do the same thing.

39
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:46,240
It'll pause at that assertion again and will ask us if we want to

40
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,970
start recording. We'll say yeah, let's go ahead and start

41
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:53,160
recording. And we can verify the text here.

42
00:02:53,160 --> 00:03:00,050
So we'll say Selenium IDE, Verify, Text. And it will come

43
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:03,890
in here and say that for that verification, we have this

44
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:08,540
option of looking for this text.

45
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:14,440
We can change this to Thursday. Add a couple of Ts. And

46
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,910
let's run this whole thing over again.

47
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,550
We'll see this verify fail, but the test will continue to

48
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:21,260
run and just report at the end of it that it's failed. So

49
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,340
we need to stop recording.

50
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:30,700
Run that test again.

51
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,810
The assertion will succeed. The verify will fail, but it will continue to run.

52
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:43,000
The assertion stopped us, and the verify allowed us to continue and just reported the error at the end of the test.
