00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.360
Now that we have our hub up and running and our first node up

2
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.210
and running, I'm going to show you how to set up a second node.

3
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.060
And the command is almost identical.

4
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.650
We're going to go through and reuse that same command that we had before,

5
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:27.210
java ‑jar selenium‑server‑standalone‑3.141.59.jar ‑role node ‑hub.

6
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.480
The only difference I'm going to make is I am going to

7
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.780
specify a port so that there aren't any port collisions

8
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.250
with the other server instance.

9
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.010
So I'm going to say ‑port 5556, and hit Enter. And now it

10
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.540
launched a server, and I have forced a port.

11
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.080
So by doing so, I should be able to switch back to my hub, and I can see that I

12
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.400
have another instance up and running. And if I switch over to my browser, this

13
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.610
is what it looked like before the refresh. And after the refresh, you can see

14
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.240
that I have two instances up and running.

15
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.190
The one thing to note on the differences between these two is that

16
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:12.120
on the second instance, we forced the port of :5556 on that so

17
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.290
that we don't have address collisions.

18
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.530
They've since cleaned it up to where it's pretty good about identifying that,

19
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.290
but that's how you can specifically set the port that you would like it to

20
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.120
run on so it's consistent each time that you run it. We now have our hub up

21
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.780
and running and our two server instances set up.

22
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.320
You could have it running on a completely separate machine

23
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.680
because it does it all based off of IP address and have an

24
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.410
entire grid setup of Linux, Windows,

25
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:49.000
Mac, whatever various operating systems and browser configurations you want set up and running.
