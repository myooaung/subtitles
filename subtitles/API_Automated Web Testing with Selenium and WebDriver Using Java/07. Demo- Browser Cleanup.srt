00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,970
You may have noticed after our last test and the previous tests that we've done,

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:09,540
when we're done executing it, it leaves our browser window open.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,900
Well, we've already written most of the code to clean this up.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,510
Let's add this to our unit tests,

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:17,590
and we can be a good steward of cleaning up after ourselves.

6
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:22,440
To do this, we're going to say @AfterAll,

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:34,390
and we're going to say public static void cleanUp, and

8
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:40,440
we'll say Browser.close and save that.

9
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,840
And now when we run our test, it will go through at the

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,540
end of it and clean up after ourselves.

11
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:57,000
It goes through and successfully completes our test. And when it's finished, it closes that out.
