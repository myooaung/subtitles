1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,640
Now that we're getting started on our favorites feature, one of the important concepts that we need

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,360
to come back to is the concept of services.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,700
So far, we've we've used services to mock API calls to external services like Google, but services

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,550
extend way beyond the fold of just that.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,540
In essence, with our service folder, it has everything to do with our interaction of data.

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,390
Right.

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,900
Data is what flows into the application and flows back out of the application.

8
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:38,660
And services are that layer that communicate with the data.

9
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:46,170
We don't want data all across our application being muddied in terms of where we call in request data

10
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,110
and retrieve data.

11
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:52,200
No, we want a nice shell around how we work with data.

12
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,300
And so services are that show.

13
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:59,880
Now, when we get into the concept of services, obviously we have our service, our mark in our context

14
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:11,540
and the context is there to provide the glue between what is react and what is the actual data transmission.

15
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:11,900
Right.

16
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:19,950
The API call in the transform we do against the data is one layer of requesting data, but the other

17
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,880
layer is how do we get that into the react ecosystem?

18
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,130
And so we decided that context was going to be that way.

19
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,980
Now, when we talk about our favorites, our favorites are basically also a service.

20
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:41,310
Now, whether we decide to store them locally or store them externally on a server, on a database or

21
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:47,670
whatever, at the end of the day, it's data that we're interacting with that may eventually become

22
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,940
an external concern.

23
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,930
So when we talk about it as a service, we have our favorites service.

24
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:01,120
But our favorite service is a bit different than the other services that we've created so far in the

25
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:07,750
sense that we're used to having a mock, a service and a context, in this case, we're going to be

26
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,610
storing our favorites locally.

27
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,330
So in that case, what we're going to start by doing is we're going to start by building the context.

28
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:19,180
So we're going to have a favourite's context.

29
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,470
Yes.

30
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:24,780
And this is going to kind of be where we focus all of our efforts.

31
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,660
So as with all of our services so far and all of our context, we're going to import, react from react.

32
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:38,350
And what we're going to do here is we're going to also import the all important to create context.

33
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:47,720
Now, what we need to define here is export const favourite's context, and that's going to be equal

34
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:54,420
to create context, which is going to be the context that is going to hold the favorites.

35
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:02,930
Now, as with everything, we're going to export a const favourite's context provider, which is going

36
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:11,570
to be the one that wraps the tree or the app is in order for us to be able to supply the favorites to

37
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,040
the tree of react.

38
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:22,670
And inside of there, we're going to say favorite context dot provider, and then we're going to close

39
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,710
that off thought provider.

40
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:33,260
And inside of here, we're obviously going to render our children, which are going to come from the

41
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,060
props of the component.

42
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:41,090
Now that we have this, what we can do is we have our baseline.

43
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:50,170
And so when we talk about favourite's, well, our favorite context needs to keep track of our favorites

44
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,410
and our favorites are basically the restaurants.

45
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,230
So the restaurant data is what it's going to store.

46
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:04,780
So we're going to import you state and you state is going to have CONSED favorites and a set favorites

47
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,230
function.

48
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:11,910
This is going to be equal to you state of an empty array, because we do not have favorites when we

49
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,570
put the up.

50
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:20,860
And each time a user decides that they want to interact and add a favorite, we need to set up something

51
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,680
to add and remove favorites.

52
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,610
So let's say const add is equal to adding a restaurant.

53
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,940
So we're adding a restaurant to our favorites.

54
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:38,140
And this is going to equal the process of doing set favorites of the current favorites.

55
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:48,350
Plus, the new restaurant that is going to be the process that is followed by the add function, now,

56
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:52,610
if we go look at our remove function, the remove function is going to look a little something like

57
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:53,000
this.

58
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,800
It's going to take in the restaurant that we want to remove.

59
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,690
And what it's going to do is a bit more involved.

60
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:11,180
It's going to do CONSED New Favorites is Favourite's Filter and it's going to check the restaurant by

61
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:17,720
Placide against the other restaurants in the favorites.

62
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:23,300
So the current favorites have all of the restaurants and we're filtering seeing if the police I.D. matches

63
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,040
do not add.

64
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:32,870
We could do something similar to this where we said if it is equal, don't add.

65
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:41,070
Now, that logic is going to be left for the outside, now we need to provide our provider with the

66
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:47,040
value that it's going to provide externally, and that value is very important for us because it is

67
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,460
the shape that is going to go to the outside of the component.

68
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,220
So first of all, we're going to provide favourite's and then we're going to say add to favorites is

69
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,110
going to be equal to our add function.

70
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:04,680
Remove from favourite's is going to be our remove function, and that's basically it.

71
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,830
These are the three methods that are going to be part of our favorites context.

72
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,220
It's very simple, very straightforward.

73
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,140
And so now let's go look at how we hook it up.
