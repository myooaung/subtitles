Hey, hey, Mo, here, before we get to building this feature around the menu and the menu list and

2
00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:13.330
the items that will go into there before we get to any of that, we currently have one small issue,

3
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.160
our navigation.

4
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:21.400
The way that we've set it up, the way that we navigate between screens isn't set up for scale.

5
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.600
It just isn't right now.

6
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.050
So before we get to building this out, I'm going to quickly pause this feature and then the following

7
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.440
videos.

8
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:37.090
What you're going to see is us optimizing the code for the navigation in order for us to build out this

9
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.000
feature more properly.

10
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.790
So in the following videos, don't be scared that you see us pivot away from this feature, because

11
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.980
what we need to do is optimize what we've built already so that we can build this in the best way possible.
