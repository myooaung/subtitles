00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:06.740
So as you just went through the process of registering and logging into GitHub, we're back in Visual

2
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.910
Studio Code.

3
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:17.330
And what I want us to do next is I want us to be able to go take our code and look at it on GitHub dot

4
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.740
com, because that is the outcome that we want to see.

5
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.810
We want to see our code somewhere on GitHub.

6
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.120
All right.

7
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.300
So how do we go about that?

8
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:32.479
Well, if we press these three dots over here, we can say push and we can say push to.

9
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:41.560
And it says your repository has no remotes configured to push so Persad remote and then will press add

10
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.730
remote from GitHub.

11
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.910
So if we click that the extension GitHub wants to sign into GitHub, allow.

12
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.960
And so authorize visual studio code to access GitHub, if you have initiated this authorization for

13
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.710
Visual Studio Code, click continue.

14
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.160
So we're going to click continue because we did this.

15
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.290
So now we're going to say authorize GitHub for VOST code and what it wants to do is it wants to read

16
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.440
all public and private repositories, huh?

17
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.640
All right, so let's go see.

18
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.440
Authorizing or redirect you to.

19
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.580
There, so why can't I click this button?

20
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.300
What's what's going on here?

21
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.030
Well, what's going on here is potentially a bug with.

22
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:40.260
Edge, so if you see something like this happen, make sure that you have other options out there.

23
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.800
So what we're going to do here is we're going to install Google Chrome and with Google Chrome, we're

24
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:53.600
going to try this process again, because as you can see here, we're not able to click authorizer right

25
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.270
here, which is very painful.

26
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.410
So make sure that you have your options.

27
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.050
And I'm going to go through the process of going through Google Chrome, and I'll be right back.

28
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.290
All right.

29
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.580
So I have Google Chrome installed.

30
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.979
And as you can see, even I as the instructor, when I'm setting up a new computer, I can run into

31
00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.940
issues and it's about finding solutions.

32
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.920
So now that we have Google Chrome installed, you may not need to do this.

33
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.440
If you already have Google Chrome, then go through that.

34
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.290
But we may want to set our default browser.

35
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.350
So choose a default browser and then we'll go inside of here and we'll say, hey, our default browser

36
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.170
is going to be Google Chrome and that's going to be that.

37
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.530
And now we're going to go to get hub dot com and we're going to go through the process of logging in

38
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.910
again.

39
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.200
So sign in and we're going to fill in Mopani and we're going to fill in our password again.

40
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.690
So we're going to use our Two-Factor key.

41
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.390
We're going to hit Verify.

42
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.010
And now we're logged into GitHub again.

43
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.000
OK, so over here, we're going to go through this process again.

44
00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.620
We're going to go over here, we're going to say Pushtu.

45
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.100
No remotes configured at a remote.

46
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.620
We're going to say ad from GitHub.

47
00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:13.700
And now what we need to do is we need to copy this link and we need to put it inside of Chrome because

48
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.700
it didn't go there.

49
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.940
Now, as you can see.

50
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.760
Green button.

51
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.470
Not a green button, so some browsers may have bugs, so let's authorize GitHub.

52
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.560
Oh, no, an error occurred.

53
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.790
Please restart to sign in from the editor.

54
00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.470
OK, so let's do that.

55
00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:37.540
Let's exit out of all of this and let's restart Visual Studio code for good measure.

56
00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:39.490
So let's go back here.

57
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.820
And as you can see, all of these issues can occur.

58
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.840
It's completely normal.

59
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:52.410
Now, let's go back into source control and let's go over here and let's say push to.

60
00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.210
Let's add the remote again, let's add it from GitHub, let's allow the Sinon process and now it's going

61
00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:00.170
to open with Chrome.

62
00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:06.110
So you can see I try to step where I tried to copy paste the existing new URL from somewhere else.

63
00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.950
Didn't work.

64
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:13.470
So make sure that you restart the process if you see this error where the button didn't work.

65
00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:21.410
So let's hit continue here and it's going to say allow and we're going to say open visual studio code

66
00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.220
and so allow an extension to open this story.

67
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.670
So let's open that.

68
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:27.670
And there we go.

69
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.230
OK, so now I have access to all of my repositories on GitHub.

70
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.020
Now this may be an empty list for you.

71
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.270
This may be a completely empty list.

72
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.320
OK, so now what we want to do is we want to go back to GitHub, right.

73
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.690
Let's go to GitHub dot com.

74
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.380
And what we want to do is we want to create this repository.

75
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:54.520
We'll call it focus time and then we'll add a description focus time app.

76
00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.790
And you can make it public or you can make it private either or let's create that repository write.

77
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.200
And here, let's press escape and then let's say push.

78
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:12.450
To again, at a remote, let's add the remote from GitHub, and it's going to go look and we can see

79
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.100
focus time at the top of the list, the repository that we just created.

80
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.670
So let's add that.

81
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.790
And then let's say while the remote name.

82
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.530
Please enter a remote name.

83
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.830
Well, let's just hit enter oh, we can't just hit enter.

84
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:29.570
Well, then let's call it.

85
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.160
So what do we call it, what do we call it?

86
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:38.800
Well, if we go into GitHub, we can see here that get remote at origin.

87
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.390
So let's just call it origin.

88
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.230
So Origin is going to be where we're pushing our code.

89
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.340
Would you like code to periodically run, get fetch?

90
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.580
You can say yes, you can say no.

91
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.720
It's basically going to periodically go and fetch.

92
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.190
I really don't like this feature.

93
00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.350
So I usually said no.

94
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:03.120
OK, so now that that's done, what we're going to do here is we're going to push.

95
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:04.830
So not push too.

96
00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.370
We can still hit Pushtu and we're going to see origin over here.

97
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.200
So let's push to origin.

98
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.480
And so now it's starting to push, push, push.

99
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:14.570
OK.

100
00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:15.910
Well, it's asking us to sign in.

101
00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:16.690
Didn't we sign it?

102
00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.400
Well, it's signing in our browser.

103
00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:24.720
And it's going to go over here and we're going to authorize get credential manager, remember, during

104
00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.100
the set up, when we look at get credentialed manager, well, it's coming in here, so let's authorise

105
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.860
it successful.

106
00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.430
We may now close this tab and go back to our application.

107
00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:36.100
So what's happening now?

108
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.350
Well, you could see that there was a bar up here doing some stuff.

109
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:41.370
But what happened?

110
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.550
Well, if we go into the focus time, let's hit this again.

111
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.300
Whoa.

112
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:56.470
All of a sudden our code is in here, all of our code, and it has the message, initial entry sample

113
00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:57.160
Snocap.

114
00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.170
Oh, good, good.

115
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.190
We push our code up and it's all visible on GitHub now.

116
00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:04.780
So simple.

117
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:05.800
Right?

118
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.270
But we have to keep in mind all of these simple steps that we needed to go through.

119
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.540
Restarting the flow of one of the browsers has an error.

120
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:20.320
Looking at all of the different things that we needed to do here, we need to add an origin.

121
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.340
We needed to push all new and exciting things.

122
00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:30.310
So if this is new to you, slow this video down and watch it very slowly go through the process of adding

123
00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:32.820
GitHub because it's a key step.

124
00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.330
Now, it is optional.

125
00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.090
You can still go through the course without setting up GitHub.

126
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:40.480
But I want to give you the option of being able to push your code up.

127
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:43.990
You could just as well commit locally and just go that route.

128
00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:47.350
But if you want to push your code up the GitHub, it's up to you.
