00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:10.380
Setting up an Android emulator is a very, very simple thing, but unless you know where to look, it

2
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.250
can be quite a challenge.

3
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.460
So on the screen where it says, welcome to Andrew, we obviously don't have a project yet.

4
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.870
We don't have anything to open.

5
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.450
But we have this little configure button over here.

6
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:28.320
And if we press it, it'll show us all of the different things that we can use in order to configure

7
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.680
Android as an environment.

8
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.640
And if we go look at something called eved manager, that's the Android virtual device manager.

9
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.000
What you're going to see over here, if you spread it out a bit, is that we have a pixel, a pixel

10
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.320
three a already configured.

11
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.380
Now, if you don't have a device configured or something is going wrong, you can also create a virtual

12
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:55.260
device and you can create one to your own specifications, pixel for pixel for Excel.

13
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.900
And so all you have to do is press pixel for.

14
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:06.170
Then you can just go over here and say, OK, what version of Android do I want wanted to run to I want

15
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.800
to run Cupie Orio, all of those different things.

16
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.160
And so if we go over to the 86 images, you can obviously see that we already have the version are downloaded

17
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.200
in 86.

18
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.130
The one over here is a 64 bit above.

19
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.810
So the difference is the ones that you've downloaded don't have the download sign beside them.

20
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.680
So you can go look at different types of images that you could put on it.

21
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.680
You could put Newgate Marshmallow Lollipop, you could test devices with many different versions.

22
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.830
We're going to use the one that we already installed, which is are you going to press next?

23
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.920
And we're going to say, OK, the setup orientation is going to be portrait of that good stuff, you

24
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.580
know, pretty basic.

25
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.070
We're not going to change too much and we're going to finish.

26
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.950
And now we have a pixel four as well.

27
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.000
So we have a pixel three and a pixel four.

28
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.230
Amazing.

29
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.810
And so now that we have our virtual devices.

30
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.340
Well, what's the next step for us?

31
00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:59.900
Well, if we open up.

32
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:09.130
Terminal, so the next step for us is obviously to go back to our project, which was in documents and

33
00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.470
then projects and then inside of there we have focus time.

34
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:23.470
And right now, if we can package Jason, we can see that we have the yarn Android command.

35
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.780
So let's run that yarn android.

36
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.290
And what that's going to do is it's going to start Android, which is going to, in the background,

37
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.170
make sure that it runs the metro bundler.

38
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:43.150
It finds all of the relevant resources it needs and then try to figure out, hey, well, can I actually

39
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.460
run a android?

40
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.340
And then you could see no Android connected device was found.

41
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.530
No emulators could be started automatically.

42
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:58.640
Huh, interesting, so let's go back to Android studio then, because it's clear that we have our emulators,

43
00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.300
but it's not able to start them.

44
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.600
So how do we go about that?

45
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.990
Well, if we go to a manager, we can just press the little button here.

46
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:13.040
And with the play button is going to do is it's going to start our emulator for us to make sure that

47
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:21.230
in the cases where he isn't able to automatically start it or something went wrong, that we have that

48
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.760
control.

49
00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.450
And so it's going to request some things.

50
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.500
We're going to say, OK.

51
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:33.140
And then as the emulator starts up, we'll be in a good position to kind of test out our application.

52
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.500
Over here.

53
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.820
You can see it's still a black screen.

54
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:41.690
Be patient, starting up an Android emulator can be a long process, and it really depends on how fast

55
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.670
it goes based on your system set up like how much ram you have with a processor you're running.

56
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:47.930
So you'll be very patient.

57
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.750
And if you have a local Android device, you can always scan the QR code and run it locally instead

58
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.270
of on the emulator.

59
00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.570
But this is just a possibility in case you do not have an Android device.

60
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:07.600
So let's go ahead and let's control see inside of the manager and let's do an android once more.

61
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.170
And what that's going to do is it's going to reboot the metro bundler.

62
00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:18.800
And if we go over here, it's downloading the client, installing the export a client app on the emulator.

63
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.019
So it clearly found everything it needed.

64
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.080
It found our current emulator that we started.

65
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.290
And so after the installation, what it's going to do is it's going to boot up focus time in the emulator.

66
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.420
And so, as you can see, the emulator has started the app and it's building the JavaScript bundle,

67
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:48.250
just like it did for iOS, and once this bundle has finished building, we have a fully running focus

68
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.500
time locally.

69
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.340
That's amazing.

70
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.260
We can run a both on iOS and Android.

71
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.510
So if you're missing one or the other device and you want to run locally, you don't want to run inside

72
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:04.900
of snap of a snack, you can use these emulators, these virtual devices that run on your computer to

73
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.840
kind of be able to build and run expo without any issues.

74
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:21.730
And as you can see here now, we're able to run our application locally and test it out in a way that

75
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.760
we could on iOS as well.
