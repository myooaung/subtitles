1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:06,320
Don't you just love code clean up, so the intended outcome of this exercise was to take all of our

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:11,720
components that were styled components and take them out of the restaurant card component and put them

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,980
into something called restaurant info card style starches.

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:21,830
And so this is a pattern that is very useful when you're creating style components that are just solely

5
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:23,240
visualisations based.

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,800
Now, you may be asking yourself, well, why are these Dorte styles?

7
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,500
But is text a component?

8
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:38,360
Well, that's because in the text we're adding extra functionality here with kind of these variants

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,820
and these functions inside that that make it a bit smarter.

10
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,720
So that's why it's called it Dow component.

11
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:50,030
And the same is true for a spacer because we're using kind of like this get variant type of interaction

12
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,130
to make it a bit smarter.

13
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,260
So it functions more as a component because it's utilizing props.

14
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:59,180
It's utilizing properties that are given to it to dynamically determine styling.

15
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:06,260
Whereas over here and restaurants up InFocus styles, well, it's just using basically the theme to

16
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,350
colorize and position things.

17
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,550
So we're calling that dot styles.

18
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:15,830
So by putting everything in that styles right, one of the things you may have noticed is you have to

19
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:22,760
move the imports over here and you have to add the export keyword to every single one of these in order

20
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,480
for it to work.

21
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:27,140
And then over here, so much less code in this component.

22
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:33,530
And a nice, nice overview of where we're importing things from and what we're importing and specifically

23
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:39,350
calling them out to be styles right there, styling their components that are positioning things in

24
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,650
the right place on the screen.

25
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,910
So over down here, we can see now.

26
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,290
All right.

27
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,450
Pretty nice overview of very, very basic UI.

28
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,290
Sixty three lines of code.

29
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:57,980
And we have this absolutely, absolutely stunning card component that is going to be utilized throughout

30
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:01,840
the course to create a stunning visual of the app.

31
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:08,630
And so in the next video, now that we've done our cleanup, what we want to do is we want to look at

32
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,740
how to apply this card.

33
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,430
Multiple times we're going to use a list, great, see you in the next one.
