1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:07,640
Last we left it, we were left with this obscure screen, this thing that that came installed would

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,620
get that kind of looks like the Matrix.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,950
Well, first and foremost, I want to tell you, we don't need to use this on windows.

4
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:21,380
If you're a more advanced user and you know how to use command line, go for it.

5
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:25,250
But we installed Visual Studio Code.

6
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:32,689
So let's take a look at how that thing works, because that's what we're going to base all of our knowledge

7
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:32,820
on.

8
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:38,030
OK, so over here, if you go to file, you can say open folder.

9
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:44,720
And if you open the folder to the documents folder and the focus time folder that we said if you select

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,440
that folder, it's going to open up here.

11
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:52,570
Now, what you can see over here is that it opened up focus time at the top.

12
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:58,630
You can see the folder name and then you can see the folders assets, you can see the source folder,

13
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,110
you can see the features folder.

14
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,890
You see the utilities that we need.

15
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,040
You know, all very great stuff.

16
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,470
If we open the app, Gorgias, you can see that it's going to colorize everything and make it nice and

17
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,040
pretty.

18
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,570
And all of our code is here.

19
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,590
Everything we did in our snack is here and now.

20
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,390
Our objective is simple.

21
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,480
Get it to run on windows.

22
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,370
So we're going to do that.

23
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,670
But before we do that, I want to teach you this thing.

24
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:30,350
And so I promised you that I was going to teach you how to use get.

25
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,360
Now, for that, one of the two things we need to do.

26
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:44,000
Is it works with something called repositories, a git repositories kind of like a box, and you're

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,630
going to say like in this box, we're going to keep our code and we're going to keep revisions of our

28
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:47,870
code.

29
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:52,310
So every time we change something, we're going to put a new folder and we're going to see the folder

30
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:55,430
for today is here, the folder for an hour like when I last did.

31
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:55,970
It is here.

32
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,500
The folder for tomorrow is here.

33
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,620
We're going to organize our code in in this git repository.

34
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,050
So if you press this little symbol here, if you hover over it, it's going to say source control.

35
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,430
So we're going to click that.

36
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:12,170
And what that's going to say is the folder that is currently open does not have a git repository.

37
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,150
This folder that we downloaded from XPO Stack is not get enabled.

38
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,940
OK, so what we want to do is we want to initialize it, right, right, right.

39
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,110
So, yeah, we want to initialize it.

40
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,580
So we're going to hit this initialise button.

41
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,250
And what that's going to do is, whoa, what just happened here?

42
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,960
What what is all this?

43
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:42,830
Well, it's showing us everything that changed all of the files that have changed in our folder.

44
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,900
And all of these are green suddenly.

45
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,010
What does green mean.

46
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,840
Green means that they're new.

47
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,970
Green means that they haven't been in our repository yet.

48
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:59,780
It's it's kind of like get is going through everything we've done and saying, I know this or I don't

49
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,290
know this.

50
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,670
It's kind of like an auditor.

51
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:05,000
If you've ever been audited, horrible experience, don't go through it.

52
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:10,340
But what is basically doing is going through all of your files and saying, hey, I haven't seen this

53
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:10,670
before.

54
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,390
What is this?

55
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,170
Is this new?

56
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,310
It's probably new.

57
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,410
I haven't seen this before.

58
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:18,740
So over here you can see it has a little thing called 19.

59
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,920
What does nineteen refer to?

60
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:27,700
Well, it's found 19 files are folders that are new to it that it hasn't tracked yet.

61
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,640
And when we talk about tracking its debt, doesn't know this file.

62
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,980
So it's the very first time that it's seen it.

63
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:38,740
So if it's the very first time that it's seen it, it doesn't have any history yet.

64
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,110
OK, so if we go over here and we look at these 19 files, these 19 changes, what is going to do now

65
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:51,380
is it's going to say we can stage the changes so we can tell get hey, track this or we can undo it

66
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,790
and it's going to remove it.

67
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,910
It's going to say, hey, don't keep this file, remove it.

68
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,410
We don't want to remove anything.

69
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,310
Don't press that.

70
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:04,450
Or at the top here, we can press the pause button, so if we press the button, we can see that there's

71
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,960
this new column over here, stage changes.

72
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:14,000
So now suddenly get knows about get ignored and the EU changed into an E.

73
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,240
So it's starting to track it.

74
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:20,140
OK, so we're learning we're seeing that get ignored.

75
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,550
Went from not anything at all to what we put in it.

76
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,310
So we're going to be able to see how files change as we go along.

77
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:32,630
OK, so if we press this plus here at the top, it's going to stage everything, we can stage them one

78
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,450
by one or we can stage them all together.

79
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,450
And what we want to do is we want to stage them all together.

80
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:42,050
OK, so now everything is staged.

81
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,270
What is staged mean?

82
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:49,850
Well, staged means that now everything is going to be tracked by Gitte.

83
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:57,110
And so the little symbol is now an AI instead of a you write the and you is neither here nor there.

84
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:02,930
But just know that new files are going to be green because the changes haven't been tracked yet.

85
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:09,590
So now we have 19 files that went from I don't know what they are to hey get is now going to stage these

86
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:10,030
changes.

87
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,380
So now we have three things over here.

88
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:18,800
We have a toggle view mode which is going to toggle different types of use for us to look at the files.

89
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,520
And and that's just going to show us different ways of looking at it.

90
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:30,050
We have a commit button and we have a refresh button and we have the three dots over here that's going

91
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,910
to do a bunch of other stuff.

92
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,140
All right.

93
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:37,820
So now that we've staged all of our changes in the next video, we're going to go look at how we're

94
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,000
going to actually put these online.
