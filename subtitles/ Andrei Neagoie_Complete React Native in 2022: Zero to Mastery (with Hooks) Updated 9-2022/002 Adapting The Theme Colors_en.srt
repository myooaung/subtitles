1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:07,720
So that designer comes to you and says, hey, Moe, in my case or in your case, whatever your name

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,920
is, but hey Moe.

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:16,770
I get that, you know, you went for a different color pattern, but you have orange tabs, you have

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,670
a purple menu and you have blue buttons, I really like the purple.

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,850
Could we could we just stick with the purple?

6
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,080
And you're like, we sure can.

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:32,700
So we go over to our colors, dot jazz and we look at our brand colors and they say, oh, OK, you

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,060
set up a theme, you set this up with a proper brand strategy.

9
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:45,930
OK, so could we change the primary color to six nine six, a C three?

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,220
And that will allow us a deep nice purple.

11
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:59,640
And for the secondary color, how about we go with a five d six six six and they're speaking to us in

12
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,520
hex code because I guess that's how designers speak.

13
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:10,140
But you get it and you fill it in and now you go into your app and you say, oh, now everything that

14
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,460
I did as brand primary blue is purple and the buttons are purple.

15
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,900
And if we go over here, oh, we're missing an avatar.

16
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:25,680
So we go we quickly go over to our settings screen and we say to ourselves, oh, our avatar icon has

17
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,680
a background color that is not set to a color.

18
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,990
So we quickly go and say colors.

19
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:40,670
That brand dot primary and we import colors over here, so we say import colors from.

20
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:49,410
Infrastructure theme colors, and by doing that now, if we go to the settings screen that's set up

21
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:53,130
to be consistent about our tab menu is also not consistent.

22
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:58,470
So we go to App Navigator and we say, well, let's import colors here as well.

23
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,110
So we import colors from.

24
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,290
Dot, dot, dot, dot.

25
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:10,910
Infrastructure theme, and then we say colors, and then over here we say that well.

26
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,610
What color should we pick?

27
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:20,620
So we go down here and we say, when it's active, let's do colors, not brand thought primary, and

28
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,360
then when it's inactive, let's do colors, dot, brand, dot muted.

29
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,740
And if we go look at that, what we can see is that the muted color is.

30
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:38,110
Kind of in line, it's kind of a pastel blue that bleeds into the purple and the designers are like,

31
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:41,150
oh, well, that looks pretty nice, that's pretty decent.

32
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:46,300
And so the app is now fully well, I guess you could call Purplest.

33
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:51,760
And so if we log out, we can also see that our buttons are now purple, all of our buttons.

34
00:02:51,760 --> 00:03:01,330
And just with those simple, simple changes, we change the whole aesthetic of our app with no code

35
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:01,740
at all.

36
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:07,570
We created consistency when we thought there was none possible when we were freaking out.

37
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,550
Remember when we were freaking out in the previous video?

38
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:16,570
I was freaking out in the previous video, but it was this simple to change everything and it was no

39
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,310
sweat at all.

40
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:22,870
That's what happens when you set up your code for scale and it's amazing.

41
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:28,100
OK, so now that we have that going for us, what's going on over here in the cart?

42
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,430
Well, let's quickly fill in an order.

43
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,810
Let's do Moaveni and let's quickly do a payment.

44
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:41,080
And we can see that when we pay, an error is happening and everything is working as intended and the

45
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:46,480
other icons will automatically turn to purple and our map still works as intended.

46
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:55,600
Everything is good, just small couple tweaks to the code and we have created beautiful consistency.
