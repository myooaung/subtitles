1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:07,410
I want to ask you a question, have you ever been in the situation maybe you haven't quoted any time

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:12,480
previously, but have you ever been in the situation where you're working on a document, whether it

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:20,580
be a word document, an Excel document or whatever else, and something happens, boom file gone?

4
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:28,640
Well, in coding, we have methods to avoid this happening once and for all.

5
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,880
And on top of that, that methodology extends to working in teams and all of these other nice things.

6
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,900
Well, what is this methodology I speak of?

7
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,360
What is this black magic memo?

8
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:49,080
It's called Get and what get is it is an open source version control system distributed.

9
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,780
I'm oh, you're you're throwing a lot of words at me here, whatever.

10
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:53,590
What does that mean?

11
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,210
Well, I'll tell you what it means.

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:04,030
Basically what it is, it's an ability for you locally to keep revisions of your work.

13
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,730
So just like a word document, you're saving, you're saving your work.

14
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,120
But it goes beyond that.

15
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,320
It allows you also to keep a history of your work.

16
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,760
Now, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

17
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,050
How does it do that?

18
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:25,560
Well, it's a very complicated technology under the hood, but what basically we need to get out of

19
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:34,680
it and what you need to remember about it is that it is going to take care of us saving our work and

20
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,260
keeping a history of what we've done.

21
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,960
Have you ever worked at, like a factory or something where you have to take your card when you come

22
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,760
in and you go out?

23
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,330
It's kind of like taking that cart.

24
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:50,880
You know, when you ticked all, will you take them at seven, 10, seven fifteen, seven twenty will

25
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,440
get is kind of the same way.

26
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,170
You're checking in what you've changed at specific times.

27
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,160
So we're going to save our work, but we're going to save it in a way that we know what we've done and

28
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,620
what the history was and when we did it.

29
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:10,530
And that's going to be important for us, not for the short term, but for the long term, because everyone

30
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,450
can work on projects individually.

31
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,670
But it's when you want to start collaborating or when you want to start keeping more complicated changes

32
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:22,560
or you want to branch off and try something real quick, things like that when you want to experiment

33
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,400
and all that good stuff.

34
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:30,000
Once you get or once you install get, for instance, you're going to open a whole new world of possibilities

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,450
for yourself.

36
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,490
So what we're going to do here, we're going to press, download, get for Windows and downloading it

37
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,180
for Windows.

38
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,370
We're going to hit the save button.

39
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:46,600
Boom, run the security skin were good, now it's going to give you this gett installation, you're

40
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,650
going to double click that.

41
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,690
And once you double click that, that's going to ask you if you want to run it.

42
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,160
We're going to say yes.

43
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,630
And then once we start running that, what we're going to do is we're going to go through the installation

44
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,320
step by step.

45
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,810
So first it's going to give you a whole bunch of information.

46
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,610
Let's say we read it.

47
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,590
You don't have to actually scroll to the bottom.

48
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,020
But then we're going to press next.

49
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,580
We're going to say where we're going to save it.

50
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:16,030
Always leave this wherever originally decides if you're a more advanced user, you can obviously change

51
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:16,330
this.

52
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:22,480
But for all intents and purposes, we're going to store it on our C drive or C drivers of our hard drive.

53
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,320
This is what when those calls it, we're going to save it in the folder program files.

54
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,740
This is where software is saved on your computer and we're going to save it in the folder.

55
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,240
Get all right.

56
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,170
Don't change that.

57
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:40,660
Now we're going to press next and by default, it's going to install all of these things, all of these

58
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,170
things.

59
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,450
Now, do we need anything else?

60
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,570
Well, we can add desktop icon.

61
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,230
Sure.

62
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,580
Add a desktop icon and then you can check for updates daily if you want.

63
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:56,500
That would be useful if you're going to end up using this in the longer term and you can install a font

64
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,540
optionally if you want to.

65
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,560
I'm not going to do that today.

66
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:04,090
OK, so now it's going to take you and say, hey, create shortcuts.

67
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,360
Well, let's create a shortcut.

68
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,350
All right.

69
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:14,950
So in this next step, it's going to ask us to choose the default editor that we won't forget.

70
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:20,589
Now, Vim is the default editor for it, for Windows only for historical reason.

71
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:22,680
And it's highly recommended that you switch.

72
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:27,940
So what we're going to do is we're going to switch because it already says here the verm, which is

73
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,980
powerful, can be hard to use.

74
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,140
We don't want we don't want hard to use.

75
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,670
I like simple things.

76
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,050
Simple things are good.

77
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,750
So we're going to switch to something called Visual Studio Code.

78
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:43,330
So let's download that as well, because as you can see here, it won't let us press next just yet.

79
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,890
So let's save that.

80
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:51,740
And then once that saved, will quickly install visual studio code, so we're pausing our gett installation

81
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,310
right here and we're going to run this.

82
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:57,680
And once we run this, we're going to say I accept the agreement.

83
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:02,390
So right now, we're installing visual studio code, which is going to be used by GIT.

84
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:03,820
So let's slow this down.

85
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,510
What is Visual Studio Code even?

86
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:09,200
Well, Visual Studio Code is where we're going to code.

87
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,430
It is the environment in which we're going to put all of our code.

88
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,680
We're going to write our code and we're going to do a whole bunch more stuff.

89
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:22,640
So it's good that we're installing this already and it's good that the git installation kind of told

90
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,740
us, hey, you need this switch.

91
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,140
So we're going to do that.

92
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:33,940
So we're going to press next, next, next and create a desktop icon and we're going to press, install

93
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:41,210
and then once Visual Studios installation is complete, hopefully we can go to the next step in our

94
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,140
gett installation.

95
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,010
So bada bing, ba boom, this is installed.

96
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,200
We can launch Visual Studio code.

97
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,050
This is looking good.

98
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,730
So this is Visual Studio Code, but we'll get back to that later.

99
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,610
Now, what is happening over here?

100
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,860
Can we press next?

101
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,200
Well, we can't.

102
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,540
OK, so you can see here when I pressed back.

103
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,560
Originally, the next button was still great out when I pressed back and forward again.

104
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:15,020
Now, when I use visual studio code because I went a bit quickly, right, so it's great out again.

105
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:15,950
Why is it great out?

106
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:18,170
Well, let's press back and let's press forward.

107
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:21,830
And now it figured out that Visual Studio code is there.

108
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,290
So let's press next again.

109
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:30,430
And let's leave this to let get the side, this is adjusting the name of the judicial branch.

110
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,820
Let's let's just, you know, let's let's get the side.

111
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:42,490
And so adjusting the path environment, so let's just leave this as this let's leave it on the recommended

112
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,450
setting, if you're a more advanced user, go ahead and try things out.

113
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,000
But let's leave it on the recommended settings for now.

114
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,000
Now.

115
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:55,700
Choosing the https transport back end, what does that mean?

116
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:03,540
Let's just leave it to open SSL, the default now configuring line ending conversions, these are all

117
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:07,020
very complicated things, but, you know, just leave it to what it's selected.

118
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,680
OK, now choose a terminal emulator.

119
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:11,340
What?

120
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:11,880
What not.

121
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,600
Well, we'll leave it to the default selected as well.

122
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,810
And here, choose the behavior of git pull.

123
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:24,170
We're going to leave it again to what it's set as default.

124
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,650
Now, what credential helper would you want again?

125
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:36,550
We'll leave it to what it has selected by default and you can always click more information here to

126
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,210
see what it's referring to.

127
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,800
To get credential manager is just a software that they're giving.

128
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,930
You will leave it with the selected because you can see here deprecated.

129
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,850
We don't want that or none.

130
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,300
We want to credential help.

131
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:54,520
So let's just leave it at where they left it and they will file system caching.

132
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,940
Let's also enable symbolic links.

133
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,070
Let's enable that as well.

134
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:07,190
And now experimental support, we don't like experimental, we don't like it, so let's press install

135
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,450
and we're finally through it.

136
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,270
I was a whole bunch of different stuff we had to go through.

137
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,920
And I understand that a lot of it may have been kind of obscure.

138
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:22,490
You may not understand all of it, but don't worry, once this installation is behind us, we can finally

139
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:26,120
get to the good stuff, which is what we're going to use it for.

140
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:31,070
And what we're going to use get for is more important than all of the tiny details and steps we have

141
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,350
to go through in the installation.

142
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,200
So.

143
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,450
First thing we're going to do, we're going to hit launch, get bash, and then we're going to hit finish

144
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:45,170
and this is going to launch this interface Min GW 64.

145
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,540
If you're on a 32 bit system, it may be a bit different.

146
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:54,660
We recommend 64 bit system, though, so we've installed get what do we do now?

147
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:55,790
All right.

148
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,750
Well, let's go through that.
