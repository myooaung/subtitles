1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:03,050
Good job making it this far.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:10,130
Things are going to get more and more fun starting in this section because we're now learning real tools

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,100
that real companies use and that will get you hired.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:19,520
And development also becomes a lot faster because we're using these tools to make us build websites

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:20,720
faster and better.

6
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,350
So let's talk about react.

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,520
What do we have before we act?

8
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,210
Well, as I've mentioned before, we had Jorquera.

9
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:40,500
Jacqui was, as you remember, very imperative writing code was like mixing ingredients sequentially,

10
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,400
if this happens, then do this and then do that.

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,560
But also if this happens, then do this.

12
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,890
And it creates a lot of inconsistencies.

13
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:56,790
And if you remember the DOM manipulation section, well, that is really, really difficult.

14
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:04,410
And constantly keeping track of what changed and what to change is a huge mess and it creates for a

15
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:05,790
very slow development.

16
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:12,240
And as your website gets more and more complex, it becomes very, very hard to scale, which means

17
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,110
it becomes very hard for teams of developers to manage it.

18
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:23,790
Now, React was created at Facebook, as you know, Facebook is a pretty big app and a lot of things

19
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,470
need to happen for it to work well.

20
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:32,220
And they had this problem and they created react as a way to solve this issue and be able to have a

21
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:39,030
tool that allows them to build websites in a nice, predictable way that you can have multiple developers

22
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,370
working on it at the same time.

23
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,990
And I like to use the analogy of a bread machine.

24
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:54,660
Using react is kind of like that, you just throw in the ingredients and react as all this magic underneath

25
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,570
the hood and puts out a website.

26
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,430
So it's very reliable and very consistent.

27
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:11,130
And it does one thing really, really well, and that is the view it manages to make our websites the

28
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:11,590
DOM.

29
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:17,500
Change in predictable ways that is easy to scale and easy to manage.

30
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:24,620
And the beauty of react is that because it's just the view, it doesn't necessarily mean it's only for

31
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,250
browser's.

32
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:31,850
As a matter of fact, react can be used with mobile devices to build native apps.

33
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,550
It's used in virtual reality apps.

34
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,460
You can build desktop apps with react anywhere that has a view.

35
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,230
Well, react can use it.

36
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:48,020
And big companies, as I mentioned before, Facebook and Instagram use react and Netflix users react

37
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,300
whenever you browse through movie choices.

38
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,390
Well, that's using react underneath the hood.

39
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:56,600
It's a very, very useful tool and in very high demand.

40
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:02,660
So I'm excited to talk about react and teach you this valuable skill in this section.

41
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:09,350
Now, in order to understand react, there's a few things that we want to go over, and these are principles

42
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:14,390
that are very valuable, that have been learned over the years by developers.

43
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,880
One is the idea of thinking in components.

44
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:25,410
Up to this point, we've just built websites, everything is just one JavaScript file once you file

45
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:26,750
one HTML5.

46
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:34,070
But would it be nice if the Web was a network of these small components?

47
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:41,160
Think of them as Lego blocks where everybody builds a specific Lego block and you just combine these

48
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,120
local blocks to create your website.

49
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,080
That is the idea that react established.

50
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,000
Let's use this as an example.

51
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:59,850
You first have atoms which, as you can see here, are icons and little, small, indivisible elements

52
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,060
on your website, such as images.

53
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,870
There's some tax and you divide these into atoms.

54
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:15,990
From there, you form molecules or combine atoms that have similar functionality, such as the navigation

55
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,200
bar.

56
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,190
Down here you combine individual atoms to add some functionality.

57
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:28,430
And then you have organisms, again, a little bit bigger than molecules that combines to a bigger scale

58
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:34,190
functionality and then finally have templates the combination of these organisms.

59
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:39,480
To give you an idea of how your app or website Shilluk, finally you have your pages.

60
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,170
That is the page of your app.

61
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:47,610
And if you think in component's, as this image demonstrates.

62
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:56,800
What you're able to build small little components that you can reuse and put on different parts of the

63
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:04,390
webpage, for example, this backbone here, if I build a react component that is the backbone, I can

64
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:11,230
now use it on multiple pages and I don't have to rewrite the code if I wanted the navigation bar to

65
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,480
be used in different areas of the app.

66
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,970
Well, again, I don't need to rewrite the code.

67
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,370
I write it once and I can we use it.

68
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,770
As a matter of fact, I even share with the world.

69
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:29,410
And this idea of components makes react amazing because right here I have a website that has real components

70
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,960
built by somebody and we can reuse these.

71
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:41,880
And it's not just access and e-mail, but real functionality such as navigation bars and signing forms.

72
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,410
I can just download this Riak component and attach it to my website.

73
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:54,780
And because of the way reactor's structured, it doesn't really need to know about the rest of the webpage

74
00:05:54,990 --> 00:06:02,000
is just its own local block that works by itself, by reducing dependencies on other parts of the website.

75
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,400
I can just plug this anywhere I want.

76
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:10,590
Another important concept with React is the idea of one way dataflow.

77
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:19,000
The best way to describe it is by looking at this tree like structure in here, you see that we have

78
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,910
a parent, some children, and then those children have their own children and those children have their

79
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:25,420
own children.

80
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:33,940
And the idea with react is that data flows from top to bottom and never the other way around, that

81
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:38,110
is if these red, let's call them components change.

82
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:43,350
Well, in that case, only their children know about the change.

83
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:50,260
The parents don't really care about the change because, well, the direction of the data flow is just

84
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,110
always downstream.

85
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,750
So if we go back to the idea of components, if we had a website build on components.

86
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:04,350
And this was the page and these were organisms and then molecules than atoms.

87
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:11,880
Well, in that case, the red components change and then only the ones below it, as you can see here

88
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,400
in blue, know of this change.

89
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:18,530
And based on that, they will act accordingly and change as well.

90
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:25,050
Now, without actually having a problem, it's hard to understand this concept, but trust me, this

91
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:32,820
is a very important concept that react brought in a creates a lot of really nice bug free code.

92
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:37,950
And it is an idea that you'll understand more and more as we start to code and react.

93
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:45,600
The next thing is the idea of virtual, Don.

94
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:52,370
You know what, the dummies, the document object model, and we also learned that one of the most important

95
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:57,770
things as a developer is to minimize the amount of dumb manipulation that we do because, well, web

96
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:01,220
browsers has to have to work really, really hard to achieve that.

97
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:05,440
And it reduces the performance of the Web page, plus increases bugs.

98
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,170
I think this image demonstrates what REAC does really well.

99
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:17,240
Beforehand, we were the painters, we told the DOM exactly what to do, remove this element, then

100
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:22,820
put this in and then also add this and color this this way with react.

101
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:28,580
We have this react bottom and the react to create something called the virtual dome.

102
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,970
Virtual dome is just a JavaScript object.

103
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:38,870
And this JavaScript object that just describes our website, the current state of the website.

104
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:48,080
And we just give it that object to react, and the jackpot will automatically make changes to the dome

105
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,620
and paint the picture in the most optimum way possible.

106
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,150
So we just tell it, hey, this is the object.

107
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,240
This is what we want in the dome.

108
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,440
And the reaction takes care of manipulation for you.

109
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:10,520
Remember how annoying it was to do selecter all, then grab elements by ID and then doing all these

110
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,560
event handlers will react, takes care of that.

111
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:21,650
So again, the virtual dome is just a copy of the dome that's in a JavaScript object and then react

112
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:25,190
underneath the hood just changes the view.

113
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,220
And that's why it's able to work outside of browsers.

114
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:35,000
And you can use things like VR and and mobile devices because react as the machine and what the canvas

115
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,320
is on.

116
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:38,240
Well, we can change the canvas to whatever we want.

117
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,440
Finally, React has a great Eco-System.

118
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:49,290
It is probably one of the biggest ecosystems and JavaScript right now, and there are so many tools

119
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,550
that work with react.

120
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:57,760
As a matter of fact, the developer community so big that any problem you have, there's most likely

121
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,870
a chance that somebody else has had it and has posted it on the Internet.

122
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:06,100
And you can find solutions for you can find Riak packages in NPM.

123
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,960
You can use it with Noad.

124
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,070
There's Web back.

125
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:15,340
And Bable that you can use with it is just a really good eco system that uses the latest JavaScript

126
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:19,360
technology to build websites in a really nice, elegant way.

127
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:26,380
Now, one thing that I want to warn you about in this section, we're going to see code like this.

128
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:33,080
And it's going to look very strange at first, it's like the same way when you looked at JavaScript

129
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,770
the first time.

130
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,970
It seemed like a whole new, different world.

131
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:43,140
It will when you first look at this, but trust me, knowing what you know about JavaScript, this becomes

132
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,050
really, really easy.

133
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,600
You have classes that extends the react component.

134
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,110
And this is how we build components.

135
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,200
We have constructor again, that we've seen an advanced object.

136
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:03,540
And then each class has a mandatory render function that you just tell it what this clock should render.

137
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,480
And as you can see, it looks like a Schimel, isn't it?

138
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,990
It's not exactly HTML, but the syntax is very similar.

139
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,870
So even by looking at this, you see that this clock component, again, this Lego block just returns

140
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:23,610
a hello world H1 tag with an EU that says it is.

141
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:30,660
And then the time again, just to give you a heads up, you're going to hear words like props and state

142
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,670
and riak components.

143
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:38,970
But these are just language syntax that you'll learn and it's actually quite easy once you get used

144
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:39,200
to it.

145
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:44,460
So don't worry, this is all going to make sense by the end of it.

146
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:45,840
And you know what?

147
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,210
We're going to be building a pretty cool app.

148
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:53,260
It's called Robo Friends, and we're going to build this app that well.

149
00:11:54,460 --> 00:12:01,420
Searches through your robot friends and you can find their contact information and as you can see it

150
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,980
updates live, it's super fast, it's responsive.

151
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,380
It's going to be a lot of fun.

152
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,420
And we're going to build this pretty fast just to show you how powerful react is.

153
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,830
All right, I'm really excited to get into this section, you're going to have a lot of fun.

154
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,380
I'll see you in the next one.

155
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:21,310
Bye bye.
