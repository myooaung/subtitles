00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.760
Oh, we hit an error case, what's going on here, Jason, value pixel of any string cannot be converted.

2
00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.550
Did you forget the percentage or point or suffix?

3
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.830
What is this about?

4
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.210
Well, is it the padding?

5
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:16.970
Did we get the patterns wrong?

6
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.030
If we remove the padding?

7
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:18.860
Does it go away?

8
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.390
Oh, that seemed to make it go away.

9
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.400
Well, let me remove all the padding then.

10
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.190
Does that fix it?

11
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:25.490
Let's reload.

12
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.380
Oh, it's coming back.

13
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.140
What is this about?

14
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.420
Well, we'll put the paintings back now and we'll make sure that OK.

15
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.190
OK, so let's reload now.

16
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.340
Is it just oh no, it's back again.

17
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:39.760
So is it this?

18
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.080
Let's try that.

19
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:49.940
Let's reload again, it's gone, so something's going wrong with the margin top of current height and

20
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.160
basically because it's not supported on Iooss properly, right?

21
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.820
It's only an Android feature.

22
00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.900
This is breaking.

23
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.530
So how do we fix this?

24
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.530
Well, we can invert this.

25
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.560
We can do something like if this is a thing.

26
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.750
Then we'll return.

27
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.590
This as a string.

28
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.870
Let's try this piece of code instead.

29
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.150
So what is this doing?

30
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.480
Let's try this, if we reload here, does it still break?

31
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.930
No.

32
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.620
Why is this the case?

33
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.670
Why is this happening?

34
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.340
Well, let me explain something to you on.

35
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.530
I was in general.

36
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.180
Status of current height is not supported because we're using safe area of you, right?

37
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.500
We're using the safe area of you and the safe area of you status.

38
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.750
But at current height is only used by Android.

39
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.140
So on iOS, it's not really returning a valid value.

40
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.460
So when we're setting it in margin top, it's causing an error to occur.

41
00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.200
We're hitting an error case.

42
00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.740
Right.

43
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.440
And so we can quickly prove this, that this is actually the case if we put this back.

44
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.130
Right, just this part.

45
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.310
And we save that and we go back to our emulator here.

46
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.120
And we hit refresh, well, suddenly we're getting an error.

47
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.150
OK, so we know that this line is causing us an error.

48
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.250
So what's the difference between this line and this line?

49
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.750
Right.

50
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.280
What's the difference between those two lines?

51
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.470
Well, let me show you on this line.

52
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.080
And this is a great trickery of template strings.

53
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.960
This is a funny way to use template strings here, we're saying, OK, on the style to see if any of

54
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.790
you we're having flex one, but.

55
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.660
I'm going to use a variable.

56
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.590
And our variable is going to be status, our current height.

57
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.690
So if status bar current height has a value, right.

58
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.500
And and so this is a check.

59
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.970
If this has a value, then add margin top.

60
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:12.940
Status bar, the current height plus pixels, so we're only applying the margin top if status bardock

61
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.250
current height has a value.

62
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.850
OK, and does this solve our bug?

63
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.810
Well, I would say so, because now when we reload, no more error.

64
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.730
So we're in a good spot.
