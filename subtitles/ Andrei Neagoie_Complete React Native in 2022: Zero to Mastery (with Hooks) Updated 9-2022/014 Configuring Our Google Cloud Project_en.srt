1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:07,200
Now that we know everything there is to know about Google Cloud and all the safety measures we need

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,510
to take, we also understand that Google Maps is one of the foremost providers.

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,800
So right now, what we want to do is create a new project.

4
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,940
And by creating a new project, we're going to call it meals to go.

5
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:27,540
And this project is going to be where we get our information from how we're going to configure APIs.

6
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,030
So for me, it's going to be in an organization.

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,020
For you, it won't probably be in an organization.

8
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:37,290
You'll be on your individual account, but just create the project and then.

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,670
What you will have is the ability to choose that project.

10
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,620
I have two projects from meals to go.

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,250
I'm going to show you in this project that is now being set up how to set up the corresponding APIs

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,280
that we will need in order to integrate.

13
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,640
So now that it is set up, if we go over here, what we can see is that on the dashboard, everything

14
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,740
is set up with our billing and so forth.

15
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,540
And what we can do now is we can go look at what products we need.

16
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,630
So the first product we're going to need is the Places API.

17
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,690
So we're going to search for places and we're like the places API.

18
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:20,090
Then we'll select enabled and once we enable that API, it is now available on our Google cloud for

19
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:20,870
us to configure.

20
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:29,900
The second thing we'll need is the Geocode API now the Geocode API is one that we'll use to translate

21
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:36,710
location Balochi, a city into a location, latitude, longitude and so enabling that will allow us

22
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:41,340
to basically do requests to get that information.

23
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,250
There's two things we need to do.

24
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:48,290
First off, we need to set credentials and second off, we need to set quotas, so let's go ahead and

25
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,390
set quotas ahead of them right here.

26
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:56,540
I'm in the geocoding API, which I've enabled places API in the geocoding API, and I can also configure

27
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,730
it for all of the maps platform.

28
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:03,620
But you have to set quotas on the specific API, so we'll go to geocoding API and then we'll go to our

29
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,310
requests.

30
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:09,860
And what are you going to see here is that currently it is configured for unlimited requests per day,

31
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,790
3000 requests per minute and requests per minute, per user unlimited.

32
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,300
This is what can catch you when you, for instance, have no limitations set.

33
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:27,380
It will not stop the requests from coming in, meaning that you need to set limits for the amount of

34
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:33,240
requests you want to do per day so that your costs will be caught if you make a mistake.

35
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,720
So what we're going to do is we're going to see four requests per day.

36
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,750
We're going to disable Unlimited and we're going to set it to one thousand.

37
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:43,780
And then we're going to say we're sure we're reducing the quota for requests per minute.

38
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:50,210
We're also going to change it and we're going to configure it to be amount of requests per minute that

39
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,110
is more reasonable.

40
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,480
So we'll set that to one hundred requests per minute.

41
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:59,180
That way, we're sure that if we hit a limitation within that minute time frame, we can cancel out.

42
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:09,040
And then on top of that, what we'll do is we'll set requests per user per minute also to a thousand.

43
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,620
And here, reduce the quota, we can always adjust these based on usage, if we're hitting limitations,

44
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,480
the API will send us an error and we can adjust our quota.

45
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,380
These are just there in place so that we can be careful.

46
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:30,950
And then on top of that, what we'll do is we'll go to our other API here, the Places API, and we're

47
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,510
going to set quotas in place for that as well.

48
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,550
Now, it's extremely important that you do this step.

49
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:41,470
If you don't do this step, you're not going to have the safety net of configuring Google Cloud properly.

50
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,390
So we're going to set requests per day to a thousand as well.

51
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:49,130
We're going to get requests per minute to a thousand as well.

52
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,810
And then we're going to set requests per minute per user to a thousand as well, so all of these are

53
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:58,610
going to be one thousand so that we are sure that we won't go overboard.

54
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:07,040
And once we've configured all of these, what we can do is we can go ahead and configure the credentials

55
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,550
that will need.

56
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:13,090
So the last one will need to do is over here, set up from a limited to a quota of a thousand.

57
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:19,220
And once we've saved that, we've now configured Google Cloud for the safety measure of the quota.

58
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,880
But we'll need to do next is we'll need to go look at credentials and what we'll see here is that in

59
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:31,160
order to configure our authentication, we're going to need something named the nitpicky.

60
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,420
So it's going to say currently we have no API keys.

61
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,240
What we'll do is we'll go to credentials and the API services.

62
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:46,670
And what we'll need to click here is create credentials and we're going to create an API and by creating

63
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:51,920
an epic, we're going to create an epic that we can use to talk to Google.

64
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,850
This is going to be our unique identifier that we use to talk to Google.

65
00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:02,030
And when we want to do next is we want to restrict the key and by restricting the key, will disable

66
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,300
it from being able to be used with certain API.

67
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:11,450
So we're going to say this epic is only for polices and geocoding and will limiting its use specifically

68
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,470
to those two APIs.

69
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,010
That's another layer of protection that we're adding in.

70
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:22,310
And now that we've saved this, we have our API key available and we can now use it to do our calls.

71
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:29,870
Make sure you keep that close because we're going to be using it to set up other services and our connection

72
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,530
to Google.
