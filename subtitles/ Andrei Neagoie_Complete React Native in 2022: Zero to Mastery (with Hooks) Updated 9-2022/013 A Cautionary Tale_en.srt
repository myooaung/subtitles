00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,100
Before we get deep into integration of Google Cloud, I wanted to tell you a cautionary story and it's

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,240
a hell of a story I almost vomited when this happened.

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:16,079
Now, I've seen this happen many, many times in my job working for different clients when they're implementing

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,550
Google cloud provider services.

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,070
And this is just a cautionary tale.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,390
It's not that you need to be deathly afraid of working with cloud service providers, but you you have

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,820
to pay attention.

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,020
It's not something you want to play around with.

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:29,400
And I'll tell you why.

10
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:37,950
On December the 6th, right back over here, the number five to six, it was an evening like any other.

11
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:38,760
I was just coding.

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,740
I was coding away, building meals to go.

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:48,420
And I was going through the motions of kind of working through all of the different parts that I needed

14
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:48,960
to do.

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,540
And so I was doing some traffic to Google Cloud building out to the infrastructure.

16
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:02,430
And I had built out a function, a search function that was going to hit the Google Cloud API and the

17
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:08,430
geocoding API specifically in the places API and I had put a function somewhere inside of Orender body

18
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,630
just to test it out quickly.

19
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:10,740
And I had forgotten about it.

20
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,510
I just didn't pay attention.

21
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:19,240
And then I hit a use case where I was trying something out and it was silently rendering the components

22
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,680
started rendering without me knowing and I didn't notice because the app was just there.

23
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:24,760
Nothing was happening.

24
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,130
I didn't have any logs anywhere.

25
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:35,050
And so I went away for like two or three minutes, got some water, came back and looked at my dashboard.

26
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:41,980
To my surprise, I had done 86000 requests to the geocoding API.

27
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,430
It had silently been rendering for those five minutes.

28
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:51,040
And it I've been hitting the geocoding API continuously and continuously, continuously, continuously

29
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,090
hadn't stopped.

30
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,590
Needless to say, when I saw this, I almost puked.

31
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:02,440
Because you go into panic mode, what would I do, where is this happening?

32
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,460
I didn't I don't remember doing any of this.

33
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:12,310
And when I found my mistake, just leaving a stray function call somewhere inside of a body of a component,

34
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,200
which is a bad practice to start with.

35
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,170
But I was just testing something out when I'd found my mistake.

36
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,990
I was mortified.

37
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,980
But it happens.

38
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,560
These things happen.

39
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,520
And what are you going to do?

40
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:28,360
Well, first of all, I had a panic attack.

41
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:34,450
And to be honest, like at that point, well, my first reaction was to contact Google.

42
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:38,020
And luckily enough, they helped me out.

43
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:43,980
They gave me a credit on my bill, they saw that all of the usage was incurred in the same exact moment,

44
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:49,020
on the same exact day, in the same exact hour, and that it was a fluke and they helped me out.

45
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:54,750
But it's better to prevent the need to get through the situation where you need to go and look at this

46
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,500
usage and say, well, now I have a five hundred U.S. dollar bill.

47
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:04,380
So with that, they gave me some strategies, strategies that I already knew I just hadn't implemented.

48
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:10,140
And we're going to go through that so that you can prevent making a similar mistake.

49
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,880
And I've seen this happen at clients as well.

50
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,070
But instead of 86000 or cost, we're talking about millions, millions of requests.

51
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:21,510
So you need to be very cautious about how you set everything up when you use a cloud provider.

52
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,430
Safety is the most important thing.

53
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:30,810
You need to understand what you're doing, configuring everything to the most granular quota that you

54
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,440
can set.

55
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,820
And that's what we'll be looking at as well, but this is a cautionary tale just so that you know that

56
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,220
mistakes can happen and there's tales about this all over the Internet.

57
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:45,660
And I'm just saying this because I want you to know that you need to pay attention.

58
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:51,040
You need to pay attention, because although you have a three hundred dollar free quota, if you start

59
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,510
a new account and you have this two hundred dollar quota for the places in the geocoding it by free

60
00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:01,000
usage, it's very easy if you don't set up the proper guardrails to go over.

61
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,020
Now, with that, don't be too afraid of using cloud providers.

62
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,390
It is honestly fine.

63
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,410
You just need to be careful about how your coding.

64
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,230
So with that, that was my mistake.
