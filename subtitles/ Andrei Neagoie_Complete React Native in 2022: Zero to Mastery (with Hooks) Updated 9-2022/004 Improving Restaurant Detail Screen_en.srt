1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,520
The designer comes back to you and says, hey, for the restaurant info card, could we adjust that

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:05,790
a bit?

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,230
Because I don't like the way that it's filling in the entire with.

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,000
And you're like, sure we can.

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:21,150
So what you do is you go to a restaurant info card styles, and we're looking at the restaurant card

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,850
and you say, what exactly do you want?

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,430
Well, shorten it a bit.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,560
So you say, OK, with ninety five percent.

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:36,510
All right, so we do that and, oh, well, let's align it to the center aligned south center and so

10
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,260
now it's aligning itself perfectly in the center.

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,810
The others like, oh, yeah, that looks much better.

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:51,180
And then they ask you, hey, on this detail screen, right on the detail screen, could you adjust?

13
00:00:52,470 --> 00:01:00,090
The dividers between the different menu items, and you're like, sure, so you go and you research

14
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,530
and research and you find that reacclimated favor has a divider item.

15
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,459
And so we go.

16
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:13,320
And what we do is between each accordion, we decide that we're going to put a divider.

17
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:14,200
Right.

18
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,270
So we put a divider between the items right here.

19
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:30,020
And by doing that now, every item inside the menu has a divider, but subsequently we also put them

20
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,290
between the accordion's.

21
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:40,970
So by doing that now, we can create logical groupings between each and every section as well as each

22
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:44,230
and every individual item inside of the menu.

23
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:50,390
So we'll put them between the accordion's and put them between each and every menu item.

24
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,190
There we go.

25
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:57,260
And then right here between coffee.

26
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:04,040
Te Modelo Coke, and there we go.

27
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:13,900
And by doing this, we now have dividers dividing up very lightly the menu to create this nice flow

28
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:23,230
of the UI so that we have a clear separation of items between groups and otherwise.

29
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:24,710
Awesome.

30
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:29,470
All right, that was simple enough, no muss, no fuss.
