00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.320
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:08.870
Now you just watched a video on the folder structure of React and you might be wondering.

3
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.330
Hold on a second, Andre.

4
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.870
I see something a little bit different than in your video.

5
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.750
Well, if that's the case, it means that you installed React 18 or higher depending on when you're

6
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.800
watching this video.

7
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:29.550
So I wanted to make a quick video to show you the process of how, as libraries change, you want to

8
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.720
stay on top of it.

9
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.440
Now we actually have a couple of videos and exercises in the section towards the end where I show you

10
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.990
how to upgrade your React app, and we actually upgrade everything to the latest version of React and

11
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.390
show you the minor changes.

12
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.460
But just in case you have questions right now, again, we're going to get to it later in the course.

13
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:58.320
But let me just give you a small snippet on how, as a developer, you want to stay on top of changes

14
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.200
of the libraries that you're using in this case, react.

15
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.250
So I've actually prepared for you two things.

16
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.930
One is what you just saw in the previous video.

17
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:17.820
With the React on the Render of our Friends app, we have the React strict mode and the document get

18
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.480
by ID root on the left hand side.

19
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.070
I just ran a Create React App Command.

20
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.820
And got this, which depending on when you're watching the video, you might have this version versus

21
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.770
this version facing the video.

22
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.350
So why the differences?

23
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.560
The key is in the package JSON file.

24
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.040
Again, if we look at the package JSON file on the right hand side, we have this React version.

25
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:56.260
And then on the left hand side, we see that we have a React version that is 18 or higher, and that's

26
00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.460
why there's a difference.

27
00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:06.250
So what I can do is go to the documentation website, the React JS documentation and see that right

28
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.940
here.

29
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:15.670
How to upgrade to React 18 Well, in React 18, the major change that we really care about is this updates

30
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.500
to client rendering APIs.

31
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.510
Again, this is something that we're going to practice in this section where you get to read the docs,

32
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.110
see how you can upgrade your projects and practice that muscle.

33
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.660
But you see here that react dom their render is no longer supported in React 18.

34
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.900
Use create root instead until you switch the new API, your app will behave as if it's running.

35
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.010
React 17.

36
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.960
It's telling us that we can no longer use React Dom.

37
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.300
To render, we need to use create root.

38
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.580
So let's test our assumption.

39
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.300
All right, so let's test this out.

40
00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.260
Let's say that I copied the old way of doing it.

41
00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.790
So it's telling me, react, dom, die.

42
00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.410
Render no longer exists.

43
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:06.820
But what if I just replace it over here like we had it before and run this with react 18 or higher?

44
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:14.470
If I do MP m start and this is a freshly newly created create react app command.

45
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.930
So it's just my app with React version 18 or higher if I do MP am start.

46
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.280
I get nothing.

47
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.630
And it says Over here.

48
00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:27.590
Hey, look at that.

49
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.920
Dot render is not a function.

50
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:32.260
All right.

51
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.100
So exactly what we thought is no longer supported.

52
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:43.480
So the only change that we really care about and again, we're going to have an exercise to update the

53
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.750
code base later in this section is we see that we no longer use react dom render.

54
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.450
Instead we do something called create root.

55
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:59.950
And inside of this function we do the document get element by ID, which is exactly what we do here.

56
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.670
And then that after we create the root.

57
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:05.950
Right here.

58
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.680
That's when we can do the dot render.

59
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.490
So technically, we can just do this as well if we want it to.

60
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:18.399
So if I don't even declare a variable and I just do dot render, this should work.

61
00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:19.390
Let me test it out.

62
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.890
Look at that.

63
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.540
Everything works as expected.

64
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.210
Again, this is just important for you to realize that libraries are constantly updating.

65
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:39.270
So your job as a developer, as a smart developer, is to always be on top of your game.

66
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.310
And we'll work on those exercises of updating our code bases throughout the rest of the course.

67
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:45.840
Easy peasy.

68
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.000
I'll see you in the next video.

69
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.580
Bye bye.
