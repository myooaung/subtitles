00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:00,630
Hey, there.

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,060
I wanted to take a second.

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:09,870
At the end of it all, at the end of your learning journey to just say this one thing that is thank

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:10,020
you.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,680
I know your time is valuable.

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:20,970
We have limited time on this earth and you decided to spend your time and your money, frankly, with

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:27,770
us doing something that takes a long time to learn so truly from the bottom of our hearts.

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:33,690
I know it sounds cheesy, but thank you for dedicating your time and effort to this course.

9
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:40,320
I hope you got what you wanted out of it and congratulate yourself for getting this far because a lot

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,190
of people start.

11
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,090
A lot of people have hopes of learning, but they give up along the way.

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,620
But you didn't do that.

13
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,670
You work through the challenges, the problems and you got here.

14
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,180
Now your learning journey doesn't end here.

15
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,320
It keeps going.

16
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:01,800
But I hope this created a foundation for you to go off and learn things on your own.

17
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:02,810
Get a promotion.

18
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:03,480
Get hired.

19
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,420
Start a new business, whatever it may be.

20
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,740
Again, thank you and best of luck with your learning journey.

21
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,120
This is just the beginning of whatever you decide to do in the future.

22
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,460
So thank you and good luck.
