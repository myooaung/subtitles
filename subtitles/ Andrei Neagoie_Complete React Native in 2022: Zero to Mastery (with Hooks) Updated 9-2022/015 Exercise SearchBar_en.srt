1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,070
Time for us to enhance our feature now, as you can see, we built a search bar.

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,780
Well, we built a search view.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,720
We built the view in which the search bar is going to live.

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:19,080
Now, with that comes well, we can't really fill anything into this or to this.

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,510
It's kind of just a static view.

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:20,850
Right.

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,500
And what we need is, you guessed it, another package.

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,230
Now, I promise all of these packages have a purpose, and the purpose is to make development easier

9
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:34,620
for us.

10
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,960
And as we go through the setup, things will become more and more easy as we gain more and more of these

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,500
packages.

12
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:50,100
Now, that being said, one of the packages that we need to add is called react need of paper and its

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,730
cross platform material designed for react native.

14
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:59,040
Now, as you know, React Native comes with a bunch of items like a view, a textfield, a button field,

15
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,230
but they're not really styled for us.

16
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:10,320
And so we can go through the motion of styling them or we can use a predefined package that has all

17
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,240
of these components already built out for us so that we can leverage them, which sounds easier.

18
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:23,280
Now, this is most often used in the industry because we don't want to reinvent the wheel.

19
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,560
Oftentimes theming is done.

20
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,950
So customizing the colors and the palette and the sizing and the spacing, but rebuilding all of these

21
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,490
very, very granular components is something that isn't really done.

22
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:39,990
So if we go and we say try a demo out on XPO Snack.

23
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:48,850
We can see here that we can go ahead and load a example of all of these components and how they work

24
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:53,290
in react need of paper, and I would suggest you go and try this out so that you can get a feel for

25
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:55,930
all of the different components that react native people will give you.

26
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,960
Now, that said, we need to get started.

27
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,190
And so to get started, what we want to do is yarn, add react native paper.

28
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,000
So you guessed it.

29
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:10,240
We're going to go into visual studio code, we're going to open our terminal and we're going to run

30
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,130
that good old command again.

31
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,650
Yarn ad react native paper.

32
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:23,520
And so by doing that, we're going to be adding react native paper to our package, Jason, in which

33
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,290
will now have the ability to use, react need of paper.

34
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,650
So that's awesome, right?

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,590
So we already added prettier and excellent and all of that good stuff.

36
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:42,040
And so now what react native paper, we're going to get access to all of these components and you can

37
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,590
already guess it, what do we need to do here?

38
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,160
Well, we want a search bar.

39
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,910
So what would we look for here?

40
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,440
Would we look for text?

41
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,420
Not really.

42
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,380
Would we look for search?

43
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,690
Oh, there's a search bar component.

44
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:04,310
Amazing, so they have a search bar component that has an input box where in which you can put search

45
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:04,910
queries.

46
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:14,650
Sick, so now we're going to utilize this, this is going to be the exercise, implement the search

47
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:21,130
bar from riak native people in the view where we put the green search field.

48
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,960
And try a couple of things out.

49
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:31,490
Let's see how it pans out and one of the things that we want to do here is just make sure that it's

50
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:32,600
there and it looks nice.

51
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:33,470
That's about it.

52
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,080
We'll get into the customization in the solution.

53
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:43,340
And so now that we've added react native paper, you can see it's available here now and it's up version

54
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,350
four point five point zero.

55
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,520
You don't have to exactly match the versions because as the course progresses, packages may update

56
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,050
as well.

57
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,610
We're on XPO version 40.

58
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,950
And when you start this course, we may be a version forty one.

59
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:04,340
OK, so that said, we want to implement the search bar from Riak native paper in the search view,

60
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:05,810
so let's get to that.
