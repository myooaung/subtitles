00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.400
Now that we're pretty much set up to build out the rest of the settings interface, the last thing that

2
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:12.370
we need to do is build out a nice interface for the favorites screen that is going to render inside

3
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:12.960
settings.

4
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:19.140
And in order to do that, what we're going to do is we're going to build out the favorites screen.

5
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:27.490
And this is going to come from the same place that settings screen comes from, which is the screens

6
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.060
of settings.

7
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.620
But we're going to call it favorites.

8
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.430
And so there's going to be a favorite start screen that we're going to create here.

9
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:41.050
Favorites, dot screen dojos and we're going to import react from react.

10
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:49.940
So let's go ahead and do that import, react from react, and we're going to export CONSED favourite's

11
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:50.480
screen.

12
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.480
And that's going to equal the ORENDER out right now of not so let's do that.

13
00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.560
So it's going to be the exact same.

14
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.910
And let's go back to Settings Navigator, and it has to be favorites that screen.

15
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.600
Now, if we go over here and we go to favorites again, rendering not what we wanted to render, though,

16
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:18.460
and this is a short exercise just on reusability, we wanted to render something equivalent to this

17
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.770
list for you, the exact same type of list view that we're rendering for restaurants, exact same layout,

18
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.620
exact same format, exact same item.

19
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:33.310
We want it to do that with the favorites array, not with all of the restaurants, strictly with your

20
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.220
favorites.

21
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.140
Now, for this exercise, I want you to go look at the implementation over here, see which parts are

22
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.150
reusable, potentially reach the flat list and all of these other things that we've learned and try

23
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:52.720
to build out the list in a way that you can view it over here now.

24
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.910
In the next video, we'll look at the model solution.

25
00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.180
Now, this doesn't mean that the way that you solve it is incorrect or that you cannot do it in different

26
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.630
ways.

27
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.630
It is completely valid to gain an interface and build it out in the way that you see it.

28
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.900
However, the model solution reaches to my knowledge and my expertise in the way that I view it in terms

29
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.280
of how I would solve it.

30
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.930
That doesn't mean that your implementation is wrong in any way, shape or form.
