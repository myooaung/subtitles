1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,670
Now that we've set up our stock navigator to allow the restaurants tap to contain multiple screens,

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:11,370
what we're going to do now is we're going to say the restaurant stacked up restaurant detail is going

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,460
to be equal to a no.

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:14,900
Right.

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,550
Let's well, let's not do not.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,940
Let's import text from Riak native.

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:28,530
Right, and let's put TextField in there that says restaurant detail.

8
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:39,810
OK, so now that we have this, what we can do is we can go ahead and we can try to navigate to there

9
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:40,970
from the restaurant screen.

10
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:48,770
Now, one of the things that you get when you link a component to a restaurant, stack that screen,

11
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:54,360
what this is going to guarantee you is that this component is going to pass a prop into restaurant screen

12
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,530
at the top level.

13
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,730
So whatever component is in this component field automatically gets a prop.

14
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:04,489
Now, what does that prop will that prop is the prop navigate?

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:12,690
So any time a component is given to this, what we're going to see here is that you're going to have

16
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:18,450
a prop navigate at this level anywhere deeper inside, like restaurant list isn't going to have navigate

17
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,130
search isn't going to have navigate, but the restaurant screen is going to have to navigate because

18
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,650
it's injected right here.

19
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:31,530
So any of the components that are in this field are guaranteed to get the prop navigate.

20
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:32,760
OK.

21
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,100
And of course, it's called navigation, not navigate.

22
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:43,190
So if we give it navigation, what we're going to see is that navigation should have the properties

23
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,180
and listener can go back dangerously, get parent.

24
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,450
All these different things jump to push, too.

25
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:59,330
And so what we can do with it now is we can make it push to a different screen or navigate to a different

26
00:01:59,330 --> 00:01:59,680
screen.

27
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:09,740
So the way that we're going to do this is we're going to go ahead and do a on click right now.

28
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,690
How are we going to do this on Click?

29
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:18,220
Well, right around here, around this restaurant info card, we want to add an arm press handler.

30
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,390
So we're going to import something special.

31
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,210
So what we'll do is we'll import Pressel from here and then we'll wrap our.

32
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:35,770
Component over here with a principal and then principal and what we'll do is our own press function

33
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:42,250
will be navigation navigate and we'll go to restaurant detail.

34
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:49,530
And so over here, it's expecting a curly brace.

35
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,630
I believe that should do it.

36
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:57,440
And so now any time we press on one of these, we're going to restaurant detail.

37
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,910
Well, we're going to restaurant detail.

38
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,630
And so now these have a press action.

39
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,270
Now, we could have also used touchable opacity.

40
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,100
We could have used a bunch of different things.

41
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:16,860
But this press API allows us now to hit our card and transfer to the restaurant detail screen.

42
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,010
But there's something that's not quite satisfying here.

43
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:26,760
You see, we're kind of stuck navigating in a direction that's left to right, but I want the detail

44
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,000
to pop up from the bottom.

45
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,760
So how would we achieve that?

46
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,930
Well, let's look at that.
