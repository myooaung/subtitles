00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:07.600
I know what you're thinking, can we optimize this, can we make this simpler than it already is?

2
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:08.580
Right.

3
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.420
Mo, I have to go and I have to run this command every time, every time I want to see something or

4
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.390
I'm doing something wrong.

5
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.210
Well, surely enough.

6
00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.100
What we can do is we can simplify the process even further if we need to.

7
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.300
Now, first off, we have this lenth command here.

8
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.690
Right.

9
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:33.160
And the command is awesome because it's going to link our code, but we can integrate it even further

10
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.570
into visual studio code.

11
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.280
And if we click over here on this little icon, it's called the extension's icon.

12
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:46.090
And in the extension's icon, you can add extensions to Visual Studio Code and the extensions that we

13
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.750
want to add.

14
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.480
If we search Iceland and we can see here at the top, Slint has a plugin.

15
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.570
And this integrates excellent interviews code.

16
00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:05.170
And this extension basically allows you to lend your code in the editor, so if we hit install here,

17
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.880
the extension is now enabled globally.

18
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.000
OK, so we just installed it.

19
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.620
That was pretty quick, right?

20
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:18.340
So now if we go over to our code, well, we can see here at the top, Iceland is disabled since his

21
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.830
execution has not been approved or denied yet.

22
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.280
OK, so it's telling us press the light bulb.

23
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.870
So if we look at this.

24
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.030
Yes, Lintas disabled.

25
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.980
Right, so let me go through that again, so if we if we go here and if we press peak problem, we can

26
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.980
see a light bulb here, right.

27
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.900
Show fix problems and then we'll manage the library execution and this will pop up.

28
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.610
The excellent extension will use node modules, Esslin for validation, which is installed locally.

29
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.500
Do I want to allow and then I want to say allow everywhere to remember this choice.

30
00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:05.150
And so that in itself is going to enable us to lift in line, so let's say I went back here and I instead

31
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.520
of doing this, I put margin top 10, Fleck's one.

32
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.720
Well, now I can see in line that, hey, I'm breaking a rule, no inline styles.

33
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.260
So I already automatically know that something's going wrong.

34
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.760
And if I put a comma at the end, it's going to double up on me, is going to say, hey, hey, Mo,

35
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.010
you're doing two things wrong.

36
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.460
And I'm like, whoa, whoa, sorry, sorry.

37
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.100
So I'll just remove that and I'll put styles that list.

38
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.320
Right, and and all as well.

39
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.660
Isn't that easy?

40
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.130
That's amazing.

41
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.150
So now we can enforce our consistency throughout the project.

42
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.200
That's awesome.

43
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.930
All right, so with that, let's look at how to optimize prettier as well.
