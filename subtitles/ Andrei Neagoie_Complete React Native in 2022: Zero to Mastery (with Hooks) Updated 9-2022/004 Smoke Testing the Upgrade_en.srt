1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,910
If everything went to plan, really nothing should have changed at all.

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:05,290
Right.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,840
Because we only updated the foundation.

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:16,180
So if the upgrade is successful and it should be really our app should just continue to work as it is.

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:17,650
So let's take a look at the.

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,250
Let's go ahead and run the app.

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,240
And by doing this, we'll start our bundler.

8
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:30,080
And what we'll do is over here.

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:39,540
Will Reload, which will grab the bundle from the Metro BUNLAR, which is now running on version 43

10
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,530
of Expo.

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,320
And if everything has gone to plan, what we should see here is a fully functioning app.

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,880
I'm already logged in.

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,330
My mock data is loading in and.

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,400
Seems like my app works perfectly fine, right?

15
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:02,700
We always have to do a smoke test after an upgrade and ensure the functionality works as intended right,

16
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:09,810
and that everything that we put together is actually up to date.

17
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:16,470
And so by doing this, we will always, always, always ensure that our upgrades are successful.

18
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,690
Now what can you do for smoke tests?

19
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,110
Well, there's manual testing where you take the team and you say, Look, OK, here's the branch where

20
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,530
upgraded, and let's go through it together.

21
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,160
Or you can run automated tests with something like detox.

22
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:36,720
There's many, many ways to smoke test an application, but nothing passes the test like a quick run

23
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,610
through of the core functionalities.

24
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,900
And so as we can see here, our app is fully up to date.

25
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,250
We're running the new version of React.

26
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,630
We're running the new version of Expo.

27
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:52,230
The foundation of our app is set and everything just continued to work, as is.

28
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,300
That's amazing, right?

29
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,930
And so that's how you go through a secure upgrade.

30
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:04,840
And so if you wanted to upgrade any of the other parts of the app, like the navigation, the new design

31
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:12,580
system, any of those additional like perks, you would go and grab the migration guide from that package,

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,410
the regularly published the migration guides, and they'll tell you how to go through it, what code

33
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,310
you need to change.

34
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,880
But it's so nice that would expo an expo, especially.

35
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:29,110
We went through a full foundational upgrade of React Expo, a bunch of core fundamental packages, and

36
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,640
our app continued to work.

37
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,000
Now, is this always going to be this way?

38
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:33,280
No.

39
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,100
Sometimes some things will break and then you'll have to go and you'll have to look at, you know,

40
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,130
the breaking changes guides that they link over here when you did the upgrade, right?

41
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:48,790
Remember when we said the following packages were updated, the following weren't well, they'll always

42
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,100
refer you to the release notes, right?

43
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:56,560
If there are any breaking changes or if you're skipping a couple of versions, what the prior versions

44
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,210
breaking changes were so that you can go through the documentation and kind of see.

45
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:01,820
All right.

46
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,430
Where do I need to adjust things?

47
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,490
What do I need to update?

48
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,620
And that's very important.
