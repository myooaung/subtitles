1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:06,840
Now that we have everything in order for the favorite spa and all of the different parts set up that

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:12,610
we need, what we can start doing is building out what the favorite spa is intended to look like.

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,850
So, first of all, what it needs to take in is the current favorites.

4
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,740
That is what it will be consuming.

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:26,180
And then once it has the current favorites, what it's going to return is a styled view.

6
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:34,710
So import styled from styled components made of and we're going to create a component that's called

7
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:40,980
favourite's wrapper, and that's going to be a component that is styled thought view.

8
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,620
And we're just going to give it a basic padding.

9
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,980
We're going to give it a padding of 10 pixels all around.

10
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,890
That's all that it needs.

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,890
And so we'll take that favourite's wrapper and will render it out.

12
00:00:53,660 --> 00:01:00,560
And inside of that favors wrapper, what we're going to need to do is we're going to need to put in

13
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,129
a scroll view, a scroll view from Riak Netiv Scroll.

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,690
You in that scroll view is going to work basically as our horizontal navigator.

15
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:20,270
So we'll put in a scroll view and we're going to put in the following properties on it horizontal and

16
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:27,020
show horizontal scroll indicator false, both of which are necessary to make sure that our scroll view

17
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:31,930
goes in this direction, right this direction, not this direction.

18
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,910
So from left to right, not up to down.

19
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:41,720
Once we have our scroll view set up, what we can do is we can say favourite's map.

20
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,770
I'm going to copy a code snippet here, what we can say is favorite stop map.

21
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:53,460
And then each individual restaurant is going to have its name and we're going to split and join it.

22
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,610
That's a potential that you could do on the key.

23
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,360
We don't really need this, but it's an option.

24
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:05,380
And we can say that we're going to have a concert.

25
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,490
You know what we'll do?

26
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:16,110
We'll have a spacer here that is going to be of type left, so position left.

27
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:25,050
And size is going to be equal to large or you know what, let's do medium, so we're going to have a

28
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:29,580
spacer here because we had a view that basically had an inline style, but we don't want to do that.

29
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:35,610
So we're going to import spacer from bottega spacer spacer that component.

30
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:42,750
And that's going to allow us to space the compact restaurant in for which we also need to import from

31
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:47,010
DOT's Restaurant Compact restaurant info.

32
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,770
So it's going to be a very basic setup here.

33
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,790
And then what we're going to say is that the key is equal to key.

34
00:02:54,710 --> 00:03:04,040
Right here, once we do that, if we go over here to our overview and we open it up, undefined is not

35
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,700
an object.

36
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,780
Favorite sport isn't receiving favorites, of course.

37
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:14,750
So we have to go over to the restaurant screen and we have to make sure that we in the restaurant screen

38
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:19,250
import the restaurant context.

39
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:27,720
And the low key and the favorites context, specifically, so favourite's context from favorites, slash

40
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,230
favorites, thought context.

41
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:36,110
So once we have our favorites context, where we can go do over here is we can use the context, favorite

42
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:36,740
context.

43
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:43,400
We can pull in the favorites, the current favorites, and we can pass them to the favorites bar like.

44
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:49,840
So now here you asking me why do it this way as opposed to having the favorites bar.

45
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,950
Just use the context directly.

46
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:59,180
Well, the reason for that is the favorite bar should be able to receive its favorites at any given

47
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,210
point from anywhere, just as a prop.

48
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,070
It should be something that flows in.

49
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:08,100
And so the question then becomes, well, why didn't we do that to the favorites component?

50
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,910
Why does that one take in a restaurant but kind of hook itself on to the context?

51
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:18,860
And that is because we consider this favorite to be more of a module.

52
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,769
It's kind of a self-contained feature of sorts.

53
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,100
It interacts without any outside help and it's just there to position itself.

54
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:33,480
If we were to take in all of these different methods from the outside, it would defeat the purpose.

55
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,950
We could even go so far as to put this inside of a module favorites folder.

56
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,160
But I decided to leave it as a favor to component.

57
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:45,210
We could even potentially rename it to favorite module.

58
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,150
But all of those are semantics.

59
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,700
It's just the reasoning behind why we're doing this.

60
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,520
If we look now at our favorite bar.

61
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,180
And we open it up.

62
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:05,840
Oh, no element type is invalid, expected a built in function, so there's something going wrong here.

63
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,980
So if we look at Favourite's Bar, it's importing from Oh.

64
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:17,830
Accidentally undid it, so this should be from favourite's and then it should be favourite's bar thought

65
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,460
component.

66
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,150
And this should allow us to render out.

67
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,990
Nothing well, that's new, and that's because we don't have any favorites, so once we start clicking

68
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,880
favorites, oh, there we go.

69
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,610
There are our favorites.

70
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,210
This is looking good.

71
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,630
So we can import all of these.

72
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:42,420
And as we import all of them, you can see them pop up here.

73
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:48,540
And once they pop up, they basically become usable right out of the get go.

74
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:54,130
And so removing them will remove them from the list in the position that they were in.

75
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:58,840
And so we can quickly see here that we will push them to the back of the stack.

76
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,610
If we add them back, we can hide and show our favorites bar.

77
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,650
But there's one crucial thing missing.

78
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:14,840
In the fevered spa, we're unable to click on the compact restaurant info, and so one thing we would

79
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:23,330
want to do here is add a touchable opacity and once we add the touchable opacity, we would add it around

80
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:30,080
the compact restaurant info and on press, we would say navigate.

81
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,840
So on press, we could say.

82
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:43,340
Go go to detail and go to detail, would come in as a prop or we could say on detail, let's call it

83
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:52,280
on detail, and when we say on detail, what we're going to do here in our restaurants screen is we're

84
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,460
going to pass it a function to go to Anta detail.

85
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,940
And that's going to be the same function that we basically use over here.

86
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:06,470
But we're going to pass it in here and we're going to say on detail equals and we're going to pass it.

87
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:11,600
Not the full navigation, but we'll pass it navigation, but navigate.

88
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,900
And that will allow us to go inside of Favourite's Bar.

89
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,430
Let's call it I'll navigate that feels better on navigate.

90
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:30,960
And then in the restaurant screen, we'll call it on navigate and then we'll be able to copy the same

91
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,870
body that we put inside of here.

92
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:38,220
And when we go inside of our favorite spa, then once we have the touchable opacity, what we can do

93
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:43,370
is we can say on navigate as a function return and there we go.

94
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,580
That'll work a bit better.

95
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:52,920
Now, we don't have any favorites, so once we add them, we can quickly see here that we can.

96
00:07:53,740 --> 00:08:01,480
No, if they are favored it or not, and once we click them, we know where they are, we can go see

97
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,490
the detail of them.

98
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,780
That is absolutely amazing.

99
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,990
And so now we know all of our favorites.

100
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,820
Little thing we could add here to the top is potentially some texts.

101
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:24,430
So let's import text from Thugged typography text and we'll add some text with a spacer around it.

102
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:32,700
Right up here and we'll call it favourite's, and so now we know that we're looking at our favorites,

103
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:38,909
the things that we favorite it so far, and that allows us to better understand what is going on up

104
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:40,309
here and what are we looking at.

105
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:41,640
Amazing.

106
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,870
So we just built out our entire favorite spa, but there's a small issue.

107
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:50,880
When we reload, we lose all of our favorites.

108
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,980
And so nothing is rendering out.

109
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,540
And so we shouldn't be rendering out if we don't have any favorites.

110
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:03,120
So one thing we should add into here is a return up here and then down here.

111
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,350
Let's close it off.

112
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,320
And what we'll do is we'll say.

113
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:14,230
If favourite's the length.

114
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:21,460
Does not exist, right, is zero, then will return, no, we won't return anything.

115
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:28,990
So just to make sure that we don't render anything out in case that way we kind of know, hey, we don't

116
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:29,820
have any favorites.

117
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:35,310
And then once we select one, OK, it's pretty obvious that it will show up in the list.

118
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:36,580
Great.

119
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:42,010
But we also need to figure out how we're going to store favorites, how we're going to store favorites

120
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:42,940
between sessions.

121
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,680
Even so, let's take a look at that.
