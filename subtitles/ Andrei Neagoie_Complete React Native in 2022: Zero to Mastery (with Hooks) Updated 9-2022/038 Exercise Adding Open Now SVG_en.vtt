00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:06.180
So now that we've added the rating as Fiji on the screen, right, we've rendered it, the next thing

2
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:16.860
I want us to do is to add an open icon if the restaurant is open and I want it to be laid out over here

3
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:17.820
on the side.

4
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.200
Right.

5
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.470
I want it to be in this element, but I want it to be positioned here at the end at the end of the row.

6
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:35.640
So as part of the exercise, now I'm going to give you the Fiji that you will need in order to achieve

7
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.000
this.

8
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.290
And you can try out differently outing options to get the star rating showing, as well as the open

9
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.790
Fiji here at the end.
