00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:10,750
Next up are our Font's right here, you can see some restaurant and you can see here in our final app

2
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:16,180
that we have a way, way, way nicer font going on.

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,890
Why is it that the font isn't applying here?

4
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,430
What is going on?

5
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,910
Why isn't our font applying to our text?

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,260
What exactly do we need to do here?

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,240
Well, let's get into that.

8
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:35,380
Let's start applying our fonts, because we already went through the preparation of setting up which

9
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:42,010
fonts we're going to use here, but now we have to import them and we're going to build this super cool

10
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:49,780
component, a text component that's going to be able to hold the specific font that we are going to

11
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,350
set up.

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,810
OK, so let's get into that.
