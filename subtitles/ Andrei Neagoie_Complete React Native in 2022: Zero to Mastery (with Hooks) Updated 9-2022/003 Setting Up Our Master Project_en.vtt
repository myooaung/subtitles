WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:08.430
We made it we made it through the setup, and now that we're here, we have our development tools set

2
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.310
up, we're basically ready to hit the ground running.

3
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.410
Now, that being said, I just wanted to do a quick roundup of all the things that we've learned so

4
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.650
far.

5
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:25.450
During building focus time, we were heavily involved with the client and the snack, and we really

6
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:34.090
focused on creating and building an application that took you minimal time and had maximum output,

7
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.440
the focus time of being a timer that that basically helps you focus.

8
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.420
It was so easy to build.

9
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:48.540
And then through the setup, we saw the ability for us to take that app and run it on our own computer.

10
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.890
And one of the cruxes of that setup was the Expo Seelie.

11
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.950
Now, you may be wondering, OK, I understand what snackers snack was, the web interface that we used

12
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.960
in the browser and the client.

13
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.640
The client is what we put on our phone.

14
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.790
And then when we scan the QR code, we got everything we needed.

15
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.310
And then during the setup, I saw you use this Seelie and I set it up with you and we kind of went through

16
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.940
the motions.

17
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.300
But what is it?

18
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.280
Well, the Expo Seelie is a command line environment.

19
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.830
Now, a command line environment basically means that when we go into our terminal interface here,

20
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.430
this funny little screen that that looks like it's the matrix.

21
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.350
What we're seeing here, the terminal is basically an interface that we use to communicate with our

22
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.380
computer through text on windows.

23
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.030
It's different than on Mac and on Mac.

24
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.230
It's different than on Linux.

25
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.280
But they all have similarities to each other and they all work a bit differently.

26
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.420
And we went through the motions of using them to set up our environment.

27
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.720
Now, with that said, the command line environment for Expo is the tool that is used here in order

28
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.560
for us to be able to talk to Expo.

29
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.550
So Expo needs a bulk of tooling in order to set up everything and put everything in the right place.

30
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:07.780
And if we hit, learn more.

31
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.660
What we're going to see here is that when we go to learn more, the Expo KELLYE is the main interface

32
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.230
between the developer and the expo tools.

33
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.370
So remember how we built the snack and everything happened in the browser while we took those tools

34
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.110
that happened in the browser and we put them on our own computer and we use explicitly for creating

35
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:33.160
new projects, developing our app, publishing our app and releasing them over the air and potentially

36
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.200
building binaries and releasing them to these significant stores, the App Store or the Google Play

37
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.410
store.

38
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.110
So this this one tool has all of this functionality and we have to do some setup to get it there.

39
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.450
But it was worth it.

40
00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.630
And it also is able to manage Apple credentials and Google store.

41
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.000
So these two points are heavily involved with releasing an app to the App Store, which will get you

42
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.810
down the line.

43
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.490
We're not really concerned with it right now.

44
00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.670
What we want to focus on is the first three points, creating new projects, developing our app, running

45
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.790
the project and publishing it so that we can use it anywhere without distributing it publicly.

46
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.050
OK, so we went through the process of installing Expo Cloud globally.

47
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.210
So now it says, check the version, check the version to determine the version we're currently working

48
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.360
on.

49
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.170
So let's do that.

50
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.030
If we go into our visual studio code and we hit the little terminal tab here and we say new terminal,

51
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.120
what we'll see here is that if we clear it out, don't worry about the warnings that I get.

52
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.620
If we type in exposed space, that version and we hit enter, we'll see.

53
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.720
We're running four point zero point fifty.

54
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.660
Now, how do we know if this is the most recent version or not?

55
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:49.150
Well, if we go over to the exposed CLI on NPM and PMG dot com packages especially, you can see that

56
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.940
the most recent version is four point zero point fifteen.

57
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.510
Now, you may be running a newer version and that is completely fine.

58
00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:02.290
It's always good to get the newer and better versions because they come with increased updates, security

59
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.790
and performance.

60
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.950
They're just overall better for you to always have the newer expo.

61
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:15.610
OK, so now we know that expo runs in the terminal and we know that it has a bunch of commands.

62
00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:20.660
The commands are documented on this page, so if you ever need to go look up a command that you can

63
00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:27.530
do it XPO, you can see here they document what each and every command does.

64
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.800
You have login, XPO, log out, expl, register.

65
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.650
You can do it all through the expert interface.

66
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.090
And so you have also have xpo, who am I.

67
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.240
So let's try that out.

68
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.770
If I go back into Visual Studio Code and I type XPO, who am I, well then it's going to say I'm logged

69
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:43.540
in as maby.

70
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:50.960
So that is my XPO account and if you want to login you can type XML log in and that will allow you to

71
00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:51.460
log in.

72
00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.820
Now it's going to say you're already logged in as mobility.

73
00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.400
You want to log in as a new user.

74
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.090
I'm going to say no, but you can go through the login process here.

75
00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.440
Just be aware that if you fill in your password and you don't see the characters pop up, that's completely

76
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.740
normal.

77
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.140
Just keep filling in your password and then hit enter.

78
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.220
All right, so we know that this XPO command line interface works in this way and we can use it to do

79
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.740
command line things.

80
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:15.970
So what do we want to do now?

81
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.410
Well, what we want to do is we want to create a repository.

82
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.490
I'm just scrolling through this so that you can see all of the different commands that go into it.

83
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:25.150
Right.

84
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.150
This is the Expo commands.

85
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:33.850
Now, let's go look at how we can use it to create a new project while getting started on the process

86
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.660
to make a new project use expo in its path.

87
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.650
All right.

88
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.330
So expo in it.

89
00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:41.320
Interesting.

90
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.750
So how do we know what path we're on?

91
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:50.590
Well, if we go into visual studio code will and we type else, for instance, we can see that on my

92
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:51.040
Mac.

93
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.240
We're in a specific folder.

94
00:05:53.160 --> 00:06:00.930
Now, it may differ based on where you are, on what system you are, but what I want you to do is I

95
00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.350
don't want you to use this interface.

96
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:09.330
What I want you to do is I want you to go ahead and I want you to create a folder on your desktop,

97
00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.890
whether it be.

98
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.620
Your desktop on your Windows, your Mac or your Linux, and I want you to call that folder projects.

99
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.380
And so we're going to keep it on our desktop for now, well, we can move it to documents later on.

100
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.980
And so what I want you to do, a visual studio code is I want you to open that folder.

101
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.950
So we're going to go over to our desktop and we're going to open projects.

102
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.580
And once we open that, when we open up our terminal.

103
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.150
Now, what it's going to do for us is it's going to start off.

104
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.330
In the projects folder.

105
00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:45.490
OK, so we now know that we are in our projects folder, right?

106
00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:46.670
And there's nothing in it.

107
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.040
So now we're going to do XPO in it, meals to go.

108
00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:53.650
And this is going to.

109
00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.170
Pull up, expl, and it's going to say, hey, we're going to set up a project for you.

110
00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.700
Now, this is way different than doing it in the snack, for instance.

111
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:00.990
Right.

112
00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.670
What we're trying to do here is we're trying to set up our environment.

113
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.960
So let's go do that in the next video.
