WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.240
Now that we've lightened up our account background, now comes the most important part, building out

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.470
the content for the screen.

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.310
And in order for us to do that, what we need to do is set up some styles in order for us to create

4
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.740
that centricity or that feeling of content on the screen.

5
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.580
So originally, we sent our account cover to have a background color of zero point three.

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.600
Now, what I want us to do is I want us to build a container that's going to be securely emulate that

7
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.200
same feeling.

8
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.100
And what we're going to call it is export consed account.

9
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:44.660
Container, and that's going to equal a styled component or styled view, rather, that's going to have

10
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.550
a background color of a higher opacity or a higher capacity of white.

11
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.890
So it's going to look a little bit more white.

12
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.850
We're going to set the padding to the proper spacing.

13
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.830
And then once we have that, we're going to go to our account screen.

14
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.670
And what we're going to do is we're going to bring in that account container.

15
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.180
And that account container is basically going to contain the intractable items that are available for

16
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.050
that screen.

17
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:16.610
And it's going to create this effect that basically counteracts what we're typically seeing on the light

18
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:17.330
in the background.

19
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.120
So you see here we have a slightly more white but still high opacity block.

20
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.780
And so in that block, we can then go and put elements in order for us to log in or register.

21
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.430
I hear you're thinking, Mom, how is it we've built almost an entire app yet?

22
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.430
We haven't used the button yet?

23
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.840
Well, we have used a couple of different types of buttons, but they've more been interactive elements

24
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.210
rather than specific button presses.

25
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.650
Now, you may be wondering, well, how do we use a button?

26
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.720
And over here in Riak Native, there is a button component, a basic button component that should render

27
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.600
nicely to each platform with minimal customization.

28
00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.860
Now, it also says if this button doesn't look right for your app, you can build your own using the

29
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.160
touchable opacity or touchable without feedback.

30
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:11.150
And this allows you to basically build circular buttons or kind of customized buttons that need to need

31
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.450
that little bit of extra pizzazz for our use cases.

32
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.270
The regular button should work just fine.

33
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.340
So if we go back into our account screen, what we can do here is we can go into account thought styles

34
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:29.980
and we can specifically style a button by doing expert contact off button equals styled dot button.

35
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.420
And then what we're going to do here is we're going to adjust the attributes specifically.

36
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:43.940
So if we do the attributes and we go in and say that we want to specifically change the color, well,

37
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.040
the way that we would do that is we would change the attribute color.

38
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.470
So if we set color and then we set it to if we go look at our colors, that.

39
00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:01.220
We can import the colors from over here and then we'll probably use brand that primary.

40
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:11.990
So if we do import colors and we do that from Delta Sigma Theta, Delta slash infrastructure, slash

41
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:18.650
theme colors, and once we import colors, we can use colors, thought brand that primary.

42
00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.660
So we'll set colors, that brand, that primary.

43
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.690
And the reason we have the important colors here is because the theme is not available when you set

44
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:30.620
the attributes here.

45
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:39.500
So if we go look at that now and we went into our account screen first to set up the button.

46
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.890
Meaning going here and then saying off button.

47
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.320
If we set our off button with a title of login.

48
00:03:51.260 --> 00:04:02.120
Then we can see here in the UI that the Log-in is being set, but it's getting a very specific UI over

49
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.130
here, it's not really looking like the press me button that is over here.

50
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.590
So if we go look at press me.

51
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.440
And we see over here.

52
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:22.490
In iOS, it's specifically getting a UI that we don't particularly want if we go look on iOS now, when

53
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:30.830
we say tap play, we can see that it's going to do a UI specific representation, which looks a little

54
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:31.330
like this.

55
00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.320
These are the iOS standard buttons.

56
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.950
OK, well, that's not really what we want, is it?

57
00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.690
That's not how we want our off button to look, even though it's even though it works.

58
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.810
It's just a piece of text and it doesn't really feel buttons.

59
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:52.430
And given it's an Iowa standard, we can see here on our Android device, for instance, that if we

60
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.210
reopen, it looks like a real button.

61
00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.940
So we want that look and feel.

62
00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:58.500
Now, where can we get that?

63
00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:59.960
Well, maybe react.

64
00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.100
Native Pepper has something.

65
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.230
So let's go look at react native pepper.

66
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.500
And if we look at react native pepper.

67
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:14.400
Or react native pepper, and then we go to the getting started, we can see over here that it has a

68
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.750
button component and that button component feels a bit more like an actual button.

69
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:27.120
So let's go ahead and import that button rather than creating our own button based on the React Netiv

70
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.630
Button, because that isn't feeling quite right.

71
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.430
OK, so over here at the top will import button from Riak native paper, and then once we do that,

72
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:37.810
well, what do we need to do here?

73
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.480
OK, well, it kind of looks like this.

74
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.490
It can have an icon.

75
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.420
What do we need it to look like?

76
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.800
Well, let's let's try this one out.

77
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.350
Let's see what it looks like.

78
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:59.230
So if we do this and we say button, and instead of having it look like a camera, maybe we could try

79
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:00.600
a different type of icon.

80
00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.950
So we'll say over here, Log-in.

81
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:10.070
Then over here, if we go to icons, what we can see is that they can use your native vector icons or

82
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.990
material icons.

83
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.960
So let's open up the list and let's look for like a block.

84
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.800
And what we can see is that there's all different types of locks.

85
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:25.180
There's a lock open outline, so let's use that one.

86
00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:31.930
We can put the icon in here and then let's see what it looks like on the screen are much better.

87
00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.890
Much, much better.

88
00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.240
That looks like a real button, doesn't it?

89
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.250
But it's a bit purple.

90
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.600
So how would we adjust the color of this one?

91
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.190
Well, let's look for color so dark.

92
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:42.980
What are the color is a dark color.

93
00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:49.480
So this says whether the color is a dark color, a dark button will render with light text and vice

94
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:49.970
versa.

95
00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.820
Hmm.

96
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.160
We can also give a custom color.

97
00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.690
Well, I prefer that much more.

98
00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:01.270
So if we said, for instance, color and we said black here, what would it look like?

99
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.010
Well, that's going to render black.

100
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:04.350
OK.

101
00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.250
OK, well that works.

102
00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:14.590
Maybe we could maybe we could take this button and kind of customize it over here where we had our colors.

103
00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:22.900
So if we said expert consed off button again and instead of making off button, a styled button will

104
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:29.590
import the button from Riak native paper and instead of using style, the button will do styled button

105
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:40.990
and then we'll do that and we'll set the color to colors, dot brand, dot primary and then we'll,

106
00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.940
we'll have a primary branded button.

107
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:47.290
And over here, instead of using this, what we can do is we can import off button.

108
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:54.920
And we can use that over here and over here with a custom color.

109
00:07:56.030 --> 00:08:02.090
And if we go look at our oh, that looks much better, that all with the padlock, absolutely amazing.

110
00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:05.240
Nice touch, focus looks beautiful.

111
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.560
And now we can also create an off button for registration.

112
00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:16.220
So if we go over here and we say off button and we remove the color over here because we don't need

113
00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.900
to set the color, it's coming.

114
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.520
It's already being set externally.

115
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:27.060
And then we say, for instance, what should we set over here or register?

116
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:28.100
That's the button we need.

117
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.830
Well, they're close to each other.

118
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:33.110
So, you know, maybe we need a spacer.

119
00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:34.549
Let's import spacer.

120
00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:43.559
From dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, slash components, slash spacer slash spacer component,

121
00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:55.150
and then we can say that the spacer has a spot right over here, right around this component, and lets

122
00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.920
space it from the top.

123
00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:06.220
And once we do that, OK, the space is good, we could maybe we could maybe work on the sizing and

124
00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.340
so let's go look at our space or component once more.

125
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:17.470
And if we look at our space or component right here, we can see that it takes in the position and the

126
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:17.970
size.

127
00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:22.630
So let's adjust the size specifically and let's set that to large.

128
00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:25.620
And then that feels like better spacing.

129
00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:26.730
That feels like better spacing.

130
00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.180
But there's one more thing.

131
00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:32.140
And we need to, like, make this button look a bit more professional.

132
00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.990
So maybe we should add some padding to the button.

133
00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:47.710
If we add a padding where we do a props and we say props, thought theme thought space too, would that

134
00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:50.620
look at a much more breathable buttons?

135
00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.200
And they they interact way better this way.

136
00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:01.560
Although you can see that the clickable area is centered, so you can see exactly where you're clicking.

137
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.400
That's that's pretty nice.

138
00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:04.090
It's pretty neat.

139
00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:07.680
And so now that we have this set up, let's make them interactive.

140
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.090
Let's make them go somewhere.

141
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:18.030
And as we said before, whenever we have a screen that is directly linked to a route right here, which

142
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:24.450
is main, main is account screen, if we go to our account screen, we should have navigation available.

143
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.100
So we'll grab navigation here.

144
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:33.560
And then we can say navigation, dot navigate and we can tell it to go to lagom right over here.

145
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.590
Navigation, dot navigate and we'll go to lagom.

146
00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:45.790
And then down here, we'll say navigation, not navigate, and we'll go to register, so log in and

147
00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:50.210
register and that should do it if we press login.

148
00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.120
There we go.

149
00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:53.770
We're on the login screen if you press register.

150
00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.870
Oh, well, register with the navigator payload.

151
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:04.370
So apparently we do not have a register route.

152
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.300
Let's go look at our account navigator.

153
00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:10.020
Looks like I made a small typo, very important to fix those.

154
00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:14.910
And so now if we hit register, we'll go over to our register screen.

155
00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:16.130
Awesome.

156
00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:20.390
So we have that full interactivity working and it's looking pretty sweet.

157
00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:27.090
Next, we'll work on kind of getting the login screen in the register screen in a good state and then

158
00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:31.560
we'll we'll add on some nifty little things like the animation in the title and all that good stuff.
