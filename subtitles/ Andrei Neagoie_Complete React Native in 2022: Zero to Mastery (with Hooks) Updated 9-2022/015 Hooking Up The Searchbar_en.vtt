1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:06.870
So now that we know the majority of how the context works, how the service works and how it all inter

2
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.970
operates, we can clean up our code here.

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.600
So let's remove our control logs because we don't need the logs everywhere.

4
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.420
And what we want to do now is we want to remove our use effect here, and I'm going to show you why

5
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.450
we don't need this right away.

6
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.250
What we need to do right now is we need to build a search component.

7
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:32.810
And that search component is going to live inside of the components folder of the restaurant features.

8
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.340
So we're going to do search that component.

9
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.210
Dargis.

10
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.320
And so this search component is basically what it's going to do.

11
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:42.750
Blank canvas here.

12
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.640
We're going to import react from react.

13
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:54.350
What we need to do right now is we need to go into our restaurant screen and right over here we built

14
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.880
this search bar and search container.

15
00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.350
So we're going to copy that out because we're going to build a standalone search functionality that

16
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.210
we're going to call search.

17
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.250
And it's just going to stand alone and it's going to talk to the location context on its own.

18
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.730
And it's basically going to be encapsulated right here and it's going to live inside feature restaurant.

19
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:19.280
So we're going to do export consed search and then we're going to declare the function body and what

20
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.260
we're going to do inside of here, we're going to have a search container, which we need to pull out

21
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.550
of the restaurant screen.

22
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.160
So once we do that, we'll grab it, we'll put it over here.

23
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:37.270
And what we need to do is we need to import styled from styled components native.

24
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.670
And so by doing that, now we have our search container.

25
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.700
The one other thing we're missing is our search bar, which we also need to pull out.

26
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.400
So we'll take that and we'll put it over here.

27
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:56.390
And so now we basically have our search bar as if it were integrated in a separate feature.

28
00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.680
Correct, because it's running in its own component folder over here.

29
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.310
OK.

30
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.380
So now what we want to do is we want to pull use context and what we're going to do is we're going to

31
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.539
say consed search context.

32
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.040
Is equal to use context of and then we're going to do location context.

33
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.510
Now, sorry, we're going to call it location context, excuse me, and that's equal to the U.S. context

34
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.100
of location context naming is important.

35
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.680
The variable names are so, so important.

36
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.580
And oftentimes I'll tell you so hard and I'm working on the search feature and I think I'm using the

37
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.170
search context, but actually I'm using the location context that has a search function.

38
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.470
It's it can get confusing, honestly.

39
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.650
So what we're going to do now is we're going to import location context and we're going to import that

40
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.060
from that.

41
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.440
That's all that's left our thoughts.

42
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.080
And then we're going to go into services.

43
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.680
We're going to go in the location and we're going to grab location, the context.

44
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.630
And so by doing that, what we're going to grab is the location context.

45
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:07.310
So if we console that log location context, where we're going to see in here is the ability for us.

46
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:16.340
If we grab this, we close this and we open our terminal, what we're going to see in here is an error.

47
00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:23.450
And that is because obviously we need to import search into our restaurant list.

48
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.590
So let's go and do that.

49
00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:32.870
So let's do import search and let's say from both components search.

50
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:43.300
And save that and so with that, let's put that let's group the imports for the imports that are coming

51
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.570
from here.

52
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.190
I like to group imports together.

53
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.720
Just makes it feel a little bit cleaner.

54
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.600
So two views with the same name.

55
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.800
Let's dismiss that.

56
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.570
Let's reload here.

57
00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:04.210
And what we're going to see is that now that we have this context right in here, if we scroll up beyond

58
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:11.410
our error here, what we're going to see is that we have search location, keyword is loading and error.

59
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.950
And so because we have all of that information, what we can do now is in our search component, what

60
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.350
we're going to do is we're going to start layering it.

61
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.560
Like I said, we're going to layer like a cake.

62
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:32.740
So the placeholder is going to be placeholder, is going to be search for a location and then what's

63
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.190
going to be the icon?

64
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.980
Well, let's work on the icon later.

65
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:42.880
Let's say that the value is equal to we can say we're going to use state here, use state.

66
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:51.430
And what we're going to say is that we're going to have the const search keyword and then set search

67
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.390
keyword and that's going to be equal to you state.

68
00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:02.530
Now we want to move this line down because what we want to do is we want a default, the search keyword

69
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.680
to a value on location context.

70
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.560
And that is going to be if we go into location, context, the keyword.

71
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.070
So we're going to grab keyword from here and we're going to set it as the default.

72
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.770
And that is going to be set as the default value inside of the search bar.

73
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:27.040
And by doing that, what we're going to see over here is once we remove our console log because that's

74
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.930
breaking, once we remove that, we can see that San Francisco is being filled in by default.

75
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:38.680
And this is coming from the location context, default value that we have over here because we set that

76
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.400
to San Francisco.

77
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.330
Now let's set it to look proper, right.

78
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.230
So we set it by default to San Francisco and that's filling in here.

79
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.250
And so we're tracking local.

80
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.270
State over here.

81
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.630
Right?

82
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:50.290
Right here.

83
00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.280
We're tracking local.

84
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.670
State.

85
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.620
Why are we tracking local, state?

86
00:05:53.950 --> 00:06:00.150
Because this component needs to be able to track what the search keyword is that you're filling in.

87
00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:06.610
But this one only needs to know once you submit what the key word is going to be.

88
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:07.300
Right.

89
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:14.590
We're going to trigger the search function here at a certain point with a key word from the search keyword.

90
00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:20.790
And that's going to be internally then set from then on to the keyword in the location context provider.

91
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:27.340
So we're having this back and forth between what the component is storing and what the location context

92
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.450
will eventually store.

93
00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:33.760
But the location complex will only store that once we run the search function.

94
00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:41.200
OK, so knowing that what we need to do now is we need to add some extra properties to this search bar.

95
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.480
And the extra properties that we're going to add is we're going to add on, submit editing.

96
00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:55.070
And on submit, editing is a function that is going to allow us to trigger the search.

97
00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:00.490
And so what we're going to do inside of here is this is where we're going to trigger our search and

98
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.360
we're going to trigger it with the search keyword.

99
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.740
So when you submit the editing, that's when the search is going to occur.

100
00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:10.610
But we still need to set the search keyword to whatever is happening inside of here.

101
00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:17.770
So let's say on change text, and this is going to be a lifecycle method that is going to trigger every

102
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:25.030
time the text changes, we're going to say every time the text changes, we're going to set the search

103
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.760
keyword to text.

104
00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:36.100
Now, the one thing we don't want to do is if we don't have text, right, if the text length doesn't

105
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.200
exist, let's just not do anything.

106
00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:39.760
We don't really want to do anything.

107
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.870
In that case, let's just return exit early.

108
00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:50.260
And so what we can see here and let's go into our location context provider and let's just add a quick

109
00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:52.810
search keyword trigger here.

110
00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.670
Let's console that log here.

111
00:07:55.570 --> 00:08:00.640
And then if we open up, we closed this and we open up our terminal, but we're going to see inside

112
00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.860
of our terminal is this search keyword updating.

113
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:09.160
So if we scroll all the way to the bottom and then we clear this and we say Antwerp, what we're going

114
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.440
to see is Antwerp's coming in.

115
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:15.280
And then if we do Chicago, Chicago will come in to our search context.

116
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:20.110
And then if we do, for instance, Philadelphia.

117
00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:20.800
Right.

118
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:26.340
Well, seems to be a small bug here, so we need to be able to figure that out.

119
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:30.310
Philadelphia, what's going to happen is we'll get Philadelphia.

120
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:38.980
OK, so now we're getting the input from this search box right into our context.

121
00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:43.570
But there's still this small little case of a bug here that's basically happening.

122
00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:46.650
And this is because, oh, we added this.

123
00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:55.260
So this is not something that we want to add, like the return case here is what's causing this to happen.

124
00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.340
So, Filla Delphia.

125
00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:04.860
Is going to happen, one of the things that we need to be aware of here, doing checks, right.

126
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:10.620
It would stand to reason that if text didn't have a length, we wouldn't want to set the search keyword.

127
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:11.570
Right?

128
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:15.540
Well, we do still want to set the search keyword over in here.

129
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:20.940
But what we don't want to do is in the location context, in the location context.

130
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:24.420
What we don't want to do is we want to say if search keyword.

131
00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:27.020
Dot length.

132
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:35.790
If that doesn't exist, then we would want to, for instance, say, hey, don't do anything right,

133
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.740
don't do anything.

134
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.470
So here we could do an early return.

135
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:46.440
And what that's going to do is it's going to cause us not to do like an overabundance of API calls.

136
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:46.800
Right.

137
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:49.170
So, for instance, if we did hear Chicago.

138
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.270
Right, well, I removed the console log, but I would return Chicago.

139
00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:57.420
But now I can easily remove all of the text here.

140
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:03.480
And we're not sending the search keyword, but if I hit enter, I may set the search keyword here.

141
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:08.550
But when it comes into my context provider, well, I'm going to bail out on my search because I don't

142
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.230
want to search for an empty location.

143
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:12.330
That doesn't really make sense for me.

144
00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.280
I'm not there yet.

145
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.830
I like what and what am I searching for at this point?

146
00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:18.710
We don't want to trigger that API call.

147
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:24.600
Now, there's a difference between doing it on the on change text versus in the location context.

148
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:29.010
And I wanted to show that because you can inadvertently cause bugs by doing this.

149
00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:33.660
OK, so now we've hooked up our search component as a standalone feature.

150
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:36.840
It's interacting back and forth with the context.

151
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:42.390
It's setting the keyword and then passing it into the search function that eventually will search for

152
00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:43.170
the location.

153
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.640
And then at the location level, we can console that log our result.

154
00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:48.480
Right.

155
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:54.380
And then we'll see that we're actually getting back the proper results that we expect.

156
00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:58.470
So if we look here at Chicago, we'll see that we're getting something.

157
00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:01.530
If we do Toronto, we get along attitude, latitude.

158
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:06.390
If we do Philadelphia, what we're going to see is that we're not getting anything.

159
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.760
Rather, we may be getting an error.

160
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:12.840
So let's console that log error and let's see what's going on in there.

161
00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:17.490
And so we can see that the back and forth is actually working as intended.

162
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:19.830
So if you do Philadelphia, it's going to say not found.

163
00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:25.140
If we do some other place, some other place, it's going to say not found.

164
00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:27.660
And so that's very important to keep in mind.

165
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:34.100
We have our end to end hook up of the flow and the search component is working, so now what we want

166
00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:40.700
to do is we want to hook up what's coming back from this location that we're passing, we're passing

167
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:46.160
down, and we want to give it to the restaurant context.

168
00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:47.410
So let's look at how that would work.
