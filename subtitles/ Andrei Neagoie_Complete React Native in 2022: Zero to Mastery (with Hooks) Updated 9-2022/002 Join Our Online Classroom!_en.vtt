00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.710
Hey there.

2
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.710
This is Andre.

3
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.960
You're about to dive into the course.

4
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:05.640
But here's the truth.

5
00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:08.100
Most people won't finish this course.

6
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.330
Why?

7
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.870
It's because doing a course from the comfort of your home is going to take something away.

8
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.590
That is one of the most critical parts of doing anything challenging and worthwhile.

9
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.480
Accountability.

10
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.370
It's a lot harder to stop going to elementary school than to stop watching an online course.

11
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.830
Right.

12
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.180
But here's the thing.

13
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:37.070
There is a way to guarantee right now that you will finish the course and you will get through the XHTML

14
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.720
courses no matter how hard they get.

15
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.450
And trust me, it's going to get hard because we want to teach you really valuable skills.

16
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.080
And they are valuable because they're hard to acquire.

17
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.000
And this is why you're here.

18
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.110
If you don't finish the course, it's a waste of your money.

19
00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.360
But if you finish the course, we truly believe it will get you the skills that you want.

20
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.570
So this is why you're going to do that.

21
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.340
Might put you outside your comfort zone.

22
00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:10.860
But it will be extremely effective in increasing your chances of success.

23
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.030
Ready for it?

24
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.880
You're going to come join our online classroom.

25
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.160
In the next lecture, I'll provide a private link only for XDR-TB students.

26
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.640
In there, there are three things I will ask you to do.

27
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.060
One is to introduce yourself to the community.

28
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.780
You can share as little or as much as you want about yourself.

29
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.230
I'm going to finish x course by this date and put that date in your calendar to.

30
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.800
Number two, go to Accountability Buddies channel.

31
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.570
Well, that's a that's a mouthful.

32
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.460
And find someone who is starting a team course right now at the same time.

33
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.500
It doesn't have to be the same course.

34
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.570
And you can have multiple partners.

35
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.670
You're going to make sure that you each finish the course and the goals you set out to do.

36
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.770
Finally, number three, hang out in the general chat and talk about anything that you want.

37
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.340
You will also have, of course, specific channels that you can chatting.

38
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.550
You want to be surrounded by other learners like you to stay motivated and being part of a class.

39
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.820
Now in here we're also going to have virtual hangout sessions with myself, others, ETM instructors

40
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:20.540
and students.

41
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.060
I recommend having the discourse server open as you go through the course and as you are learning.

42
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.210
Now, I'm not saying this to sell you something.

43
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.470
This is simply a fact of learning when you learn in a group.

44
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.890
When you surround yourself with other learners, when you have accountability, you are more likely

45
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:40.550
to succeed.

46
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.810
It's a fact.

47
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.120
Finally throughout the course, as you encounter problems or challenges, don't give up.

48
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.840
Come back to our Discord server and ask questions and get help.

49
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.170
But most importantly, as you start to learn and grow your skills, come here and help out other students.

50
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.750
Teaching and helping others is one of the best ways to retain the information you just learned.

51
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.500
If you create this routine around your learning, opening up discord, start watching the lessons.

52
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.920
Surround yourself with others that have similar goals to you.

53
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.740
You will have the accountability and the support system to finish the course, I promise you.

54
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.870
Oh, and another fun bit.

55
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.270
When you finish the course, you post your certificate in the alumni channel to become an alumni.

56
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.350
And then, who knows?

57
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.760
The people that really are stars of the community become star mentors.

58
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:31.540
Ooh, you.

59
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.390
Now, this all may sound silly.

60
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.670
You may say that you don't need anybody.

61
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:43.240
But trust me, we've been doing this for many years, and there is this consistent trend of those that

62
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.470
finish the course, get hired, and find success in their careers.

63
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.360
You have to do the things that are uncomfortable sometimes to succeed.

64
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.130
So that's it.

65
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.280
See you in the next lecture and see you in our community.
