00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:06.960
Now that we have our focus subject, visualize, the next thing we want to do is actually add a progress

2
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.060
bar in the progress bar is an indicator that shows the user, Hey, this is how I'm tracking towards

3
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.580
my goal because OK, the countdown timer is nice.

4
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:22.410
And you know, we all know, Hey, we're looking at this and we kind of are aware that one minute,

5
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.350
59 seconds, 58 seconds and so forth, we can see time.

6
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.280
We can visualize time.

7
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.410
Look at this as a nice to have.

8
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:35.670
From the usability perspective, we're trying to add some flair to our UI, some nice little sprinkles

9
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.990
that are additive.

10
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.690
And so if we look at React native paper, which we've been using, they also have a progress bar.

11
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.480
And so again, they show the usage, import progress, bar and colors from React native paper.

12
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.390
It's pretty straightforward.

13
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.930
It takes a progress prop.

14
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.610
The default value is zero.

15
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.870
And the progress is a value between zero and one.

16
00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:58.740
OK.

17
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.010
So knowing that let's go back over to our snacks, so we already have react native paper available here.

18
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.330
Now one thing I always like to do is I like to keep the relative imports below the absolute ones, so

19
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.700
we'll import progress.

20
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:16.190
Bar.

21
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:26.870
And we'll do that from React need of people now that we have a progress bar in here, is that all we

22
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:27.200
need?

23
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.380
Probably we're going to create our own colors.

24
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.320
So what we'll do is we'll actually go down here.

25
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.150
And should we add it here, let's have it here for now.

26
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:50.000
Let's create a view, and let's say that the style has a padding top.

27
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.170
Of spacing.

28
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.080
Thought, let's do small, and then what we'll do is we'll add our progress bar here.

29
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.940
Now one thing we need to add to the progress bar is the actual color.

30
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.560
So we'll do color is equal to.

31
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:15.010
And right now it's purple colors, dot and what colors that we have.

32
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.800
Let's go take a look at our colors again.

33
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.480
Well.

34
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.370
Those seem to be clicking through colors that dark blue, so let's add colors, the dark blue.

35
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.630
And let's see what that gives us.

36
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.640
Oh, we can't see it.

37
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.900
That means we need a lighter blue, so how do we go about that?

38
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.990
Well, you need to pick something that contrasts well to the blue.

39
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.980
You already have.

40
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.160
So let's go over here and let's say progress bar.

41
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.720
And let's add a color here.

42
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.080
Then let's go back to our timer and let's say color that progress bar.

43
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.400
That's a nice color.

44
00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.630
Now, one thing I want to do is I want to give this progress bar a proper heights, we'll say Hide 20.

45
00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.550
Oh, that seems to be a lot.

46
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.470
So let's give it 10.

47
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.040
Now, it's nice, invisible where it's going to count down, but actually, we could also just say spacing,

48
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.070
not small, which is an eight and everything will be consistent within the paradigm of the UI.

49
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.660
So now that we have that, we actually have to hook it up.

50
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:36.510
So it takes the prop progress, which we know, and we'll hook that up to a variable progress here that

51
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.310
we're going to define up here.

52
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.280
Now, how do we get variables again?

53
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.250
Well, we need you state.

54
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:50.280
So what we'll say is we're going to track a contest progress and we're going to set progress.

55
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.730
And we're going to say that that's equal to a U.S.

56
00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.420
State.

57
00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.940
Of what?

58
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.270
So we're going to track Oh.

59
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.150
Should that actually be won or should it be zero, should we count down from the top to the bottom or

60
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.900
the bottom to the top?

61
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.270
Well, in my opinion, you count down from 100, which is 100 percent of the time backwards.

62
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.339
So we're seeing that, hey, our progress bar is starting at the full amount of time and we're going

63
00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:21.209
to count backwards.

64
00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.410
So we're setting it to one.

65
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.290
If we set it to zero, then it would track from zero forwards.

66
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.220
So now we have our progress indicator that's actually set.

67
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:41.030
Now, if we remember correctly, our own progress here has a function, so that would probably give

68
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:49.160
us back the progress and what we could do here is, we could say, set progress to the progress.

69
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.930
Now how do we know that this progress is the correct progress?

70
00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.630
Well, let's go look at our countdown component and let's go look if we remember correctly.

71
00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:04.940
You know, every time we count down, we're setting the amount of milliseconds to track towards zero.

72
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:16.260
And so Countdown takes the on progress here and whenever we count down over here in this huge effect,

73
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:23.160
every time release counts down were dividing the amount of milliseconds by the amount of minutes to

74
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:29.850
release, and that will give us a number that's either, you know, tracking towards zero because it

75
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.940
can be like zero point nine zero point eight zero point seven.

76
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.810
We're giving the percentage number that kind of correlates to tracking down to zero.

77
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.980
So if we do that and we set the progress here, we don't actually need these brackets around here.

78
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.920
They're nice to have.

79
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.610
If we don't start our timer.

80
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.320
What we'll see is that, oh, it's tracking towards zero.

81
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.730
There we go.

82
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.300
Our timer is now hooked up.

83
00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:05.200
Now the one thing we would want to do, probably here is say that will have a function.

84
00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.270
On progress that's going to track.

85
00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:10.990
Well, you know what we could do.

86
00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:20.580
We could probably just give set progress to our progress because remember, progress is the equivalent

87
00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.620
of a function that takes the value and then sets the value right.

88
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:36.510
So like values set progress value is the same thing as giving set progress directly to on progress.

89
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.280
So now if we press start.

90
00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.330
It's still tracking down amazing.

91
00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:47.130
We've now hooked up our progress bar.

92
00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:48.880
That's awesome.

93
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:55.420
Now in the next video, we'll be looking at vibrating the phone once the timer has countdown fully.
