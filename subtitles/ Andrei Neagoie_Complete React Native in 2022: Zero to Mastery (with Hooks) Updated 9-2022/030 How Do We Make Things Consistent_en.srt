1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:07,260
Now that we see the benefits of using styled components and specifically using styled components to

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:15,420
compose elements that will form our user interface in a semantically pleasing way, and all those words

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,220
basically mean we're creating components that have nice names.

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,830
There's one more thing I promise to you, and that was consistency.

5
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,840
And in order to achieve consistency, we have to use something called a theme.

6
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:36,570
Now, if we go look at Riak native specifically style components for Riak native, when we go to the

7
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,380
advanced section, we can start talking about theming.

8
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:46,320
You see, styled components has full theming support by using something called a theme provider.

9
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,370
Now a theme provider is a wrapper component.

10
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,480
So think of it like something that we put around the app Shell.

11
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,350
And then suddenly everything inside of the app has access to the theme object.

12
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,600
It's kind of like a global state of sorts.

13
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,220
This component provides the theme to all the components underneath itself through the context API.

14
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,000
Now what is the context API?

15
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:17,610
Well, if we go look at react context, what context is, is it provides a way to pass data through

16
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,840
components without having to pass props down manually at every level.

17
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,700
Now if you've never written react before, this may be very new to you.

18
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:27,810
But don't worry.

19
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,350
Basically context is a way for us to share things globally.

20
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,100
We can share methods, we can share data, we can share anything globally.

21
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,520
And so you can read up on context here.

22
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,480
And basically there are a couple of ways that you can utilize context.

23
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,630
And the theming in styled components is one of those ways.

24
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,120
Now, as you can see over here, this is the normal way that you would normally write a style button

25
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,140
in HTML.

26
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,120
This is not a Riak native version, but bear with me.

27
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:05,690
And if you look at it in a themed approach, this would be the way that you would apply a theme, see,

28
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:10,940
this is how you would apply a color if you were to use the theme props that theme dot mean.

29
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:20,240
So you can obviously put together a theme that has all of the properties that we would need.

30
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,690
Right.

31
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,650
In order to achieve consistency across.

32
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,290
And we can theme a bunch of different things.

33
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,570
So let's get into setting up our theme.
