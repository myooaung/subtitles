00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:07.689
In this video, we're going to talk about how to contribute to open source and actually take you through

2
00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:08.230
the steps.

3
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.400
But first, for those who don't know what is open source.

4
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:21.580
Well, a lot of technology that has been created on the Internet that we know today has been built on

5
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:28.540
top of open source projects and open source projects means that anybody can view the code.

6
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:36.550
Anybody can see the code of a program, can inspected, can modify it, can enhance it in this way.

7
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:43.180
The idea is that by sharing this information with everybody, we get everybody's input and we use the

8
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.910
collective mind to improve software.

9
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.050
Not only that, but it also benefits everybody.

10
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.500
Right.

11
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:59.050
For example, the most famous example of an open source project is Linux, an operating system just

12
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:05.770
like Windows or Mac OS, except it's built by everyday programmers.

13
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.280
And it's code that is completely open sourced, anybody can inspect the code, add on to it.

14
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:23.740
And it's become so successful that most of the cloud that we know of the servers usually run Linux,

15
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.220
RWC, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, all of them use Linux.

16
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.910
Some of you might be running Linux right now as you watch this video.

17
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.350
So not only do you get to work with other developers from around the world where you can build great

18
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.240
projects, but just working in teams by learning how open source works.

19
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.250
Well, you don't have to create something as big as Linux, you can create a project with a friend,

20
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.470
something very small and simple, it doesn't really matter.

21
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:06.280
The idea is of collaboration, of openness and sharing code to hopefully improve on the collective knowledge.

22
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.060
Finally, a lot of employers actually look upon open source contribution as a plus.

23
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.440
So if you're able to put in your resume that you're an open source contributor, well, that's a good

24
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.750
sign.

25
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:27.630
Plus, it teaches you valuable skills using get in GitHub to work in teams if you're looking for job

26
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.400
experience, but you don't have a job.

27
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.970
Contributing to open source is the perfect way for you to learn how to work in teams and mimic a work

28
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:36.930
like scenario.

29
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.340
This is a really important video and something I'm really excited about.

30
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:48.120
So let's show you how to make your first opensource contribution, improve your resume, learn some

31
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.170
real life skills and have fun along the way.

32
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.610
Now, we've actually created some open source projects for you for this course.

33
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:06.120
We have the zero to mastery repository here, where we can see that we have about 64 projects open right

34
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.220
now with about 2000 contributors, that's a lot of people and this number is bound to increase.

35
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.350
Now, this place was created as a practice ground for you, a playground.

36
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.550
Nobody will yell at you.

37
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.750
If you break things, you can contribute ad silly things, whatever you want.

38
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.750
It's a testing ground.

39
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.430
The idea is to have as much fun as possible and make it as easy as possible to contribute to open source.

40
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.980
Now, within that organization, we have a great community of administrator or management team that

41
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.380
will help you with these open source projects.

42
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.600
By the way, who are these administrators?

43
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.860
They're right here, ignore my name, I help out as well, but they do a lot of the heavy lifting and

44
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.620
they are past students just like you that have had a bit of experience.

45
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:06.610
Now, most of them are working full time, but they are now helping out the community by helping with

46
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:07.420
our open source.

47
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.830
Projects are discord and generally just helping our community grow.

48
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.980
So shout out to them if you get a chance.

49
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.839
Say hi to them on this court.

50
00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:20.380
They definitely do a lot for this community.

51
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.320
They're very active on discord and they really help maintain all of our open source projects.

52
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.450
So let's learn how to make our very first opensource contribution.

53
00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.270
I do want to note here that this isn't the only way for you to contribute to open source.

54
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.310
This is just a playground that we've created for you.

55
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.190
But once you contribute here, you could go off and contribute to all the other open source projects

56
00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.150
all over GitHub.

57
00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.710
They can find you can contribute to projects like react and Angular.

58
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.390
The world is your oyster.

59
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.210
Or you can just stick to these as we actually have a ton of projects here that are fun.

60
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.690
We have events going on like October 1st.

61
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.850
Well, we'll get to that shortly.

62
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.750
We definitely have a great community of developers and we can create some awesome projects together.

63
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.970
Now, the way you want to get started is to first go to the start here guidelines.

64
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:24.890
Now, in the start here guidelines, and I'll link to this page, you actually have a four step guide

65
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.830
to get started.

66
00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.980
The first thing you want to do is to actually watch the kid started guideline.

67
00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:38.570
A fellow student actually created this guide for you to follow the steps that I'll mention in this video.

68
00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.790
So you always have this as a reference.

69
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.870
So after this video, definitely check out this document as a reference.

70
00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:51.830
But otherwise, once you've browsed through the document is, well, make your first pull request.

71
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.960
So if you've already watched my get and GitHub videos, you should be all set.

72
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.210
Otherwise, hopefully you're familiar with Git and GitHub.

73
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:06.740
Now, the first thing we want to do is to actually add our names to the contributors, DOT and Diffa.

74
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:14.880
In this project, so if you go up, you'll see that we have a contributor's MD which stands for Markdown

75
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:21.480
File, and if I click on here, you see that all the contributors that we have, we have over a thousand

76
00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.170
contributors.

77
00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.680
And if you scroll down, these are all their GitHub names.

78
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.150
So your first task is to actually add your name to this list.

79
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.080
So how can we do this?

80
00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.030
Well, we can just clone this repository.

81
00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:45.360
But a more recommended way of usually contributing to open source is to fork the project for essentially

82
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:51.340
means copy over the entire project and put it on your own GitHub profile.

83
00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:57.930
So if I click here and we see over here, they can select where you want to for the project and you

84
00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.430
want to select your profile.

85
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:07.660
So once we fought this project, we make a copy of it, it's like we own this repository now with our

86
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.200
own version of the start here guidelines.

87
00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:18.370
So once we have this, we can clone this repository using S.H. or whatever you prefer.

88
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.510
In my case, I'll use S.H. so that I don't have to use my password every time.

89
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.520
I can now say git clone and clone this repository.

90
00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:36.390
Now we can and to start here guidelines and we can't open this up in our favorite text editor.

91
00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.760
Now, once here, let's clear this.

92
00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:50.880
We have the contributors file, which we need to add our name to now, I can see here the contributors

93
00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:56.310
file is getting quite long because while we got a lot of students who are contributing to open source,

94
00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:02.880
but at the very end, make sure you're at the very end here, you want to add your own name.

95
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:10.160
Now, here's the thing right now we're on the master branch, but I'm going to show you what a good

96
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.010
practice is.

97
00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:19.310
We have our forked project and we want to create a new branch to work off of instead of master by saying

98
00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:28.670
Get Check-Out Dash be to create a new branch and we want to name this branch in our case, let's just

99
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:31.310
name it test fired enter.

100
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:34.940
You'll see that now I'm on a new branch called Test.

101
00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:42.820
And in this branch, I can add my name to this contributor list, in your case, you'll want to use

102
00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.470
your own GitHub profile.

103
00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:51.930
So we're using markdown here, which is a way, a syntax to write and has some functionality.

104
00:08:52.300 --> 00:09:00.040
For example, if we go to the contributors list, you'll notice that they are all clickable links.

105
00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.040
So we essentially use the same notation.

106
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:12.520
We do a dash square brackets with your GitHub username and then in the parentheses we just have the

107
00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:18.310
actual URL that you want to link to in our case, the GitHub user name that you have.

108
00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:21.550
So your GitHub username here, GitHub username here.

109
00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:30.520
Once we do that, we can save this file and now go back to our terminal and say, get stats.

110
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:39.150
And we see here that, yeah, we just modified our contributors, Diffa, and if I do get diff to see

111
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:44.070
any changes that we've made, we see that we've added this new line.

112
00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:46.780
So let's clear this.

113
00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:55.120
We have our name all set up, and we can now add this comment by saying good ad and dot for everything,

114
00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:04.840
will add everything and then get commit and we'll write a message says added my name to a contributor

115
00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:05.860
list.

116
00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:08.890
There we go.

117
00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:13.540
So now it's time for us to push these changes.

118
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:17.440
Now, if I do get push origin.

119
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:26.360
M. Well, right now, what that would mean is that we want to push to origin and the origin.

120
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:34.730
Is this start here guideline, which I thought so the origin is actually my version of the project,

121
00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:39.100
and if I want to push to master, that is the main branch.

122
00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:50.870
But we don't want to do that because ideally we want to be able to also change and add our name to the

123
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:55.370
original zero to Mastery's starchier guideline, because this is the main.

124
00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:06.510
So what we can do is instead of MASCIA, push to our test branch, so we say get push origin test.

125
00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:09.050
There we go.

126
00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:14.740
Now, if I go back here and go to my project and I refreshed.

127
00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.540
I now have two branches.

128
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:29.190
The master branch and also the test branch, which I just updated, so one way to do this is to click

129
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:30.780
on new pull request.

130
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:46.040
And you can add comments here, like I've added my name to the list and you can tag some of our maintainers,

131
00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:48.510
in my case, I'll just tag myself.

132
00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.300
I do create pull request.

133
00:11:54.130 --> 00:12:03.310
I now have my poor request and notice here how my poor request is now at the Zero to Mastery start here

134
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:07.660
guideline so that if I go back to our starchier guideline.

135
00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:10.130
I see that I'm part of.

136
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.480
The poor request now.

137
00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.390
And because I've tagged one of the management teams.

138
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:25.630
So in this case, it was myself or you can tag any of the management team that we have now in this case,

139
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:32.860
I'm cheating because I also help manage this so I can just myself merge the pull request.

140
00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:36.220
Most likely in your case, you won't be able to merge it yourself.

141
00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:39.460
But if I click, merge and confirm.

142
00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:43.120
There we go.

143
00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:50.360
I've merged my project, I've deleted the branch, and the pull request is closed.

144
00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:53.230
If I want, I can even delete my own fork.

145
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:55.810
But for now, let's keep it the way it is.

146
00:12:56.330 --> 00:13:03.530
Let's check the starchier guidelines and see if my name has been added to the list if I scroll all the

147
00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:04.250
way down.

148
00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.130
Hey, check that out.

149
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.810
There's my name on the list.

150
00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.570
So I've been added to the contributors list.

151
00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:12.650
That was pretty easy.

152
00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:12.940
Right?

153
00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.250
And the cool part is that now if I go to my profile.

154
00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:22.750
I actually have zero to mastery as one of my organizations.

155
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.780
So if you're able to add yourself to the contributors list, you can actually join the Zero to Mastery

156
00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:34.640
Organization and have this little icon appear on your GitHub profile.

157
00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:41.570
And lots of GitHub profiles have organizations, so people usually have their workplace icon in here.

158
00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:46.880
So it's just a nice little thing to have on your profile to show that you're involved in the programming

159
00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:47.420
community.

160
00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:56.520
So we've just made a poor request, which is step two, and that was pretty fast, right?

161
00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:04.120
Finally, the next step is to go join an actual project and start contributing the way we just learned

162
00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:07.630
in our Zero to Mastery organization.

163
00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:14.380
Now, there's actually a guy that we provide for you to figure out what project you choose, what's

164
00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:15.440
going to be good for you.

165
00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:23.890
We also have in our discord a group projects section where we can look at some of the current projects

166
00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:32.320
that are happening, or you can just go to the Zero to Mastery Organization and pick any of the repositories

167
00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:33.930
to contribute to.

168
00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:39.580
Now, in the next video, we're going to contribute to one of these projects and show you a real life

169
00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:40.840
scenario.
