1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:04,990
So we said that we were going to focus on creating a tab and navigation.

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:12,040
OK, this is possibly the most common style of navigation in mobile apps, a tab based navigation.

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:16,930
And this can be tabs at the bottom of the screen below the top bar of the heather or even inside the

4
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:17,230
header.

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:22,210
Now we're going to focus on creating a tab navigation that's at the bottom of the screen.

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:28,050
OK, now it says before continuing first install reac navigation bottom tabs.

7
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:29,140
Why is that?

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,490
Well, as we said, REAC navigation is an extensible library.

9
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:40,150
So what it's trying to achieve here is it's separating out all of its core fundamentals into separate

10
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,870
packages so that you can only install what you need.

11
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,970
And so what we need right now is the bottom tabs.

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,870
So if we take this over here and we go over to our terminal.

13
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:54,070
Right.

14
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,110
What we can see inside of the terminal is that.

15
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:06,390
We basically need to install the package, so we'll do yard add Riak navigation bottom, perhaps.

16
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,190
OK, so now we're installing the bottom top navigation and now it's giving us a basic example.

17
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:15,160
Right, a minimal example of how top navigation works.

18
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,640
So at the root level, we need our navigation container.

19
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,960
Our navigation container is going to come from react navigation netiv.

20
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:28,150
And then it says Create Bottom Tab Navigator from REAC Navigation Bottom Tabs.

21
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,320
Interesting.

22
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:29,980
Interesting.

23
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,690
And then it's giving us an example of how to set up a home screen, a setting screen.

24
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:42,040
And then it's showing us how to create a bottom PAB navigator, interesting, so we have to return a

25
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:48,280
navigation container and then we have to put a tab navigator inside of there from this TAB Navigator,

26
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,620
and then we can put screens inside of their.

27
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,830
And we can try this out on a snack as well.

28
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,570
Absolutely amazing.

29
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,690
OK, so here's the exercise I want us to do.

30
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:07,030
What I want us to do is I want us to take this example and apply it to our code base in a way that we're

31
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:12,610
going to have a restaurants screen, we're going to have a setting screen, and we're going to have

32
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:13,930
a map screen.

33
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,290
I want all three of those screens available.

34
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,680
And I want us to create kind of the functions that are going to render those screens except for the

35
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,190
restaurant screen, because for the restaurant screen, we've already built out an entire feature.

36
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:29,800
Right.

37
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:38,440
We have our restaurants that screen and where I want us to build this this initial navigation example,

38
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,850
let's build it straight.

39
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,650
An app Dot Jase's.

40
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,130
And I thought, yes, I want us to replace the restaurant screen.

41
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:52,200
I want us to follow this example to create the tab navigation that we will see at the bottom here.

42
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,680
That's going to look like this.

43
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,410
We're going to have restaurants, map and settings.

44
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:03,340
And so by replacing this and creating this, we don't have to focus on the icons just yet.

45
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,650
Don't focus on the icons at all, just get it.

46
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:11,020
Rendering the tab navigation and the ability to switch will focus on the icons later on.

47
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:17,860
I want TAB navigation in its basic form now that we have everything ready for this, and then we'll

48
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,740
look at optimizing it and cleaning it up.
