New Year, New Me A saying that you might have heard hundreds of times now it's used most often around

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:13.690
New Years to kind of solidify your New Year's resolutions with React Native and Expo, it's more so.

3
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.890
New Month New Me Right in the JavaScript ecosystem, things can move exceptionally quickly.

4
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.360
And so when we started off this project, we were around expo version 40.

5
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.980
And as of right now we're at version 43, and whatever version it's at doesn't really matter.

6
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.920
The question begs, What do we do?

7
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.760
How do we upgrade and keep our projects up to date when we use expo?

8
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:53.130
While the following videos are going to try to explain in the most simple way possible what steps you

9
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:59.430
should go through, why you should go through them, and what the end consequence is, what steps do

10
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.810
we need to take once we upgrade?

11
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.560
Because upgrading a scary upgrading has always been scary, right?

12
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.210
Especially upgrading three minor versions of Expo Right?

13
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.460
Like, if we look at the highlights, there's so many things.

14
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.380
There's experimental support for Hermes.

15
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:21.870
There's improved module infrastructure and all of these good, nice to have things right, and we want

16
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:28.090
to keep our projects up to date so that we can always have the latest versions of everything, right

17
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.370
with the new XL version.

18
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:36.060
We're upgrading to a new version of React Native, and we're getting the new version of React for Free.

19
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:43.890
And so these videos are not intended to kind of like push you through and get you to use every little

20
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.290
bit of what comes in these new versions now.

21
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.850
What we're trying to get at is what do we need to know?

22
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.300
To upgrade and keep our projects up to date.

23
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.670
And for that will be using meals to go.

24
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:00.320
So get ready.
