I want to challenge you all to find what's causing this bug, this bug on this address field has two

2
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.030
points of entry.

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:15.210
One is our card component because our card component is expecting some type of data to come in that

4
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.059
isn't available.

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.650
And the second part of this is our restaurant service.

6
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.350
Our restaurant service isn't returning what's expected.

7
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.520
Otherwise we would see something here that is expected.

8
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.300
Now, would it be something to do with the transform potentially?

9
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.850
Could it be that we don't have a property?

10
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.810
Potentially.

11
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.240
Try it out, try to figure out what's going on here and in the next video, we'll look at the solution.
