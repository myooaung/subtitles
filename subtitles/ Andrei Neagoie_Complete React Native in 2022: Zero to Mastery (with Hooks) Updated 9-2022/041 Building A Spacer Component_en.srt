1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:03,650
So there's two things I want to focus on over here.

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:11,530
One is the fact that we have these components, right, these views that are offsetting our content.

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:11,900
Right.

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:17,400
So basically what that means is that they're pushing the content aside.

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,600
Now, some would say, Mo, this is kind of redundant.

6
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:22,970
You can just use a margin and you definitely can.

7
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,300
It's just the style that I've learned to like.

8
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,260
Now, it's not for everyone.

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:33,390
Some people like to just give things margins and all this good stuff I like to give margins to.

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,760
It doesn't matter whether it's a margin or a padding.

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:43,460
What I'm particularly after is that I like it when I have these things that will push content for me

12
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:52,490
so that I know that my content is in itself stylish almost, and that its position is irrelevant to

13
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,530
the things around it.

14
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,600
And so I called these spacer components.

15
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,890
And so I want to go ahead and make one of these components.

16
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:06,140
So let's go ahead and make a folder in here and let's call it spacer and inside of spacer.

17
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,100
We're going to make a spacer dot component.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,060
Dot James, right?

19
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:21,590
And so we're going to import react from react, we're going to import.

20
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,500
View from Riak native, right?

21
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,390
And we're going to do a very, very basic implementation, we're going to do export consed spacer,

22
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:32,160
right.

23
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,080
And it's going to take two parameters.

24
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,270
It's going to take let's say we'll call it a variant.

25
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:38,650
Right.

26
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,410
And based on this variant, we're going to return different views.

27
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,080
OK, so we could do different types of areas.

28
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,320
Let's do a switch on variant, right?

29
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,300
And with a switch case, we'll do a default of returning.

30
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,710
And let's see here, we'll return of view.

31
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:03,800
That has a we've got to be a bit smart about this.

32
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,230
All right, so let's think about this.

33
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:11,390
Let's import style from styled components.

34
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,570
Netiv.

35
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:23,160
Let's create like three or four variants, let's do Consed Top Small, and let's say that that's a styled

36
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:30,330
type view that has the following properties, it's going to do a margin.

37
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,400
Top of four pixels.

38
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,930
And let's do a top medium.

39
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,470
Right, top medium.

40
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:48,640
And that's going to do a margin, top of eight pixels, and then let's do a top large, which is 16

41
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,120
pixels.

42
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,180
Right, and so if we switch variants, we're going to see a case.

43
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,800
Well, let's do it if statement because it's fairly simple for now.

44
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:11,370
Let's let's say if variance is equal to top thought small, we're going to return top small, actually.

45
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,350
Let's return top small by default.

46
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:19,680
And let's say if it's top medium, we'll return top medium.

47
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,000
And if it's let's let's see here.

48
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,480
Got a bunch of issues.

49
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:31,170
And if it's top large, we'll return top large.

50
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:39,850
Right, and so now you can see we're building a lot of logic, right, so we could say left and we could

51
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:40,530
do the same.

52
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,630
We could do left small, left medium.

53
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,950
And left large.

54
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:55,810
And so that will be the same, it will be for eight and 16.

55
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,790
But it will be margin left.

56
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,240
So let's, first of all, go ahead and do this.

57
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,250
I got to fix this.

58
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:08,260
This is margin up and these will be margin dash left.

59
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:14,890
OK, so now I can also say, well, if my variant is left.

60
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,670
Or left that small.

61
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:25,950
So let's add a left thought small and you can see I'm quickly accumulating a lot of logic here.

62
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:31,360
The spacer component feels kind of like heavy, but let's see what we can do because we're going to

63
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,050
optimize it.

64
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,890
Don't worry about that.

65
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,000
But if we go back to our restaurant card, we can now replace this with a spacer.

66
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:49,460
So if we say spacer and we say variant equals left that small and we do two spacers here, actually

67
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,150
it was medium.

68
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,200
So let's do medium.

69
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:58,310
Should it be medium, let's do large, because we want a decent amount of space between each and then

70
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:06,190
we'll go here and what we'll do is we'll import spacer and we'll do that from Balthasar slash slash

71
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:10,310
components, slash spacer spacer component.

72
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,920
And so that'll give us the spacer component.

73
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:21,190
And what we'll see over here right now is that everything works just the same or does it right.

74
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,590
What's going on here?

75
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,580
Well, first of all, let's reload and let's see.

76
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:31,290
So right here, left that large, doesn't seem to be working.

77
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,850
So our very end, we set to left that large.

78
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,980
So what exactly is going on here?

79
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,270
So we did left that large.

80
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,730
Oh, well, of course, more.

81
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,370
So let's take these and let's make them left.

82
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,570
OK, there we go.

83
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,610
And now everything's moving aside.

84
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,060
Right.

85
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:56,000
And so the way that things are moving aside is that there's a little view in here that's basically pushing

86
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,220
it.

87
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,500
OK.

88
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:05,600
Now, love it or hate it, this is a pattern that I've learned and grown to like because now I don't

89
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,850
need to care about specifically, OK, how much does this need to be or how much does this need to be?

90
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:18,320
I have a consistent spacer for myself, and I can go as far as to say, well, hey, these spacing's

91
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,940
that I'm giving here, I can go ahead and I can use my theme that speccing.

92
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,220
Right, so I can use four, eight, 16.

93
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:25,580
So.

94
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:31,240
I did it a bit faster here, but actually what I should be doing is doing props.

95
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:40,320
And then doing props, dot theme, dot space, and then thought, I believe it was too.

96
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,790
And then we can do two.

97
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,620
And for.

98
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,700
And here we can do two.

99
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,010
And for.

100
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,940
And it's looking good, right?

101
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,200
This is way better.

102
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,470
So now we have an effective spacer that works the way that we intended to work.

103
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,540
I believe it's actually actually I may be one off, I maybe one off.

104
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,950
I may be pushing it away too far.

105
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:18,910
It's one, two and three whoopsie, so we have to go back to our spacer here and we have to make sure

106
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:25,870
that it's one, two, three and one, two, three.

107
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,700
We were pushing it out a bit farther.

108
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:36,060
Now we can see that our spacer is working accurately for us to space things apart, to push things apart,

109
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:40,080
whether it be from the top, from the bottom, from the left.

110
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,120
And for now, we have top and left.

111
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,530
Left small.

112
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,670
Actually, this one should be small.

113
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,130
I have another issue here so you can see how the spacer, you know.

114
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:56,660
It's great and all, but there's a lot of logic to it.

115
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,590
There's a lot of logic to the spacer, but it's a great component.

116
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,780
Brings me into this case of where, hey, if we have a ton of variance of styles, right.

117
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:10,760
So like let's say, for instance, we have text and we wanted to have text, that was a caption and

118
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,320
we wanted to have text that was a title.

119
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,660
And we wanted to have text that was a heading.

120
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,340
And we wanted to have text that was just body text, like a paragraph.

121
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,110
All of those variants.

122
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,510
Are we going to encapsulate those each in their own component?

123
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:28,130
That sounds like a lot of logic just for a minor styling change between them.

124
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,049
So I'm going to show you a technique in this next video where we're going to use something called styled

125
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:41,570
system in conjunction with styled components to achieve absolutely amazing results through a technique

126
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,980
called variance.
