1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,210
This is amazing.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:08,890
We now can see all of our favorites and we can start them and we can underwrite them in any given screen

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,030
for the restaurant detail, and that is absolutely amazing.

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:20,140
Now, one thing we also need to keep in mind here is that if we want to build a favorite spa, what

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:24,460
we're going to need to do is we're going to need to track some state here because we're going to toggle

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,510
and untangle it at given points.

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,360
First things first.

8
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,560
Over here in our restaurants, we have a search component.

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:39,490
And in the search component, we have the ability to give it an icon and that icon value, we're going

10
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:40,840
to currently set it to heart.

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:48,240
And what we're going to see here is that it's going to be a clickable element.

12
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:56,680
So we're going to do an on icon press and that's going to be equal currently to a known method.

13
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,180
And so, as you can see, it is now a clickable element.

14
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:09,490
OK, so now we need to set up our state to be able to track and the restaurant or rather the favorite

15
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:15,830
spa is going to be a feature that is going to live right underneath search.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,920
So this component is going to need to track some state, will use state.

17
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,220
Now, what we'll see here at line 31 is const.

18
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,440
Is toggled, set is toggled.

19
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,480
Is equal to use state false.

20
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:41,640
And this will be the method that we will pass into our search container and we'll call it on toggle.

21
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:46,300
Policy set is toggled equal to.

22
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:55,060
The opposite of the current is toggled, so we'll invert the toggled each time it is clicked and this

23
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,190
will allow us to toggle it on and off.

24
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:04,020
Now that we've given it a method, what we can go do is we can go back into our search component and

25
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,479
we can see here, well, first of all, we also need to pass the toggled state.

26
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:17,010
We'll say is favourite's toggled and then will also do on favourite's toggle.

27
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,720
We'll give it a bit more of a semantic reasoning here.

28
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:28,340
On the inside, it's OK if we name it as toggled, but for search, we need to give it more of a name

29
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,250
and so in search we're going to take in.

30
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,780
The prop is favourite's toggled and on Favourite's Tovo.

31
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:45,910
And we're going to run these so on press is going to run on favourite's toggle and in the icon we're

32
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:53,290
going to say his favorites toggled to a full heart, otherwise do a heart outline.

33
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,220
And here we have to say full on heart outline.

34
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:01,840
And that's going to allow us to toggle off and on the heart.

35
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,950
So here we can see we're toggling it on and off given the state.

36
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,090
So we're able to toggle the favorite spa on and off.

37
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,760
Now, we don't have a favorite spa yet.

38
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:19,570
So what we need to set here is is toggled and and we'll set up a favorite spa.

39
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:26,970
And this favourite's bar is going to come from the same place that favourite's comes from, so we're

40
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:34,400
going to say Favourite's Bar comes from component's favorites, favorites, bar dot component.

41
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:41,910
And over here in Favourite's, we're going to set up a favourite's bar component.

42
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:51,210
Dargis that's going to import react from react and export consed favourite's bar.

43
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:59,660
Which is equal to will quickly put something in here, will import text from Riak made of quickly.

44
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:05,660
What we'll do with this text is we'll say text favourite's bar.

45
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,050
And so if we visualize this out in our component, what we're going to see here is Favourite's Bar no

46
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:17,130
favorite of our favorite bar, no favorites bar.

47
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,990
OK, so now that we have the framework set up around the favorite bar and being able to toggle and untangle

48
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:30,020
the favorites bar and we set up that infrastructure for the favorites bar, we can start building out

49
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:30,900
the visualization.

50
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,030
So let's get into that.
