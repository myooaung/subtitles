00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.440
Now that we have everything set up in terms of our firebase functions and all of that other stuff,

2
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:14.180
what I want us to do is I want us to deploy our functions and we're going to do that by going into our

3
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.400
package, JSON of our function.

4
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.490
We're going to do yard deploy.

5
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.920
We have to make sure we're inside of the functions folder and.

6
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.590
We are, and then we'll do Jaan.

7
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.120
And once we deploy, we'll be deploying our functions live with all of the information.

8
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.810
After we do that, we're going to publish, but we're going to make sure that everything is set up correctly

9
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:41.950
in order to publish.

10
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.020
So right here, we're deploying our functions, and in order for us to publish, what we want to do

11
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.510
is we want to double check outside of our functions right here, going to close up our features.

12
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.120
And in our utilities environment, we're going to say, well, it's not going to be development, so

13
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.980
we're going to be pointing to our live host.

14
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.060
Awesome.

15
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:09.010
Everything is good to go, all we need to do now is deploy our.

16
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:17.210
Expo application by doing Expo Publish, and this will publish a live version of our application in

17
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.290
its current state, and it should be a production built.

18
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.470
So it is not going to be development anymore.

19
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.160
It's going to be pointing to our live host.

20
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.650
And if all goes well, we should be working against our live functions.

21
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.540
Awesome.

22
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.320
So right here, while it's going through the publishing phase, what I'm going to do is over here on

23
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:49.550
this side, you see my live phone and my life phone is also pointing towards the meals to go that we

24
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:50.460
can load.

25
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.490
Now, you can see that I have snacks and I have published projects.

26
00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:02.930
So I'm going to go into this published project and I'm going to make sure that when I log in Moaveni

27
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.400
thought I owe.

28
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.610
Test one, two, three, and I log in.

29
00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:16.560
Right now, San Francisco is loading up and as we can see, it's still loading up the mock images,

30
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.810
so it has not refreshed.

31
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:26.730
So if we go back home and we refresh here quickly, we refresh again and we make sure that our functions

32
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.530
have been published, which they have.

33
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:39.460
Now, what we're going to do is going to open up Miles to go again, and let's try to fill in Toronto.

34
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:48.610
And once we do that, we can see, OK, now it's hitting the live API, so now I can go look for specific

35
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:49.330
spots.

36
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.870
Well, if we say Brugge, we'll go see what's available and can't find Brutsch.

37
00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.270
Well, how about the let's see Montreal.

38
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.910
Let's go look for Montreal.

39
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.280
And once we look for Montreal, what we'll see is that our app is now loading the Montreal location

40
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:15.620
and we can live toggle all of the information for Montreal.

41
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.890
The same is true for any other place if we were to do Brussels.

42
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.890
We could go look for Brussels information and now we'll see all the information pop up from Brussels

43
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.450
and this is the live app that I published.

44
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.170
So now we can talk to our firebase functions directly from our application that we now published.

45
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.940
So we have the full end to end spectrum going on here.

46
00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.670
Absolutely amazing.
