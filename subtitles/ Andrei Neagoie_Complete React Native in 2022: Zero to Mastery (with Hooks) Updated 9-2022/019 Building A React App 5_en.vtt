00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.050
Our robo friends are looking really, really nice.

2
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.000
I really like this app, there is one issue, though, if I minimize this.

3
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:14.920
OK, it's responsive, it looks good, but if I scroll down, well, I lose my search bar at the top,

4
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:21.340
would it be nice if this was at the top and I have a scroll that I can do and still search to my friends?

5
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.390
Well, you might be thinking, well, there's probably a CSI style that I can add here, but I want

6
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:37.400
to illustrate to you the fact that react and why react is so good is because you can create components

7
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.140
that are reusable, not just car components, but functionality.

8
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.080
Would it be cool if there was maybe something where we can add around Cardless?

9
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.230
Maybe I can create a scroll component.

10
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.170
And this scroll component just wraps the cardless.

11
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:05.349
And now Cardless will be completely scrollable, but now I can use Skrull this component anywhere in

12
00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:09.220
my app, anytime I need scrolling, I can just wrap it around.

13
00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.610
Can we do this, let's give it a try.

14
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.140
I'm going to import a component that we don't have yet that's called Skrull.

15
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.710
From a file that will create in just the second.

16
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.270
Let's create a new file.

17
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.530
We'll call it Skrull, James.

18
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.910
And here will again go through the motion of react from react.

19
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.050
Let's make this a little bit bigger.

20
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.180
And again, I want to change this to.

21
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.750
Bable.

22
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.180
And we'll say cost Skrull equals.

23
00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:04.010
It's going to return, hmm, what should a return before we talk about that, just so we don't forget,

24
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.800
we have to export.

25
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.740
Default Skrull.

26
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.620
Now, here's a problem.

27
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.650
Want to return something, but it doesn't make sense, does it, if I go to James?

28
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.010
Scrawl, it's not a self-closing component.

29
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:33.400
It wraps components, so how can we tell scroll to Hey, just render whatever is inside of you.

30
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:43.070
Up to this point, we've learned about props and we've learned about St..

31
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.440
There's one other thing and react that I want to teach you, and that is children.

32
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.960
And children, is this.

33
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.800
Skrull can use children as a way to render its children.

34
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.580
What do I mean by that?

35
00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.430
Well, in here.

36
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.570
Every props object has children.

37
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.990
So if I go props dot children.

38
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.160
Well, let's see what happens, I save.

39
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.350
And go back.

40
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:21.790
Everything's rendered.

41
00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.340
But if I remove this and I just do and each one.

42
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.460
I just get this.

43
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.870
You see, Profita children is exactly that if I console.

44
00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.560
Let's open up the console.

45
00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:04.820
I see that I get an object, and even though I didn't pass any props to scroll automatically, every

46
00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.090
single component and reacts has this property.

47
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:18.010
And this children, it kind of looks confusing here, but has card list, type card list.

48
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.400
So using this prop start, children, we can create.

49
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:36.170
Components that wrap other components up to this point, we were only able to wrap these lower case

50
00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:42.410
components, which are kind of like the HTML tags, but every time we had a custom component with capital

51
00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.020
letter that we built, well, we couldn't really wrap it.

52
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.230
And now we can using this thought children.

53
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.190
But here's the cool part, using props to our children.

54
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.170
Well, I can create a scrollable component.

55
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.090
Let me show you how simply do def.

56
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:12.400
Close that divide and then here again, curly brackets, props, dot children, and all we need now

57
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.100
is to add styles to this div.

58
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.020
I could create a scroll txt file and add a style.

59
00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.860
So it's scrollable.

60
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:27.400
But I want to show you another way, which is using style, just like an HTML using this style attribute

61
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.620
and J sex.

62
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:38.710
I can add styles but using double curly brackets that is, this is a JavaScript expression and within

63
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.510
this I'm returning an object and this object can have Castells.

64
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:55.230
Such as a property overflow WI, which is a success property, and this we can say Skrull again, a

65
00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:05.070
way to make the element scrollable, we'll say border is one pixel, solid black.

66
00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.940
And then finally, we'll give it a height of.

67
00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.010
Five hundred pixels.

68
00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.010
Going to make the smaller so you can see I'm going to save.

69
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.380
Compiling is fine if I go back, it looks like we have a box here.

70
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.570
Let's make it a little bit bigger just so you can see.

71
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:29.940
I say five pixels, even though it's ugly and I forgot a 10 here height.

72
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.380
All right.

73
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:30.740
Let's see.

74
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.450
Look at that, we have a scrollable component.

75
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.170
Let's make this a little bit bigger, just so we can see a better.

76
00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.300
Look at that, if I make this smaller.

77
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.420
I now have a scrollable component.

78
00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:54.410
Very cool.

79
00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.420
Now, this is a simple app, it allows you to search.

80
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:01.700
It allows you to scroll.

81
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.060
But it does show the power of react, doesn't it?

82
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:17.510
We've created these simple functions, and the only thing that we tell it to do is, well, we tell

83
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:18.980
it what state it has.

84
00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:29.480
The entire app is described through these two things, the robots and search field and react takes care

85
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:35.980
of the rest as soon as search field or robots changes react.

86
00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:46.010
Trickles down all this information as props to all these components and magically creates our view for

87
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:46.230
us.

88
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.340
That's why React is so powerful.

89
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:49.490
It's a view layer.

90
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.430
It takes care of manipulating the dom.

91
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:57.920
And all we tell it is, hey, what's the state what are the functions that you wanted to work with the

92
00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.200
state and the rest?

93
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:06.350
Well, it optimizes to make sure that everything is super fast and you can see how amazingly fast everything

94
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:06.750
is here.

95
00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:11.330
It's a super snappy app and these components are now reusable.

96
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:17.180
I can bring a search box now into another part of the website.

97
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.100
I can add scrolling to another part of the website.

98
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:26.360
This is what made react so powerful and this is why so many websites are powered by react.

99
00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:35.429
Once you learn the syntax and you get used to everything, that's when React truly becomes powerful.

100
00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:40.990
And although we took a bit of time to create this app, once you get used to it, an app like this,

101
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:45.250
you can create it in, well, less than an hour, probably 30 minutes.

102
00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.270
All right, I think we've done a great job here.

103
00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:51.330
Can't wait to see you in the next video.
