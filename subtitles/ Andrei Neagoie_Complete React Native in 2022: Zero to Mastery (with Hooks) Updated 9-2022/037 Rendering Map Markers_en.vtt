00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.930
We have our Mapu rendering out the correct region.

2
00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.660
Next up on the chopping block is how are we going to get the restaurant markers in the right spot?

3
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.280
Well, we already have the information right here in our Mock's.

4
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:24.280
If we go look at Antwerp, at the specific restaurants, every restaurant has the same geometry object

5
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.790
with a location and a viewport.

6
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.940
And so with that information, we can calculate where the markers are supposed to be.

7
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:41.290
So knowing that it's fairly simple for us to build out the map screen functionality for the map, you

8
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.870
the marker.

9
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.520
So what we're going to do is we're going to do map you marker and we're going to say close the marker

10
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.850
map.

11
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.620
You thought marker.

12
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:59.020
And what we're going to render inside of here later on is the view, the detail of you, but for now

13
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:09.200
we need to say the key of this, Mapu is going to be restaurant name and the title is going to be restaurant.

14
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:09.730
That name.

15
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.760
And then next to that, what we're going to do is we're going to say the coordinates of this Matthew

16
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.640
marker is going to be equal to the following.

17
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:27.850
Longitude and latitude is going to be equal to restaurant dot geometry, dot location, dawlat and langue.

18
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:35.510
And by doing this, what we can do is let's close this for a second so we get rid of the error by by

19
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.130
doing this.

20
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.200
What we're able to do is we're able to determine where the latitude and longitude of this pin is going

21
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.730
to be on the map by taking the geometry location object for a specific restaurant.

22
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.690
OK, so with that, we should have our markers, right?

23
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.710
Well, let's go look over on the map.

24
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:54.680
Wow.

25
00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:02.810
We have all of our markers and they are automatically rendering out a nice marker for us to know, hey,

26
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.169
this is the restaurant and if the markers are close together, we just zoom in and then we know which

27
00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:15.170
one is which and we can kind of pan out and we can go city beer, Tommys joint.

28
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.080
It's that easy, we just put markers on the screen and it looks so professional, so professional,

29
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.270
if we go over here to Antwerp now, we're going to see that when we change views, boom, the markers

30
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.220
are going to come in and we're going to know exactly where the restaurants are that we just searched

31
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.210
for in this vicinity.

32
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.840
That's absolutely amazing.

33
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.970
OK, so now.

34
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.210
What we need to do is we need to.

35
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.260
Update this call-out, this call out for the map for you is a bit.

36
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.290
Well, simple, and so we want it to look nice, we want it to look something like what our cards look

37
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.790
like, we want to see the image and the name, and we want to have a nice font.

38
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.790
So let's go ahead and look at how we're going to do that.
