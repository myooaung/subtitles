1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:05,590
Now that we've reached a clickable state and we're able to render the restaurant details specifically

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:15,220
for each and every restaurant that we click, what I want us to do is I want us to render out the card,

3
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:21,220
the information card that we have here on this screen when we click it.

4
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:27,370
Now, in order to achieve that, what we need to do is we need to go to react navigation.

5
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:35,060
And if we go to react navigation, what we can see here is that when we go towards passing parameters

6
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:39,950
to routes, what we all know is said, remember when I said there's more?

7
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:48,320
Well, parameters is a part of navigation where when we do navigation, not navigate to a specific route.

8
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:48,650
Mhm.

9
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:57,950
We can pass parameters to go along with that route and will we are able to read those parameters when

10
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:03,650
we go into that specific sub screen by reading the property or the prop route.

11
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:10,340
Prem's so we can do something along the lines of when we do the touchable opacity on press, we can

12
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,690
pass parameters in here.

13
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,890
So I want you to try to pass the parameters and then.

14
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:25,480
What I want is for us to build out a restaurant detail, screen, a restaurant detail screen in the

15
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:33,520
restaurant screens folder, so a restaurant detail screen, pass that in here and then read out the

16
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,180
property route that Prem's and try to render out the card.

17
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,550
In the next video, we'll look at the solution.
