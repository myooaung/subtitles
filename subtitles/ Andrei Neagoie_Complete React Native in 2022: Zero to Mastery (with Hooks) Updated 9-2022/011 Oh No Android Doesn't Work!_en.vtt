00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:07.580
Oh, we tested it on Android and all of a sudden our firebase function isn't working.

2
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.120
What's going on here?

3
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:17.610
Well, I'll tell you what's going on on Android by default http you URLs do not work.

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.620
It will only work if it's an https URL and in that case it will actually retrieve information.

5
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:32.910
Now the problem here is that our local firebase function does not run an HTTPS mode, so this is going

6
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:33.850
to be a problem.

7
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.530
What we can do then is we if if we wanted to test it on Android locally, we could just run it directly

8
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.460
against the live host, which means you would need to publish your app firebase functions and then it

9
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.970
would work consistently.

10
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.710
This is a shortcoming of firebase functions locally.

11
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.670
They cannot run on https.

12
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:04.050
So the only way to test on Android when using firebase functions is directly against the live host.

13
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.420
Just something to keep in mind here.
