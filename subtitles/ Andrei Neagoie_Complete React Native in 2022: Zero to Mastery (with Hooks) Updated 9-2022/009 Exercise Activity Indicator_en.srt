Before we build out search, I wanted to add some polish here because we have our restaurants loading.

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:15,940
Right, we have it all loading, but the issue is that when we reload, we're not really getting any

3
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,020
feedback about if it's loading or not.

4
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:24,070
So one of the things that we can do is we can go look at react native pepper.

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:33,670
And react native people, and if we go look at the docks here, if we look for activity in the Kater.

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:42,340
The activity indicator is this indicator that shows if you are having progress or not, and so an exercise

7
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:47,770
that I want us to go through is I want us to take the usage case of this activity indicator and create

8
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:52,210
an activity indicator that's going to show while the data is loading.

9
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,220
So we have our is loading property here.

10
00:00:54,610 --> 00:01:01,120
And while this is true, I want us to show an activity indicator in the UI.

11
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,970
And so in the next video, we'll look at a solution.
