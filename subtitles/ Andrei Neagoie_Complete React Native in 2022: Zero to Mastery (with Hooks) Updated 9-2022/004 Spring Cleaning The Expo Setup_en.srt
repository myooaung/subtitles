1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:04,010
All right, it's spring time and it's time to clean out the closet.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:05,150
I'm joking.

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:10,610
Of course, what we're going to do now is now that we've set up our meals to go repository, what we

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:17,390
really need to do here is we need to go ahead and we need to clear out all of the cruft that was left

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,810
behind by XPO.

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:31,540
Now, XPO puts a lot of things by default in our project, and so we need to go ahead and we need to

7
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,950
you know, I like to look at it as a clean canvas.

8
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,440
You don't want to paint on a canvas that's already been painted on.

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,710
So you kind of want to start off with nothing but a few.

10
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,140
OK, now that we have cleared out our apologies file, what else do we need to do?

11
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:55,880
First of all, let's go into our app, Jason, and this is where we will control sort of what we would

12
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,660
call the metadata of an application here using metadata.

13
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:06,380
Well, it's the data that actually controls kind of the name of the app when it goes to the App Store,

14
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,600
the icon that you will see when you install your application on your phone, the splash screen that

15
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,060
will originally come in and all that stuff.

16
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,920
We just want to go through here.

17
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:21,260
We want to look at these properties and we want to make sure that everything is, you know, up to snuff.

18
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,320
Is this the name that we want to have for our application?

19
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,310
Is it the version?

20
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:25,920
Right.

21
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,960
We could go ahead and say, like, well, we're not a version of a point out where we're literally just

22
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,410
starting out.

23
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,360
So maybe we're at zero point zero point one.

24
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:32,960
Right.

25
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,000
And we could set the orientation.

26
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,730
We could do all of that good stuff.

27
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,410
So it's important to know that this file is here.

28
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,810
And at first glance, everything is good in here.

29
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:47,420
That's what spring cleaning is about, just looking around what was set up for us and what is all available.

30
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:53,990
And we can see that there is an icon of fabrication because this also is set up to run on the Web.

31
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,850
But we're not focusing on that outcome.

32
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,370
We're focusing mainly on Android and iOS.

33
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,720
But there is this movement in the Riak native space to also cross pollinate it to Web.

34
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:07,550
But for the intents and purposes of this course, we're focusing solely on the specifics of mobile development.

35
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:15,680
And the reason that my voice kind of sounds like skeptical is I believe that every platform has a specific

36
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,480
usability concern.

37
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,120
Right.

38
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,890
When we're on the mobile phone, we're concerned with the mobile user experience.

39
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:26,420
We're concerned with what users see and hear and how they interact with this blank canvas.

40
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,800
Whereas when we're on the Web, we have so much more space to deal with.

41
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:34,030
We have so much more things that we can do.

42
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:40,610
And so going and trying to tailor something that's meant to fit on this small screen and trying to fit

43
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,020
it on this big a screen.

44
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:42,230
Right.

45
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:45,470
My desktop screen just doesn't feel right now.

46
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,080
It's not to say that you can't go and do that.

47
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,820
It's to say that everything has a proper purpose.

48
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,100
And so for some use cases, you may go ahead and maybe try to build a react native app and target all

49
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:58,970
three platforms.

50
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:03,050
I prefer to when I use Riak native target mobile only.

51
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,320
OK, so we've we've held our spring cleaning here.

52
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,680
We know kind of what's around here and we want to create a new folder.

53
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:16,450
Not in here, obviously, so let's create a new folder at the top level, and what we want to do is

54
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:21,190
we want to select Abcess and then we'll create a folder and we're going to call it source, just like

55
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,240
we did with focus time.

56
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,870
And so inside of source is where the bulk of our code is going to live.

57
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,110
And now that we've created that.

58
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:36,610
We're going to set up a couple more folders, so let's set up components, if we look over here, we're

59
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:40,810
going to create a folder in components, but we want to click over here on Source and we're going to

60
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,790
create one more folder.

61
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,180
We're going to call it utils.

62
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,660
OK, so now that we have these two folders.

63
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:52,610
We basically want to make sure that something is rendering on our screen, if anything, so we're going

64
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:53,540
to say text.

65
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:02,420
Our react native blank canvas, and this is where the magic is going to start.

66
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,700
This is where we start our adventure.

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,680
Oh, wait, it's all the way up here.

68
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,720
What's going on?

69
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:09,770
Well.

70
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:20,620
Just like we said, if you don't give your container a style, it's going to not center the items right.

71
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:26,930
And so if we do a line items center and we say flex one.

72
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:28,970
Where does it end up?

73
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,570
Where's our text?

74
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,750
Where did it disappear to what is going on here?

75
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,730
So if we say here, justify content center.

76
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,420
Oh, there's our content.

77
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,250
Where did it disappear to before we had this, it was just gone.

78
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:48,900
What happened?

79
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,670
It's just not here.

80
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:59,050
Well, it's off the screen, obviously, so right now we have our react native blank canvas, and so

81
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:03,850
with this blank canvas, what we want to do is we want to start building our app.
