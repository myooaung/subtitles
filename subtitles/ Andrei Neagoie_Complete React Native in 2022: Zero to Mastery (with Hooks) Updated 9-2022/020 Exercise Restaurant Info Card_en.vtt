00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:06.660
It's time for another exercise, and in this exercise, what I want is for us to start building out

2
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.380
the visualization of restaurant list info, write the info component that's going to be rendered eventually

3
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.010
in our list.

4
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:20.650
And so the first and foremost thing that I want you to go ahead and develop is this card element.

5
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.450
Now, I don't need you to build it from scratch.

6
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.850
No, no.

7
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.640
We're going to be utilizing react native paper and what we're going to be utilizing and react native

8
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.170
paper is something called card.

9
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.010
And so over here you can see different implementations of the card element as well as the usage, the

10
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.420
properties and all of the different things that you can do with it.

11
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.500
And so what I want is I want you to build something visually equivalent to this.

12
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.270
I want you to build out the card.

13
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.980
I want you to show the image, and I want you to show the name of the restaurant that we gave it right.

14
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.510
We gave it all of these defaults.

15
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.050
So the next step is to show this little piece of a visualization.

16
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.270
Awesome.

17
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.069
All right.

18
00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.060
In the next video, will look at the solution.
