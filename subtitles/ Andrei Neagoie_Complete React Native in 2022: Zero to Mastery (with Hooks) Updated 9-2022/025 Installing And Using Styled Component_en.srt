1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,170
So I hear you thinking like, OK, how do we install this?

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,100
Well, like what steps do we go through?

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,690
So first of all, let's go in here and let's create a new terminal.

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:14,480
And in that new terminal, what we're going to do is we're going to do Jaan add.

5
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:16,840
Well, what do we can't add?

6
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:23,950
Well, let's go over here, let's go over to the installation guide and let's take styled components,

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:24,650
right.

8
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,970
Oftentimes you'll see NPM install.

9
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,620
This is a different package manager.

10
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:29,560
We're using yarn.

11
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:34,720
Do not ever do an NPM install because that will put your project in a weird state.

12
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:41,750
And so what we want to do here is we want to go over here and we want to say you can't add styled components,

13
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:46,580
OK, so styled components is now being installed.

14
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:52,910
And once we have styled components, I can show you the true power of what we can achieve with style

15
00:00:52,910 --> 00:01:01,100
components in our existing feature, because with style components installed, we can very easily go

16
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,040
and change what we've already written.

17
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,690
To be more meaningful, and that's what we want, we want our code to be meaningful, we want to understand

18
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,880
at a glance what exactly is going on.

19
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,730
S components has been installed.

20
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,180
Let me close this real quick.

21
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:24,630
And here at the top, we can now go up here and we can say import styled from styled components, Netiv.

22
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,530
OK, and now I hear you're thinking, OK, what are we going to do?

23
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:35,580
OK, well, first of all, let's change this title, so let's do a concert up here, concert title equals

24
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:42,860
styled thought text and we can open the template strings, right.

25
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,690
These are two special types of strings.

26
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:49,120
You'll find this under the escape key next to the tilde.

27
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,390
It's a special type.

28
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,620
Don't try to use quotes because that won't work.

29
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,600
It has to be template.

30
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:03,010
So once we have these, what we can do is we can go down here and we can take what we have.

31
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,580
So padding 16, right?

32
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,170
Padding 16.

33
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:16,400
And we can kind of write this as CSFs, so when we put pixels behind it, it's basically going to use

34
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,610
a translation to react native ecosystem.

35
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,800
So we write everything as if we were to write Quesnel, which is more familiar for Web developers as

36
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,160
well.

37
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,070
And that's better for bigger teams.

38
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:35,900
So if we did this title and instead of doing text here, we did title title and we saved this, what

39
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,180
would happen to our app?

40
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,640
Let's go look at that.

41
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:44,840
So if we were to go look over here and we said title title.

42
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,550
OK, what if we did color red?

43
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,450
What would happen?

44
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:58,730
Well, now it changes to red, but now the semantic reasoning is that we have a way to write success

45
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:03,850
in react native or CSFs like styles, and they'll be translated for us.

46
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,170
And this is extremely important.

47
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:10,610
But we'll get into the bigger, broader benefits because we're again, we're layering it like a cake.

48
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:17,090
The first step is we have solid components and now we can give our components styles very easily.

49
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,990
But also our components now have semantic reasoning.

50
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,090
You can see the benefit of reading, oh, this is a title instead of oh, this is a text with the style

51
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,890
or Styles title.

52
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,450
And so we can get rid of this.

53
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:34,480
And behind the scenes, it's already doing all the good stuff that Stylesheet Create is doing for us.

54
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:42,530
So we have all of these benefits and a way simpler syntax and semantic reasoning about our components.

55
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,380
So we know that this is a title now amazing.

56
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:52,880
All that benefit from just one library installation and a very, very core library to the industry.
