1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,980
Here's our next exercise.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:08,119
So for our next exercise, I want us to transfer all of the styles that we have in the style sheet,

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:10,490
create across all the files that we have.

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:18,260
And I want us to make specific components that are going to highlight the styles and have a specific

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:18,560
name.

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:24,740
For instance, don't worry, I'm going to show you because we can do style text, right.

7
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:29,720
And we can also do style dot view and we can do we can do all of that stuff.

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,810
But what if we wanted to style the card, for instance?

9
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:34,120
What if we wanted to style the card?

10
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:41,600
So if we wanted to style the card, we could say something like CONSED Restaurant Card and we could

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:48,820
say styled and we could open the parentheses here right in between the parentheses we can put card.

12
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:54,110
And so now we can specifically style an element that isn't exported this way.

13
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:58,820
We could also import text from Riak native and do it like this.

14
00:00:59,480 --> 00:00:59,870
Right.

15
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,930
So we could do that as well.

16
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:11,060
Now styled components native by default will export all the things that Riak native has or the majority

17
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:11,390
of them.

18
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:12,230
Right.

19
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:18,410
But if we want to style something very specifically, we can follow this syntax as well, where we put

20
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,240
it between the parentheses.

21
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,940
So, for instance, here we're taking a card and we're putting card between the parentheses.

22
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:27,140
Right.

23
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:32,930
And if we wanted to do cardboard cover, we could do restaurant card cover and we could do cardboard

24
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:33,350
cover.

25
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,620
And so now we can style the specific card cover.

26
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:44,360
OK, so with that, I want you to take these and migrate the styles that we put in stylesheet create.

27
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:51,260
And I want you to do the same for restaurant screen and I want you to do the same for Appalachia's Belnap

28
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:51,680
Dodgiest.

29
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,530
We don't have anything right now, OK?

30
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,790
And in the next video, we'll look at the solution.
