00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.780
Now that we know how are you on our camera feature to look, what we need to do is we need to set in

2
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:11.810
place the building blocks in order for us to be able to store pictures on our phone.

3
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.450
Now, in order for us to do that, what we saw here is in the setting screen when we tapped on our avatar,

4
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:24.620
what we would do is pull up a settings camera screen so we would flow from this screen over to another

5
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.450
screen, which means navigation is one of our main concerns here.

6
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.710
So we're going to have to add some navigation.

7
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.600
If we go over into our infrastructure folder, into the navigation folder, we know that we have our

8
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.250
settings navigator over here and our settings Navigator has different stack screens.

9
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.230
So one screen that we could add over here then is the camera screen.

10
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:53.400
And we'll give it a camera screen component, which will come from the settings feature, so over here,

11
00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:00.210
feature screens, settings, what we'll do is we'll add a camera screen and then we'll say in the feature

12
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.880
setting, screens will have a camera but screen.

13
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:11.050
And then what we need to do is build out that screen in the features folder settings, screens, now

14
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.860
we'll add a new file camera, dot screen dojos.

15
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.150
And now that we have that, what we can basically do is start building out our camera screen so we'll

16
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.290
do export consed camera screen.

17
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.990
Is equal to no for now.

18
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.530
Right, as equal to a function that returns not so we're not going to render out anything right off

19
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.650
the bat will import, react from react just to make sure.

20
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.160
And now what we need to do is take in this camera screen in some way.

21
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:52.710
So if we go over to the settings screen, we know over here that on the Avatar container we have our

22
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.910
Avatar icon.

23
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.110
And when we click this Avatar icon is when we want to pull up the screen.

24
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:06.160
So what we can do here is, well, we can pull in a style that touchable opacity or we could just import

25
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.430
touchable opacity from react native.

26
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.880
So let's do that import touchable opacity.

27
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.440
From React Native, and this, again enables us with a slight fade to do attachable around any given

28
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.810
elements, so we'll do a touchable opacity around the Avatar container.

29
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.920
And what will have that do is over here we have navigation, so what we'll do is on press will make

30
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.220
it go to navigation DOT and let's go see how we use navigation, navigation, navigate.

31
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.160
And we'll navigate to camera.

32
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.950
Now, if we do this, what's going to happen over here, if we reload is when we press this will go

33
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.770
over to the camera screen, but it won't really give us anything to see because we're rendering not.

34
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.570
So if we go over to settings and we click it now we're seeing the camera screen.

35
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.600
So we've set up our scenery for our camera module.

36
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.870
But now how are we going to implement the camera module like MO?

37
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.230
What options do we have now that we've set up everything we need to set up in order to implement the

38
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.630
camera?

39
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.910
Well, let's take a look at that.
