00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.100
Hey, everyone, I thought it would be a great idea to give you all a short, quick demo of what we're

2
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.070
going to build before we get into it.

3
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.390
So here is the meals to go up.

4
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:17.420
And this is the app that we will be building throughout this section and adding on to as we go into

5
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.170
the bonus section.

6
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.680
And as you can see here, the Happy Watermelon is happy to see you.

7
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.680
Now, when we log in to meals to go, what are we going to be greeted with is this amazing, beautiful

8
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:35.120
login screen with which we will get state management as well as air handling and all of that good stuff

9
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.070
in between and over here is the main focus of the app.

10
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:46.220
This is the restaurant screen, extremely aesthetically pleasing, as well as having the ability to

11
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:53.300
search different cities to get us different results of restaurants that we can utilize, building out

12
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.430
their star rating, showing their address, their name, even going so far as to show a detailed screen

13
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:05.390
and put in a checkout flow with which we can process payments.

14
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:12.410
And by filling out the name here, we pull up the credit card review and by pulling out the credit card

15
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:18.770
view, we can fill in credit card information, handle error states do try to do a payment, handle

16
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.220
the error, states, clear the card, go over to the map.

17
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:30.830
You look at the same exact information we had and have the ability here to zoom in and look at things

18
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.630
from a closer perspective.

19
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:40.790
And that way, we can show the restaurant's view in a different state, as well as having a settings

20
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.340
panel that has access to be able to render your camera, of course, on the simulator here, you're

21
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.080
not able to see my camera and building out the logout feature.

22
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:59.960
So with all of these features, what we're aiming to do is give you the broadest possible ability to

23
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:07.910
build a fully featured app that mimics what you will see in real life and helps you learn how to structure

24
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.479
code as well in a production grade way.

25
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.710
So let's get into building meals to go.
