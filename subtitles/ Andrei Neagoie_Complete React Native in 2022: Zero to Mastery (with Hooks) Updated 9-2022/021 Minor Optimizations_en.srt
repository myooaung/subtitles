1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:06,300
We've covered the full end to end implementation of our Google Maps integration, but there's a couple

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:12,660
of loose ends we need to tie up, first of all, over here in our location requests and our geocode

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,110
request.

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:22,940
And as well, our places request, we kind of never turn on moch mode ever again, and this is a problem

5
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:23,950
for many reasons.

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,210
First of all, what if we want to develop in mock mode?

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:36,740
So what we can say is over here and Mark is equal to is Mark and we're going to declare in is mock inside

8
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:41,760
of the environment that we're going to be able to set to true or false.

9
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:48,260
Now, we're going to do this both for the location service as well as for the restaurant service.

10
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:51,890
And what we'll do here is import is Mark.

11
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:58,200
And we'll set it here at the end by saying, and Mark is equal to is Mark.

12
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:06,610
By doing this now, what we can do is when we turn on our server right here in terminal and we go over

13
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,840
here to level three yard serve and we serve up.

14
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:13,870
Environment.

15
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:21,610
What we'll be able to see over here is that if we say export consed is moch false.

16
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,800
Now, what it will do if we refresh here is it will go and pull from the live information, so it will

17
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,610
go get live places information, which is great.

18
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,220
But now if we set it to true now, it will fetch more information.

19
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:45,840
And that just closes the loop for us on being able to develop in mock mode versus non mode, which is

20
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,170
honestly a great way of going back and forth.

21
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,990
But there's still one problem we have.

22
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:59,700
Remember when I told you that Android did not have the ability to use the FTP local instance?

23
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:05,210
Well, I told you, you can definitely use the live host and you can deploy.

24
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,000
But we didn't really make it easy on ourselves.

25
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:09,169
We would have to do this.

26
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,430
And that doesn't really feel super nice.

27
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,770
So what we can also do here is we can say import platform.

28
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:24,120
From React Native and we can say consed export const.

29
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:31,240
Is Android and will say platform talk os equal, equal, equal to Android.

30
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:37,210
So what we need to do now is we need to determine a way to tell the host to use the live host in case

31
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:37,880
it is Android.

32
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,260
So what we're going to do is we're going to invert over here.

33
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:44,350
We're going to say if it is not development.

34
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,810
Or it is Android.

35
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,670
Use the live host or otherwise use the localhost.

36
00:02:54,190 --> 00:03:01,150
And this should enable us on Android to be able to directly link to the cloud functions.
