00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:08.700
Hey, everyone, so in this section of the course, we're going to be updating the app to be visually

2
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.280
more pleasant.

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.130
Think of it this way.

4
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.079
Think of it like we have the app over here and we have all of our code and the company meals to go.

5
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.060
They went and they hired a designer and the designer comes in and they start clicking around the app.

6
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.680
They start trying to order things.

7
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:29.910
They go through and try out the app left, right and center, and then they get angry.

8
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.090
They're like, this is inconsistent.

9
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.070
What is this color pattern and why is there orange and blue?

10
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.110
What is going on here?

11
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.330
And you're sitting there and you're thinking to yourself, oh, my God, I'm going to have to rebuild

12
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.220
the entire app.

13
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.810
And so the designer goes away and puts together some design recommendations for us.

14
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.000
And we look over them and we realize to ourselves, huh?

15
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.220
I built this app.

16
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.550
Pretty amazingly, because all of these changes that they're proposing, I can do them fairly easily,

17
00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.730
and so you pat yourself on the back and you think to yourself, well.

18
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.950
I wrote my code while I structured my code well, I have a theme and all of the criticism is basically

19
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.440
on small visual changes that we can tweak within a day.

20
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.940
And that's when, you know, you've built an application that can scale because you can make those changes

21
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:28.540
easily.

22
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.700
And so let's go through some of those changes.
