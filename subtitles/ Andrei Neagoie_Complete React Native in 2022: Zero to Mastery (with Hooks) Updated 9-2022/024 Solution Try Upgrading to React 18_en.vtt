00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:01.220
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:09.080
Now that you learned how to update your projects and have the latest version of a library, let's do

3
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.460
a fun little exercise.

4
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.020
I want you to update your robot friends project to the latest libraries.

5
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.950
So if you have been working on the robot friends up yourself, then open up that project.

6
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.220
If not, you can clone the project from the link we've provided for you for the final robot friends

7
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.460
up.

8
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:36.110
And once you have that open up package that Jason and let's have a look at the version available to

9
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.320
us.

10
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:45.990
So pause the video and see if you can update your project to the latest and then check it to make sure

11
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.250
that everything runs.

12
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.490
All right now, assuming you pause the video and tried everything yourself.

13
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.310
Let's see how I would update this project.

14
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.230
All right now, here's the thing.

15
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:05.600
When I am recording this video, this is actually the latest version of React and React Dom, but there

16
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.890
is some new changes.

17
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:16.690
If we go to the official React documentation, we see that this is the latest version, we can usually

18
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.020
see it at the top, the docs usually point to the latest.

19
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:29.620
But we see an announcement here React version 17 and React version 17 is the new major release for React.

20
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.190
So based on when you're watching this video, React 17 might be up here, but I want to demonstrate

21
00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.200
to you why you might want to do if you want to play around with release candidates.

22
00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.820
These are versions of React that aren't finalized yet.

23
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.230
It's a release candidate, and soon it'll be the official version.

24
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.880
But let's say you want to play around with some new features that they bring to react.

25
00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.370
Now, keep in mind that React 17 actually doesn't have any new features.

26
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.210
You can see it right here.

27
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.860
No new features.

28
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.830
They've essentially created this new version of React just to make it easier to upgrade.

29
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.639
React itself in the future.

30
00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.620
So it's all internal changes that we, as developers might not really care about.

31
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.140
We'll just have some benefits down the road.

32
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:25.600
But if we wanted to download this version of React, we can't just simply say, React 17 in here and

33
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.610
just do zero zero.

34
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.840
But whenever you get into the situation where you already have the highest version possible, but there

35
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:42.310
might be a new feature or a new release candidate, what you can do is usually within the post, there'll

36
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.140
be a link to try out this release candidate.

37
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.840
So let's scroll down.

38
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.520
And there you go.

39
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.370
Installation.

40
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.840
So I can simply just copy this.

41
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.490
So let's use and p.m. and install the latest version.

42
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.120
And now we're free go to package.

43
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.740
And there we go.

44
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.770
We have the latest version now.

45
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.240
Now, we don't recommend actually using a release candidate in a production app, but for testing out

46
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.240
new features, that's always a nice thing to do.

47
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.300
By the time you watch this video, it's probably no longer a release candidate and can probably upgrade

48
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.250
to the latest version, whatever it is.

49
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.340
Seventeen point zero seventeen point one, so on and so on.

50
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.380
So let's test out the app.

51
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.990
So I'm going to do and p.m. start and make sure our Robot Friends app still works.

52
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:40.190
All right.

53
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:46.970
Everything looks good, and because React 17 doesn't have no real changes for developers.

54
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.220
Well, we expect the app to work.

55
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.660
Hopefully, you were able to update your app to the latest version.

56
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.130
I'll see you in the next one.

57
00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.910
Bye bye.
