1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:06,410
All right, we're about to start our journey in developing locally on windows.

2
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:08,189
Now, what does that mean?

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,590
What does that mean for the majority of the time?

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:17,920
Now, we have been coding in this Web browser, but it's time to say goodbye to the old and say hello

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,270
to the new new being developing on our computer locally.

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,120
Now, how do we go about that?

7
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:32,920
Well, first of all, we want to take this app that we already know works that we've set up here in

8
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,760
this way.

9
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:39,880
And we want to take that and make sure that we can run it locally because it's our baseline right at

10
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,880
the end of the day.

11
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,150
We just built this and we know it works.

12
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,180
So what better way to validate that?

13
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:51,580
What we're doing is going to work than taking this app, setting everything up locally and making sure

14
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:57,610
that we can run this app because that will verify to us that we've done everything correctly.

15
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,540
So the first thing we need to do here is we need to press these three dots over here, right there,

16
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,430
and you're going to see three options import, import, export.

17
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,230
Now, what do you think we're going to do?

18
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,460
Ding, ding, ding.

19
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,960
We're going to export we're going to export our products so that we have it locally.

20
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,570
That's what we want to do here.

21
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,870
So we'll hit export.

22
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,330
And what we'll get is.

23
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:27,710
Well, a reminder to protect our computer, but but we'll get down here if we're on edge, if you're

24
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,740
in any other browser, will say, do you want to save the focus?

25
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,610
Time says it.

26
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,260
So we'll say save.

27
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,170
And once we save that, we can open the folder that it's saved then and what you'll see over here is

28
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,760
focus time.

29
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:50,260
One now I obviously already downloaded once before, if we right click that and we say open a new window,

30
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:55,480
basically we'll get the ability to get the folder focused time, which will have all of our assets.

31
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,570
So we're opening the zip file.

32
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,010
This is a zip file, so we've opened it here.

33
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,950
Now, what I want you to do is I want you over here in this window.

34
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,160
If you have two windows are open, a second window.

35
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:11,880
I want you to go to your documents folder and in your documents folder.

36
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:19,050
What I want you to do here is I want you to drag and drop focus time from within the zip that we opened.

37
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,320
I want you to drag that folder and I want you to release it inside documents.

38
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:32,030
And so in documents now, we have focused time and with focus time there, we have all of the information

39
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:39,080
that made our application run inside of Expo, all of the code that was in here, all the code that

40
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:47,150
we wrote, all the code that made our application work is now on our computer inside of the focus time

41
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,770
folder, inside of documents.

42
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,140
So make sure that all that code is there.

43
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:55,070
And then once you have that ready, we can move on to the next step.
