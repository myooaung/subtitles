00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:07.230
Whoo hoo, we did it, we finished robo friends, we finished our wrap, now we can forget about it

2
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.890
and it's going to live forever and ever on the Internet.

3
00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.880
Right.

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.640
Well, maybe not.

5
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.410
You see, part of using a library is something we've already talked about, a library or a framework

6
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.560
is constantly evolving, constantly changing.

7
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.380
And every time you use a tool, you usually want to stay up to date.

8
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.230
This is one of the challenges with being a programmer that you always have to stay up to date.

9
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:45.490
I mean, sure, your projects could live on on GitHub, but eventually they get stale.

10
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.640
If they have a lot of dependencies or libraries that they depend on, then things might not work as

11
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.270
intended.

12
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.280
Now, this doesn't mean that you always have to jump on the latest and greatest.

13
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.450
And as libraries come up with new features, you don't necessarily need to jump on them right away.

14
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:12.100
But in these next couple of videos, I want to actually show you what my steps are and what most programming

15
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.080
steps are when things change.

16
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.770
Because if you have an application that is running, that has users, most of the time you want to keep

17
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:21.540
things up to date.

18
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.090
And this is something we've already talked about.

19
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.420
But what about things like react we learned about react in this course and we're starting to get comfortable

20
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.780
with it.

21
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:39.340
But again, because it's a library, it gets updates because it's being used by companies like Facebook

22
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.720
that has teams that constantly need new things, find challenges and want to improve it.

23
00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.340
Ideally, things are always improving.

24
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.000
So React had a big update as a version sixteen point eight.

25
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.760
It got something called hooks.

26
00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:01.150
Now, if you know anything about react, everybody is going a little crazy with hooks because there

27
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.490
are quite a big shift.

28
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.820
They are exciting, but can also be intimidating for a beginner.

29
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.250
And you can see over here and there documentation that they have a new section on react hooks.

30
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.950
Over the next couple of videos, we're going to be talking about react hooks, what they are, why they're

31
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:18.490
useful.

32
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.210
But instead of just showing you point by point, as it is in the documentation, how hooks work, because

33
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.500
let's be honest, you're able to do that on your own.

34
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.360
That's what these documentation's are for.

35
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.410
I want to show you the process, how I would learn something new when a library changes, when a library

36
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.340
has a new feature.

37
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:47.170
Now, the reason I haven't talked about hooks up until now is that what even react documentation actually

38
00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.770
doesn't talk about hooks until way later in their guide.

39
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.140
When you learn about react, their main concepts, some of the advanced guy, some API references,

40
00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.360
they don't mention hooks until the very end.

41
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.930
So when you learn about react, it's good to put off hooks until you actually understand the concepts,

42
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.440
which hopefully you do until now.

43
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.530
So let's say Riak comes up with hooks.

44
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.390
How would you go about learning it?

45
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:19.360
Well, obviously you'd start off with the documentation and start going through it and actually understanding.

46
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.620
Now, starting in the next video, we're going to learn about hooks, but I'm going to show you the

47
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:32.680
process of how I would learn about hooks and then also convert our robo friends app from using the class

48
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.950
stateful components to using react hooks so that you can compare them side by side and see what the

49
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:39.640
differences are.

50
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.680
I'll see in the next one by.
