00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.110
We're getting in the territory of rendering a custom call-out, and so the way that this works is anything

2
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:13.840
inside of the mapu marker is what's going to be rendered as part of the actual tooltip.

3
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:22.970
So if we wind up here and we said consed, some text is equal to style dot text and then we we just

4
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:31.820
use that as the internal write some text and then we put inside of some text.

5
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.980
Hi there.

6
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.840
Well now what we're going to see is when we click a marker.

7
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.440
Huh, nothing is happening, and so why is nothing happening?

8
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:52.880
Well, first of all, we need to wrap this interview and so by wrapping it, in a view, will be ensured

9
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.500
that it will be part of the actual render cycle.

10
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.720
So let's import view.

11
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.810
From React Native.

12
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.900
And now we'll go to our map screen and what we can see is that, oh.

13
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.700
It's actually it's not rendering it as a tooltip, it's rendering it as the marker itself.

14
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.810
Oh, OK, so that's what Matthew Markhor does so now.

15
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:32.070
Well, what we actually need is map view, dot call-out and that is specifically what is going to render

16
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.580
out the tooltip for each and every item.

17
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.790
Now, that being said, once we refresh, what we can see here is that every single map you call out

18
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.860
is going to render hi there some text.

19
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.550
And so we now know that the same is true on Android.

20
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.150
When we refresh here, what we're going to see is that the Mafia is going to render out our markers

21
00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:02.880
and that the call-out is now going to change in terms of saying hi there, if we put a specific hi there

22
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.340
in here.

23
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.500
So if we put.

24
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.040
Hi there.

25
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.200
We could see hi there.

26
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.920
Hi there.

27
00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.490
Hi there.

28
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.370
So what we need to do now is we actually need to build out the component that is going to visualize

29
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.440
the mapu marker detail.

30
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.840
And for that component, what we're going to set out here is inside of components.

31
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.600
We're going to say map call-out, dot component dachis.

32
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.790
And this map call-out component is what we're actually going to put inside of the call out here.

33
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:42.870
So let's go ahead and let's remove our unused code here and then we'll remove this subtext and we'll

34
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.340
put map.

35
00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:53.050
Call-out component, and it'll take restaurant as the current restaurant for the information.

36
00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:05.330
And then we'll import this from components, from deltoids, components, map call-out, and by having

37
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.810
this, what we can do now is we can go into Map Call-out, we can say export const.

38
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:20.310
Map call out is equal to and then will render out some information in here, so let's import react from

39
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:28.710
react and the first thing we're going to do here is we're going to import styled from styled components

40
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.510
native.

41
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:40.630
And we'll say, consed, my text is equal to styled thought text and we'll take we'll take that into

42
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:41.160
account.

43
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.820
We'll grab the restaurant from here.

44
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.430
And we'll say.

45
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.990
Is equal to restaurant dot name.

46
00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.990
And this should render out the restaurant name in the text component.

47
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:08.690
So here we can start building out the visualization that we want for our map call-out.

48
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.210
And so let me show you the visualization quickly.

49
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:19.880
If we go home and I open up the zero to mastery version of this app and we go to our map view, we can

50
00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:26.600
see here that what we want to render is the image with the name inside of the Call-out.

51
00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.600
So as an exercise, I want you to try out building out this component.

52
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.800
Don't worry about the favorites icon.

53
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.060
We will get there.

54
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:43.220
But for now, just render out the image with the specific name of the restaurant in this font.
