00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,870
Hey, everybody.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,060
I want to take a quick break here.

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,070
Go grab a coffee gravity.

4
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,920
Just take a break from all the learning that you just did.

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,810
And I want to talk to you quickly about imposter syndrome.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:20,580
It's this idea that you're not good enough that things are too complicated for you to ever achieve what

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,420
you want to achieve.

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:29,010
You look at other people, at other industry experts and you say, I will never get there, but it's

9
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,260
just a symptom of learning.

10
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:38,670
This idea of you not being good enough simply means that while you're just not there yet, things take

11
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:39,080
time.

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,240
If you want to learn a valuable skill, well, it's hard work.

13
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,520
That's why it's valuable.

14
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:50,790
Remember how you felt on the first day of going to school first day on a job?

15
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:58,200
It's the same experience, but over time, with repetition, with practice, you get comfortable, you

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,280
get experience and you slowly start to lose that imposter syndrome.

17
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,890
Now this idea of an impostor syndrome is great.

18
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,770
It means you're doing something worthwhile.

19
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,690
So don't use it as a negative.

20
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:14,730
Use it as an encouragement that you're doing something good, that you're learning and you're stretching

21
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:15,270
your limits.

22
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,470
So with this break, I want to propose that we do a quick exercise.

23
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,160
I want you to stop the lectures again.

24
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:28,620
Grab a coffee gravity and head on over to our discord now in our Discord server.

25
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,870
If you've used it up until now, that's great.

26
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:36,990
If you haven't head on over to this server and I want you to do something that I think it's super important

27
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:43,530
to learning, and that is using what you've learned up until now to actually teach someone or help someone

28
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:50,370
so you can go all the way to, let's say, the coding and courses section and pick a topic that you

29
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,380
want to help somebody at.

30
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:57,600
So let's say you go to the Python channel and in here you'll have other students that are asking Python

31
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,620
related questions.

32
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:04,080
Now you can scroll through here and see if you're able to help someone, even though you may not have

33
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,490
the experience or the knowledge.

34
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:12,630
Yet this idea of practicing and explaining what you've just learned to other people, even if you're

35
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,050
not 100 percent certain, actually is beneficial to your learning.

36
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:22,290
Because if you're never teaching, if you're never explaining and vocalizing and showing what you've

37
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,080
learned, you'll always be a beginner.

38
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:29,490
This idea of teaching what you learn is a very important concept.

39
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:35,640
So moving forward, as you go through the lectures, any time you feel like taking a break, hop on

40
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,220
over to discord and help somebody.

41
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,160
Our motto here is that we're always kind.

42
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,420
We don't judge anybody.

43
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,250
We're all just beginners here.

44
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,120
We're all learning.

45
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,700
So don't be afraid to answer things because you've got to remember nobody's perfect.

46
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,570
Except for Yoda.

47
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,040
Yoda is pretty perfect.

48
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,290
All right, I'll see you in the next one.

49
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:55,830
Bye bye.
