1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:06,270
Now that we got all of that out of the way, and now that you fully understand the snack interface and

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:14,340
how snacks work before we dive very deep into coding, there's one thing I want you to do.

3
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:23,240
Over here on my snack, you can see that I have something called the Focus Time demo.

4
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:31,770
Now, the one thing I want you to do is very simply go to your camera app point and click at this QR

5
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,110
code and open it in the Expo app.

6
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:40,770
And now what you're going to be able to do is play around with the app that we built.

7
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:50,540
And be able to work with the demo that is available to you, so let's say mowing the lawn and we say,

8
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:51,750
OK, that's good.

9
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:52,820
Let's add that.

10
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:58,010
And now we can play around with the demo that I showed you in the very first video.

11
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:05,150
And so you can get a feel of what exactly it is we're building and you can get a feel of, hey, what

12
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,580
is exactly what's going on here?

13
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:14,600
And if we close this and I reinstall it, what exactly is going to happen?

14
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:18,680
And you can try this again and again and you can always come back to this demo.

15
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:24,110
And because it's in your XPO app, you can also see, hey, mowing the lawn stayed around.

16
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,120
This is also a feature we're going to build.

17
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,540
It's called Storing the focus items.

18
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,880
We're going to do that.

19
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,350
And we can also clear them so that, hey, they're not a problem anymore.

20
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,150
We focused on too many items.

21
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,320
So we're going to be able to run this demo locally on our phone.

22
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:45,770
We're going to be able to understand what exactly it is we're building.

23
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:53,150
And while you're building your application, you can always reach back to our demo just to get a better

24
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:56,950
understanding of, hey, what exactly is it we're building?

25
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:03,950
And so over here at this you URL, this is where you can find the snack and we'll make sure to put this

26
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,550
in the resources on the video so that you can reach to it.
