00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.090
Hey there.

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:08.130
So in this bonus section, we'll be going through a stripe integration, a stripe integration meeting

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:15.360
will be building a small minor checkout flow that will show you how to integrate stripe payments into

4
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.200
your application.

5
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:23.160
Now for this bonus section, we will be building on some of the concepts that we build on in the bonus.

6
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.810
Google integration in the fiery section will be using firebase functions.

7
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.670
And that means as well that you will need a paid firebase account or to upgrade your firebase account,

8
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.460
at least to a plan which has a free usage to your built into it, but requires credit card information.

9
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:50.130
And this is because we will be releasing a firebase function for the check out integration that will

10
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:56.350
allow us to do our payment against Stripe in the test sandbox that they provide.

11
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.220
Now, you can also just develop this firebase function locally without deploying it to the cloud.

12
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.100
But again, remember that if you're not deploying your firebase functions, you're basically enabling

13
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.140
your app only to work locally in the emulator and on your local machine.

14
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.910
And that is very important to note here.

15
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.420
Now think of this feature this way, someone in their company comes to us and they say, hey, for meals

16
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.530
to go, we really like the meals, need to be able to go like people need to be able to buy things.

17
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.630
And so the very first feature that they come up with is how about if we ask every single restaurant

18
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.640
to require a special menu item, we're just going to offer a special.

19
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:46.240
For twelve ninety nine at every single restaurant that we load now, this is a bit unrealistic.

20
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.810
Of course, in real life, you couldn't possibly hook up every single restaurant in the world.

21
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.210
But let's let's imagine that we're further down the process of getting these restaurants on board.

22
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.700
Every single restaurant has a special and that's special is twelve ninety nine.

23
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.930
And restaurants are competing to get customers to order their special.

24
00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.250
Now, if you order a special, you'll order the special from that particular restaurant.

25
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.540
If you decide that you want to switch it up in order a special from a different restaurant, you'll

26
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.920
switch it over to a different restaurant.

27
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.430
You can order multiple specials by going back and adding to the order and that will change the total.

28
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.270
When we fill in the name of the user, then we fill in their fake credit card information.

29
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:40.210
And then if we add the expiry date and then the KVI code, we can then press pay and if we press pay,

30
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.220
a leading indicator will start, will disabled the buttons and we'll see.

31
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.520
We successfully paid now by successfully paying.

32
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:54.140
We also successfully log this payment in the stripe interface as well as if we feel a payment.

33
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.540
If we don't have certain information, we try to pay, we'll get an error screen and we're able to clear

34
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.050
the cart.

35
00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.310
Just in terms of a very, very simple a very straight to the point flow here that will be integrating

36
00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.560
strike payments.

37
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.540
Now, that said, we'll be showing you how to integrate all of this.
