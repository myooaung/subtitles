00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.790
Welcome back, I want to talk quickly about some of the options that you have when you're working and

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:14.490
building a mobile app with React Native, the first choice is, do you want to test on your device or

3
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.350
do you want to test on a simulation?

4
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.470
And we're going to see both of these throughout the course now on your device that you obviously get

5
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.490
to actually physically see the app on your phone, which is really, really nice.

6
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.690
But sometimes that takes a bit of time for it to get transferred to your phone.

7
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:38.880
Or you can use a simulator on your computer so that it simulates both Android and iOS so that you can

8
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.260
get fast feedback.

9
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:46.300
Another option is to use the Expo app, which we're going to show you how to do.

10
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:55.980
You can either fully compile your code into an app on your phone or you can use the expo client.

11
00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:03.360
So that is you download the Expo app on your phone and then you can really fast ship your Riak native

12
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.190
code to that expo client.

13
00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.520
And that Expo client app is going to load up on your phone as if you're running that app.

14
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.140
But underneath the hood, it's the expo app that's displaying your application.

15
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.280
Now, why would we want to do something like this?

16
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.800
If we go to setting up the developer environment section on the Riak native documentation, you'll see

17
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.540
that we have two options the react native Kellye.

18
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.160
So that is without using the client or using the expo.

19
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.980
SEELIE Now we'll walk you through the installation steps here, but always know that you can refer to

20
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.160
these documentation and go through everything that you need.

21
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:55.290
Now the reason we use Expo in this horse is that it makes it super easy for you to run and test your

22
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.890
applications.

23
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.310
But we also make sure that all the students can do this course.

24
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.420
You see, if we just do the react native KELLYE method.

25
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.820
There's some limitations, for example, on Windows, you need to actually have a Mac to even build

26
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.080
an iOS app.

27
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:19.340
So on Windows, if you have a Windows machine, you can't create a iOS app.

28
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.460
It's just the rules that Apple has come up with.

29
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.560
And there's also a lot of installation steps that you'll need for Mac OS.

30
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.050
For example, you'll need X code for Android, you'll need Android studio.

31
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:40.820
So we're going to do X potentially because it allows us to make sure that everyone taking this course

32
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.850
can actually follow along.

33
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:51.590
But don't worry, because this Expo Seelie, which I actually have downloaded over here, I've run these

34
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.320
commands and I will show you how to do that later on as well.

35
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.030
But I want to show you something quickly.

36
00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:05.630
This Expo client, if we go to package, Jason has a few options for you to be able to run your code.

37
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.490
You can run your code on Android, you can run on iOS or a simulation.

38
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.610
You can even run it on the Web, which is a new feature.

39
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.570
So if we look at the dependencies, we see that we have react.

40
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.310
We have reaction because we have the option of running it on the web as well.

41
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.570
And then we also have react native for running it on iOS and Android.

42
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:39.860
But if you ever want to not use Expo and actually build apps through Xcode or Android studio, which

43
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:47.180
is what iOS and Android recommend, you can always do NPM run highjacked.

44
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.880
And what this does is it allows you to eject from an app.

45
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.970
And what we'll see is that we actually get native Android code right here.

46
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:12.560
And native IOW code right here, so we can load up the IOW code through Xcode.

47
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.820
Or Android code through Android studio.

48
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:26.070
So although we use XPO in this course, nothing's going to prevent you from ejecting these apps and

49
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:31.030
working on Native by itself, so there really isn't any downside to export.

50
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.840
As a matter of fact, I usually recommend the path of starting with Expo and then when you're ready,

51
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.970
you can eject from XPO and build any professional app that you want.
