00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:08.050
All right, so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to make sure that focus time, our app

2
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.650
that we're going to build now is in focus.

3
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.720
So we're going to make sure that it's installed in our XPO app or you're running it on the iOS or Android

4
00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:17.110
app.

5
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.900
And we're going to make sure that our device is connected.

6
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.360
And what we're going to do, first of all, and you should always do this always, always, always.

7
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.290
If you're starting off with a snack, clean up the environment.

8
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.490
So we're going to remove the card.

9
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:31.660
We're going to remove the text.

10
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.860
We don't need any of that.

11
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.310
We're going to remove the card component.

12
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.950
We're going to remove the acid example component and we're going to remove some of the.

13
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.750
Ubiquitous styles that we don't really need and we're just going to we're just going to put it in a

14
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.730
good shape, you know, we're going to make it simple.

15
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.010
You can see here our app is empty.

16
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.560
Now we're going to delete the files we don't need because, hey, we're going to set up an application

17
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.630
the way that we want to set it up.

18
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.250
And so the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to follow some good practices.

19
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:13.500
And hey, if you don't want this in the way while coding, you can always just go ahead and make it

20
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.680
bigger by doing this and escaping out and then just minimizing it.

21
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.520
And now we have more code space.

22
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.220
And if you're running it on your phone, well, it's just useful to do that because now you have more

23
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.040
code space over here to do whatever you need to do.

24
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.880
And so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to create a folder and we're going to call it

25
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.570
source.

26
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.330
You always want to start with a source folder.

27
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.050
It's just a good practice, the folder structure.

28
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.890
Doesn't really matter if you're just trying to get things done quick and dirty, but we're trying to

29
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.620
teach you the best practices here.

30
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.190
We're trying to get it as close to a production up as possible.

31
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.790
And so we're going to start off by creating a source and a components folder.

32
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.930
And inside of the source folder, we're going to create another folder and we're going to call it features.

33
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.970
That's what's going to contain our features.

34
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.180
And let's also create a folder called Utils.

35
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.030
And I accidentally drag it at a level that I didn't want it.

36
00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.660
I had it inside of features, but I actually want inside of source.

37
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.990
So you can always go ahead and drag your.

38
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:22.000
Folders to specific folders, so if I wanted in source, I can drag it up to source and then it'll end

39
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.730
up in source.

40
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.060
So right here I have a pretty decent setup.

41
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.320
We always want to leave Abcess at the top level.

42
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.800
It's basically telling us, hey, this is the app.

43
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.380
This is the thing that's pulling everything together.

44
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.990
This is what's going to create the base of my application.

45
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.260
This is the central point.

46
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.280
That is the glue to everything else.

47
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.440
And whatever happens inside of you, well, that's what's going to.

48
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:54.650
Create our application so we may pull in features here, we'll see what we do.

49
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.510
Let's put in a quick hello world.

50
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.700
Always a great application to start with.

51
00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.500
And you can see over here, hello, world ends up at the top because we have no styling.

52
00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.840
So, you know, quick padding.

53
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.250
Let's add some padding.

54
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.230
Let's say, you know, 50.

55
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.030
Quick padding update and you can see it now, it ends up here because we added 50 padding to the top

56
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.320
left, right and bottom.

57
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.980
So we ended up in this little spot over here.

58
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.010
And so you can start playing around with what's going on here.

59
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.720
But we basically cleaned up our environment and we are ready to start building features.

60
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.790
It's always important to take the time and figure out what folder structure you want to go with.

61
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.250
If you just start coding, well, you're going to get things done, but then you're going to have to

62
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.820
go back and say to yourself, hey, I really wanted to structure things this way or that way.

63
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.870
So a little bit of thought up front never hurts.

64
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.950
Things will never be perfect on the first try, but try to think about a way that you would like to

65
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.600
structure things and apply it.

66
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.300
And this is this is one way of applying a structure.

67
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.340
All right, so now that we have our environment set up and ready to get a little bit deeper into the

68
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.940
feature set, let's start adding things to this interface, because all we have right now is Hello,

69
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:12.360
world.
