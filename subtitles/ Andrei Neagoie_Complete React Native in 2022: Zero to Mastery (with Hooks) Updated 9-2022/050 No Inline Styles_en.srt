1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,880
I can hear you screaming from the rooftops.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,860
You told us no inline styles, we set it up in our linta.

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,890
Why would you do this?

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:11,670
And.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,340
This is not ideal.

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,280
But sometimes this is the way it has to be, not I'm kidding.

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:24,340
There is a way to resolve this with without components, obviously, but we just haven't seen it yet.

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:29,200
And I don't want to overload the previous video with more content, because this one this one is a bit

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,100
strange and I'll show you why.

10
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,130
So we start patting 16 over here.

11
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:33,400
Right.

12
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:40,990
And we basically did that because we wanted the padding around the item to be concrete.

13
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:45,460
So if we were to create our own component here called restaurant list.

14
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:45,810
Right.

15
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,940
If we did contact restaurant list.

16
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,490
And we said that was equal to styled and then we gave it a flat list.

17
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,510
That didn't do anything, and if we gave it inside here, a padding of 16.

18
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:10,370
Pixels, that is well, that's 16 pixels is being applied.

19
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:16,130
But it's being applied to the holistic list, right, so it still looks right, but it's not the same

20
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:17,280
concept, really.

21
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,460
It's a bit different content.

22
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,770
Container style applies the padding to each individual element.

23
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:27,890
And so, although this looks right, it's not the same thing that we were doing previously.

24
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:34,580
In order to do that, what we would need to do is we would need to do something that is onboard style.

25
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:35,960
So we're going to leave this intact.

26
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:40,790
But right behind here, we're going to do dot press, right.

27
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:41,890
And we're going to put an object in here.

28
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:48,170
And this is the call to the function method that attributes so that attributes gives us access to give

29
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,800
specific props to our default flat list.

30
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,750
And so what we would say is content, container style.

31
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,080
Right.

32
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,210
And then we would give that an object.

33
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,130
We would say padding 16.

34
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,700
And as you can see, it's applying the style correctly to everything.

35
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,860
And that is the expected outcome that we were looking for.

36
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,699
This is exactly what we were looking for.
