00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:07,660
Hey, everyone, welcome back to the bonus section, where we'll be looking at integrating Google Maps

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:15,490
into our applications so that we can get live information from Google about these places.

3
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:20,650
Now, in order for us to do this, we're going to be using something called Firebase Functions, which

4
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:27,400
enable us to run a mobile backend without the need to manage servers, meaning we're going to be deploying

5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,710
code that's going to run on the cloud in Firebase.

6
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:39,850
And it's going to expose to us an end point from which we will receive information that comes from Google.

7
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:48,160
Now, you can read up on firebase functions over here and in actuality, what it basically is, it's

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:55,750
a little piece of code that's going to run on a server and it's going to do an API call for us to Google

9
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:00,170
in order to do our search and retrieval of information.

10
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,730
Now, a very, very important note we need to make here.

11
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,720
Very important for this portion of the course.

12
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:15,900
We are going to be upgrading from the free plan to the pay as you go plan, which also has free limits.

13
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:22,850
It has free limits, up to two million invocations a month, 400000 requests of gigabits per second.

14
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:30,250
Now, the free tier does not allow us to run functions unless we use node version eight.

15
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:38,630
This is a big limitation as node has moved way beyond and will potentially later on be removed.

16
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:45,230
So we want to be able to use Firebase in a way that allows us to deploy these functions properly.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,830
This means you will have to update your plan to pay as you go and means you need payment information.

18
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,480
And the same is true for Google Maps in order for us to use Google Maps.

19
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,370
There is a pay scale.

20
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,540
It is pay as you go.

21
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:03,150
Now, Google Maps also has a free amount of requests.

22
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,210
You can do up to 200 dollars per month of requests, but.

23
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:15,030
Just note here that in order to do the complete section of the firebase and Google Maps integration,

24
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:20,040
you will need payment information and we are not liable for any cost you may incur.

25
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:27,540
However, we will teach you how to set up the cloud environment and teach you how to run your fire function

26
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,160
locally so that you can limit the amount of live costs you may incur.

27
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,210
That being said, things can happen.

28
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:44,400
I myself, during development, made a small mistake over here in the Google Maps platform and I incurred

29
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,190
sixty five thousand requests worth of costs.

30
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:52,140
Now, that was that was a stressful evening right there.

31
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,990
But luckily I reached out to the Google platform team and they helped me out.

32
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,560
They helped me fix everything.

33
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:03,690
And they also gave me some tips and tricks that I'm going to be passing along to you in terms of setting

34
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:10,800
up quotations, making sure that your Google cloud is set up so that you can limit the amount of costs

35
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,090
you can incur.

36
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:16,800
That being said, nothing is one hundred percent fail proof.

37
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,590
That's why you have to link payment information.

38
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,240
You may incur some costs.

39
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,230
You may not.

40
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,420
It depends on how you utilize this section.

41
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,440
And we're going to teach you as much as possible about how to use these services.

42
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:34,650
If you do not have payment information, however, and you cannot do this bonus section, don't be afraid.

43
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,840
You can run your fire function, your firebase function, you can run it locally.

44
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:45,060
You will not be able to do the full integration to Google as you need payment information to talk to

45
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:45,420
Google.

46
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:54,110
But we will be migrating our mock information to a server environment, which you can invoke locally.

47
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:59,220
Now, that said, this will mean that your app will be reliant on the server.

48
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:06,780
So you have to be careful in how you approach this section because if you cannot push your fire function

49
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:14,040
to the cloud, your app will only work locally because you will only locally have the firebase function

50
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:19,670
so you can test the section out even if you don't have payment information up to a point.

51
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:25,530
It is important to, though, realize that you do need payment information in order to complete this

52
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,440
entire section.

53
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:33,210
So with that said and that out of the way, let's take a look at everything we need to put in place

54
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:38,970
in order to set up our firebase functions to build out a server.
