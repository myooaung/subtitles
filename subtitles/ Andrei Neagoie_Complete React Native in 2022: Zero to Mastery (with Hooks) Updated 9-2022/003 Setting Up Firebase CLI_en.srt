1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:07,790
Now that we have our fire base in a state in which we can deploy functions, the question becomes more.

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:15,870
How do we deploy functions and what's important here is to realize that the docs point us in really,

3
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,460
really solid directions.

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,920
If we go to Firebase Google dot com and we go to functions, get started, it tells us basically everything

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,080
we need to know about how to get started.

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,010
Now, we already have a firebase project so we can skip step one.

7
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,190
But when we go to step two, it says, set up no jass and firebases like, well, we already have no

8
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,300
just set up but Firebase Seelie, huh?

9
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:46,470
And so over here, it says you'll need no gas to write functions and you'll need Firebase CLI to deploy

10
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:51,990
the functions to the cloud function runtime, meaning that any code that we write, we need to be able

11
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:56,400
to push it up to Firebase so that Firebase can run it for us later on.

12
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,650
OK, now here's the star or the important section.

13
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:08,380
The important section is that NOGs versions 10, 12 and 14 are supported, 14 is under beta.

14
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,290
However, I have tested it and I find that it works just fine for what we are will be doing.

15
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,730
So we will be using version 14 of your own version 10 or 12.

16
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,090
That is fine as well.

17
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,910
But it's always best to be on the most recent LTE version, long term support version.

18
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,530
So it also says Theset runtime docs for important information regarding ongoing support.

19
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:35,310
So let's go over there C runtime options and it's going to tell us over here what runtime options are

20
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:35,980
available.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,630
As you can see nogs, eight is deprecated as of June 8th.

22
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,410
Twenty twenty.

23
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:47,270
So that way we can keep track of what is supported by Firebase if a newer version is supported here,

24
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,150
please go ahead and take the newer version.

25
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:57,660
Now with that, once we have node and installed, which we do, we need to install Firebase Clive through

26
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,420
our preferred method.

27
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:03,120
So over here, they give us a command NPM install minus G firebase tools.

28
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,710
So let's copy that command.

29
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:12,510
And if we go over to our terminal and we open up a new terminal, what we can do is we can run that

30
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:19,650
command that will install the firebase tools globally and by installing them globally, we will in effect

31
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,190
have.

32
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,740
Access to the firebase command.

33
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,650
Now, it also says if this command fails, you may need to change your NPM permissions.

34
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:35,000
So if you're unable to run this command, you may need to change some permissions.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,120
And if we click this link, it will take us to help documentation that will outline what we may be seeing.

36
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:48,410
And if this outlines what you may be seeing, you may want to follow these steps over here to resolve

37
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:48,740
it.

38
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:55,790
And that will allow you to set up your computer in a better place to be able to run this command if

39
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:00,770
it still feels, please reach out on our Dischord community or on the section.

40
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:06,620
But the discourse community often has a lot of students who have a lot of prior experience with dealing

41
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,010
with certain errors, and we help each other out.

42
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,980
So that's always a good option.

43
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:17,720
Now, if we go back over to the docks where we can see here is after we run NPM install firebase tools,

44
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:22,370
it says here in many cases, the new features and bug fixes are available only with the latest version

45
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,290
of Firebase Seelie.

46
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:26,840
So we'll want to update the Firebase Functions SDK.

47
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,830
And so to frequently update these, you will have to run the following functions inside of our project.

48
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:37,790
We can run NPM, install firebase functions at latest firebase admin, the latest.

49
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,790
Now, once we set this up, we will get the latest version.

50
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:47,570
But that being said, you may run into an instance where later on, if you leave the project for a while,

51
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:53,720
if it stagnates, you may have to come back to it and run these two commands in order to upgrade and

52
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,670
get the latest version of firebase functions.

53
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:02,120
OK, so once we have that, we can run something called Firebase Login.

54
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:09,100
Interesting when you initialize the firebase SDK for cloud functions to create an empty object before

55
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,880
we even go into that, we need to log in through the command line.

56
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,720
So let's go over here and let's say, OK, it's installed.

57
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,920
We've installed firebase tools at nine point one point zero.

58
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:28,450
So if we do firebase the minus minus help, what we'll see is that we have Firebase as a command available.

59
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:34,990
Now that we know that we have it available as a command, we can run firebase login and this will say

60
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,210
already logged in as McGeeney.

61
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,430
So if I do Firebase log out.

62
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:46,650
Then I will log out as Bobigny, and if I do log in again, what it's going to do, it's going to ask

63
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,540
me if it wants to collect error reporting information.

64
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,860
I'm going to say no right now.

65
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:56,190
It's going to take me into my browser and it's going to ask me to select an account with which I want

66
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:56,790
to log in.

67
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,830
So I will log in with Moaveni that.

68
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:07,360
Now, this will ask from fire basically certain permissions view and manage data across the Google cloud

69
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,970
platform, administer your firebase data and take control of cloud platform projects.

70
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,860
So we'll allow that.

71
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,540
Once we've allowed that, it will say firebases Ally Log-in is successful, you are now logged into

72
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:27,030
firebase command line and if we go back over to our command line success, you logged in as Mobeen.

73
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,370
Awesome.

74
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:36,660
Now that we are certain that we have access to our firebase cloud and we are authenticated, well,

75
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,300
over here you can see that step two and three.

76
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,610
It says go to your firebase project directory.

77
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,860
So our firebase project is meals to go.

78
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,620
And it says run firebase in a fire firestorm.

79
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:52,630
Well, we're not going to use the fire storm, so let's skip this one and then it says Firebase in it

80
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,510
functions, huh?

81
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,560
Well, we're going to use functions.

82
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:00,600
OK, so let's go ahead and do that now.

83
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,160
Let's go ahead.

84
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:05,170
Take this over here and run this in the command line.

85
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,670
Now it's going to ask us a bunch of questions and it's going to say, well, do you want to use an existing

86
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:17,640
project in your firebase to link the functions to or do you want to create a new project or do you want

87
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,250
to add it to an existing cloud platform project?

88
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,580
What do you want to do?

89
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,550
So we're going to say use an existing project.

90
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:31,250
And over here, you can see I have two miles to go, you most likely have one and you can link it to

91
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:36,140
that Miles to go project I only have two because I've tested meals to go a couple of times.

92
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,810
So we're going to link it to meals to go.

93
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:43,610
And by linking, it is going to ask us in what language do you want to write your cloud functions?

94
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:44,930
Well.

95
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:51,940
JavaScript, of course, so lets select JavaScript, do you want Esslin to catch problems and for style

96
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:58,480
we're going to say no here because we already have excellent configured in our project and it will take

97
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,470
over lintang for us in the project.

98
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:08,130
So we're going to say no here and it's going to say that is going to write the following files.

99
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:13,560
So it wrote a package, JSON, an index to get ignore and it's asking us if we want to install our dependencies.

100
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:18,370
We're going to say no here because we're going to install our dependencies ourself.

101
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:22,840
But first and foremost, what we want to do is over here.

102
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,040
We want to see what it's added.

103
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,920
It's added a firebase that Jason awesome.

104
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,610
That's empty.

105
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,950
It's added a firebase RC in which our project has been specified.

106
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,210
And so if we open up our functions folder, we can see that it's added a bunch of different information

107
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:37,630
for us.

108
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:43,120
It's added functions from firebase functions which haven't been installed yet, and the next Jass and

109
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,990
all that good stuff.

110
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:52,510
Now, what we want to do is we want to go inside our get ignored and first and foremost, let's add

111
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,300
the node modules of the subfolder.

112
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:03,550
And then let's add like that same, but we're going to also say that it can't track the node modules

113
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,220
of the subfolder, let's do get status.

114
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,980
And what we can see here is that it's tracking these three folders now.

115
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,190
Awesome.

116
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:18,060
OK, so with that, we're now ignoring the node modules inside of here.

117
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:22,030
And if we go inside of functions, what we can do is we can run yarn.

118
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,580
And then it's going to say, huh, the engine node is not compatible with this module expected version

119
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,160
12.

120
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,400
Well, what node version am I running?

121
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,220
Oh, I'm running 14.

122
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,690
OK, so let's go inside our functions.

123
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:39,620
Let's go inside our package, JSON, and let's update this to 14.

124
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,860
You may need to update this to the node version you are currently running.

125
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:51,440
So always remember to run node minus V, and if we then do yarn, it will install all of the dependencies

126
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,150
for the firebase function.

127
00:08:53,810 --> 00:09:00,070
And if we do get status here now, we can see that everything is being tracked inside of our folder

128
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,250
if we go one level up.

129
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,790
So we're tracking our see the JSON and the functions folder.

130
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:12,950
If we look at exactly what is inside of our index function currently there is no firebase function available,

131
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:19,310
but we've set up everything in a good spot so that in the next video, let's take a look at how we run

132
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,740
this actual function and what goes into it.
