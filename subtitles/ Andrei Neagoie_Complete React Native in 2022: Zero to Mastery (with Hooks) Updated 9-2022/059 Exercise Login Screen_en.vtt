00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:07.430
Now that we've reached this point, the next exercise I want us to do is I want us to build out the

2
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.320
full login screen so that we can actually already log in.

3
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.510
So over here, there will be two text inputs, an email and a password, and in the email will be able

4
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.600
to fill in the email address and then the password.

5
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.900
And if we fill in the wrong password, obviously it won't log in.

6
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.630
We won't create any visual feedback just yet.

7
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.070
But when we fill in the correct password, we are greeted with our application.

8
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.580
That is the end outcome that we're aiming towards.

9
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.390
And when we reload, the app obviously will be logged out because we're forced reloading.

10
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.710
OK, so now that we have that portion, there's a couple of things we need to set up.

11
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.990
First off, we need to add this is authenticated over here to line twenty nine.

12
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.280
That's something that needs to be in place.

13
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.410
And then also we need to make sure that we have export content on the login request.

14
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:06.110
On top of which, we need to make sure that we use the context that we've created in the login screen

15
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.410
in order to create the actual Internet output, I want us to use state.

16
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.920
So we want to use the text input field from react need of paper.

17
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.640
And this will help us actually build out that input field.

18
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.180
You can create a style component or you could put it directly in place.

19
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.920
Whatever you see fit, just try to build out the screen and do the end to end integration on your own.

20
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:37.970
And in the next video, we'll look at the solution that I made so that you can have a path forward.
