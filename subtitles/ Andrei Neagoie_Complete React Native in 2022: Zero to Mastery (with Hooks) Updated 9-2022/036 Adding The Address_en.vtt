00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.140
Now that we're here, we're in a good space to finish up our feature in order to get our restaurant

2
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.870
info card in a good spot to put in a list.

3
00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.350
And so for that, the first thing we need to do is we need to edit the font size, because the font

4
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.460
size for the title needs to be a bit bigger than it already is.

5
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:29.350
And so we'll take our props and we'll say props that theme, that font sizes dot body, because that

6
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.510
is the size that we need.

7
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:38.790
And then on top of that, what we'll do is we'll take the speccing off of the title.

8
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.990
Let's take it off of the title.

9
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.780
But we want to put something around the title that's going to be the wrapper.

10
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.010
So let's put something like info around it.

11
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.100
And let's do a style view.

12
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.180
Contact info equals styled thought view.

13
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.340
And let's put in here the padding that we had originally said.

14
00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:10.330
And so with that now inside of title, we can also add address.

15
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.310
So let's do address and then let's put an address here.

16
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:23.240
OK, so now that we have address, well, we need to make sure that we have an address type, so that's

17
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.100
also going to be of type text.

18
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.430
And so this one is going to be.

19
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.820
I changed the title to font type heading because I felt that that was more appropriate since the title

20
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.450
is of type header and so heading is going to be a lotto.

21
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.540
And so for the address, we're going to use body.

22
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.910
So we're going to use body for this one.

23
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.290
And we're also going to use the font size body.

24
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.630
Right.

25
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.520
Actually, maybe we'll use caption, let's use caption that feels more appropriate.

26
00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.380
It's a bit smaller.

27
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.560
So some restaurant at one hundred random street.

28
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.600
All right, we're looking in really good shape, but the next thing we have to put on here is the rating

29
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.500
and the icons.

30
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.460
So let's take a look at how we're going to achieve that.
