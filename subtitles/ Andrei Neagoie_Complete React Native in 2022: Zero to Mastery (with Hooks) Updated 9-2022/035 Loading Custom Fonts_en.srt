1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:06,530
The question becomes, how do we installed these fonts, because we know we're going to use Oswald and

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,580
LoDo, but what are these?

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:13,790
So let's go look them up if we go look up Oswald font.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,940
Then we can see here in the Google fonts, the Oswald font, and the same is true for the lotto font.

5
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:28,650
Now, that said, there is this cool package from Expo called Expo Google Fonts and the X will Google

6
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:35,250
Fonts Package for Expo allows you to use any of the nine hundred ninety one fonts on fonts that Google

7
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,860
dot com for your expo app.

8
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,590
That's amazing that so many fonts.

9
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,660
Honestly, if you want you can pick out your own font.

10
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:50,490
I would suggest doing the installation process of the fonts we currently have so that you know how to

11
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:50,970
do it.

12
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,050
And you could potentially pick out your own phone of you want to make the app your own.

13
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,810
But for now, let's stick to what we know, which is we need Ozwald and LoDo.

14
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,540
So let's go figure out how do we install this.

15
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,600
So here's an example of how to install the Interphone family.

16
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:13,110
So XPO install at Expo, Google Fonts, Inter Expo font, huh?

17
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,770
What is Expo installed?

18
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:22,620
Well, just like yarn and yarn ad expo install is an expensive tool going to do the installation process

19
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:28,680
for you, but also do extra things behind the scenes for hookup and consistency and making sure that

20
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,170
everything works properly as it should with Expo.

21
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,950
So we need to do two installations.

22
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,720
There's the Expo, Google fonts enter and then there's the expo font itself.

23
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:45,750
So first off, let's go into our command line and let's do Expo install expo font.

24
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,370
That's the first thing we need.

25
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,600
And then we need to do Expo install.

26
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:57,170
Export Google fonts, and we're going to get LoDo and Oswald.

27
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:04,360
So, first off, it's going to install this whole font package and this is a pretty cool process.

28
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,760
You know, it's resolving packages, fetching everything.

29
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,949
So, OK, we have XPO fonts now.

30
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:14,110
So now we have to do XPO install XPO Google Fonts, Oswald.

31
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:20,840
And after we do Oswald, what do we need to loto you got it, Lardo, is it loto?

32
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:25,730
I'm saying LoDo like it's the lottery, but, you know, building this up, we are basically winning

33
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,290
the lottery and it's so beautiful.

34
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,250
I'm kidding.

35
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:34,350
In any case, the funds were installing here are going to make our app look like we won the lottery.

36
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,790
That's what I'm trying to get at.

37
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,090
So Lardo.

38
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:46,800
OK, so once we've installed these two fonts, we're basically 90 percent of the way there to get this

39
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,180
going.

40
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:57,610
What we need to do now is we need to import the use fonts and the well, not the interphone we're not

41
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,000
using in there, but the Oswaldo Dell'Orto font.

42
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:08,370
And if we go back to the Google font, we can see that we have all different types of fonts available.

43
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,350
We have regular four hundred medium semi.

44
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,850
And it looks like we particularly want to use the four hundred varieties.

45
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,440
So how do we go about this?

46
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:24,310
Well, first off, what we need to do is we'll copy this and we'll figure out how this works over here.

47
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:30,130
So first off, we're going to create some space here and we're going to say, well, we don't want Intr,

48
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:36,220
we want Oswald, OK, we want Oswald and we don't want particularly the Oswald.

49
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:36,850
Nine hundred.

50
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,470
We want the four hundred.

51
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:43,030
OK, so it said over here, it said inturn, nine hundred black.

52
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,340
So we want Oswald.

53
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,600
Four hundred.

54
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,490
It needs to be named regular.

55
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,650
And then we have the use fonts, OK, this looks good.

56
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:01,390
So what we're going to do now is we're going to go over back to France and we're going to see how do

57
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,110
they load this.

58
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,500
OK, so they do something like this.

59
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,630
So let's do something similar.

60
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,280
So they do font's loaded.

61
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,840
So we're going to do Oswald loaded.

62
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:16,720
And we're going to do use fonts and we're going to say, Oswald, four hundred regular, OK?

63
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:24,710
And we're going to say consed here we don't like let's and next up, we need to duplicate this, duplicate

64
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:25,340
the Seline.

65
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,220
We also need to make sure that this is coming from Oswald.

66
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:29,960
This would have been bad.

67
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:34,690
We're not trying to import from Intr and we're going to LoDo Lato 400.

68
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,960
Well we need to go look does Lettow have a four hundred regular.

69
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,160
How does a little work.

70
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,910
So let's go browse the fonts and let's look for Lardo.

71
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:50,690
And if we go over here it has a four hundred regular so we're going to go that route and we're going

72
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,140
to say.

73
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:52,840
Also here.

74
00:04:54,470 --> 00:05:00,800
Lardo loaded, and we're going to use the front loto for regular.

75
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,250
Amazing.

76
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:08,610
And so now we can say, well, huh, OK, if.

77
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,160
Oswald is not loaded.

78
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,390
Or Lardo is not loaded.

79
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,780
Well, then we'll just return not we won't return to that.

80
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,130
Well, they're still loading, right?

81
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,430
So we don't want to return anything right now.

82
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,070
So let's go look at what that looks like.

83
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,750
So use funds has already been declared.

84
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:37,220
Oh, we have a duplicate use fonts, so we're going to call this as use lato and we're going to call

85
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,040
this as use Oswald.

86
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:46,100
And then we're going to say, use Oswald, use lardo.

87
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:48,850
Beautiful.

88
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,730
OK, but hey, wait.

89
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,780
Laro, it isn't being used here.

90
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:55,780
What's going on?

91
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,130
Well, we need to tell.

92
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,600
The TextField right here, which Forn family is supposed to use.

93
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,300
So we're going to go from family.

94
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:14,890
And we're going to say props and then we'll say, hey, OK, props start theme thought Font's is it

95
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,300
thought Font's, let's go look.

96
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,190
That body, so let's do that body.

97
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:29,500
OK, so we're over here, font's dort body, let's just close this so we can focus on it.

98
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:35,200
And as you can see, we set the font family over here on this line.

99
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:44,140
We said from family to props theme font's body, which is Oswald, four hundred regular and as we can

100
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,010
see here now, it has applied.

101
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,910
So we have a nice font going on.

102
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:53,260
And if we remove this line, boom, back to the ugly font.

103
00:06:53,410 --> 00:07:00,400
So we've loaded custom fonts into Riak native and we can choose from all nine hundred ninety one fonts

104
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:06,730
that Google has to offer us as long as we rinse and repeat our recipe over here for being able to load

105
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,990
different fonts.

106
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:08,470
Right.

107
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:13,820
As long as we utilize this technique right here, we'll be able to load however many fonts we want.

108
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,430
That's absolutely amazing.

109
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,570
And you can load different sizes as well.

110
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:22,480
You could go over here and you could say, OK, well, I also want 700 Bould.

111
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,470
So you could, for instance, say, I want like this LoDo.

112
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,070
700 Bould.

113
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:34,240
And then once we do that, we'll just add it to the list.

114
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:35,890
Boom.

115
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:41,340
And then once we added to the list, what we can do here is we can go over here.

116
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:48,030
Up here to our phones and we can say, for instance, that body is supposed to be this.

117
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:56,930
And oh, suddenly it's a different font, amazing, so we have this ability to load any type of font

118
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,400
from any font family.

119
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,030
That we want.

120
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:05,040
That's absolutely amazing, so I'm just going to undo this real quick because I'm going to keep it to

121
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:11,580
the base that we want to use and that's going to allow us nice consistency with the design that we set

122
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:11,820
out.

123
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,850
But feel free to load any font you want.

124
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,940
Feel free to make this your own, obviously.

125
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:21,060
So with that, we have now taken a massive step forward.

126
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:26,340
This is a customization that honestly opens so many doors for you.

127
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:27,720
Awesome.
