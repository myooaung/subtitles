00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.990
Now that we have our area of youth set up for success.

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:11.370
Next up is to add some flair to our application and by adding flair, I don't mean like crazy animations

3
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.900
or anything like that, but you know, we can start with something simple, like a background color

4
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.020
and the background color could be anything you want.

5
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:28.290
Right now, what I'm going to pick is a color that kind of represents like how I wanted to look, and

6
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.270
that can be a dark blue.

7
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.690
That dark blue is a colour that I personally prefer.

8
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.810
And I want my app to have a dark tone.

9
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.710
Now, as you can see here, the text is also kind of dark against it.

10
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.340
So we may want to add style here for the text.

11
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.020
So let's do styles of text.

12
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:59.180
And then let's add specific text colors where we can say, hey, the text color is white and we can

13
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.670
do three f's and then boom, that stands out against the dark blue.

14
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.950
One thing to note here, though, is that these strings that we put in here for background color in

15
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.590
color, we don't want to copy these around every time we want to set something as dark blue or every

16
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.170
time we want to set something to the color white.

17
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.420
So what we can do is we can add a source folder and in that source folder, what we can do is we can

18
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.250
create a folder called utils.

19
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.200
And with that folder utils, what will add is a new file and we'll call that file colors dot.

20
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.870
And in here we can say export konst colors and we'll create a map of colors.

21
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:45.950
We'll say white is equal to FSF and we'll say dark blue is equal to.

22
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.670
And then we'll grab the color that I previously had.

23
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.990
So now we have a color map.

24
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.230
We go back to the app here where we can now do is we can say import.

25
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.860
Colors.

26
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:02.540
From.

27
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.110
And then we can say that splash source utils colors.

28
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.970
Am I doing this now, he can say?

29
00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.260
Colours the dark blue.

30
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.890
And color is thought white.

31
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:26.350
And that cleans up the code a bit here and now we have a nice, dark background and some white text.

32
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.890
Awesome.

33
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.200
I was fairly simple now choose whatever color you like, make that up your own and I'll see you in the

34
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.800
next video.
