00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.320
Now that we have the basic building blocks of our app, we put in some style.

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.210
We have our colors map over here.

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.160
Let's start by trying to build our focus feature.

4
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.160
So in the source folder, what I want you to do is I want you to build a folder called features, and

5
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.350
this folder is going to contain the entry point for the features that we're going to build.

6
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.280
One of them being the focus input screen.

7
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.630
So what we're going to do in here is we're going to create a new file or we're going to call it Focus

8
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.740
Dot J.S..

9
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:42.020
And InFocus thought, yes, that's where we're going to export concert and we're going to export something

10
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.920
called focus.

11
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.190
This is going to be the building block for our focus feature.

12
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:54.230
Now let's make sure that we always, always, always import the right things to start, import, react

13
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.980
from react and then let's import view.

14
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.240
Text and style sheet.

15
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.480
From React Native.

16
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.360
Let me just switch these to a single.

17
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.960
Now with that, we can basically say here, let's create a view.

18
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:24.530
And within that view, what we're going to say is let's run there some text and that text is going to

19
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.450
be focus feature.

20
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.130
Now, let's create a style sheet, so let's say concert styles is equal to stylesheet dot create.

21
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.350
And let's create a container, and let's say that container has Flex one.

22
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:51.390
And the view of the focus feature is going to be what has this style of styles thought container?

23
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.100
So in here, what we've basically made is a very, very basic component.

24
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.200
It's the building block for our focus features.

25
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:05.430
So we're seeing let us create a functional component that has a view that has a style of styles, that

26
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.980
container, which is a flex one.

27
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.470
So it's going to take up the entire space.

28
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.890
And then let's put some text in there called focus feature.

29
00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.730
Now we should give our text some styles.

30
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.510
So let's go ahead and create text.

31
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.450
And what we'll do in here is we'll see color is and we'll take our colors map about white.

32
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.970
So but we still need to import that.

33
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.920
So let's import colors.

34
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.120
From dot dot slash utils colors.

35
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.670
Now, there are certain important mechanisms that you can use to make your imports more pretty.

36
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:54.190
What we're trying to get out here is the easiest, fastest way to build out an entire app with a limited

37
00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:01.150
friction as possible to get you kind of acquainted with React native syntax, focusing predominantly

38
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.270
on how the building blocks work and how you can use views and text to build out functionality and get

39
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.390
an app functioning as fast as possible.

40
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:19.060
So now that we have our focus feature, let's go back to app and in here, let's say import focus from

41
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.540
and say dot slash source features focus.

42
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.020
Now, let's grab that, let's get rid of our text over here, and let's put focus in you.

43
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.490
And what we'll see is, oh, focus features there, but we miss them.

44
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.890
So let's go over here, huh?

45
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.850
Text is an unused style.

46
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.610
Oh, we forgot to add it here.

47
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.150
So let's say style is equal to styles dot text.

48
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.130
And boom, that should turn white.

49
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:46.390
Great.

50
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:54.130
Now over here, what we can do is we can clean up some of these files and we're good to go.

51
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.320
We now have the building spot for our focus feature.

52
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.210
So let's look at that in the next video.
