00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.350
With that whole prelude, you may be wondering to yourself, well, what exactly are we going to then

2
00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:06.540
learn in the section?

3
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.580
Well, let's break that down.

4
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.370
Let's break that down so that you understand exactly what you're going to get out of the section.

5
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:19.450
Currently, our app is managed by XPO, so we're running our entire app inside of the Expo infrastructure.

6
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:26.470
In order for us to go to the App Store and the Google Play store, we need to do something special because

7
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.380
currently Expo is kind of the manager of our application.

8
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:42.130
So we need to take what Expo has and we need to output a bundle, a package, so to speak, that the

9
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.320
App Store will understand and that the Google Play store will understand.

10
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.690
Now for the App Store, this is called an IPA file.

11
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.990
And for the Android store, this is called an app file.

12
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.290
And so both of these files are specific to the platform that they will run on.

13
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.370
One runs on iOS, the other runs on Android.

14
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.420
The output of the bundle that we're trying to generate, we are generating through Expo.

15
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.310
Expo is managing this for us.

16
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.020
But we have to tell you what it's going to built, whether it's going to build for iOS or whether it's

17
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.520
going to build for Android.

18
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.550
And by doing this expo will then give us the outputted package.

19
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:24.250
And what we subsequently need to do is understand where we need to go in order to manage the release

20
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.070
process for the play store.

21
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.630
We will show you where exactly you can go through the process of doing the release for the App Store.

22
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.090
We will also show you how App Store Kinect works.

23
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:41.320
And subsequently, once you know all of these individual steps, you can go and deepen your knowledge

24
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.210
on specifically what the release procedures takes, what the common pitfalls are, and understand what

25
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.850
exactly you need to do by better educating yourself.

26
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:55.450
But having that end to end flow, seeing how you can take our Expo app and generate these output files,

27
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.780
and then knowing subsequently where to target.

28
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:06.010
What you need to do is enough of a foundation to then go and deepen your knowledge and investigate on

29
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.500
your own what specifically you should do for the apps that you then want to release once you go and

30
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.040
build an app.

31
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.500
Because in most scenarios, in most established companies, the process of releasing to the App Store

32
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.320
has already been established and the process of deploying to the Google Play store has also already

33
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.980
been established.

34
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.130
But it's good to have that foundational knowledge of what exactly goes into that process and investigating

35
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.870
subsequently on your own.

36
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.540
If you wanted to release your own app, knowing where to target these things can be fundamentally important.

37
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.900
So we want to show you the basics of generating these output files and then showing you where exactly

38
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.400
you can start your journey.
