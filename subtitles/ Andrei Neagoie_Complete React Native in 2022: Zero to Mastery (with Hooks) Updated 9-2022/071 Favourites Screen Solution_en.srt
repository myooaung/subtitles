1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,100
All right, so here I'm going to show you how I would have built a favorite screen, I hope you all

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,800
got a version working that works for you.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,560
However, this is the model solution.

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,240
This is how I would have done it.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,620
That doesn't mean that there aren't different ways, but I would have said const favourite's is equal

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,180
to the use context.

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:27,050
Of the favors context, so we would have pulled in the favorites context and we would have done that

8
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,230
from import favourite's context, from.

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,100
Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, slash services.

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,760
And then the favorites context, and that would have given us access to our favorites at that point.

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,940
I would have said if favourite's dot length, we're going to return something, otherwise we're going

12
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,470
to return something else.

13
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:56,910
And the something else we're going to return is, first of all, let's import the safe area and let's

14
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:57,990
import text as well.

15
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:05,519
And then we're going to render out in the safe area is a text where we say if you do not have favorites

16
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,820
yet, we're going to render out no favorites found yet.

17
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,650
But if you do have a length, let's just put that to no real quick.

18
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,510
Right over here.

19
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:19,590
We're seeing, well, a line item center justify content center.

20
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,750
So we're going to need a styled component here in order to make this a bit nicer styled from styled

21
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,790
components, Netiv.

22
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,390
And we're going to call this favourite's area.

23
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:37,170
Const favourite's area is equal to styled and let's call that area.

24
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:46,030
Let's take the safe area of you, let's add onto it and let's say a line items center.

25
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:50,460
And let's say justify content center.

26
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,060
And by doing this, we can now put in favourite's area.

27
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:03,510
Let's remove the style over here, and by doing this, we can put favourite's area here great.

28
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,610
No inline styles.

29
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,970
What do we render, though, if it has a length?

30
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,610
Well, that's a good question.

31
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:14,340
Let's take our safe area then at that point, because we want to render out a safe area.

32
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:19,360
We don't need to align anything and let's say safe area.

33
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,780
You know what let's call favourite's area.

34
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,490
No favourite's area.

35
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,670
See, no favorite area.

36
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,260
Let's call out because it's only when you have no favorites.

37
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,710
So when you have favorites, we're going to render out a safe area.

38
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:37,940
And what we're going to do is we're actually going to import our restaurant list component.

39
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:43,800
What is that component that actually well, let's go look at restaurants and let's go look at the components.

40
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:56,670
And so what we had inside of our restaurant screen was a restaurant list that came from the restaurant

41
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,360
lists component.

42
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,500
That was a flat list.

43
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,100
Correct.

44
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:02,460
So we use the flat list with a content container inset.

45
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:03,830
All right.

46
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,910
So now we need to reuse this.

47
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,290
How are we going to reuse it?

48
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,830
Well, we can export it, but we kind of want to put it somewhere nice.

49
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:11,270
Right.

50
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,810
So let's go over here.

51
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,610
So we have restaurant info, car styles.

52
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:21,270
So let's create a new file called Restaurant List DOT Component Dargis.

53
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,860
And although it's a style component, we're still going to call it a component because it's going to

54
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,030
be reused in that way.

55
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:33,060
We could also call it that styles, maybe we should call it out styles to be consistent.

56
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:39,990
So let's do that styles and let's say Export Council restaurant list and then let's import style from

57
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,020
styled components native.

58
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,620
And then let's import philatelist.

59
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:55,380
From React native, you could also do style that flat list, and by doing this now, we can go and say

60
00:03:55,390 --> 00:04:05,470
restaurant list is the import restaurant list from slash components, slash restaurant list styles.

61
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,600
And now inside of our favorite screen, what we can say is.

62
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,370
Import restaurant list from the states.

63
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:21,339
And then again, dot org slash will go to restaurants, will go to component's, will go to restaurant

64
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:22,450
lists, styles.

65
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,330
And with this component now, we will build our view here.

66
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:33,540
So we'll say the same thing that we did over in the restaurant screen.

67
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:38,610
So where the restaurant list is, we're going to do the exact same thing.

68
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,610
We're going to copy this entire implementation from line forty nine.

69
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,660
So we'll copy that and we'll go back to our favorite screen.

70
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,360
And this is basically what we need right here.

71
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,250
So what else do we need?

72
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,240
Well, we need touchable opacity, so we're going to import touchable opacity.

73
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,900
From Riak native.

74
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,160
And then once we have that now, we need a restaurant.

75
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,500
So what else do we need here?

76
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:09,950
Well, we need to use the context for the restaurants from the restaurants context.

77
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:17,380
So let's do that restaurants context and we're going to import the restaurants context.

78
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:24,640
From the services restaurant, so restaurants, context from services, restaurants.

79
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,880
Restaurants that context, such as.

80
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:36,890
And once we have that one in there now, we can grab all of our restaurants and what else are we missing?

81
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,270
Well, we need navigation.

82
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,540
So our favorite screen is going to pull in navigation.

83
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,580
And then what we need is our spacer.

84
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,580
So we're going to pull in our spacer from.

85
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,060
Spacer spaceboy component.

86
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,980
Kind of building it up correctly.

87
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,850
And then we can pull in our restaurant in Fourcade, so we're going to do restaurant info card and we're

88
00:05:58,850 --> 00:05:59,720
going to go here.

89
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:07,240
To the end, we're going to delete this part, we're going to say restaurant info, card thought, component

90
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:07,460
thought.

91
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:07,880
Yes.

92
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:13,880
Now we've built up our favorite screen based on features that we built for the restaurant screen.

93
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:20,850
So we're utilizing code in a proper way to build out a feature quickly and safely.

94
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,070
Now it says favourite's has already been declared.

95
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,190
What exactly is going on here?

96
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,940
Oh, this hasn't been refreshed properly.

97
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,190
So let's just restart this.

98
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:38,570
And once we restart it, what we should be able to see is, first of all, if we have any imports that

99
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,850
are incorrect, so import safe area component.

100
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,760
So let's go look at that.

101
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,240
Is our safe area coming from the right spot?

102
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:53,450
So let's just make components a safe area and this is in the favorites screen.

103
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:59,450
So let's just reload this real quick, unable to resolve all those components.

104
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,750
So let's just make sure that this is the correct path.

105
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:10,830
And let's do this thought out, slash, component's, slash, utility, slash safe area, that component,

106
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,640
and once we do that.

107
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,980
Let's reload here.

108
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:22,470
And we should be good to go once we go to our settings screen and we load our favorites now we can see

109
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,580
all of our favorites over here or can we?

110
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,120
Oh, I copied a bit too much code.

111
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:35,190
Like I said, we didn't need to load the restaurant, so we actually didn't need the restaurant's context.

112
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,380
And this can happen when you copy code.

113
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,730
You have to be very aware of what your data sources.

114
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:46,590
And so now when we swap it out and we go to settings, now we're rendering out our favorites.

115
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:52,170
And if we go back here and we quickly add one, what we can see over here is it's been added to the

116
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:52,650
list.

117
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:57,390
So always make sure that your data source is correct and that you're pulling the correct information

118
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,800
into your list.

119
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:04,440
Because as you can see, when I'm copy pasting code between features, it's very easy to have a slight

120
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,760
oversight line.

121
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:13,530
Twenty four caught me in my overview here in my feature overview of Favourite's, I was loading the

122
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:17,240
entire list of restaurants, not just the favorites, but with a quick swap.

123
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:22,200
We now have the correct implementation and it goes back to the restaurant view and it shows you the

124
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,070
detail page.

125
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,240
Amazing.

126
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:33,270
So looking at this now, we have a fully featured application, we can view our favorites, we can log

127
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:37,890
out, we can log in, we can register, we can view a map view of our restaurants.

128
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,840
We can go into the detail view.

129
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,400
We have the menus.

130
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:43,260
We can see what they sell.

131
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,660
All of that is a great feature.

132
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:50,040
We can show our favorite bar here at the top that has a nice effect.

133
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:56,040
We have the clearing of search and the sinking of search between the two places we can search for Antwerp.

134
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,490
And if we search for Antwerp over here, we're going to view Antwerp.

135
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,720
If we log out, we have this cool watermelon that's going to pop out when we register.

136
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,630
We have the entire registration flow set up.

137
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,820
We have manuell back buttons.

138
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:16,800
Just we have all the features, every single thing you could think of.

139
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,690
Absolutely amazing.

140
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:26,880
Now, with that, you have built the majority of focus time and now we can go and look at ways to extend

141
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,740
functionality.

142
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,740
Great job.
