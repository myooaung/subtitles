WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.540
Now that we have our map, you rendering and our search hooked up, the next point that we need to get

2
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:13.070
to is the ability to render out the map markers that are required for this map.

3
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.970
So let's open up the map and then let's see how we're going to go about this.

4
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.590
So first and foremost, we're going to need our restaurants.

5
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.280
How do we get our restaurants?

6
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:30.170
Well, what we're going to need to do is we're going to need to pull in both the location context and

7
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.310
the restaurant context.

8
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:39.350
And for us to do that, we're going to need to import both location context and the restaurant context

9
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.140
from their service folder's.

10
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.170
That means a short little import statement here to make sure that we pull in the context.

11
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.470
And then once we have them, what we need to do here is inside of the map view.

12
00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.320
We're going to have to do a type of restaurants that map where we're mapping over the restaurants,

13
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:07.820
getting the individual restaurant and then taking that information and rendering something out.

14
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.820
So for now, let's return null because we're not going to be rendering anything out.

15
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.790
And let's see let's see if our app still renders.

16
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.410
So if we go over to the map, you we're still good.

17
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.210
Now, how do we how do we render out a map marker?

18
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.650
Well, that's a good question.

19
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.640
The React Native Maps has something called map view that marker.

20
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.120
So we imported map view, but we also imported maps.

21
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.510
You wrapped map you with the style component.

22
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.220
But for this we're going to reference map view dot and we're going to do dot marker.

23
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.410
This is going to give us a marker that we're going to be able to use in order to determine a specific

24
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.950
position.

25
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.640
Now, where are we going to place this marker?

26
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.080
Well, that's a good question.

27
00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:03.310
We don't even know where we are on the map yet, but if we put markers for each restaurant, we need

28
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.650
to give it coordinates.

29
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:13.300
So it's going to take some type of coordinates that's going to have a longitude latitude.

30
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:24.530
Now, before we get into that, how about we make our map, first of all, render out the correct space,

31
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.620
because right now our map markers are not going to be able to render out in the correct spot.

32
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.320
We need to figure out how we're going to get our map in the correct spot.

33
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.620
So let's put no back here and let's think about this.

34
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.680
So when we put together a location in our infrastructure folder.

35
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.340
In our services fold, or rather, we when we put together a location, the location Mark gave us back

36
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.240
geometry, and so far we've used longitude and latitude from the location object to determine how to

37
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.470
search for restaurants.

38
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.690
But now we need to use both this location and the viewport.

39
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.960
The viewport is referring to where on the map it's supposed to focus to determine how we're going to

40
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.240
let our map render out the correct spot.

41
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.610
In order to do this, we're going to need to do some math.

42
00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.250
So what we're going to do is we're going to write a use effect.

43
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:27.260
And this use effect is going to be what is going to calculate exactly where we're supposed to render.

44
00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.920
And it's going to change based on the location changing.

45
00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.640
Now, what it's going to do for us is it's going to do some of the heavy lifting.

46
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.920
We're going to need to track something called Latitude Delta.

47
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.820
Latitude Delta is what determines how close the zoom level is going to be on the map.

48
00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:52.190
And right now, we don't have any information about that just yet.

49
00:03:52.610 --> 00:04:01.760
But how we calculate this is we do our viewport, so we're going to pull in our viewport from location.

50
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.710
That means we're going to do CONSED.

51
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.460
Viewport is equal to location.

52
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:16.120
And we're going to pull in our viewport in order to be able to calculate all of this now, are we exposing

53
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.339
our viewport currently on the location object?

54
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:24.360
Well, let's go look at location, context, and currently location is pulling in the following.

55
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:31.630
If we go into our service, currently, our location is pulling in Laerte and Lang from geometry location,

56
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.340
but we do not have a viewport.

57
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.480
So let's expose viewport by doing geometry dot.

58
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:46.410
And let's let's go double check if we do geometry, oh, it's geometry, dot viewport, OK, so geometry

59
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.850
dot viewport by exposing this now we'll have access to the viewport.

60
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.880
And if we cancel that log the viewport.

61
00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.150
We'll be able to know what exactly is going on now, it's missing a dependency.

62
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.020
It also needs to take into account if the viewport changes.

63
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.740
And by doing this now, we're able to calculate.

64
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:10.780
So let's close this up.

65
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:16.390
Let's open up our terminal and let's go to where our code is running.

66
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:26.590
And now we can see that when we console that log out the viewport, we are getting a entire object right

67
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:27.000
here.

68
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.260
So if we do this.

69
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.360
Are we actually getting the correct output?

70
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:34.890
Let's go back to location, Mark.

71
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.970
Well, when we do the viewport, we should be getting northeast and southwest.

72
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:51.370
So let's go ahead and say DOT North East and let's see what that renders out when we re trigger the

73
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.810
render inside of here.

74
00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.070
Well, now we're getting lat and langue amazing.

75
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.540
OK, so now we have our viewport ready, ready to rock and roll so we know that we have the information

76
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:07.550
that we need and to calculate the delta, what we're going to do is we're going to take the northeast

77
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:14.600
latitude and the southwest latitude and the delta is going to be the difference between the two of these.

78
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:21.470
And so we can we can we can shorten this by just writing this inside the Latitude Delta function.

79
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.300
Now that we know the latitude Delta, we need to use this information in some way.

80
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.500
So what does the map take while the map is going to take coordinates as well?

81
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.980
And when we say coordinates, we say region is equal to.

82
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:47.660
And then we can say latitude is equal to Laerte, longitude is equal to all LNG, and then the latitude

83
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:55.520
Delta is going to be Laerte Delta and then we're going to set the longitude delta.

84
00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:03.360
To zero point zero two, which is a default zoom level that we have to determine that we want, and

85
00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.370
now when we render out our map, well, first of all, we need to get Latin langue out here because

86
00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:09.660
we need them for the map.

87
00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:14.630
And then once we do that, if we go to our mapu, we are now zooming in on San Francisco.

88
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.270
And if we search for Antwerp, we're going to zoom in to Antwerp.

89
00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:23.210
And if we search for Toronto, we're going to be zooming in to Toronto.

90
00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:27.200
We search for Chicago, and now we can zoom in to Chicago.

91
00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:36.960
So we've quickly built the ability for our map to take the information from the response, calculate

92
00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:43.470
what zoom level it needs to be at with the longitude and latitude Delta, take the latitude and longitude

93
00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:51.630
of the position and then put that as the maps region so that we can specifically see where we are on

94
00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:52.050
the map.

95
00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.080
And the same is true for Android.

96
00:07:55.380 --> 00:08:01.590
San Francisco is rendering here and if we search for Antwerp, we'll be going to Antwerp and rendering

97
00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:03.290
out the city center of Antwerp.

98
00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.000
So that's amazing.

99
00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:10.050
Just a couple of lines of code with all of the information that we already had available from our location,

100
00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:11.460
context and our restaurants.

101
00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:15.180
And we're able to put the map in the right position.

102
00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:22.020
And now that we're able to put the map in the right position, what we can do is we can start rendering

103
00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:25.200
out the markers for the restaurants.

104
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.640
But we need to dissect the restaurant information to determine where we're going to put the markers.

105
00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:31.140
So let's go ahead and do that.
