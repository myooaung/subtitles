00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.670
Man, oh, man, am I excited, you know, building up this flow wasn't as hard as you may have thought,

2
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:08.920
right?

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:15.240
You may have thought integrating stripe, getting a payment token is going to be 2000 lines of code

4
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.440
and five months of work.

5
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.140
No, it was about approximately 30 lines of code and super easy.

6
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.240
And that's what Stripe's sets out to do.

7
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.650
It sets out to make payment integration as easy as possible and scalable.

8
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.720
That's why we choose it.

9
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.040
It's a first class library and platform to do this.

10
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.800
And we want to give you all the tools that you can leverage in order to do things right on the job.

11
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.230
OK, so now that we have our Tulgan, we're focusing on Check-Out, here's where things are going to

12
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.880
change, because now we need to focus on the user experience side of things.

13
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.640
We're not working with Stripe in the following couple of videos.

14
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.540
Not necessarily.

15
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.650
We have our token already.

16
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.210
Once we get to the payment step, that's when we'll come back to it.

17
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.700
But in the checkout flow now we're thinking user experience.

18
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.050
Now we're thinking, hey, when the user wants to check out what products do they have?

19
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.190
What are they going to do?

20
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.920
And that's where we start building out what we would call a cart, right, every checkout comes with

21
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.210
a cart, every checkout comes with products that you can add to cart.

22
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.830
Every checkout has a flow.

23
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.240
And so we need to start thinking about that.

24
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.470
What we need to start thinking about, what that looks like and what that feels like, because we can't

25
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.070
just go and integrate a credit card input and then just say hit pay.

26
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.700
No, no.

27
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.760
We need to hook it up into the restaurant screen.

28
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.760
We need to hook it up into the the flow of this.

29
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:52.260
And so what I came up with here, since we're doing a End-To-End integration, that kind of feels like

30
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.700
you are processing a real payment.

31
00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.670
Every single restaurant, no matter if we're with live data or production data or mock data, it doesn't

32
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:07.840
really matter what we're going to do because the stripe integration is solely in a test sandbox is we're

33
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.440
going to have every single restaurant offer a special, OK, so we're going to have every restaurant

34
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.010
offer a special.

35
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.030
What is that going to look like?

36
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.000
Well, let me show you, if I open up my production meals to go up here to show you the full flow and

37
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:29.440
I click on Zuni CafÃ©, what you're going to see here is an order special button and order special is

38
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.750
going to read twelve ninety nine.

39
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.250
And when we hit that, it's going to add that the cart and at the top we're going to see the restaurant

40
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.120
we're ordering from.

41
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.730
We're going to see our order, we're going to see that it's a special for twelve ninety nine and we're

42
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.260
going to see our total and then we're going to be able to fill in our name.

43
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.840
We're going to be able to fill in our credit card information.

44
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.530
Right.

45
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.240
And then once we do that, we're going to be able to pay.

46
00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:01.810
And once we pay, it will go through life payment and we'll either succeed or fail and tell us and then

47
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:02.950
our cart will be empty.

48
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.260
So that's that's kind of the full flow that we're going for.

49
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.950
But what we're trying to build right now is this order special.

50
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.520
So when we order a special, we're going to try to build out the screen.

51
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.250
That's going to show us, hey, we're ordering a special and it's going to show us where we're ordering

52
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.970
a special from.

53
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.970
It's going to show us the information and then we'll start building out the bottom section here, which

54
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.670
we will consider to be the payment flow.

55
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.480
So we're going to focus on kind of building out that cart integration.

56
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.390
That's going to show us this information right here.

57
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.940
That's going to be the next couple of videos.

58
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.740
And then eventually we'll trickle into payment and kind of gracefully handling all of that.
