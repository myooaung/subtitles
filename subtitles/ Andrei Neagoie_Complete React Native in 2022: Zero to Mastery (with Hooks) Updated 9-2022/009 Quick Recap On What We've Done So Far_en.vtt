00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.560
Hey, all, I quickly wanted to recap something, so in the previous video, we saw a lot of information,

2
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.150
a lot, a lot, a lot of information.

3
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.520
And so with that, we set ourselves up for success.

4
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.070
We set up our environment.

5
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.140
Now, one thing I want to make sure that is crystal clear is that because we have the Expo app over

6
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:28.040
here and our snack is now connected to our account in our recently opened projects, will always be

7
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.610
able to find our focus time again.

8
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.550
And since we've opened it up over here in a couple of seconds, it's going to show up.

9
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.610
And recently in development, it takes some time to sink sometimes.

10
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:44.510
So if you have a snack open that is linked to your account, you can rest assured that you're always

11
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.780
going to find it over here.

12
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.600
Worst case, you can just open it in the recently opened, but it's over here.

13
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.670
And if we click that one where you're going to see over here is that in connected devices, it's going

14
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.730
to show us that my phone is connected.

15
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.860
So most iPhone is connected.

16
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.209
And with that, I can now determine if I want it to update as I type.

17
00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:12.470
So continuously send updates or I can determine when it will update and I can even reload the app forcefully.

18
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.110
So if I say update now you can see it goes to Hello World.

19
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.490
We can now also toggle our preview on and off to have more space to code.

20
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.600
And with all of that information, I just quickly wanted to summarize and recap that we have the ability

21
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.180
to just code from our browser and send it directly to our phone.

22
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.790
No setup required at all.

23
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.760
No hard packages to install.

24
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.500
Just quickly from the browser, straight to the phone, test things out.

25
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.760
It's so easy to scaffold and bootstrap and just play around with things.

26
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.620
Now, of course, don't go building any hard core apps in a Web browser with millions and millions of

27
00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:58.130
lines of code.

28
00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.480
You're going to hit performance lag.

29
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:05.090
But for our initial focus time app, we're going to hit the ground running and we're going to build

30
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.210
it.
