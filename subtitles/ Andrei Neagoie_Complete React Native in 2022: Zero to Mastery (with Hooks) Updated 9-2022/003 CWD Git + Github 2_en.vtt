00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.250
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:09.140
Let's continue from our previous video to talk about a more advanced workflow and get and GitHub.

3
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:17.670
Now, up to this point, both Marcy and I have just been working on over here, branch master.

4
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.890
What does that mean?

5
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.250
Well, it says branches, but I only see master here.

6
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.160
And you might have noticed one issue with the way that we were doing things.

7
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.770
That is if it's my first day on the job and I just changed the title.

8
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.990
But maybe we don't even want that change.

9
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.710
Maybe that breaks our branding or breaks our app.

10
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.230
But I was able to do it so easily to change it into m. maybe Marsi didn't even know that I've added

11
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.780
that change and that's a big problem, right?

12
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.430
You don't want to put things into what we call production, into what the user sees.

13
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.220
If it's going to break our website.

14
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.500
If you're a big company like Facebook, that could mean millions of dollars in lost revenue, even if

15
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.319
you have a bug that lasts a few hours.

16
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.630
So I'm going to show you a more realistic workflow that you'll have, and that is with branching.

17
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.610
No, show you what I mean.

18
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.140
I have over here a visual of what it is really, really good at.

19
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:24.180
Up until now, we've been working on what we call master, that is the master branch.

20
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.710
Think of the master branch as the authority.

21
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.100
This is the right way that our app or our website should look.

22
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:40.990
And up until now, when I did the cool background title, well, I went from a background generator

23
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.660
to cool generator.

24
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:50.470
And then when Marsi changed it to capitalized letters, then we went to here and we just went in a linear

25
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.110
fashion from one end to the other, to the other to the other.

26
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.160
But like I said, that is a bit of a problem.

27
00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.110
So a better thing to do is what we call branching.

28
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:06.010
If I wanted to change the title, I will create a branch and just call it little feature, for example,

29
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.970
and I just work on that branch on my own without affecting the master branch, what the user sees.

30
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.890
Only when it's finished, when Marsi has reviewed it, when we have tested it and everybody on the team

31
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.550
is OK, then we bring it back into M..

32
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.310
And you can see over here with the big feature, you can keep going for a long time on your own branch

33
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.890
and only when you're done do what we call merge into M..

34
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.440
I'm going to show you how that works today.

35
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:48.760
I'm going to close this and remember our example, we have Marcy's computer here with all the files

36
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.230
and we have my computer here with all the files.

37
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.030
We both have our workstation set up.

38
00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:02.540
And now you see what master in my terminal means, and I'll show you in the notes afterwards how you

39
00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.630
can have this set up so it tells you what branch you're on.

40
00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.620
But we can see that we're both on M..

41
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:09.530
That's my computer.

42
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:17.840
And Marcy's computer is also an M. We want to make sure that we're both up to date with the latest GitHub.

43
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.880
So Marcy's going to do get pull and I'm also going to do get pull.

44
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:32.930
And let's say that I'm now working on a new feature, and because it's a better workflow not to work

45
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.520
on master and this is a good tip, generally don't work on master, always branch off.

46
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:44.390
If I do get Branch, they'll show me that, well, I only have one branch and that is master, but we

47
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.020
can add to it.

48
00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.870
We can say get branch new or little feature.

49
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.270
And now if I do get Branch.

50
00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.390
I see that I have little feature, but master is highlighted because I'm currently a master, so the

51
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.950
way I would go to the little feature branch, I'll say get Check-Out.

52
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.240
Little feature.

53
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.530
And there you go, switch to branch little feature, and now I'm on a little feature branch.

54
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.600
So what I've done is I've branched off of M. and now created a little feature.

55
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.740
Let's create a bit of a change, I'm going to say in the little feature, we're going to change the

56
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.890
current access background title to say this is the background.

57
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.510
I'm going to safe here, and again, I do my simple workflow that we did in the last video get status.

58
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.550
I see that we have the index that a small change to clear so we can see.

59
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.050
So now that we've made this change, let's do get add.

60
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.150
And again, just get status to make sure everything went through.

61
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:10.560
Yeah, we're ready to commit indexable so we'll get commit message will be changing.

62
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.400
Text.

63
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.270
Perfect.

64
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:21.530
Let's clear that and now again, in order to let GitHub know of the changes we need to do, get push,

65
00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.840
so we'll do get push.

66
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.660
All right, let's go to GitHub and see what happened.

67
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:40.590
We see that now we have this yellow bar that just showed up and says you recently pushed branches.

68
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.520
So if I click on this green button here, compare, pull request.

69
00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:54.590
It shows me what changes I have, which is I've changed the title and here I can let Marcy know, saying,

70
00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.280
Marci, I've changed the text.

71
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:00.500
What do you think?

72
00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.370
And I click on Create a Pull request.

73
00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:11.340
And now I have my PR and you see here how says Mersch pull requests?

74
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:17.290
Well, if we go back to our diagram, I've created this little feature and now I'm saying, hey, Marci,

75
00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.710
I've just done this new change.

76
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:21.630
What do you think?

77
00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.550
Is it OK for me to merge it into M..

78
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:30.490
And what will happen here most likely is Marci's will come see this pull request.

79
00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.480
You can see that we're on the pull request, ABSs, so she'll be able to see them.

80
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.970
And seeing Andray just did this change.

81
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:38.920
She'll look through the changes.

82
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:48.530
And she'll say, hmm, well, if she likes this, she could be like, looks good, she can click on

83
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.720
start a review and you know, she likes this.

84
00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.210
So she's just going to approve.

85
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:06.590
Now, Marsi or myself, usually you don't want to merge your own pull requests, somebody on the team

86
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:06.800
does.

87
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.090
It can now just say March, pull, request, confirm, merge.

88
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.570
Sometimes like deleting the branch after so you can just click delete here.

89
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.140
If I go back to the code.

90
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:28.570
Well, I don't have the branches anymore because I just deleted it, but in my master, if I go to index

91
00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.160
out Simmel, I see this is the background.

92
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:37.750
So now Marci can go to her project and say, get pool.

93
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:43.990
She has the latest update.

94
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:52.480
Now, let's talk about some conflicts that can arise now, let's say Marsi wants to change something

95
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:56.380
and I also change the same thing and we get our Mirch conflict.

96
00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:57.970
Let's see what happens.

97
00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:03.790
So let's say Marsing wants to change, create a new feature saying we'll call this one big feature.

98
00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:11.490
And she'll say, get Check-Out or get Branch big feature.

99
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:17.510
She'll say, get check out big feature.

100
00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.360
And if I do get Branch, we see that there's a new branch here.

101
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:29.990
Let's clear that and she'll say here that she wants to change this back to background, color or background

102
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:34.429
generator, because all the users are complaining that the title changed and they like the old title.

103
00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:35.630
So she's changed that.

104
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:40.309
She has done the get add.

105
00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:42.809
Get commit.

106
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.040
Reverting back to old title.

107
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:53.730
Perfect, and then she's going to do get push.

108
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.320
Let's clear that first, actually, and we do get push.

109
00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:04.430
First time you get this, you might get this error saying that there's no upstream, you just copy the

110
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:06.050
code that they give you here.

111
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.160
Perfect.

112
00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.470
Now, if I go back.

113
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:19.800
The background generator, I see the big feature pull request over here.

114
00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:27.580
And just to show you that you can have multiple comments, let's say Marcy decides to oh, this is me,

115
00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.330
Marcy decides to add an exclamation point here.

116
00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.080
She can just say again, she saves this.

117
00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:34.720
That's clear.

118
00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.670
And she'll say, get ad.

119
00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:43.840
Get commit, you do this a lot, so you get really, really good to get after working in a company for

120
00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:49.120
a while and she'll say added X exclamation.

121
00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:53.340
Oops, that's not what I want to do, get commit.

122
00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:01.360
Added exclamation.

123
00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.890
And she'll do get push again.

124
00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:11.920
And let's go back to get help.

125
00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:19.340
If we look at the pool request, they'll actually have both of these reverting back to all title and

126
00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:26.990
added exclamation, and we see over here both of the changes create the pool request needs changes.

127
00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:28.310
Andre.

128
00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.390
So while this poor request is out there.

129
00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:41.180
I decided to start a new branch called let's just call it conflict for now.

130
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:47.440
And I'll get Check-Out conflict.

131
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:51.470
And now in the conflict branch.

132
00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:54.970
I decide to change.

133
00:10:56.350 --> 00:11:00.910
This to just completely remove the coal generator.

134
00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:03.970
I say that.

135
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:10.500
Again, I check my status and index that my file has been changed.

136
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:18.480
So while this is happening, I get Marcy to merge, to pull request.

137
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.000
So she's entered into Mascia.

138
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.020
Her request is in.

139
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:27.390
And now if I go back to my conflict, I do get a status.

140
00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:36.240
And we have to add these, so get add and get commit to a short message here, just check.

141
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:41.760
And now if I go back to M..

142
00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:51.800
Oh, I have to do get checkout master again before I push my changes, I want to make sure that I have

143
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.850
the latest version of a master so I'm not changing anything.

144
00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:57.170
I won't have any conflicts.

145
00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:02.030
So I'll do get pull to get the latest.

146
00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:07.640
And now I go to get checkout.

147
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.000
Conflict branch.

148
00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:14.300
And I can do this comment get.

149
00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:16.560
Merge.

150
00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:22.310
M. So I'm saying merge whatever is a master into conflict.

151
00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:31.280
Marcy has been working on the big feature and she's merged it, so now Master has the big feature branch.

152
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:40.060
I've also created another branch and I've been working on my own on the conflict branch.

153
00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:45.930
And the conflict branch doesn't know anything about masochism, saying, hey, whatever is a master

154
00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:52.110
right now, which includes the big feature that Marsi worked on, pull it in and make sure that there's

155
00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:52.770
no conflict.

156
00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:54.300
So I do that.

157
00:12:55.250 --> 00:13:00.350
And oh, I get conflict, Merche conflict and index, not Mafa.

158
00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:04.880
Now, if I actually click on Sublime Text, let me open this up so you can see a better.

159
00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:10.910
Oh, boy, I get this weird little syntax.

160
00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:19.300
It's overwhelming at first, but it's easy to see what happening head is where my branch is at and it

161
00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:25.600
shows me that here to the end I don't have the H1 anymore.

162
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:30.040
But in the master branch, we have a background generator.

163
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:36.700
Now I can talk to Marcy and say, hey, Marcy, do you want to keep that back on generator title?

164
00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.460
And she'll say, yes, that was the right thing to do.

165
00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.540
Don't change the background.

166
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:45.430
Well, in that case, I just remove these lines.

167
00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:50.200
And remove this.

168
00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.750
And save now if I do get.

169
00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:57.270
Status now.

170
00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:01.580
OK, we have the modified status here.

171
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:05.820
Let me just make this smaller again so you can see let me clear this.

172
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:13.780
What we do now is we have to do get add again because we made those changes and we have to do get comet

173
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:17.200
fixing merge issue.

174
00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:21.530
And I forgot the let's try that again.

175
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:34.390
Conflict fixing marriage issue that's clear here and get status.

176
00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:43.060
Nothing to compare working to clean, and if I do get push, well, again, I get this error, but I

177
00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:47.770
want to show you this time around if I do get the push origin conflict.

178
00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.630
It now works, let's go back to GitHub.

179
00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:02.120
See what sort of things we have, we have the conflict branch, and if we look at the conflict branch

180
00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:07.520
now, well, there's nothing changed because, well, I just reverted all my changes.

181
00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:08.580
So it's completely empty.

182
00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:09.620
There's no changes now.

183
00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:18.370
So Marcio would be like, hey, did you mean to to make this picture?

184
00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:19.840
It's empty.

185
00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:28.330
All see this message on my part and I can keep going, and that's pretty much the workflow that you'll

186
00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:29.670
see and get.

187
00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:32.260
I'll leave the commands for you after this.

188
00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:38.370
But you see, it's very, very nice to work with you learn a few commands, and as long as you have

189
00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:43.410
this visual model of every time you're working on something, you always create a branch.

190
00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:46.670
You title it with whatever feature you're working on.

191
00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:56.310
And every once in a while you want to pull master and merge master into your branch to make sure that

192
00:15:56.550 --> 00:16:00.620
you're not missing out on any updates that other developers or teammates have done.

193
00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:08.790
Once you're done with your feature, you make a pull request by doing get push and that pull request

194
00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:13.110
your add comments and people will review your file changes.

195
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:18.300
And if they want you to make a few changes, then you can do again, get add, get commit, finally

196
00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:21.570
make your changes and then you can merge, pull request.

197
00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:26.760
And once that's done, then everybody else on the team, there's now a new master.

198
00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:29.970
So everybody else on the team should do get pull as well.

199
00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:36.240
It does takes a bit of time to get used to, but is a really, really nice workflow to make sure that

200
00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:43.620
everybody on the team works on the same file, same projects, without causing any errors and making

201
00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.990
sure that everybody collaborates well.

202
00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:49.820
And that's it, I hope you find this useful.

203
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.110
I'll see you in the next one.

204
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:51.920
Bye bye.
