1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:07,980
All right, let's get coding, we are going to hit the ground running and I mean that in the most figurative

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,630
way possible because when we code, we are not actually going to run, but.

3
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:21,530
We are going to build focus time, and so in order to do that, I've highlighted the process in three

4
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:22,460
simple steps.

5
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:28,220
What we're going to achieve in this video, we are going to create an export account.

6
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,740
Then we are going to get a snack.

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,280
And no, I don't mean potato chips, although you can go and get those.

8
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,340
And it's always nice to have a snack while coding.

9
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:44,240
But what I mean here is that we are going to create a snack, an ex-post snack, a little environment

10
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,720
in which we are all individually going to build focus time.

11
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:52,610
And then finally we're going to get into coding focus time.

12
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:58,400
Now, not all of these are going to be achieved in this one video, but we should be able to get one

13
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,960
and two out of the way to get you focused on number three.

14
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,120
So let's move over to XPO.

15
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:11,800
So over here, we're on Facebook, and the number one thing we need to do is we need to go over to the

16
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,280
menu.

17
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,890
And if I log out real quick, what we want to achieve here is that I want each and every one of you

18
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,170
to sign up.

19
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,200
And so you're going to fill in your own email address, your own username and password, and you're

20
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,090
going to enroll into the developer services.

21
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:32,590
And then once you create the account, well, then we're going to log in.

22
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:39,390
And so over here, you can see that I filled out my username and password, and once I login, I will

23
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,480
be welcome back into XPO.

24
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:50,800
And so you'll be greeted with this developer page in which you can go and you can see your home, your

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,190
builds, your snacks, you're setting all of these things that we're going to get into.

26
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,320
But the number one thing that I pointed out is that we need to get a snack.

27
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,940
And again, not potato chips, although I do recommend if we go over to snacks, what we're going to

28
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:11,430
see here is that I have my own focused IMAP, but I want each and every one of you to create your own

29
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:11,940
snack.

30
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,810
And I want you to call it focus time.

31
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:22,870
And then when you save that, well, now you have a completed stack.

32
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,560
And this sneck.

33
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:32,220
You can run, you can run it over here in this right hand pain, and the whole point of this is that

34
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:39,420
Expo's giving you this entire environment that you can run a Riak native app and call in at the same

35
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:39,790
time.

36
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,290
So if we go over here to iOS, we say tap to play.

37
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:52,900
We're going to run the app that we are currently looking at, and so it says over here, hey, change

38
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,230
the code in the editor and watch it change on the phone.

39
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:01,890
So if I change it over here to change and I'm not coding in the most clean way you can see over here,

40
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,640
it changed to change.

41
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:10,270
So this is the environment in which we are going to create focus time.

42
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:16,150
So now that you're set up, well, now we can get to coding.

43
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:24,560
We can dive deep into creating focus time, our first fully fledged mobile iOS and Android app.

44
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,750
I am excited.
