00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.230
I'm so excited we're about to embark on an adventure of a lifetime.

2
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.340
We're about to integrate Google Cloud now for a lot of you.

3
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.260
This can be scary.

4
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.570
And for some of you, this may be completely rudimentary.

5
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.720
You've done this before, but for a lot of you, this may be something that gets you excited.

6
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:18.670
It makes me excited.

7
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:26.480
So Google Cloud is one of those things where we're trying to extend our functionality by taking in data

8
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.670
that Google is giving us.

9
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:35.330
Google is giving us all of these endpoints, these resources that we can just ping and we can use them

10
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.500
to make our apps smarter.

11
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.990
Now, if you've never created a Google clone account for basically here on the screen, new customers

12
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.140
get three hundred dollars in free credits spend on Google Cloud.

13
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.320
So each and every one of you will get three hundred dollars in credits when you start an account, but

14
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.400
you still need to supply payment information.

15
00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:01.400
Now, on top of that, there is also a 200 dollar credit for the Google places and Google Maps usage.

16
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:08.390
So it would be hard for you to utilize all of that straight out of the gate.

17
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.900
But with this usage, you're basically set up properly to to try things out.

18
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.280
That doesn't mean that you're completely safe of like if you make a bad coding decision, you could

19
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.540
easily go over three hundred dollars in credits.

20
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.330
Now, that said, I'll tell you a story later on of how I did this.

21
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.130
And it's a stressful one.

22
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.930
But if you're on the screen, basically what you want to do is you want to hit get started for free

23
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.470
and when you hit, get started for free, it's basically going to ask you to sign up for the terms and

24
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.130
services and that will give you all of your information.

25
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:53.150
If you haven't set up payment yet, this is where you'll have to set up payment information and addresses

26
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.910
and so forth, and then you'll start your free trial.

27
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.100
You'll get three hundred dollars in free credits.

28
00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.720
You'll get no auto charge.

29
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.670
After the free trial ends, we ask you for your credit card to make sure you are not a robot.

30
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.900
You won't be charged unless you manually upgrade to a paid account.

31
00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:14.000
It's important to note here that what they mean by this is that you, although you won't be charged,

32
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.190
basically none of the services will work without having a billing account or credit card information

33
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.650
available.

34
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.870
That's why it's extremely important that you do link this to your account.

35
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.480
If you do not have that payment information, none of the services of Google Cloud will work beyond

36
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.440
your trial period.

37
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.360
And so you need to make sure that you have valid billing information.
