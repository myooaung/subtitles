1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:07,890
We've come so far from the blue and green screen we first started out and our next focus point is going

2
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,260
to be authentication and authorization.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,000
So the ability to login and the ability to register an account so that you can login.

4
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:22,150
And logging in is the simple process of being able to fill in an email address and fill in a password,

5
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:27,340
and if you fill in the wrong password, seeing errors, filling in the right password will then give

6
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,900
you access to the app.

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:36,520
And this entire back and forth is here because we want to have different users be able to use our app.

8
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:43,410
Of course, will have the ability to log out as well as well as some personalized info from the account

9
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,940
showing up to know who you are.

10
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,660
Now, the question remains, well, how do we go about this?

11
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,000
What are we going to use?

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,820
How are we going to build authentication?

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,820
I've never done this before.

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,750
Well, authentication is a kind of a procedure that now more and more is being offloaded onto these

15
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:00,920
external services.

16
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,560
And over here you see something called Firebase.

17
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,420
Firebase helps you build and run successful apps.

18
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:15,110
So Firebase is one of those platforms where it's backed by Google and loved by app development teams

19
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:20,630
because you can use it and have so many services out of the box for free.

20
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:26,150
It can grow with your product and grow with your solution as your app journey begins.

21
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:32,660
Now, if you look at all of the build products, you can see that they have so many different things

22
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,490
going on for them.

23
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:38,090
They have a build section, they have a release and monitor section, and they have an engaged section.

24
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:44,000
So you can literally go through the process of building your app with core infrastructure to release

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,670
and monitoring your app in production and also tracking specific analytics.

26
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:56,390
They have such a wide plethora of products that they offer that it's almost ridiculous not to go with

27
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:00,020
Firebase these days when you're starting off bootstrapping a product.

28
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:07,410
Now, if we hit the go to console button up here, what we're going to see is that it's going to ask

29
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:12,150
us to sign it now in order to use Firebase, which is completely free to begin with.

30
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,490
And in their particular Sparke plan, you need a Google account.

31
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,580
So for those of you who do not have a Google account, I recommend you create a Google account.

32
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:25,790
This is in the form of a Gmail email address, for instance.

33
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,130
So you you need to go through that process of creating an account.

34
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,950
And over here you can see that you can fill in your first name, last name and pick a username for your

35
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,960
Google account as well as a password.

36
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,340
And so once you go through that process, what you're going to see here is that when you go to the Firebase

37
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,250
Docs outside of the console, you to fire based Google dot com.

38
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:54,570
Then what you'll see here is that the go to console button will actually take you to your console for

39
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,190
your particular Google account.

40
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:05,390
Once we're here, we can start exploring because the exploration is part of the fun, you can see here

41
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:11,280
all of our firebase projects and right now what we want to do is we want to create a new firebase project.

42
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,320
So we need to give it a name and we'll call it meals to go.

43
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,970
Once we do, that will hit continue.

44
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:25,280
And we're going to turn off analytics for our project right now because we do not need it.

45
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:31,680
And we'll create the project and now Firebase is going to go through the motions of setting up everything

46
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,610
that is necessary for us and provisioning all of the resources that we require for all of its services.

47
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,750
So it offers like authentication and databases and all of this good stuff.

48
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,860
And so it just needs to make sure that it has everything hooked up properly for us, for our project.

49
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,240
And now that our project is ready, we're good to go.

50
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:57,280
Amazing, so as you can see here, we start off on the Spark plan, which means it's a zero dollar plan,

51
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,020
we don't pay anything, we don't have to supply payment information and everything that we can use is

52
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:02,980
absolutely free.

53
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:09,710
And as we can see here, authentication is one of the main pillars of them to keep and manage your users

54
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,120
as well as something called the cloud firestorm.

55
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,750
And there are many other build features.

56
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:21,850
And so they've bucketed all of the features inside of build, release, monitor analytics and engage.

57
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:28,970
And by doing that, they give us the ability to know, hey, here's what you use for this particular

58
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:29,330
pillar.

59
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:35,720
So inside of build, we're going to be focusing on authentication because that's what we need for our

60
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,290
application.

61
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,660
So if we hit authentication, what we're going to see here is that we haven't set up authentication

62
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:47,660
yet and authentication manager users from providers without any type of code server side code particularly.

63
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:54,940
So we're going to set it up as if Firebase is our server and it's going to be our intermediary for authentication.

64
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,540
So we'll get started.

65
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:02,080
Once we start getting started, we can see here that it's going to take us to the authentication settings,

66
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:10,000
specifically to the sign in method, because currently all of the optional Sinon methods are disabled,

67
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:11,800
which is not what we want.

68
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,690
So we want to enable email and password.

69
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:20,920
And once we hit enable what we're going to see here at once we save is that it will be set to enabled

70
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,050
and that means that we're good to go now.

71
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,660
Currently, we don't have any users for this project.

72
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:32,920
And we we can we can see here that there's all types of different analytics that we can see here, how

73
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:39,340
many people signed in this month and the current billing period last seven days, yesterday, today.

74
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:45,010
So we can see some type of in-depth analytics as well as we can see all of the users that have registered,

75
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:48,010
which we do not have as of yet.

76
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,880
OK, but it's set up, right?

77
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:51,810
It's set up.

78
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:52,830
Yes, it is.

79
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:59,070
And so now we have to look at what the end to end integration is going to look like for Firebase.

80
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,870
So make sure you have an account.

81
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,100
You've registered a Google account.

82
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,900
If you didn't have one, you've created a project for meals to go.

83
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,660
And once you've created that project that you've set up the authentication the same way we have.

84
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:18,330
And then we'll go into the next video where we look at how we're going to feed this back into our actual

85
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,170
application.
