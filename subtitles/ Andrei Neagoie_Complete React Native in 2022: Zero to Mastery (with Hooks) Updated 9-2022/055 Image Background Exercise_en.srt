1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:07,030
We're in real good shape now, what we need to do is, as always, we need to decide, well, how are

2
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:12,280
we going to build out the future for this navigator and with with everything we've built so far, if

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,780
we go look at our infrastructure navigators, the navigator, the navigator, the restaurant navigator,

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,010
usually they're linked to a feature in some cases.

5
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:23,680
In this case, account is linked to a feature.

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,110
And so the feature is going to be called account.

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:33,850
And in the account folder is where we are going to build out the majority of the code for the account

8
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:34,350
feature.

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:41,320
Now, inside of the account feature, we're going to define the screens folder as we've done with so

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,790
many other folders.

11
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:43,650
Right.

12
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:48,910
And also we're going to have a components folder which is going to carry our components that may be

13
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:50,950
shared across screens for this feature.

14
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:57,220
And if we go and look at what screens we need to actually build, will the screen we need to build is

15
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:03,640
the login screen that yes, this is the screen that is going to basically be the screen that will interact

16
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,200
with the user to login.

17
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,470
But we're also going to need the account screen.

18
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:16,540
The account screen is the entry screen at which the user decides whether they want to register or they

19
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,100
want to actually.

20
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:27,140
Login, OK, so knowing that, let's also preemptively create our register screen Dargis, and we're

21
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,450
going to fill these with temporary information for now.

22
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:35,270
But in any case, what we need to do inside of here is we need a couple of imports.

23
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,940
So we need our.

24
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,130
Hmm, good question.

25
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,030
What does the screen look like?

26
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,200
Let's go look at what the screen looks like so we can determine what we need.

27
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:54,230
And if I go home and I open the KPM app of Mughals to go and I quickly log out, what we're going to

28
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,810
see here is, OK, we need a backdrop.

29
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:00,890
So we're going to have a background image, we're going to have a background image, and then we're

30
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:06,020
going to have a small section where we have a login button and a create account button.

31
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,479
And we're going to have a title over here, Miles, to go.

32
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,750
And then at the end, we're going to add in this amazing animation of a watermelon.

33
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,160
Hmm.

34
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,020
Where do we start?

35
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,300
Well, let's start with the image backdrop.

36
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:20,780
OK.

37
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,060
Knowing that we need the image backdrop, well, we're going to need to import a couple of things.

38
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,460
First, let's start with CONSED account screen.

39
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:38,050
And let's let's set the scene for us to be able to actually build out what we need and let's return.

40
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,990
So the question now becomes, well, how do we do an image background?

41
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:49,200
And if we go to react native, what we're going to see is we're going to have a image background component.

42
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:55,110
And this is a common feature, requests from developers that they want to use a background image like

43
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:55,990
they would on the Web.

44
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,990
And so the image background component provides the same props as a normal image component.

45
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,900
But it works in a different way.

46
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:10,650
It works in allowing us to set up an image background for our app.

47
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:17,580
Now, what we're going to do here is we're going to set this up so that we can render out the background

48
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:25,440
image that is required for our account screen login screen and our register screen.

49
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,080
So all three screens are going to use the same image background.

50
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:33,000
Now, what I want you to do as an exercise is I want you to go here and I want you to take all of this

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,660
into account.

52
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,330
And what I want is I want scalable code to be created.

53
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:43,800
So I want us to go inside components and create something that is called maybe account styles, accountant

54
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,850
styles docs.

55
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,200
And we're going to create a styled component that is an image background and we're going to use it across

56
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,130
all three screens.

57
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:57,570
And then we're going to utilize that in order to create consistency among all three screens.

58
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,620
Now that is the exercise and in the next video, we'll look at what the solution looks like.
