1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:09,150
Last we left off, we had staged all of our changes, but we were so far from actually saving just yet,

2
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,490
we hadn't saved anything yet.

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,820
OK, so why haven't we saved anything yet?

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:23,100
Well, in order to save something over here at the top, you're going to see this little input bar and

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,410
that's going to allow you to write a message.

6
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,420
And that message is going to be a message that you're going to link to these specific changes.

7
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,310
So these 19 file changes.

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:39,570
So anything that isn't staged when we write the message, it's going to say, hey, this is what all

9
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:40,180
of these were.

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,010
So we're going to say, well, this is my initial entry.

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,290
And my initial entry is like me saying, I'm going to put these 19 files, start tracking them.

12
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,570
So I'll press this.

13
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,000
Huh?

14
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:59,570
We're getting an error, make sure you configure your username and email and get what is that all about?

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:08,190
What is this it's saying no email was given in auto detection is disabled, yadda, yadda, yadda.

16
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,940
It's asking us, please tell me who you are.

17
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:12,740
Irmo.

18
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,050
How do I tell you what's going to ask us will run this, run what?

19
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:23,750
Run, get config, dash, dash, global user dot email.

20
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:28,190
And then you're at example outcome.

21
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:28,910
What is this?

22
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:35,300
Well, this is what we would call a command and a command is something that we would run in command

23
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:35,570
line.

24
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:41,750
Now, you remember that that screen that looks like the matrix that we got when we initially installed.

25
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,660
What we're going to do is we're going to copy this very first line.

26
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,160
And we're going to go here to the start and we're going to say get bash.

27
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,720
So when we open our get bash, what we're going to have here is an interface that looks like the Matrix.

28
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:01,800
Now, if we pieced what we it looks like I can't paste in here.

29
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,030
Looks like you do not have the ability to paste.

30
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,250
So we're going to have to type this out.

31
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:08,550
So what does it say?

32
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:19,660
Get space config, space dash, dash, global space user dot email space.

33
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,150
We're going to type.

34
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,820
How do I type these seams on my keyboard is in a different setting over here, so I have to make sure

35
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,810
those in us.

36
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:35,310
All right, so we want these double quotes and we're going to say Mo Adine that.

37
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:42,760
And when we run this, it's going to set that and then we're going to do get config Ashutosh global

38
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:48,190
user name and we're going to say Mo Beeny.

39
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:49,440
All right.

40
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,280
So you want these double quotes for sure.

41
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,180
Put these double quotes.

42
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,280
These double quotes are around the text.

43
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,160
This is to identify myself.

44
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,240
So we're going to hit enter on that one as well.

45
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,170
And then we're going to close this window because we don't want to use it to too much.

46
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,160
It's too powerful.

47
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:08,920
We're going to use this interface that simplifies things and doesn't make it look like we're doing voodoo

48
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,630
magic and is understandable.

49
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,620
All right, let's close this output.

50
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,860
We don't want to see no errors.

51
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:22,110
When we go back, we have staged our changes, we had 19 files here and we had said that our message

52
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,580
was going to be initial entry.

53
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,610
OK, so let's hit commit again.

54
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:34,760
There we go, we have now committed our files to get and it is tracking them now.

55
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:35,760
What does this mean?

56
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:41,420
Well, if I go into Afghanistan now and I, for instance, go inside of app and over here, I, I do

57
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,630
something like console log, YOLO.

58
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:49,760
You only live once because, well, you really only do live once.

59
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:57,170
But anyways, that aside, that stupid little quirky thing aside, if we go here into the get, what

60
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,750
we're going to see is that no files have changed yet.

61
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,220
Well of course they have.

62
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,220
And I have to actually save the file and now that I've saved the file.

63
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,600
Well, if we go here and we hit refresh.

64
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:18,750
We hit refresh, then we'll see that Abduh changed and we can see that, oh, we added a line so we're

65
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,850
able to see what we actually changed in a file.

66
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:29,400
This is so powerful because when you're coding along and you accidentally run into a bug, how do you

67
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,390
know what you changed?

68
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,080
Well, get gives you the ability to view your changes and viewing your changes allows you to see what

69
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,020
you changed and what caused the issue.

70
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:47,380
So, so powerful and with great power finish that comes great responsibility.

71
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,560
OK, I'm calling I'm being corny anyways.

72
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:54,270
So right now, this console log is not something we want.

73
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,680
We don't want this file change.

74
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,880
So something we can do.

75
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:01,470
I showed you how to stage the change, but I can also show you how to discard the change.

76
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,410
And if we discard the change, you're going to get this big yellow box.

77
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,000
You sure you want to discard the change?

78
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,160
Doesn't have to be very, very, very, very, very careful when you discard changes because you're

79
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,230
not going to get them back.

80
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,670
I can assure you you will not get them back.

81
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,900
So make sure you want to discard what you want to discard because there's no way to undo it.

82
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:23,040
And we're going to discard this console log because we don't want this change.

83
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,020
OK, so now that we've discarded this, what is the next thing we want to do?

84
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:34,560
OK, well, the next thing we want to do is we actually want to save this somewhere.

85
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,490
So not right now.

86
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,540
We're tracking the history on our computer.

87
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:45,600
OK, so everything we've done here so far is all inside of.

88
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:52,530
The folder inside of documents focused time, so everything we've done is inside of here.

89
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,740
I can hear you asking more like what are you talking about?

90
00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:01,370
Like, OK, I understand this this whole gadget thing where we can see the changes and and Eustache

91
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,750
and you can and whatever all this magic.

92
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,370
But like, how is it doing this?

93
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:12,240
Well, if we go to view and we say, you know, hidden items, then we can see that Gett actually created

94
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,080
a gett folder, a hidden folder.

95
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,890
Now, don't mess around with this folder.

96
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,930
I would strongly advise that you hide these folders again.

97
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:24,870
But inside of that hidden folder is what Gett would call what it tracks.

98
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,250
So if you go inside of here, it's tracking a lot of different things.

99
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:35,640
Your current changes, your past changes where, what, how and all of that good stuff.

100
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,600
So get is something that's going to track the history of the changes.

101
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,120
And so it's doing it all inside of that folder.

102
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:48,300
OK, OK, so now now we have get installed and we're able to track our history.

103
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,890
We're able to we know how to commit.

104
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:53,730
Now we know that when we make a change, we can fill in a nice message here.

105
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:58,740
We can say like if we add the console, log back into into here.

106
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:03,090
If we go back into Appalachia's and we said, hey, I want to add that console log again.

107
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:12,730
You know, YOLO, then we could go inside of the version control if we saved this file and be refreshed

108
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:20,020
here, we could add a nice Kimmett message saying I added a console log and if we chose to commit that,

109
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,970
that is now in our history.

110
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:29,890
And so we'll know when it was changed, why it was changed, what message came with, what it changed.

111
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,170
Super, super powerful stuff.

112
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:37,390
And so what we want to do now is we want to host somewhere and where we want to host that is get hub

113
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,100
dot com.

114
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,700
And if we go to get hub dotcom, this is where the world built software.

115
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,360
You may have heard of it.

116
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,070
You may have seen it.

117
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,910
We're going to use it.

118
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,420
We're going to use it to store our code.
