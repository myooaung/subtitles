1
00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.510
Oh, yeah, it's time to create our first React project now.

2
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.150
I have excellent news for you.

3
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.890
You see, up until now, we've created everything from scratch ourselves.

4
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:19.640
But you see React is one of the most popular tools out there for a web developer.

5
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.650
So what does that mean?

6
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.950
That means that there's an entire community of developers of really, really smart people that want

7
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:34.160
to make react, a really good experience, a really good way for you to get started super fast and build

8
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.860
projects, beautiful projects right away.

9
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.170
Let's see how a normal developer would start a React project.

10
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:50.240
Now we can do what we've been doing up until now, which is to npm install react right.

11
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.970
We create a project folder, we install the React package and we are able to start using it.

12
00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.410
But there's something even better than that.

13
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.380
And it's called Create React app.

14
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.379
It's actually on their documentation page for React.

15
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.200
It's a comfortable environment for learning, react and is the best way to start building a new single

16
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.520
page application.

17
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.580
It's the recommended way to start with react.

18
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.860
And we're going to see over the next couple of videos why this is such an awesome tool.

19
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.560
As a matter of fact, it has its own dedicated page, set up a modern web app by running one command.

20
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.180
Sounds pretty nice.

21
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:36.810
It essentially allows us to install a whole bunch of packages instead of doing npm install a thousand

22
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.070
times instead of sending up our developer environment, setting up our first page.

23
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:48.030
It does everything for you, and this is created by really, really smart developers that have worked

24
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.540
on React that are on the core React team so that this way, you know you're using the best tools, the

25
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.320
latest tools and using the best practices when creating a React app.

26
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:05.100
And this gets updated constantly, so you know that you're using the best of the best.

27
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.940
Now, if we go to the documentation, we see that we simply use this command and create React app and

28
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.170
then the name of your app.

29
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.820
So let's copy that.

30
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:25.040
And let me just explain the command for you now before you might be wondering, what does NPC's NPCs?

31
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.590
We've never seen that before.

32
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:34.780
I mean, back in the day, what we would do is, say 21:00 Install Dash G, Create, React app, install,

33
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.350
create, React app globally so we can run the Create React app command from our command line.

34
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.890
But doing an npm install DSG is a little messy.

35
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.080
And also, you have that thing where you have to run sudo if you don't have enough access.

36
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.680
Well.

37
00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:00.610
Since 21:00, 5.2 NPCs actually comes out of the box for you.

38
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:09.970
So, for example, let me just clear this if I do 9pm Dash V, your version should be higher than this.

39
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.670
And if your version is higher than five point two, which trust me, if you're watching this video now

40
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.850
five point two is an old version, you definitely don't have it.

41
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.150
Otherwise, you can always upgrade, so NPCs actually comes out of the box already.

42
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.060
So again, if we copy this oop.

43
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.120
Can use NTPC's, create React app and my app.

44
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.310
Actually, let me cancel that, let's name our project because we want to have a proper project, name

45
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.810
robo friends and I'm going to create the React app.

46
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.240
Now, while this is loading, you can see it's installing React, React, React scripts.

47
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:53.860
We're going to talk about that later.

48
00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.370
For now, you just need to know that NTPC's is a package runner.

49
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.110
I'm going to leave a resource for you in this video that you can read more about NPCs.

50
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:13.330
Essentially, what it does is it allows us to run this command of ampm installing globally to create

51
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.839
React app without actually having to install something globally.

52
00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.050
While we wait for this to download, let's just find out what Ampex is and what is it?

53
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.200
You know, as developers, we're really good at Googling, right?

54
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:30.250
Oh, there you go.

55
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.570
There's an excellent article.

56
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.780
You have been the no package measure.

57
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.310
The package runner.

58
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:43.300
So it's a Seelye tool whose purpose is to make it easy to install and manage dependencies hosted in

59
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.620
the npm registry.

60
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.590
So it's now very easy to run any sort of nodes based executable that you would normally install.

61
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.700
Vietnam BPM executable means a package that you can execute.

62
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.930
What does that mean?

63
00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.550
Well, it's this thing we can execute, create reactor.

64
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.930
Back in the day, we would have done npm installed DSG create React app.

65
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:12.180
Well, we can execute this create React app command that we would have been able to execute from here

66
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:18.160
after doing this now, just by using NPCs, just a simplified way of doing things.

67
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:24.070
So once that's installed, I then go into my folder and then run npm start.

68
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.420
Sounds pretty easy, right?

69
00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.280
Let's go back to a terminal.

70
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.910
You see that everything has installed here.

71
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:39.460
We have ampm start, ampm run build, ampm test, ampm run, eject that we can use as commands.

72
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.980
Well, we can just run and start, right?

73
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.070
So let's go CD.

74
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.140
Wrobel friends, because we want to go into our new project folder.

75
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.900
If I do else here, check that out.

76
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:55.300
We already have all these things out of the box created for us by Create React app.

77
00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:01.270
We have a no modules folder rimi package that JSON some public and source files folders.

78
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.370
Again, something we'll go over later on.

79
00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.160
For now, let's just do ampm start.

80
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.590
Let's see what happens.

81
00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.540
Hey, look at that.

82
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.670
Congratulations, you have your very first React app out of the box.

83
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.960
You didn't really do much.

84
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.220
You just installed Create React app, but there's your first app.

85
00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:22.480
Pretty neat, right?

86
00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:23.800
You now have to set up anything.

87
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.890
Create React app takes care of it for you.

88
00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:33.480
So again, if we go to the career, we act up documentation, you can read more about it here.

89
00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:40.110
But the idea is that the best of the best are creating these tools for reactive helpers so that out

90
00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:45.930
of the box you're going to have limiting tank testing already set up again, things that we'll cover

91
00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:46.410
later on.

92
00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:52.050
In the course, you'll see why create React app is useful more and more as we progress the course.

93
00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.780
So don't worry, so we have our app.

94
00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:55.950
What do we do now?

95
00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.460
Well, we open up our editor and we start.

96
00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:05.800
Evolving this simple react, tap into what we want into robo friends.

97
00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.350
So let's start doing that in the next video.
