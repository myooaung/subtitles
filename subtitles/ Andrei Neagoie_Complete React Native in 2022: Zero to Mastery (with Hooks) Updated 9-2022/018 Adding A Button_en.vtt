00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:07.720
So the next step for us is we have our focus subject here as part of our focus component, right?

2
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.100
This is telling us, Hey, this is what I specifically want to focus on.

3
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.340
Now that's just for this part of the screen.

4
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:23.610
But our app doesn't know anything about, you know, what we're keeping track of or if we actually have

5
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.350
a current subject.

6
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:34.240
OK, so before we go too far, basically over here, we know when we change text because we've set the

7
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.150
subject right, we're setting the subject as we type.

8
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:44.350
But we need something to trigger us to kind of instantiate a timer of sorts, right?

9
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.780
Because what we're trying to do here is kind of create the Pomodoro style timer.

10
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:57.550
Now, what we've done is we've gone ahead and in the resources of this video, you'll find a link to

11
00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.150
a rounded button component that we're providing for you.

12
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.060
Now all you have to do is go over here.

13
00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:06.010
Copy this code, right?

14
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.600
Once you copy it, you'll go back.

15
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.370
You go over to your source folder and you'll create a folder called components.

16
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.190
And in that folder, we're going to create a component called rounded button dot jazz.

17
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.340
And all you need to do here is paste this code.

18
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.820
Now we'll run through it, but all you need to do is paste this code.

19
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:31.210
And basically what it's doing is we're providing you a nice looking button out of the box so that you

20
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.430
can just go ahead and utilize it.

21
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.810
But let's run through it real quick.

22
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.400
We're using something called touchable opacity from react.

23
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:46.710
Native and touchable opacity is a react native component that allows you to touch something.

24
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.580
It creates a touchable interaction.

25
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.220
Then we're using a text component to render some type of text, and we're using a style sheet to render

26
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.800
some styles.

27
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.830
And of course, we're using our colors map.

28
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.420
We create a component called the grounded button, and we give you the ability externally to add files

29
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.750
to it.

30
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.830
We also give you the ability externally to add custom text styles to it, and we give it a default size

31
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.350
for you in case you don't want to give it a size.

32
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.800
Right.

33
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.840
So our rounded button by default will be 125 density pixels large.

34
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.460
Then we create a touchable opacity and we give it the size.

35
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.170
We give it the style, and we kind of add the potential for an on press event.

36
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.880
We render some text inside of it, and that's about it.

37
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.990
And over here, you can find some styles.

38
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.350
Now, if we look at this in terms of usage, basically inside of our focus feature, what we want to

39
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:47.100
do is we want to import our rounded button from dot dot slash components, rounded button.

40
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.490
And that's going to give us the ability to implement our rounded button over here.

41
00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:03.120
And what we want to give to it is, you know, a custom title because we want some text inside of here.

42
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.860
And so let's go ahead and do that, and over here you can see, hey, it's rendered a very, very,

43
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.820
very large, default sized, 125 sized.

44
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.090
Element or button that is clickable.

45
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.720
Right?

46
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:24.370
It's clickable, touchable opacity, so like you can see when I touch it, the opacity fades.

47
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.160
That's what touchable opacity does.

48
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.620
OK, so I have my around the button.

49
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.670
I want it to be kind of smaller, so I'll give it size 50, right?

50
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:40.050
And there now it's size 50 still has a good, clickable ratio, but I really don't want it over here

51
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.290
like I want it over here beside the text box.

52
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.640
How do I go about that?

53
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.480
Well, we can take our input container and we can say, Hey, give it flex direction of type row.

54
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.700
This will enable it to render in a row visualization.

55
00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.920
OK, well, then let's remove the flex off of it because we don't want the road to take up like the

56
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.590
whole screen, and then we'll say that our text input needs custom styles.

57
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.840
So let's say style is equal to styles, not text input.

58
00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.519
And then let's go ahead and create our text input styles, say, you know, flex.

59
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:22.730
Zero point eight.

60
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.990
Let's give it a flex of 0.8.

61
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:32.310
And now you can see that's the supplying wonderfully and then we'll say padding to the right.

62
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.120
Should be kind of 10, let's say, 10.

63
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:39.290
Huh.

64
00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.750
That's not really applying now, is it right?

65
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:42.470
Having right?

66
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.510
Well, what if we say margin, right?

67
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.200
There we go.

68
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:55.210
Now that's kind of pushing it aside here and then for our button component over here.

69
00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.270
Well, it's kind of sticking to the right.

70
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.250
Let's say that we have button.

71
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.330
And let's kind of go through the motions of putting that in the right position, so we say around the

72
00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.530
button style is equal to styles dot button.

73
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.890
Right.

74
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.140
And over here, we can see that.

75
00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.680
We made a little typo, so let's do that.

76
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.320
And what we can see here is just the Free Content Center.

77
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.950
OK.

78
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.180
What if we do end?

79
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.980
Huh.

80
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.270
So that's applying itself to the inside of the button.

81
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.860
That's not really what we want.

82
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.370
So let's go ahead and wrap a view.

83
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.890
Around our button.

84
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.890
So let's say a few, let's say, styles stop button, and let's wrap that with a view again.

85
00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:56.750
And then let's see what we get.

86
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:03.320
So if we do this and we justify conference center, we can see now that the button is centered along

87
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.080
the way of this.

88
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.700
Now let's go ahead and give this Flex one and take up as much space as possible.

89
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:17.600
And what we can see now is that, you know, our focus and put item is nicely positioned now.

90
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:23.210
Our input container is adding a lot of padding, and that's kind of bleeding out here, making it look

91
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.840
not as nice.

92
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.550
So let's change up to 25.

93
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:27.020
And there we go.

94
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.550
Now our focus input container looks very nice.

95
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.820
It's within the realm of the screen.

96
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.060
The input is not taking up too much space and the button is right beside it.

97
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.890
And that's about how we want our screen to look now.

98
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.360
Right.

99
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.260
We have our touchable opacity over.

100
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.650
Here are button, but we haven't hooked that up just yet.

101
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.070
And over here we can add our emojis.

102
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.070
I just click some random ones, and that's about it for this one, we've hooked up around the button

103
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:03.410
in terms of like just on the screen, we've rejigged some stuff around.

104
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.630
And next up is how do we keep track of our focus subjects?

105
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:10.070
So let's take a look at that.
