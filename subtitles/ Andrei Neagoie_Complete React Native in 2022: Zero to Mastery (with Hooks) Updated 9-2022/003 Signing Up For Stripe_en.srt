1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:06,700
You may have asked yourself through this entire prelude of architecture and all this other stuff, what

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,980
his stripe, what is it?

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:09,850
What does it do?

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,830
Well, it's payment infrastructure for the Internet.

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:20,760
Now, their main offering is to allow users and clients to scale their payment infrastructure.

6
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:27,070
So outsourcing the payment gateway directly to Stripe.

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,320
And they charge fees for this, of course.

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:36,790
But the whole point of scaling to external services is to take out of your hands the management and

9
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,960
all of the things that come with building your own.

10
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:44,650
And so they have partnerships with Amazon, Slack, Zoom, Lyft, Google, Salesforce, insert the card,

11
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:45,310
Shopify.

12
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:50,730
And if Stripe is good enough for all of these juggernauts, it's good enough for you.

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:58,030
And the reason for that is it helps you scale without having to think about all of these security concerns

14
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:58,930
that go into payments.

15
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:06,910
Payments are so painful, so, so painful because they come with so many regulations and costs and all

16
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,170
of these things that you need to do.

17
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:14,290
And companies left and right have been outsourcing this to companies that have done this for years and

18
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:14,620
years.

19
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:19,030
And Stripe is just one of those companies that has taken the Internet by storm.

20
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:25,360
And they've come with so many features, including the ability to link back to your customers, to your

21
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,090
products, generate reports and all of this good stuff.

22
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,710
They have so many features.

23
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:35,470
It's the one of the world's most powerful APIs when it comes to payments and will be looking at a straight

24
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,880
shot integration into credit card payments.

25
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:47,050
Now, in order to do this, what we need to do is register ourselves for the stripe integration.

26
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:52,290
And if you go over to dashboard and you look here is going to ask you to sign into your account.

27
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:56,830
Now, if you do not have an account for Stripe, I want you to sign up for one meaning.

28
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:02,590
You have to fill in your own email, your own name, your own country, your own password, and then

29
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,460
create an account.

30
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:08,889
And once you've created an account, we can log in and I already have an account.

31
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:13,770
So over here I'm going to go over to sign in and I'm going to login.

32
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,920
Now, once you log in, what you're going to do is you're going to be redirected and that redirection

33
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:25,310
is going to take you to your actual dashboard, your actual stripe dashboard.

34
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:31,060
Now, when you come over here, it's going to give you this overview of getting started with Stripe.

35
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,260
Now, you don't need any credit card information to set up straight.

36
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:40,720
It'll come out of the box in a sandbox mode, in a test mode, and it'll ask you to activate your account

37
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,900
to be able to create a live.

38
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:51,650
Integration and so you can see here I have processed eight hundred and seventy two dollars in payments

39
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,250
in my test environment.

40
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:59,280
Now you will have access to your Test API because this is a publishable API key.

41
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:04,160
And then over here you can see the secret key, which they hide and they hide this for a very specific

42
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:04,430
reason.

43
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,420
This is very, very sensitive information.

44
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,400
This is not a key that you just want out floating into the wild.

45
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:17,120
When you bootstrap servers and you set up those providers, you will give this key to that server in

46
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,180
order to be able to process payments on your behalf.

47
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:23,180
The publishable key is what is used by the clients.

48
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:30,710
So are react native app or a Web application or any other type of application to link itself to the

49
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,230
payment provider.

50
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:32,960
Right.

51
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,830
There are certain things we need to do on the client side and there are certain things we need to do

52
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:43,130
on the server side and both interplay together to be able to process a payment.

53
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:49,550
And eventually what we'll be able to see in the end is that will be processing successful as well as

54
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:55,950
failed payments with specific payment tokens, specific users for specific amounts.

55
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,710
That's what we're aiming for.

56
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:05,150
And now that you have Stripe's set up, we can move over and we can look at the rest of the integration

57
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:05,890
that needs to happen.

58
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:12,260
Just keep in mind that these two keys over here are going to be extremely important in the following

59
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:12,800
videos.
