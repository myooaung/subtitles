00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.170
Now, you may be asking yourself, Mo.

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.210
Now that I've developed this app.

3
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.790
Well, I basically need to be in development mode in order to show it to anyone.

4
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.100
I can't really run it outside of my house.

5
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.350
I need to be on my computer at all times.

6
00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:16.890
It's really quite bothersome.

7
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.960
How do I go about this?

8
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:25.390
And so that's a great question, because one of the things that happens here is that you may be in the

9
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.990
process of making an app, but you don't want to publish it to the store yet.

10
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.150
So it's publicly available.

11
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.630
But you do want to show your friends and family potentially what's going on.

12
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.450
In order to do that, let's go over to the terminal here.

13
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.590
And one of the commands that we need to know is something called XPO Publishing.

14
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.700
If we go to the Expo Help section and we scroll up here, it kind of becomes unreadable.

15
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.890
But over here we can see publish deployer project to Expo hosting.

16
00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.710
So this will allow us to deploy a project directly to Expo.

17
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.769
And if we run Expo publish, if we're not logged, then obviously it'll ask us to log in.

18
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.780
But you should do expo log into your account.

19
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.360
And what Expo publishers are going to do is it's going to publish a built version of your application,

20
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.090
all the assets to your account.

21
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.380
And so if we go in here and we sign into our account, which for me is Bobigny, and if I grab my expo

22
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.450
password and paste it in here and we sign in, what I'll be able to see.

23
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.470
Is I'll be able to see a meals to go up over here with STK 30.

24
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.140
I have to because I've been testing out, but this is the one that we've recently published.

25
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.990
And if we go over to the Expo website, what we'll see over here is a project, and this project is

26
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.230
the Meals to Go project.

27
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.200
It's a project that we have been working on.

28
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.850
And over here, it clearly states that I am the owner.

29
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.810
Currently, there are no builds because we have run no builds.

30
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.930
We've just published our project for our own consumption.

31
00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:04.390
And over here we can see the expo, you, Earl, and what that will show us is going to be our project

32
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.960
page.

33
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.330
And currently it's not publicly visible, but you could make the project publicly visible to everyone.

34
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:18.400
Now, one thing to note here is that these published projects, they will not open on iOS unless you

35
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.550
are logged into the account that is the owner of this project.

36
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.620
So if you want to share this project with multiple iOS users, it will not work.

37
00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.460
Android users, I believe, should be able to open this QR code just fine.

38
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.370
But just note that there is a limitation here for the published project to only be accessible to your

39
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.850
account.

40
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.410
And if we open that up, what we're going to see is our application loading perfectly fine with all

41
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.120
of the things that we put in place.

42
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.830
And we can log out.

43
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.570
We can see our animation pop up here and it's absolutely amazing.
