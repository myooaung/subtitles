00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.600
Hopefully that worked out for each and every one of you, but we're here to go through it together.

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.520
So over here you can see for padding, we have to replace it with props.

3
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.270
And then what happens here is we're actually saying, hey, for the padding, get the properties of

4
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.590
the component, the props.

5
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:16.940
Right.

6
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.210
Every component comes with props normally.

7
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.620
So we're taking those props and every styled component, every styled component.

8
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:31.200
We haven't looked at this in detail, but every style component basically gets the theme object on their

9
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.740
props.

10
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.210
Just like in restaurant screen.

11
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.530
You could get props from the outside styled view, gets the theme automatically injected into itself.

12
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.990
So if we look at padding, we're saying, hey, for the padding on the props of this styled component

13
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:51.240
that we're composing, that we're putting together on the props, take the theme, take the space,

14
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.010
take the third element.

15
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.920
I hear you thinking third element.

16
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.820
What do you mean?

17
00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.790
Well, this is an array, so if we look at it strictly from an index perspective, if we look at the

18
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.890
indexes, this is the zero index.

19
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.260
This is the first index.

20
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.820
This is the second index and this is the third index.

21
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.850
So we're trying to reference this element right over here now, a mistake that is often made with phrases

22
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.340
that people think that they're not zero index based, so that you would think that this is number one

23
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.790
and this is number two and this is number three, and that this would be number four.

24
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.960
But it's actually does not work that way.

25
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.870
This is the zero index.

26
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.090
This is the first, the second and the third.

27
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.530
And so we're referencing index three because of that.

28
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.840
And right here, you can see that this is 16 pixels.

29
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:49.180
And this is referencing big primary, and if we go look at our colors, we can see here that big primary

30
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.320
is white, so very useful stuff, very useful.

31
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.400
And the same is true for restaurant screen.

32
00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.540
Now it's very easy to see what three would do versus four or five if we take the search container.

33
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.760
And we said here, we'll use four.

34
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.260
You can see it's moving.

35
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.550
And if we said use five, well, now there's a lot of padding around it.

36
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.170
And if we go and inspect that.

37
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.260
Wow, that's quite a bit of padding, isn't it?

38
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:22.140
And if we put this back to three, you can see, well, now this is way smaller padding all around.

39
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.720
So that is the one we need.

40
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.230
That is the exact padding that we require around our component.

41
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.360
Absolutely amazing.

42
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:41.460
So with that, we now know how to use the theme and how to reference things on the theme in order to

43
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.580
achieve consistency through the theming.

44
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.350
And now we're in a spot where he we have a whole hour color setup, we have all our speccing set up,

45
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.290
we have our fonts ready to roll.

46
00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.410
Well, actually, the fonts still need a little bit of love, but we'll get there now.

47
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.450
Right now, we're in a good spot.

48
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.490
We have our spacing, our colors and all of that good stuff with that said.

49
00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.570
Now, we should look at the fonts and what's going on with specifically the fonts, because we're styled

50
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.020
component masters and that is absolutely amazing.
