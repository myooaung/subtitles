00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:07.120
In this video, we're going to show you how to set up your payment information to upgrade from your

2
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:13.010
Sparke plan just in case you do not have any payment information set up on Google.

3
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.950
Now, if we press the upgrade button here, we can see the pay as you go plan.

4
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.650
And if we say select plan, it's going to tell us, hey, you want to go to the pay as you go plan,

5
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.810
you will now be charged based on your usage.

6
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.570
And if we say continue, it's going to take us to the Google cloud console.

7
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.840
Now, this Google cloud console is specifically for Firebase, and it's going to tell us a bunch of

8
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.080
things that we have to agree to agree to add a billing account over here.

9
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.820
You can see it's asking me to create a new billing account and it's going to give it a name.

10
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.610
It's going to give it a country and a currency.

11
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:58.720
So select your country here that you live when you press continue, it is then going to ask you to set

12
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.430
up information about your personal or business.

13
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:08.770
So if you're an individual, set up an individual and say some street, you do have to fill in real

14
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:09.520
information here.

15
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.610
So fill in where you live.

16
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.320
The only reason I'm not filling in where I live is because I don't want the entire Internet to know.

17
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:22.900
Now, over here, you're going to see that this individual lives at some street, in some city and potentially

18
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.620
Ontario.

19
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.820
And let's say that he lives that m three to a four to Pete Topos.

20
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.860
And the phone number is optional, it'll ask you about automatic payments, you'll have to fill in your

21
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:45.030
credit card information here and then once you submit an enabled billing, you will be able to upgrade

22
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.930
your firebase instance to a paid plan.

23
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:55.860
Now, make sure that the information you fill in here is accurate as otherwise the billing may be rejected.

24
00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.760
And now that you've done that, you should be able to see your firebase set up in a way where if you

25
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:10.410
go to the meals to go up and you try to upgrade your plan to pay as you go, it will automatically upgrade

26
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.960
your project and you should be good to go.

27
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.800
Now you can set a budget alert if you wish to, for instance, know at a certain amount where you stand.

28
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:29.940
Great, so knowing that we now know that we'll be able to set up our firebase function and deploy it

29
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.510
with a paid account.

30
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.870
Now, if you're unable to put in a paid account here, don't worry, you'll still be able to run your

31
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.240
firebase function locally.

32
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.660
You will not be able to integrate with Google Cloud, however.
