1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:09,240
So in the end, this is what we should be able to see when we put in place our image background now

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,950
on the previous video, you will have found the resource in the resources on the video in order to get

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:14,940
this particular image.

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:21,180
But you can load any image you want, honestly, take whatever you want and use that as long as you

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,800
find that your app looks amazing.

6
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,900
Now, if we took a look at the code.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,119
What happened in our recount navigator is that we set up an extra screen, so we set up an extra screen

8
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:35,810
that basically was the register screen because initially we didn't have this.

9
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,220
So we had a stacked on screen for Mean, which is the main account screen.

10
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:44,870
We had a stacked on screen for login, which showed us the login and we had one for register which showed

11
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:50,930
us the register and we imported these all from the feature authentication screens.

12
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:58,460
OK, so like I said, in authentication screens, we set up an authentication, not styles, but yes,

13
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:04,800
now in that styles that yes, we can set up something called an account background.

14
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:06,490
Now, you may have done this in a different way.

15
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:10,580
This is what I personally find the most optimal way to set it up.

16
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:14,870
But as long as you've got it working well, as long as you've got it working, that's what's most important.

17
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:15,920
And great job on that.

18
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,090
By the way, this is not easy to achieve in the particular way that I did it over here.

19
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:27,080
Now, with that said, what we want to achieve here is and if we look at the code we import styled from

20
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:32,990
styled components, Netiv, and then we set up a component called account background style dot image

21
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:38,360
background is the react native element that we wanted to target.

22
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,180
And so we wanted to give its particular attributes.

23
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,620
And we've done this in the past.

24
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:48,530
And when we target attributes, we can basically set props on the image background hardcoded.

25
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:53,510
So the prop that I want to set on the image background hardcoded is something called source, and the

26
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,960
source points to the image that it's going to load as the background.

27
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,830
And I set it to require dot, dot, dot, dot, slash and so forth to the assets folder, the home background

28
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,690
component, that jpeg.

29
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,700
And then I set it to flex one.

30
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,030
I gave it a background color, which is not really necessary.

31
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,540
You could honestly leave this out and it would still work perfectly.

32
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,300
I was testing some things out when I did that.

33
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:23,330
When we do a line items, however, we're trying to make sure that anything that comes inside of it

34
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:29,270
is particularly Fleck's aligned because we want to center the information.

35
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:33,470
OK, so this is the initial way that we can do it.

36
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,230
And then if we look at account screen, basically account screen just became an import overcount background

37
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,490
where we just render it out.

38
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:46,690
And then the login screen became the exact same thing where we did the exact same thing and the register

39
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,610
screen does the exact same thing as well.

40
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:52,970
So all of these will render this as a background and it's that simple.

41
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,860
And now look at how beautiful this looks.

42
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:59,750
This this honestly looks like a real application, like a real meals to go up.

43
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,030
We could compete with Obreht easily.

44
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,400
Easily, I tell you.

45
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:09,650
OK, so now that we have this in place, what I want to do next is I want to fortify our account screen

46
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,120
and start building it out a bit more.

47
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,560
So let's go ahead and do that.
