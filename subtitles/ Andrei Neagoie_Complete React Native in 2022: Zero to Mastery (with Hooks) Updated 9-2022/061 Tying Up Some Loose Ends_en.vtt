There's a couple of loose ends I'd like to tie up.

2
00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:08.430
First off, we initially didn't have a title, so I went ahead and I created the title component on

3
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.480
top of which we also didn't have really a way to go back here.

4
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.840
Now you can swipe from the side, but on Android, that doesn't really feel natural either.

5
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.100
So we also introduced this non-native back button just in case with which you can go back.

6
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.510
Now, you may ask yourself, how do we do this?

7
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.800
Well, over here in account styles, we, first of all, created this title component with a font size

8
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.700
of 30 pixels, on top of which in the account screen we took that title component and just put it right

9
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.610
behind the authentication cover, right underneath the account cover.

10
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.070
And the same is true for the login screen.

11
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.220
And then at the bottom of the logging screen, we introduced the spacer with an off button that also

12
00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.500
had a contained mode, which took an empress of navigation Dudko back, which comes from the navigation

13
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.230
prop that we get because it's in the logging space.

14
00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.690
But the other thing we did is to tighten up some loose ends as we introduced this nice feature where

15
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.410
if we get an error, it's actually being displayed in the center rather than outward.

16
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.710
And so if we do this and we, for instance, and more we audio and we filled in the wrong password,

17
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.850
obviously we're going to get the error, but it's going to fill the space and not push out.

18
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.950
And the way that we achieve that is in the account styles.

19
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.410
We introduced this air container and the air container has a max width of three hundred, just like

20
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.830
the off input, just like everything else.

21
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:47.100
It has a line item center, a line self center margin, top of space to margin, bottom of space two,

22
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.440
and that will constrain everything for the error.

23
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:57.660
And so now that we've clean that up for the majority, one other thing we want to now achieve is, well,

24
00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.550
not OK, we can log in.

25
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.270
What's basically going on in here?

26
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.970
You can see in our press log in way too many times now that we're able to log in.

27
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.920
What about registration?

28
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.330
And so let's take a look at that.
