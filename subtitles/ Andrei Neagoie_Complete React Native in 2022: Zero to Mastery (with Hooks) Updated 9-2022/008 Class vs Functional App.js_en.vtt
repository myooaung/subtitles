00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.200
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:07.320
I know I know we want to get coding one last set up before we start building our first component.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.660
I want you to change this function app and do something that I'll explain as we go through the course.

4
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.050
You see, this is called a functional component.

5
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:27.970
I want to change this into a class in the way we do this is, we say class app extends.

6
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.670
React dot component.

7
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.860
We're going to remove.

8
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.660
This since it's not a component.

9
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.460
And then we're going to return this in a render method.

10
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.850
So this what you see here.

11
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.960
You make sure I had.

12
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.690
The proper brackets.

13
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.350
Like this, I'm going to save this.

14
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:10.580
I get react is not defined because I have to import react.

15
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.490
From React.

16
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.320
And why did I get that, because I'm using React Dot component here.

17
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.430
So if I save that?

18
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.790
I get OK app is defined, but never use.

19
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.510
That's because of the index.

20
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.250
Dot js file.

21
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.820
Let's just for now use app again.

22
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.240
Everything is good, so I've created a class component, let's just make sure this works before I explain

23
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.660
it to you.

24
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.830
Look at that.

25
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:50.630
Everything works as expected, so I didn't change anything, but I did convert this into a class.

26
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:58.360
Now, I want us to start off like this, because back in the day when Create React app got started.

27
00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.950
This is how the default app dodges file was like.

28
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.930
And as you'll see, we'll have to convert this into a class to create what we call a class component

29
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.240
versus a functional component.

30
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:20.280
Again, don't worry about the naming, but essentially what I'm doing is I'm using the React package

31
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.490
that we installed using Dart component.

32
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.960
This extends or gives us the power that comes inside of the React package.

33
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:38.400
So I make an app and I say, Hey, I want the power of React component that I've installed in this React

34
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.300
component automatically detects this render method.

35
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.090
Usually, you want to add a render method because automatically part of the functionality is that it's

36
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.640
going to run the render and return.

37
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.670
Something returns some sort of view.

38
00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.930
In here, so if you're wondering how all this magic is happening, it's all in the React dot component.

39
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.190
Again, something we'll going to dive deeper and deeper into.

40
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.910
But as a starting point, I want us to start off with the class extends React component, and then from

41
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.480
there we're going to dive deeper and deeper now.

42
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.910
The final thing is that when we go into the next lesson, you might see some things different.

43
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:29.510
You might not see this react US trick mode create React app is constantly updating, so they add new

44
00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.000
nice features that doesn't really affect us immediately, but just makes things simpler.

45
00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.030
So react off strict mode just gives us extra protection that again, we don't need to worry about.

46
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.340
So you won't see that in the next video and you won't see things like report web vitals.

47
00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.110
In the next video, you might see something like Register Service Worker, which used to be part of

48
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.050
Cory React app, but once again, we're going to ignore that we're going to focus on what I said the

49
00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.600
source folder and building out our components.

50
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.030
So let's get started.
