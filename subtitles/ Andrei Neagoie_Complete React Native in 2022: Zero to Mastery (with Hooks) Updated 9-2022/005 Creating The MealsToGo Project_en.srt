00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:08,810
In the last video we left off doing XPO in it, Miles, to go, an expert in meals to go was going through

2
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,990
the command line interface of XPO and showing us.

3
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:21,350
How to set up a project and we're able to use our arrow keys to choose a specific version.

4
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:27,010
Now, the default, the blank, the empty canvas is what we want.

5
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:34,300
And we want to do it in the managed workflow, because in XPO you have a managed and Abair workflow.

6
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:39,460
Now, a managed workflow is where explosive is going to do a lot of stuff for you and manage your project.

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,670
A better workflow is where you're going to go bare bones.

8
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,290
Just get the essentials.

9
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:52,030
Now we want the managed approach because it gives us a lot more of exposed tooling and expertise and

10
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,790
backing to build quickly.

11
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:59,920
So what we're going to do here is we're going to choose blank and that's going to set up, download

12
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,160
and install all of the dependencies for meals to go.

13
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,650
And you can see in my projects folder now meals to go exists and it's setting it up for us.

14
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:16,150
So once it's done, installing all of the dependencies and going through the process of getting everything

15
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:21,940
ready, we'll be ready to hit the ground running for our master project.

16
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,290
Amazing.

17
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,770
It's that easy.

18
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:25,960
All right.

19
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:27,460
I'll see you in the next video.
