1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,110
All right, all right.

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:07,950
I had to make this quick video to talk about the elephant in the room, if you know anything about the

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:08,790
React world.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,600
Well, this discussion has to happen.

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,700
Classes versus hooks.

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,210
Now, as you learn in the course, there's many ways to build react components.

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,310
And one of the newer ways to write these components is using hooks.

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:33,050
Now, the way we've structured the course is the way that we actually recommend you learn how to write

9
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,130
proper applications.

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,720
The thing is, hooks are fairly new and they're exciting.

11
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:43,130
So a lot of people talk about them, but they're also very specific to react.

12
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:49,580
What you learn about hooks, you can't really apply to anywhere else and the programming world because

13
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,670
they're so react specific versus classes.

14
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,950
Well, that's part of JavaScript.

15
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,820
Learning classes is an important concept not only in JavaScript, but a lot of other programming languages.

16
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,670
Also because hooks are fairly new.

17
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:10,910
A lot of code bases in React still use classes because there's nothing wrong with classes.

18
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:16,400
So the way we've structured the course is that we're going to teach you react starting with classes.

19
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,080
So you know how those works so that you can apply that knowledge to any of your future projects or if

20
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,340
you land on a project at a job that still uses classes.

21
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:30,560
And then we're going to convert the app using hooks so you get to learn both ways.

22
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:37,670
And we also started with classes because there's been a little bit of move lately in the industry where

23
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:41,900
people are shying away from hooks because of the added complexity.

24
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,550
It adds to react.

25
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,710
Now this is a hot topic of discussion.

26
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,380
It doesn't really matter whichever one you prefer.

27
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,760
Our goal is to teach you both, and then you can decide for yourself what is best.

28
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:59,840
The way we structured the course is what we think is the best way to learn react that is starting with

29
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,800
classes as they were intended and then learning hooks afterwards to show what problems hooks solves

30
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,750
that maybe we had with classes.

31
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,160
So hang in there.

32
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,390
We're going to cover both of these.

33
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,680
I'll see you in the next one.
