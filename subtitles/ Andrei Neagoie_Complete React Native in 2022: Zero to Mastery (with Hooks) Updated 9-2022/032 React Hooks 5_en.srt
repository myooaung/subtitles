1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,640
All right, all right, all right, hopefully you were able to do that a little bit of a challenge.

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,530
If not, no worries.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:11,790
I'll show you how we can convert things into using hooks in this video.

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:18,030
But again, hopefully you got a chance to check out the using the state hook and using the effect hook

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,950
in the react documentation.

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,890
Because it's not as hard as it seems.

7
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:33,350
Remember what I said, Hook is a special function that lets you hook into react features so that you

8
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:40,480
use state and they use a fact hook, allow us to hook into a react feature because it's from the react

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,980
library to.

10
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,850
Either work with state or with life-cycle methods.

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:55,620
So the first thing I want to do is to actually remove this component from here, because we're no longer

12
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:04,220
using that component class to extend app, instead, we want to change this into a function.

13
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:04,610
Right.

14
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:13,640
So I can now say function app and we remove this and turn this into a function.

15
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:23,110
Next is we no longer need this constructor super and this state because we're now creating a function

16
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,340
we can, let's say, comit the self for now just so we can see it.

17
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:35,790
We are also going to comment component did mount because inside of a function, there's no such thing

18
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:36,850
as component did mount.

19
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:44,820
Remember, we got Component Dedman because we were able to use the component class in here that gave

20
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,630
us this feature, this life-cycle hook.

21
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,980
So now we can't use this either.

22
00:01:51,870 --> 00:02:00,390
And then because this is a function, what we need to do is turn this into a variable so the answers

23
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:07,680
change and the render is no longer needed, instead will have.

24
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:09,940
This piece of code.

25
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:14,150
That just simply returns out of the function.

26
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,990
So if I say this, I'll probably get a few errors.

27
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:27,950
All right, so I have you state is defined by never used use effect as defined by never used on search

28
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,170
is assigned but never used.

29
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:35,720
And that's because on search now is just a variable inside of this function.

30
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,520
And you see that we're using that this keyword here.

31
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,470
Remember what I said?

32
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,240
Because we're no longer in a class.

33
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,880
We don't need that this key word anymore.

34
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,470
So if I say this, we have one lesser.

35
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,170
Now, if I go back to our app.

36
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:58,660
Oh, we have some errors, can I read properly, state of undefined.

37
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:06,190
And that's because, again, we're using the this state here and we've commented about the constructor

38
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,240
that gave us state, right.

39
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:15,040
So this not set state that came from our component class no longer exists.

40
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:25,160
This that state no longer exists either, again, because it's no longer a class, so how do we create

41
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,630
state?

42
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:31,910
Now remember, Hooke's give us now the power to have state inside of our apps, and we do that using

43
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,410
the use state hook.

44
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,900
Let's find out how to do that in the next video.
