00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:06,600
It's time for an exercise, and this one is going to be a fun one, because what we're going to do is

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,770
we're going to go look at the styles that we've already written throughout the app and we're going to

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,540
clean things up like I promised.

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,130
We're going to do this as if it were a real, real project.

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,410
And for that, we need to make sure that at any given point when we write things, we write them in

6
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,160
a consistent way.

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,310
So right here we can see we have padding sticks and right here we have padding 20.

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:32,970
And if we go look at spacing, well, we don't really have 20 in here, which means we're going to have

9
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:33,810
to make a decision.

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,100
Does it become 16?

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,070
Does it become 32?

12
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,370
Usually I am a fan of rounding down to the closest value.

13
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,500
So I would personally make, for instance, the 20, a 16.

14
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,180
And that would make way more sense because then the padding is consistent all around.

15
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,050
So what I want you to do is the same thing that I did over here.

16
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,900
I want you to go through all of the properties.

17
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:05,980
And I want you to replace the properties that can be replaced with their proper theme equivalent, and

18
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,320
then in the next video we'll see what that looks like.
