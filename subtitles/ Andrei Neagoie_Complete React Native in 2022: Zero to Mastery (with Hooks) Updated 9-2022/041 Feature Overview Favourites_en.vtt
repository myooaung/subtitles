00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.150
Next up on the chopping block.

2
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:09.790
The favorites feature, so as you can see here in the app, we have the ability to favorite certain

3
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:16.450
restaurants so that we can keep track of the ones that we would like to visit or have visited or in

4
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.060
general, just like now.

5
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.830
This feature is amazing for different reasons.

6
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.880
First of all, we can save across multiple cities the restaurant information.

7
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:33.030
And on top of that, we're going to persist that beyond the app closing and opening.

8
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.000
And in order for us to get there, obviously there's going to be some type of mechanism that we have

9
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.750
to put in place.

10
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:50.260
But as an initial entry, what we want to be able to do is store favorites and be able to view them

11
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.260
in the restaurant tab.

12
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.150
Now, let's show you how to do this.
