00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:07.890
Hey, everyone, so to start off our journey, what we are going to do is we're going to dive deeper

2
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.670
into the Expo utility.

3
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.010
It's a software, it's a framework.

4
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.930
It is what makes react need of development simple.

5
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.540
You see, as Andre said, there are two paths you can take.

6
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:33.050
Expo is a framework that enables you to get started in the most simple way possible.

7
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.590
They have a step by step guide.

8
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.700
They have a community.

9
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.220
They have all of the tooling to get you set up in minutes.

10
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.970
Now they have this guaranteed six step process, you know, fall in love.

11
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.940
Download dogies, get the command line.

12
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:58.060
All of these steps to get you coding in React Native and we're going to follow along this trajectory

13
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:04.569
step by step to get you set up and falling in love with Riak native, because that's what we're trying

14
00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:05.200
to do here.

15
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:13.750
Mobile development for the longest time has been a daunting industry and react native has, so to speak,

16
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:14.680
bridge that gap.

17
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:22.810
But with anything that's trying to target both iOS and Android, there's still a lot that needs to be

18
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:23.170
learned.

19
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.970
And Expo simplifies that process.

20
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:35.290
Now, what we're going to do is we're going to follow along and get you set up in a way that gets you

21
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.220
building.

22
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.480
Building high performing universal apps without any set up just yet, and then we're going to go through

23
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.060
setting you up step by step so that you can do development locally on your own machine.

24
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.470
But EXPL has a zero set up environment.

25
00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.510
And the whole purpose of Expo is to simplify the Riak native development process, because with anything,

26
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:09.509
with anything at all, when you're targeting, developing in a multiplatform way, there are complexities

27
00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.410
that come into play.

28
00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.710
And those complexities are something that you cannot escape over time as you build out more and more

29
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.960
complex applications.

30
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:25.770
But what Expo gives us is the ability to bridge that gap gives us a lot of documentation, development

31
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.060
tools, forums accustomed with their members as well.

32
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:37.620
So they have a whole community around Expo to which you can reach out and you can build out applications

33
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.560
and specifically it enables you to fall in love.

34
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.040
Riak native with the lowest barrier to entry.

35
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.950
And so with that, let's dive in.
