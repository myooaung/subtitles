Implementing the search bar, one of those things where documentation comes in handy because they already

2
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.950
have a usage section where they show us, hey, this is how you get the search bar.

3
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.960
This is how you put the search bar on the screen.

4
00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.160
And we had to use a very simplified version of that because I didn't specify that we needed any interaction

5
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.290
or anything of that sort.

6
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.190
So the very basic implementation of this is the following.

7
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.710
We're going to import search bar from Riak native paper.

8
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:40.130
And over here we're going to put search bar between our view where we had styles, dot search.

9
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.350
OK, so what styles that search that's putting the padding around here.

10
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:54.280
And it's allowing the space for the search bar to breathe, so very basic and very simple, but we have

11
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.250
a beautiful search bar that already has a ton of nice features.

12
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.740
You see the backdrop here, the shadow, the little icon.

13
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.850
Amazing.

14
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.490
So simple and so awesome.

15
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:15.160
So with that now, we can go and we can look at how we're going to implement the list view.
