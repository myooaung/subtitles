00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.700
Oh, boy, am I giddy, we're about to pay.

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:12.000
We're about to pay with a credit card and process the payment on stripe, that is the whole point of

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.570
this part of the.

4
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:20.700
And so the way that we're going to achieve this is we're going to implement the Stripe SDK software

5
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.020
development kit in our firebase functions.

6
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.150
That's how we're going to do this.

7
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.570
And so the payment gateway that we're talking about here, right?

8
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.650
We have our checkout, we have our payment button, but our payment button right now isn't connected

9
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:35.160
to anything.

10
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.350
Just console lock.

11
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.320
We want to change that console, log into a console charge.

12
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.470
OK, bad joke, bad dad joke.

13
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.040
But you know what I mean, right?

14
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:52.140
We want to pay and we want to be able to see our payments on the payments screen.

15
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.610
We want to see this happen.

16
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.680
We want we want all of this good stuff.

17
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.190
Right.

18
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:05.250
And so right now, what we're seeing is that some of the payments that I've done in the other app.

19
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:05.940
Right.

20
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.680
The production app have trickled through.

21
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.920
And so what we're going to look at now is how exactly we're going to get this payment for all of stripey.

22
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:24.660
Now, if we go to the no gess implementation of Stripe on October 24th, 2013, they officially launched

23
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.440
what was, I believe, the official stripe node J.

24
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.530
S package.

25
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.660
OK, so obviously it's been updated since then and improved.

26
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.080
But during that time period, right, 2013 to now, that's eight years, a lot of improvements must

27
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.530
have happened.

28
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:51.030
So this package is the package that we're going to use to talk on our behalf to Stripe.

29
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.950
So you know what to do.

30
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.850
We over the meals to go, we see into our functions folder and we do yarn add stripe.

31
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:07.710
And by doing this inside of the functions folder, what we're achieving here is the ability to bootstrap

32
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.540
just like straight client in the front end, a stripe client in the back end.

33
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.490
Now they're different.

34
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.600
They're different because on the front end, it's a limited subset of the stripe SDK that's available

35
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.890
to us.

36
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.980
But on the back end, in our firebase functions, we have a whole world open to us.

37
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.400
We can do anything.

38
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.100
It's kind of like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

39
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.460
It's up to your imagination.

40
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:38.710
So with that said, what we need to do now is create that stripe client.

41
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.370
So over here we have our Google client, obviously.

42
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.230
And what we want to do now is const Strib client.

43
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.710
Is equal to the require of stripe.

44
00:02:51.510 --> 00:03:00.030
But what we're going to do with this is we're going to say functions, config, dot stripe, dot key,

45
00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.290
and that is what we're going to use.

46
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:10.800
Now, if you're unaware of how to add a configuration key or you don't remember how to do this, please

47
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.070
refer back to the Google videos in order to get this running locally.

48
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.880
If you've lost the ability or you forget which functions we ran and so forth.

49
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:27.120
But the key that you're going to want to set on the striped key, if we go over here and we go into

50
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.790
developers and then we go into Epic's, where you're going to want to do is you're going to want to

51
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.500
take the secret key.

52
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:41.760
This is the key that you're going to want to copy paste into your stripe, that key.

53
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:50.040
And so once you've done that, then you want to, of course, take those secrets and put them locally.

54
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.880
And again, we showed that in the Google Firebase Config series when we were doing our Google implementation.

55
00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.550
So just refer back to those videos if you're having a hard time remembering.

56
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:07.650
And so just as a quick reminder, once you've set up your firebase key, you can do firebase functions,

57
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.250
config get and you can do this little sign over here.

58
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.670
Right.

59
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.030
The greater then sign.

60
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:22.230
And so if you if you run this whole line, rather I'll show it on one line, if you run firebase functions

61
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.540
config get greater then and then to runtime that config.

62
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.860
This is going to take all of the config that is in your firebase functions and put them in a local file

63
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.870
and that way you can run it locally.

64
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:41.280
So now what we need to do is quickly restart our firebase functions and now we have a stripe client

65
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.100
that is bootstrapped.

66
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:49.350
Now, the other thing that I want to do is I quickly want to rename all of these clients to Google client

67
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.150
because we want to create a clear separation here between the Google client and the client that we're

68
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.720
passing it.

69
00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:00.920
And then what we want to do is we want to export a new function and we want to call it pay.

70
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.840
And then when we export pay, we're going to do something called a pay request and we're going to use

71
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.950
the stripe client.

72
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:13.790
Now, pay request is going to come from, well, you guessed it, pay.

73
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.820
So that's pay.

74
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.960
And so over here in our firebase functions, we're going to create a new folder and we're going to call

75
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.760
that pay and then pay.

76
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:30.390
We're going to put an index box and we're going to export CONSED pay request.

77
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:38.340
Rather, no, we don't want to use that type of syntax, we're going to do module that exports.

78
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.270
So we're going to do a module that exports.

79
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:49.610
And module that exports that pay request and then what we're going to do and you can see here, I get

80
00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.210
tripped up between the different types of syntax I need to use between different libraries.

81
00:05:53.240 --> 00:06:00.500
It happens all of these different types of infrastructure can expect different types of syntax.

82
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.730
So over here, we're using the modules, in fact.

83
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:09.640
So what we're getting is request response and then we're getting the strapline right.

84
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.930
And so with that now, we can go ahead and we can do a rest.

85
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:15.830
But send.

86
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.920
This is my payment.

87
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.360
And with that comes the ability for us to.

88
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:33.770
Be able to, well, response thoughts and first of all, with that comes the ability for us to talk

89
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:34.630
to our response.

90
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:42.330
Now, if we look over here, if we go to meals to go pay, we'll see.

91
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:43.880
This is my payment gateway.
