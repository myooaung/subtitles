1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:09,180
In the previous video, we successfully installed and set up prettier and excellent, but now now comes

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,660
a time where we actually need to use it because hey Mo, what is it doing?

3
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:18,870
Well, not very much by the looks of it, because we don't really see anything happening.

4
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:24,520
So the way we're going to set this up is we're going to go inside our package, Jason, and what we're

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:30,960
going to do over here is we're going to run or create a new script.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,480
We're going to call it Lintz, and we're going to say that Lente is excellent.

7
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,260
And we're going to put DOT so that it's going to check everything and we're going to do that.

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:52,200
He dodges and this in itself is calling the Esslin package and saying, hey, check my whole directory,

9
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,450
but only for the jazz files.

10
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:01,080
And if we go ahead and we go to our terminal and we say, hey, run that command.

11
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:08,060
And the command is a yarn lint, so if we run that well, we're going to see is whoa, it's telling

12
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:08,780
us a bunch of stuff.

13
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,350
We have 11 problems, one error and 10 warnings.

14
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,480
And so here we get into kind of an odd space.

15
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,170
Let me explain.

16
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:28,010
We have prettier, which is a code formatter and we have excellent which is a linta, so the thing is

17
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:32,270
looking at the code and saying, hey, this is the code format I want you to follow and Prettier is

18
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:35,150
looking at the code and saying, hey, this is the consistency.

19
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,690
I want your code to be formatted.

20
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,430
But both can have overlapping rules.

21
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,630
So over here at the bottom, you see this is giving me a hard core error.

22
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:50,200
It's saying replace Bable Preset XPO with single quotes to double quotes.

23
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:56,090
So if I go to the Bible config and I say, hey, put this into double quotes, OK, well, we're going

24
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:00,200
to see the error go away from prettier, but we're going to see this.

25
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:04,730
Yes, Slint is going to be warning us, Esslin, to saying String's must be single quote.

26
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,919
So there is a conflict between what Prettier wants to see and what it wants to see.

27
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:13,670
And so to alleviate that, what we're going to do is we're going to add a rule and we're going to add

28
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,320
our own rule.

29
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,470
It's an override.

30
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,420
It's going to say rules.

31
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,050
And then we're opening the object and then we're going to say quotes.

32
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:27,890
We're going to say two, and then we're going to say double instead of single and we're going to avoid

33
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:28,490
the escape.

34
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:34,460
With this rule now, what we can do is we can run Yarmolenko again.

35
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:39,320
And now we only have five problems, what problems do we have?

36
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,610
Well, platform is defined, but it's not being used.

37
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,390
So this one is defined but not used.

38
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,820
And we have an inline style.

39
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,690
Fleck's one.

40
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,530
Right, Fleck's one.

41
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,580
We have padding in background color over here.

42
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,740
And we have padding, background, color.

43
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:10,320
Over here, so we did these inline styles, right, and then we have this one down here that we never

44
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,040
assign the style.

45
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,530
So what we can do is we can move these styles into the styles.

46
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,130
So that's what it's preferring us to do.

47
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:24,570
So if we take this and we said that this was empty for now and we went down here and we said container.

48
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,110
And we put these in here.

49
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,300
And then we went up here and we said, styles dot container.

50
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:43,540
Now we're getting into a good spot, right, so we're moving our inline styles into what we would call

51
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,580
the stylesheet.

52
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:51,580
And this has benefits, as we explained, in terms of memorization and all that good stuff, so we're

53
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,020
going to call this search.

54
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,410
And we're going to put the styles in there and then we're going to have list and we're going to put

55
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,330
the styles in there.

56
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:09,340
So let's take that and let's say styles start search and then we're going to create a list and we're

57
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,280
going to put that in there.

58
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,440
So let's do that.

59
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,550
And now we're good.

60
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,820
So we'll put styles that list great.

61
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,060
OK, so now if we were on the list, what happens if we run yarn lint?

62
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,500
What's going to happen?

63
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:37,960
Well, we have a bunch of other errors, Prettier is complaining, and Iceland is complaining that we

64
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,840
can't have trailing spaces, so let's run.

65
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,550
It would fix bakdash fix.

66
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:48,810
And so it's going to go through our code and try to format it for us and fix it, and now all of the

67
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,320
errors are gone, no more errors, right?

68
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:57,960
So if we run lenth again, again, no more errors, we fix them all just with running the Esslin Fix

69
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,410
Command.

70
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:05,620
OK, so now that we understand what Iceland is doing for us, it's looking at our code, it's figuring

71
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:11,880
out how the code style needs to work, and it's looking at how to apply these rules consistently.

72
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,640
We can now throughout our entire project write consistent code.

73
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,380
And I would say, hey, run this command that early and often as possible.

74
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,990
But we're also going to look at how to integrate it into this code.

75
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,330
So let's do that next video.
