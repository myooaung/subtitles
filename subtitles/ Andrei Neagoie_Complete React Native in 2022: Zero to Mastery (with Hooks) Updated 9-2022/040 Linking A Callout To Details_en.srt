1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:07,130
The last thing we need to do is make the call outs clickable, because right now, when we click them,

2
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,730
nothing really happens in order to do that.

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:20,960
The Matthew Call-out has a on press function and this on press function has the ability to do a function

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,200
call.

5
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:28,550
Now, as you remember, any screen that is given to a navigator, if we are looking at our navigators

6
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:35,480
inside of infrastructure, any view that's given to a component here has the navigation prop.

7
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:41,140
So because we know that we have the navigation prop, let's quickly go and get it navigation.

8
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:49,250
And what we can do here is we can say, well, on press, do navigation, dot navigate and where do

9
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:56,360
we want to navigate to where we want to navigate to restaurant detail and we want to make sure that

10
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,290
we give it the restaurant as a value.

11
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:01,400
So restaurant.

12
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,980
And we'll give it the value of, well, we have restaurant here so we can give it value restaurant of

13
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:13,810
restaurant or you can shorthand this and just say restaurant past the restaurant alone.

14
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:21,070
OK, so now that we done this, if we press, we're going back to the restaurant screen and we're showing

15
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,760
Tommy's joints info.

16
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,240
That's amazing.

17
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,380
It was that simple.

18
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,170
And if we go here and we press enter the via.

19
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,810
Well, instantly, we're going to the restaurant detail screen, absolutely amazing, it was that simple

20
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,620
because we set up our navigation and our infrastructure in such a simple and rigorous way.

21
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,880
We now have an easy way to link everything together.

22
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,910
A couple of lines of code, exactly three.

23
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:56,440
And we have a fully fledged integration between the map screen and the restaurant detail screen.

24
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,960
It was that easy.

25
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,030
Absolutely amazing.
