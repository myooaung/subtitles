00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.670
Now that we understand the steps that we need to go through, the first thing we need to look at is,

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.760
well, how are we going to build a standalone app?

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.290
Because currently our app is mainly running inside of this expo interface.

4
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.320
So getting it outside of that expo interface is something that we need to focus on.

5
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.700
Now, the purpose of this guide inside of Expo is to help us understand how to create the standalone

6
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.770
binaries binaries.

7
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:26.790
What is a binary?

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.790
Well, a binary is an output.

9
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.140
So think of it like a little box.

10
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.270
And in that box, we're going to put everything we need for iOS and everything we need for Android in

11
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.150
order to run our app as an app itself on the phone instead of running it inside of Expo.

12
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.390
Right.

13
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.410
We want it to show up here on this screen as a standalone app.

14
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.030
So we're going to be building what we call binaries of our iOS and Android app that eventually can be

15
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.180
submitted to the App Store and the play store.

16
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.460
Now, something that you need to understand here is that in order to do this, Apple has something called

17
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.350
an Apple developer account, which you need in order to build iOS standalone apps.

18
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.780
But the Google Play developer account is not needed to build the Android standalone app.

19
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.750
So we're looking at different sets of requirements here.

20
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.000
Apple has a way more strict environment when it comes to deploying applications.

21
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.670
They require you to pay for a developer account.

22
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.700
They require you to have an iOS device, Android.

23
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.310
However, it can run on Linux, Mac, Windows.

24
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.770
It doesn't really matter and you don't really need the developer account in order to build your Android

25
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.950
app.

26
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.090
They just let you do it out of the box.

27
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.360
Now, if you'd like to submit either app to the App Store, you do need that developer account.

28
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.950
So the difference here is iOS.

29
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.170
You need the developer account to build it locally and even submit it.

30
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.030
Google, you don't need the Google Play developer account to build it locally, but you do need it to

31
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.960
submit to the store.

32
00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.510
So it's a good idea to read the best practices of deploying to the app stores to ensure that our app

33
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.290
is in good shape.

34
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.290
But the difference here is that these now that we've reached the point at which we're going to deploy,

35
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.630
we're coming into contact with the differences of the different environments.

36
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.990
Right.

37
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.990
We're coming into contact with how Apple works versus how Google works.

38
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.110
And so when we look at these differences, this is when a lot of the meta work starts meta, meaning

39
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.210
that we have to do a lot of due diligence and make sure that we're building for the right platform,

40
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.710
that we have the right things set in place, that we have the right accounts set up and all of that

41
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:35.190
good stuff.

42
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.110
And that's, again, one of the reasons that we want you to just follow along, because getting an Apple

43
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.160
developer account, first of all, costs ninety nine dollars a year.

44
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.930
So when we go through the process of looking at how to build these standalone apps, the first thing

45
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.910
we need is to install the CLI.

46
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.330
Well, good thing we install that when we started off our journey.

47
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.220
So we have the Xbox CLI.

48
00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.740
Now, if you haven't created an actual account, you should create one when running the build command

49
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:08.460
because what that's going to do is it's going to link that build to your account inside of your project

50
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.820
here.

51
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:09.240
Right.

52
00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.010
So you'll have a project meals to go into the link, the build to your project.

53
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.430
Once we go through and build it, Windows users must additionally have WSO installed.

54
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.920
Now this is Windows subsystem Linux.

55
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:29.130
So it's an additional step that you need to go through on Windows in order to go through the management

56
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.770
procedure of being able to build.

57
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.020
That's why we suggest follow along and understand the build procedure.

58
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.260
What I want to do, what I want to focus on is building a standalone app for every platform separately.

59
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.920
So every one of these platforms, Android and iOS, is going to have specific built steps.

60
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.810
So let's go through looking at how to build for Android and then look at how to build for iOS.
