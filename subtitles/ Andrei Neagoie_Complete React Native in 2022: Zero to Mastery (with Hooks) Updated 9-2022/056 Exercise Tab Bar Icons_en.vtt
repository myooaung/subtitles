00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.140
Now comes the fun part.

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:10.170
Now we're going to add icons to our tabs, we're going to put icons in each and every one of these sections,

3
00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:16.570
and that's going to allow us to identify specifically, visually what is going on in each of these tabs,

4
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.170
because I can go ahead and read what's going on here.

5
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.900
But if I have a visual indicator, I'll never miss.

6
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:30.760
OK, so the way to go about this is, first of all, we can go to react navigation for the tabs and

7
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.330
we can go look at how to customize the appearance, customizing the stock navigator.

8
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.850
There are some options that we can go through.

9
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:44.980
And so down here, what you'll find is a way to set up the tab bar icon with a focus color, a size

10
00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.240
based on the root name.

11
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.730
And then you can choose, hey, this is what it's supposed to look like.

12
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.210
And then you'll return the icon with the icon name, the size and the color.

13
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.950
And so you can say we're going to use the exact same colors, but you can also choose a color for the

14
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:03.860
Tabbaa option.

15
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:11.290
So given that we have this code example here, what I want you to do is I want you to go and I want

16
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:18.070
you to figure out how to use the root name to deliver a specific icon.

17
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.850
To the tab navigation based on this example, and I want you to go look at.

18
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.080
Expo vector icons, we're not going to use this one.

19
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.190
This one is incorrect.

20
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.410
What we want to do is we want to import iron icons from Expo Vector icons.

21
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.810
Instead of doing this, I'm going to show you one thing that we need to optimize here.

22
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.190
What we're going to do is we're going to import this icon icons, but we're not going to import it from

23
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.510
here.

24
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:56.030
We're going to import from at Expo Vector icons, and that's going to allow us to get the same exact

25
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.660
package.

26
00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.630
But we're going to get it from Expo because this is shipped with our installation.

27
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.670
And there's one more thing I need to note here.

28
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.880
So these icons, where can I know which ones I can get?

29
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.050
Well, that's a good question.

30
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:17.080
So what we're going to do is we're going to type at Expo Vector icons and we're going to leave this.

31
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.790
And so if we go look here at the documentation section that you can jump to Expo Vector icons, we'll

32
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.280
link this in the resources as well.

33
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.160
And what you can see here is this library is installed by default on the project.

34
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.490
OK, OK, good.

35
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.360
And then we can go to the Expo Vector Icon directory, and so here we can see which icons are available.

36
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.490
And so if we, for instance, copy paste one of these icons, we can quickly see, hey, which icon

37
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:44.000
is this?

38
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:51.380
And so we can go and we can look for things like beer, drinks, food, and we can quickly decide which

39
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.160
icons we want.

40
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.260
So I want you to take every time we have and find an icon that suits it for you.

41
00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.700
And then I'll show you in the next video my solution and the icons that I chose.

42
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.030
And also a way to optimize this logic, because this logic is very static inside of here.

43
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.820
But let's use this example to get a solution going.
