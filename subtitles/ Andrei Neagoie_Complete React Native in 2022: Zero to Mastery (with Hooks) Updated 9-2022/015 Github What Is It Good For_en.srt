1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:08,980
Now that we've mastered what git is on our local system, be it Mac, be it Windows.

2
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:17,180
Whatever the case, what we want to do is we want to store our code somewhere.

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,900
Now, you may be saying I'm storing it on my computer and that's all good and well.

4
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,810
But if your computer fails, what happens?

5
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,280
Well, what happens is you lose your coat.

6
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:33,050
And so what GitHub is, is this little space man.

7
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:33,880
No, it's not.

8
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:43,060
Literally, GitHub is a place where 56 million developers, three million organizations and 100 million

9
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,680
git repositories live.

10
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,020
Now, what does that mean?

11
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:57,220
Well, it is the place where you code, you collaborate, you develop, you automate, you secure and

12
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,380
you have a community of developers.

13
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,910
Now, for those of you who have never used it before.

14
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,520
I don't blame you.

15
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,970
It's it's something that developers are very inundated with.

16
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,450
And if you're not in the developer sphere, just they're just getting started.

17
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:11,860
All of this may be very new.

18
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,330
Now, that said, GitHub is the place we want to be.

19
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,970
And once you get into this community, once you get into what they call open source.

20
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,660
That's where all the magic happens.

21
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:32,700
Now, don't trust me, trust the 70 million developers that are on here or whatever the number was.

22
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,660
But that being said, well, we need to do is we need to take our code and we need to publicize it.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,120
We need not public.

24
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:40,980
You can make it public.

25
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:41,670
You can make it private.

26
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,810
You can make it whatever you want.

27
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:48,750
But we want to store it somewhere for backup purposes, but also for sharing purposes, but also for

28
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,460
a nice place to go.

29
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,140
Look at your code purpose.

30
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:57,390
So if you're on the go and you want to go look at a piece of code or whatnot, you know, somewhere

31
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,560
to store it online.

32
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:04,830
OK, so what I want you to do here is I want you to sign up for GitHub if my sales pitch wasn't enough.

33
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,699
Well, I don't know, but I need you to sign up for it.

34
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:14,730
So go ahead and create an account for GitHub, go through the process of verifying your account.

35
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:20,610
And once you're all good and logged in, choose a username, fill in your own email address, fill in

36
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:21,930
your own password.

37
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,860
And once all of that is done, create your account, write.

38
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:34,990
Let's say I made some random account, right, and I did like test password.

39
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,580
We could go through the process right now.

40
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:43,500
There seems to be an issue here, but I guess if I refresh, it may be OK.

41
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,360
There seems to be a small bug over here.

42
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,870
Try a different browser, for instance.

43
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,070
We could try Internet Explorer.

44
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,600
So let's go to that Internet Explorer.

45
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:02,080
Who would have known I would ever go to Internet Explorer to try things out, but you may see this happen.

46
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:03,660
Don't get scared.

47
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,140
If you do, things can go wrong with the sign up process.

48
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:15,280
And so once you've signed up for get what I need you to do is I need you to sign in to your account.

49
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,080
So that's what I'll do over here.

50
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:22,250
And so you can see here that I need a two factor authentication key.

51
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,270
And this is because I have two factor enabled.

52
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:32,600
And if I verify that now I'm logged in to my GitHub.

53
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,460
And so once we're here, we're good to go.

54
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,490
You just want to be logged in to GitHub.
