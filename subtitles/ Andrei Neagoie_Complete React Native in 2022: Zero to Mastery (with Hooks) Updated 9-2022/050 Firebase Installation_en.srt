1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:05,710
Now that we're looking at the end to end integration of Firebase into our code base, I can hear you

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:06,810
screaming from the rooftops.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,140
No, we need a service and yes, yes, we do.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,300
But first, we need to do a little bit more research about how we're going to integrate it into the

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:16,620
app.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:24,220
And so if we go over here to the documentation, they even have a guide on using Firebase and they say

7
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:29,080
things like Firebase gives you the functionality, like analytics databases, messaging, crash reporting

8
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:35,820
and authentication and Google's infrastructure skills automatically even for the largest apps.

9
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:44,680
So if we look at the firebase integration with the client, they recommend using the Firebase JS SDK,

10
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:50,110
which supports authentication, the firestorm, the database, the storage functions, et cetera, et

11
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,030
cetera, on react native.

12
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:59,320
Other modules like analytics aren't supported, but we can easily extend that by using something like

13
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,970
XPO Firebase Analytics.

14
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:07,690
OK, so XPO has gone through the motions of trying to cover every possible service that Firebase can

15
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:08,160
give us.

16
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:17,530
And so with that we can go and say, hey, well, if we need to do this, how do we go about installing

17
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:17,860
it then?

18
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:23,410
Because, you know, we know throughout the past of the course that usually there's an expo command

19
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:28,750
coupled to this and try and true, they have an expo install firebase.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,810
So let's go through the motion of running that and then we'll continue reading.

21
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:39,040
If we go over to our terminal here and we open our second terminal and we run XPO, install Firebase

22
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,550
while this is installing, we'll continue reading.

23
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:47,410
So the firebase console provides us with API keys and identifiers we need for project initialization.

24
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,290
Oh, interesting.

25
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,430
OK, so we're going to need a specific configuration here.

26
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:56,950
Oh we're seeing, we're seeing a use case here.

27
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:03,430
So we're an import star as Firebase from Firebase and then we're going to put together a configuration

28
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,440
here with all of these different.

29
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:06,210
Huh.

30
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:06,900
What are these.

31
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,400
Oh, an API key and off domain.

32
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,039
A database.

33
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,470
You URL.

34
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,410
Great stuff.

35
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:11,880
Great stuff.

36
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:17,290
So Firebase is going to supply us with all of this information ahead of time and then we're going to

37
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:24,070
use that to initialize our app so that it can be linked back to our meals to go application that we

38
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,730
set up here.

39
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,960
So Firebase, somewhere in Firebase, we're going to be able to find this information here.

40
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,180
OK, well, that's that's good.

41
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:31,720
That's good.

42
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,760
Now, let's look at how that would work.

43
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,040
Is Firebase installed yet?

44
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:41,020
Not quite yet, but we'll go ahead and trek ahead a little bit.

45
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,960
So we know here that we're going to have to import start as Firebase from Firebase.

46
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:52,270
And so we want to inject Firebase at the right position in our application.

47
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:57,220
And so that would be the entry point, which is abcess there.

48
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:04,450
We're going to import Firebase from Firebase and we're going to also take into account the firebase

49
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,860
config that we need here.

50
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:10,120
We're going to declare that just before the render function.

51
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:17,690
Just before the declaration, rather, and we're also going to copy this last line, the Initialise

52
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:25,880
app, based on the firebase config, and by doing this, we now have an initialise app or do we know

53
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,650
this isn't the right information?

54
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,240
You forgot that we need to get it from our actual app.

55
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:31,960
And that's true.

56
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,840
So let's go over here to meals to go now.

57
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,690
Where would we find all of this information?

58
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,770
I don't I don't see it anywhere.

59
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,680
And so what we need to do is we need to go back to a project overview.

60
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:52,190
And if we hit this little icon and we go to project settings, we're going to end up on the settings

61
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:52,610
panel.

62
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:57,720
And so once we're on the settings panel, we can see that we have all of these different settings that

63
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:03,570
we can touch, but the one we need to focus on the most is if we scroll down right here, we have all

64
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:08,760
of this information, project ID, project number, all of this good stuff, but we haven't configured

65
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,770
any apps yet.

66
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,770
And so the app we want to configure is the third one in this.

67
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,310
So you can see iOS Android.

68
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:20,370
But because we're running Riak native, we want to use what is called the Firebase Web SDK and the FIREBASE

69
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:26,970
Web SDK is nothing more than just a JavaScript software development kit that will work on Riak native

70
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,100
like we read on the expert documentation.

71
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,770
So we're going to call it meals to go react native and we're going to register the app.

72
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,450
And once we register the app, it's going to give us all of this beautiful information in order to set

73
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,530
up the SDK.

74
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:47,620
So we're going to copy this bread and butter right here and we're going to paste it right in our firebase

75
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,090
config.

76
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:58,360
And by doing this, we now have all the information we require for the firebase package to link itself

77
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,270
to our FIREBASE app.

78
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:07,510
So Initialise app is going to take this config and now Firebase is going to be able to talk to the app

79
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:14,140
that we set up here originally if we go back to the console and and now when whenever we authenticate,

80
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,390
it's going to say, hey, do you have a user now?

81
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:22,630
We don't have any users yet for this project and we haven't said anything up other than the linking

82
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:26,380
of our Riak native app to our FIREBASE app.

83
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,060
But they're not really talking just yet.

84
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,560
They just know of each other now.

85
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:38,410
So now we want to make our app talk to Firebase and be able to get a response from Firebase.

86
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,750
Let's look at how we're going to achieve that.
