00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:08.440
So here's a question, what does navigation look like on React Native, what is a good navigation system?

2
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:15.140
Because so far what we've been looking at is basically just building our own very, very simple version

3
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.239
of navigation.

4
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:23.690
And so throughout the years, navigation in Riak native has basically taken a big turn where it used

5
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.450
to be a couple of big packages that were taking the industry by storm.

6
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:35.390
I believe there was a package called Riak Native Navigation, and this was by Wick's.

7
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.890
And it is a native navigation solution and it is still maintained today.

8
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.740
It was a bit different.

9
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.790
It took a fully native approach and there were other navigations that were taking a non-native approach.

10
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.470
So you have to think about it this way, right.

11
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.760
We're in fact, native.

12
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:59.300
And so the question became, do we do a full native solution or do we do a hybrid solution?

13
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.480
So what I mean by that is when we look at the phone, right.

14
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.810
Well, we're writing all of our code and JavaScript, but the phone is running iOS or Android.

15
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.690
So the question becomes, do you do navigation?

16
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.320
Where do you program your navigation?

17
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.040
Navigation is something inherently custom to the platform.

18
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.740
The navigation you do on iOS versus something on Android is completely different.

19
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.410
You could have on iOS SWIP actions where on Android you would have a bottom bar here that would have

20
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.810
interactions, write the buttons at the bottom.

21
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:39.890
And so the question became, OK, do we write our navigation code for the library in Android?

22
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:48.020
And iOS is specific language, which is Objective C or Swift and Java or Cocklin, and then expose an

23
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.660
interface to JavaScript that can write and interact with this navigation.

24
00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:01.460
So basically making the navigation portion completely native, or do we do a full JavaScript approach?

25
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.630
And so the Riak native industry went back and forth, back and forth, back and forth on this for a

26
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.440
couple of years.

27
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.050
And right now where we've landed is.

28
00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:17.090
Riak navigation is kind of the one stop solution, the best solution for navigation react native, it's

29
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.000
easy to use because you can start quickly by building Navigator's with an out-of-the-box experience.

30
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.040
It has components built for iOS and Android, specifically with a custom look and feel and smooth animations

31
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.760
and transitions.

32
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.010
It's customizable and it's extensible.

33
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.800
Now, all of these things basically mean they worked very hard and very long to get the right approach

34
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.280
to this.

35
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.690
And so with that, we can first of all try the demo app.

36
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:49.640
So they have a demo app in here and they allow you to run this basically on XPO or the Web app in the

37
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.990
browser.

38
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.440
So this is cross compatible.

39
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:58.280
So you can go to this example and you can run the app on XPO by scanning this QR code right here.

40
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.950
You can pause video and scan this and try out Riak navigation or we can open it in the browser.

41
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:13.370
So with that said, you are able to test it out, but if we go and read the docs, what we're going

42
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.740
to do is basically we're going to follow the installation step by step.

43
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.280
You see what it says here is what follows is the fundamental section.

44
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:29.760
So we need to understand how reachin application works before we get into the depths of it all.

45
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.840
And so this getting started guide covers enough for you to get started in the small, small scale application.

46
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.150
And again, we're layering like a cake.

47
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.560
So we're going to start off small.

48
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.750
We're just going to add some navigation and then we're going to do some more complex things.

49
00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.050
And so here are some of the resources, right?

50
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.060
There's an express section.

51
00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.710
There's a main concepts of react.

52
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.830
They have all of this good documentation that you can read through if you want.

53
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.700
And we're going to follow an implementation that goes kind of like this.

54
00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.630
First of all, we're going to install the required packages in our Riak native projects, so we're going

55
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:08.230
to copy this command and as always, we're going to go over here and we're going to open our terminal.

56
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.200
Right, which is over here.

57
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.590
And we can open a new one.

58
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.860
And what we can do is we can run this command right here.

59
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:18.230
Right.

60
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.880
We can run yarn, ad rack navigation, slash native.

61
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.420
And so this is going to install all of the required dependencies and so let's continue reading while

62
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:33.800
this installs so Riak navigation is made up of some core utilities and then there are the navigators.

63
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.590
So these are the core utilities and then they have specific navigators.

64
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.190
Now they basically created an ecosystem of packages.

65
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.770
So they made it customizable, like you get the need of core utilities for the navigation and then you

66
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:53.070
can decide, well, do I need a tab navigation or stock navigation and all of these different things.

67
00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:01.680
OK, so now the libraries that we need to install are adjust your handler, react, native reanimated,

68
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.780
react, native screens react native safe area context, react native masked view.

69
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.470
Now this is where it gets a little tricky.

70
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.770
Do we need to know specifically what every single one of these packages does?

71
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.950
Yes and no.

72
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:19.800
We can go and read up on them specifically, but basically their packages that enhance the experience

73
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.060
of riak navigation.

74
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:29.350
By exposing specific areas of need of code to react navigation, so installing the dependencies on an

75
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.360
Expo managed project, which we are on, is by running the following comment and this will just install,

76
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.860
react native, just handler, react native Reanimator, all of these different things that we need to

77
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:39.290
install.

78
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.370
So it's as simple as running that command now.

79
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.600
So we'll copy paste that.

80
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:49.840
Well, that's a long one and that's going to go through in cycle and install every single thing that

81
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:50.230
we need.

82
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:57.130
OK, so now that all of these things are installing, we can ignore this section because we're not on

83
00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.180
a bear project.

84
00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.790
And if we scroll down, OK, we're at the end of it.

85
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:06.820
So in the next video, what we're going to do once all of this is installed is set it up.
