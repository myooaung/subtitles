1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:02,090
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:07,010
We've just done our first contribution, which wasn't that crazy, right?

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,870
We just went to the start here guideline and added our names to the contributors list.

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:19,720
But let's actually contribute to an open source project now, now in our community, every month we

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,220
do coding challenges.

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:30,280
Now, you can search for coding challenges here, but this month is a special event because we're actually

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:30,790
doing.

8
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:38,110
A half tober fest event, and this happens once a year in our community in October.

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:46,730
And you can see that if we click on the October 1st, 2019 link, so depending on when you watch this,

10
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:48,590
you might have a different ear.

11
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:55,340
You see that we've provided for you an opportunity to contribute to an open source project.

12
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,300
We actually have Animation Nation.

13
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,260
We have a Santa fied project and also a python.

14
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,390
And you can contribute to any one of these.

15
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:19,390
So if we look at Animation Nation, well, people have contributed their success animations here.

16
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:20,940
This one looks nice.

17
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:29,250
We also have the Santa fied project, so people have created a little Santa website, that's kind of

18
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:29,700
nice.

19
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:39,430
Very, very cool, and then we also have the Python art project that actually does something really

20
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,830
cool if I go to the website here.

21
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:49,180
The laxly turn an image into ASCII art, which is really, really cool.

22
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:57,600
Now there's tons of projects that you can do, but let's try and do this animation nation project.

23
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:03,050
So the first thing I'm going to do is go to the project repository.

24
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:11,890
And follow the steps that we've done before, that is we foresee the repository.

25
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:20,270
We now clone this repository, let's get clone.

26
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,360
And while that is being cloned, let's look at the instructions.

27
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,090
Now, most open source projects will have instructions on how you can contribute.

28
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:42,430
In our case, we have a nice step by step guide, so in the directory, create a directory named after

29
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:42,910
yourself.

30
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,120
OK, that's nice and easy to do.

31
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,660
So let's say CD into the animation.

32
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,310
Nation project.

33
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,190
Let's open it up and sublime.

34
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:04,890
And we see that there's an art folder and in here we have to create our own name or our own folder with

35
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:05,250
our name.

36
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:12,390
I've actually already created a folder called Animatronic that has.

37
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:21,630
A little success, our project with an extra and access, so just to show you, let's move this.

38
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,110
Or just to show you.

39
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:32,640
This is my little animation using some simple index ASML access, nothing too crazy.

40
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:38,840
Now all we need to do is move this into the art folder, as the instructions have given us.

41
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:47,520
And now we've added our project, let's see where's animatronic?

42
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:48,910
There it is.

43
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,430
That's my project over there.

44
00:03:53,160 --> 00:04:00,420
Is to well within this folder, make sure we create two files, an e-mail file and a file and link the

45
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,430
file to your e-mail.

46
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:10,850
Using only e-mail access, create a work of art, so I've actually already done that again, if we go

47
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:15,050
back to the project, I have an index HTML file, very, very simple.

48
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,209
That's linked to a stylesheet.

49
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:22,089
And this is my style about it for my animation that.

50
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:32,830
These little lines now the last part here is to add my own card to this section to the include dodgiest

51
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:33,090
file.

52
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,940
So let's just copy this.

53
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:40,670
Go to the.

54
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:49,220
Includes or include dogs, and you see, this is where everybody enters their information.

55
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:58,750
And right here, we can just add while we copy and paste it, make sure the indentation is proper,

56
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,530
so the name is going to be called animatronic.

57
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:10,310
Page link is going to be while the name of our folder so animatronic.

58
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,150
Index HMO.

59
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,980
And then the gift name, which.

60
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,490
They suggested that we include a gift.

61
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,180
So if I remember correctly, the.

62
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,080
Gafney.

63
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:37,330
Was transport gift again, I just created a little gif of my animation.

64
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,730
So we'll call it transport gif author is.

65
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,850
Andre and the GitHub link is my GitHub link.

66
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,030
All right, so that should be good.

67
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,400
Let's now make a pull request.

68
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:00,010
Now, notice here how I did all these changes on M..

69
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:06,130
Ideally, we created these changes on a new branch so we can actually just do that now.

70
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,020
Get check out be.

71
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,430
And call it animatronic.

72
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,780
So if I do get status now.

73
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,650
I see that I have two changes, that's good.

74
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,710
Let's do get add.

75
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,660
Get commit.

76
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:37,540
Adding my arsenis to the project.

77
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:44,130
And then finally get push of origin animatronic.

78
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,010
All right, if we go back to the project.

79
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:58,730
We see that we actually now have a little icon that says compare, pull request.

80
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,850
If I go back to the forked repo zero to Mastery.

81
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:11,760
You see right over here that I also have this yellow banner, so if I click on this.

82
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:25,380
Please add me to this list and we'll link to this is Joy, who's one of the managers.

83
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,840
So I'm just going to say, please add me to the list.

84
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:32,010
We actually don't even need to tag her because she will check this occasionally.

85
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,500
So I'm going to create a pull request.

86
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,480
It's now opened.

87
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:39,710
That's awesome.

88
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:46,610
So please allow me to the list, if I look at my file changes, you can see that these are what I've

89
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:47,900
added to the project.

90
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:56,490
So if I now merge, pull request again, you won't be able to do this, but some of our management team

91
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:01,260
people who are managing the open source projects will be able to merge for you.

92
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:12,870
We can delete the branch since we have merged everything and now let's see if the changes have been

93
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,170
made.

94
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:20,220
If I go to the zero to Masari Animation Nation, so if I now look for my project, hey, look at that.

95
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,520
There's my little animation project that.

96
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:28,140
Well, there it is, there's my access that's beautiful.

97
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:38,789
The way this project is designed, it randomly selects the next animation, so it might not show all

98
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:39,890
of them at the same time.

99
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,179
So you might have to refresh this a few times.

100
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:46,140
But just like that, I made my opensource contribution.

101
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:51,470
Now, there's a ton of projects here that you can join.

102
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:58,950
And like I said, this is a playground for you to test, make mistakes, because this isn't a real workplace.

103
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:05,330
We want to practice these skills before we actually go into work and make big dangerous changes.

104
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,710
And that's opensource.

105
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,620
I highly, highly recommend that you get involved.

106
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,540
It's a great way to work with others.

107
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,900
It's a great way to learn how Git and GitHub really work.

108
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,680
There's no doubt that there's a lot that an individual programmer can do.

109
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:28,620
However, the progress and scale that something can be built is really compounded when many people work

110
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,670
on something together.

111
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,520
Go make your first opensource contribution and have fun building things with your fellow programmers.

112
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,270
It may one day lead to impress a potential employer.

113
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,990
See in the next one by.
