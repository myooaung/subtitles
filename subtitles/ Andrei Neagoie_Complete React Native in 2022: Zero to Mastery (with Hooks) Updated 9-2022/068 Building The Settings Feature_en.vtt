00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.340
Now that we're taking a deeper look at our setting screen, the very first thing we need to look at

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.790
is our App Navigator, because in our App Navigator, we initially made the decision that our setting

3
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.940
screen was going to be a function that lives inside of the App Navigator.

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.320
Now, that's not the place where we want this feature to live.

5
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.840
Of course, when we move over to the features folder, what we want to do is we want to create a settings

6
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.260
folder.

7
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.390
And this settings folder is going to contain, again, screens and components.

8
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:38.550
And with that, it will be able to create the perfect integration for our settings.

9
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.900
Feature into the navigator.

10
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.860
Now, the very first file we need to create is settings that screen dojos and in that settings on screen,

11
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.710
not just we need to move from the App Navigator, our component.

12
00:00:53.220 --> 00:01:00.210
So we'll take settings from over here and we'll move it into here, will add an export and we'll call

13
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.980
it settings screen.

14
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.600
And we'll need to move a couple of imports as well, so move this this the text on the button.

15
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.680
And we'll move it all in here.

16
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.850
And what we'll do as well is move the react in the context.

17
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.080
Which will need at the top of the file to begin with.

18
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.930
And with that, now, we have our settings screen up and running, ready to go.

19
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:38.740
But what we need to do now is we also need to create the proper integration point over here, which

20
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:46.000
is settings screen, and for that, what we need to do is we need to import setting screen from features,

21
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.980
settings, screens, settings, screen, dot.

22
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.340
Jess, and so now what we'll see is that.

23
00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:02.880
How are component isn't rendering, so if we dismiss, dismiss, dismiss, dismiss all the errors and

24
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.870
we quickly reload, what we'll see over here is.

25
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.229
That it should technically load.

26
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.970
If we go over here to our Noad, what we'll see is that unable to resolve dottore components, utility,

27
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:25.140
safe area, so one of our imports in here is failing because the imports haven't been addressed to point

28
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.260
to the proper path.

29
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.170
So what we need to do here is say dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, slash components.

30
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.780
Add one more here, dot out.

31
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.620
And by doing that, we should now be able to render out the proper.

32
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.510
So if we go over here and we go to settings where we can see is we're rendering the same exact settings

33
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.960
screen that we had before, but now we need to make it look nice, don't we?

34
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.610
So how are we going to do that?

35
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.720
Well, first of all, let's remove button and text, because that's not what we want to do in here.

36
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.100
And we'll move button and text from here as well.

37
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.240
We'll leave our on log function and our use context.

38
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:11.680
And what we want to do is we want to import list from Riak native paper, because that is what we're

39
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.920
going to be using in order to build up our screen.

40
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.860
So we'll import lists from Riak native paper and basically we're going to compose our screen from both

41
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.650
sections and items.

42
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:29.230
And so what we're going to do is we're going to put together a section here where we do list that section

43
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.020
and we'll close the tag list start section.

44
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.980
And inside of there, we're going to put two list items.

45
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.060
We're going to put our logout item that is going to look something like this.

46
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.470
So on logout, we're going to put some padding temporarily over here.

47
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.980
And then we're also going to put our favorites icon over in here, right there.

48
00:03:51.800 --> 00:04:01.020
And so with that, we should be able to render out the favorites now, do we actually have a favorite

49
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.460
throughout?

50
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.690
Huh, that's peculiar.

51
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.360
Well, first off, let's take in navigation over here, setting screens should be getting navigation

52
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.610
and navigation navigate favorites.

53
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.360
Hmm.

54
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.460
Well, if we go look at our App Navigator.

55
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.890
We're loading and setting screen.

56
00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:21.050
Oh, maybe we need a settings navigator.

57
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.290
That's what we need, a settings navigator.

58
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:31.260
That's what we need, because as we can see, Settings is going to contain multiple views.

59
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:38.520
So what we'll set up in here is a specific settings that navigator dodges.

60
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:46.490
And in that settings, Navigator is where we're going to put the code for our settings screens.

61
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.130
Now, if we look at how we've built navigators in the past, first of all, we need to react.

62
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:57.160
We're also going to important use effect and then we're going to import both the create stack and Navigator

63
00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:04.270
and the card interpolate or styles for us to determine how we're going to render out these cards.

64
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:11.260
Then what we'll do is we'll render out the Settings Navigator and that will return the actual Settings

65
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.570
Navigator, which we need to create a stetting stack for in order for that to work.

66
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.300
Then we'll create our setting stack up navigator.

67
00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:28.850
And we'll close off that opening point, and as we can see here, we're going to put Hatamoto screen,

68
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.060
so we're going to have headers for these specific screens.

69
00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.600
This is because we want to see the title of the screen and then we're going to have a setting stack

70
00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:46.220
where we put in both our settings, which is going to be linked to setting screen and then eventually

71
00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.420
our favorite screen where we're going to show our favorites because we can currently see our favorites

72
00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.230
in the favorites part, but we also want to see them in a list for you and we're going to be able to

73
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:55.460
access that from settings.

74
00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.830
So first off, we're going to go and import the settings screen inside of here.

75
00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:08.880
And then for now, we're going to render out null here and what we're going to do is we're going to

76
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:14.840
use well, we don't currently need to use effect because we don't need to integrate that just yet.

77
00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.560
So what we'll have over here is our setting stack with our current setting screen.

78
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.360
And then we'll we'll look at building out the rest of the screen later on.

79
00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:31.080
OK, so now that we know that we have favorites, the thing we need to do in the App Navigator is we

80
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.810
need to import the Settings Navigator.

81
00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:46.990
From target settings, top navigator and let's take this airport, and so now we got it all set up and

82
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.140
if we go over to our app, we go over to the settings screen.

83
00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.390
Oh, what did I do?

84
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:57.300
WAPs did I not explore the component that's exported?

85
00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:58.180
What about here?

86
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:06.090
Oh, that's exported, so Settings Navigator is exported and or probably this not.

87
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:12.180
So we want that to be a function value and then we have an inline component.

88
00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:16.850
So over here now we can see that we have favourite's and logout.

89
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.000
And by adding both of those features now, we can log out of the app.

90
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.540
We can also log back into the app.

91
00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:30.020
And what we should do now is we should look at how we're supposed to build out this features function,

92
00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.640
what is it going to look like?

93
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:37.710
But we should also look at prettying up the screen a bit because it's a bit bland with just these two

94
00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:38.220
options.

95
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:42.540
So let's look at both of those integrations and feature improvements.
