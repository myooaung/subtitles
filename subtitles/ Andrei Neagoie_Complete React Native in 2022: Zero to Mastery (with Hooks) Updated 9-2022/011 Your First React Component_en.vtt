WEBVTT
1
00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.150
All right, welcome back.

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.470
We have our Hello World app, but that doesn't look very cool.

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.840
We want to make our robo friends app.

4
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.340
So in this video, we're going to get started by building our first component.

5
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.360
If we go back here, we remember that we have the terminal on the right hand side and we just ran and

6
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.120
start and Korea exact checks, all the files for us, make sure there's no errors.

7
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.820
It says that our app is defined but never used.

8
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.220
So let's comment this out again.

9
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.830
Comment again, say this and you'll see that everything's working fine.

10
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:46.450
Now, you may have a few questions just on this index, not just file one, we see that we're importing

11
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.820
react, but how come that's working?

12
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.620
We remember that it didn't work before.

13
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.860
We had to use require and then Browsr five.

14
00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:00.400
Again, react has Westpac underneath the hood that does the bundling for us, so we're allowed to use

15
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.880
imports.

16
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.270
As long as we keep these at the top of the file, we can import whatever other files we want or whatever

17
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.230
packages we want.

18
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.680
We also see that there's two things react and react, Dom.

19
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:24.850
If you remember, react is a view library, so this is the little robot that we remember from the previous

20
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:25.220
video.

21
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.280
It's the core of the package that does the DOM manipulation for us.

22
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.770
But as I said before, react can be used in multiple places, not just the browser, it can be used

23
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:43.580
for mobile devices, it can be used for virtual reality, and you can plug and play different libraries

24
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.620
like this based on what screen you're rendering to so react.

25
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:57.080
Dom is used for the DOM websites, so it's the glue of react, but we can have something like React

26
00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.290
Native that actually renders to mobile phones.

27
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:10.139
We also have import and export success, and this is a new Syntex, well, react allows us to access

28
00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.770
not just in one file, but for each different component.

29
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.670
If we go to Apgar's, well, we have access that describes the app.

30
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:29.730
If we go to index jobs while we have index access that has its own style and these cells will only apply

31
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.560
to whatever components index Sarge's renders.

32
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.490
And the way we use it is we just say import and then unlike a react package where we just say the name

33
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.910
of the package and it automatically knows to check the known moggies Falder, we have to tell it where

34
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:54.990
index cowslips and the syntax of dot slash means it's in the same directory.

35
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.670
So it's saying checking the source folder index that counts should be there.

36
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.590
OK.

37
00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.520
And finally, we see register service worker, and this is an advanced topic that we won't cover in

38
00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:14.870
this course, but think of service workers as a new feature that allows our apps to become faster and

39
00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.490
potentially work offline.

40
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.890
It's something that we don't need to concern ourselves with.

41
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:26.180
So for now, you can comment this out and it will still work, but we'll keep it here just because create

42
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.130
react up gives this to us for free.

43
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.080
The things that we really, really care about, though, is well.

44
00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:41.990
This line over here, this whole thing is what really does it saying I want the reactant package to

45
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:48.860
use the function render and this render is I want you to render whatever this is.

46
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.780
But if you remember, before we had.

47
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.670
And well, this isn't really an e-mail tag, is it?

48
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.260
We've just created this from.

49
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:10.660
It looks like the same directory, there's something called app, and it doesn't have a GPS file like

50
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:18.550
we see it over here, and that is because it automatically says that if there's no DOT success or any

51
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.220
type after it, well, it assumes that it's JavaScript.

52
00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.190
But this will work as well, as you can see.

53
00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:33.830
OK, so let's go to App Dodge's file and see why we can use this e-mail tech that we've created if we

54
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.160
go to Apgar's file.

55
00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.180
Well, again, we see that we're importing something.

56
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.140
We're doing something called the structuring here and getting component as well.

57
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:50.980
And we have a few files like Logo CFG and Abduh Access that we're importing, and again, we see that

58
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:57.760
our Syntex is a little bit off, so make sure that we change our files to JavaScript Bable.

59
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:07.790
And it looks like class app extends component that comes with react, and this is just standard syntax.

60
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.620
This renders.

61
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:16.740
Remember, a component always has the rule that it must render at least something, and the way we do

62
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.370
that is we return a ASML piece of the website.

63
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.530
So we see over here, welcome to react to get started at it.

64
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.210
Well, that's exactly what it says over here.

65
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.290
That is the power of react.

66
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:37.700
We're creating our own custom components, our own custom HTML tags that we can just add.

67
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:46.640
And if you remember the one way flow picture, we have one parent that has children so apass children.

68
00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.080
But you know what?

69
00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.740
Let's build our own component to make this point clear.

70
00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:57.590
Instead of having Hello World in here, let's create a component called Hello.

71
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:04.310
And it's a self-closing tag, so you want to have the backslash and in here, instead of saying import

72
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.560
app lets to import hello from we'll call it.

73
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.530
Hello, Jess, and you'll notice that it's capitalized here.

74
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.660
Well, if you're building a component, the standard is that it's capitalized.

75
00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.640
So it'll be called Hello Jess.

76
00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:30.400
If we see this, we'll get an air says module not found, can't resolve because the file doesn't exist.

77
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:31.990
So let's create one.

78
00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:33.970
I'm going to say new file.

79
00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:36.370
Hello, James.

80
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:38.430
There you go.

81
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:45.100
We have a new hello, gorgeous file, and it's compiled successfully if we go to the website.

82
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.340
Well, look at that.

83
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.100
It actually even gives us air on the website.

84
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.590
And that's why Create Ragtop is just so awesome.

85
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:57.140
It shows you exactly what the areas are without opening up the console right here.

86
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.790
Again, we have nothing built right now in hello, so we need to create it, let's use the app that

87
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.630
just as an example, it looks like we need to import react.

88
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:15.700
And component, so we need to say no react component from react, OK?

89
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.040
And the reason we're doing this, again, this is the structuring.

90
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:26.070
Instead of doing react dot component, we can now just do.

91
00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.550
Component, and it means the same thing.

92
00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:36.230
Again, looking at this, it looks like we say class, our component name extends component.

93
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:36.920
Let's do that.

94
00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:44.580
Class, we'll call this hello again, that's what our component's called extends.

95
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.180
And again, remember to change our.

96
00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:53.470
JavaScript to bable.

97
00:07:55.570 --> 00:08:00.760
And if you remember, one rule is that we always want to have a render function.

98
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:07.080
And within this render function, we tell it what we want to return.

99
00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:13.790
Well, we want to return the Hello World example, but we can say each one.

100
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:18.070
Hello, world.

101
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:25.390
OK, let's see what happens when I do this, I save.

102
00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:31.180
And it says export default import is hello was not found.

103
00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:34.669
Well, it's because we're not exporting this.

104
00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:42.240
Remember, if we want another file to use it, we have to export and we use export default when we're

105
00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:48.540
just exporting one thing, if we use the word default, that means this file only exports one thing

106
00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:49.830
and that is the app.

107
00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.230
So I can say export.

108
00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:55.590
Default, hello.

109
00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:00.520
Looks like it's working.

110
00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.600
Let's see what happens in our Web site.

111
00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:08.140
Hello, World, we've just created our very first component.

112
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:19.430
Now, right now, we only have one line, but what if I wanted to do something like d'Hiv wrapping it

113
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:27.890
in a div and maybe underneath here all say a paragraph that says, welcome to react.

114
00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:44.760
And it's because we're just giving him multiple lines here and returns, expecting a single thing,

115
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.610
we need to wrap this in brackets.

116
00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:58.150
In order to have JavaScript say this is an expression, evaluate this entire thing if we save this.

117
00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.750
Looks like it's working and then hello, world, welcome to react.

118
00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:10.480
Within here, if you remember, if we import.

119
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:21.170
Dot hello, dot success, we can create whatever styles we want, but we need to create that file first.

120
00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:21.920
So let's do.

121
00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:30.020
You follow up and I need to add an O in here, then you file name will be Hello CSFs.

122
00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:38.600
Now in hello, that counts, I can just say that the H1 and this is just standard access will have background

123
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.670
of red.

124
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:43.030
I'm going to save save this as well.

125
00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:44.210
Everything looks good.

126
00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:46.310
And look at that.

127
00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:54.530
But you know what, to make this faster and because we've gone over a success, I want to show you a

128
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:56.810
cool package called tachyons.

129
00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:06.290
And tachyons allows us to have similar to bootstrap predefined class names that we can just add to components

130
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:07.860
to make things look really, really nice.

131
00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:09.410
So let's do that.

132
00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:14.450
I'm going to close this and say NPM install tachyons.

133
00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:22.610
All right, it's added a package we can check by going to package that, Jason, we see that tachyons

134
00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:30.110
are there and we can use tachyons very easily by just going to indexer Jaspal and saying import.

135
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:42.440
And now we have access to this package just to show you what tachyons are, if I go to Tachyons Siles.

136
00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:53.710
It gives us little classes that we can use that, for example, text's center will just say Tsay, and

137
00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:58.470
as long as we have tachyons installed and we use text class name, it will align our text.

138
00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:06.790
So now that we have tachyons and its index such as file, we can just say within here.

139
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:22.360
F one for one, and Texana, if I save, I have to do npm start here, make sure that our server is

140
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.900
running so that we can check our changes and we.

141
00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:34.480
Get hello, world, welcome to react, but there's actually one trick here if you open up the console,

142
00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:38.860
although this worked, I get a warning saying invalid Don property class.

143
00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:43.060
Did you mean class name and react to really, really good at giving you errors.

144
00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:45.490
And you might be asking yourself.

145
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:53.680
Why class name instead of class, because if I say this, go back.

146
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.360
I no longer have that air.

147
00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.050
Hmm, why is that?

148
00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:06.490
Well, up until this point, we've kind of just been HTML, but this is a JavaScript file.

149
00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.280
How are we able to do this?

150
00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:12.400
This is actually something called JSM.

151
00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:22.000
Part of react is that it allows you to write this HTML like syntax in your JavaScript.

152
00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:29.210
And you might be asking yourself, one, doesn't that break the rule of separation of concerns?

153
00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:36.710
And two, how are we even able to add a multi JavaScript to answer the first question, separation of

154
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:43.310
concerns react has the idea of components, and that is it's better to have functionality and styles

155
00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:47.770
per component so that each component is its own separate universe.

156
00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:49.700
And you just add these components.

157
00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:57.890
And the idea of separation of concerns with react is that components, well, they're concerned about

158
00:13:57.890 --> 00:13:59.040
themselves, nothing else.

159
00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.580
So it changes the paradigm here.

160
00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.260
And it's kind of nice, right?

161
00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:05.020
I can just look at the Hillo component.

162
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:06.350
I know exactly what it's doing.

163
00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:07.550
I can look at the success.

164
00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:14.690
And any time I need to make a change, I just need to worry about the files that contain the hillocks

165
00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:15.330
and JavaScript.

166
00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:22.970
The second thing is this, this thing called Jair sex underneath the hood, what reactor's doing is

167
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.430
actually letting you use the syntax, but they're not actual ASTM all tax.

168
00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:34.820
Remember what I said about the virtual dom and how react creates its own object and then looks at the

169
00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:38.900
DOM and compares it and says, I need to change this and it does it for us.

170
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:48.080
React uses sex to create their virtual dom, their fake dom that they built based on what we give it

171
00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:48.530
to them.

172
00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:55.070
Then they look at this virtual Dom and the real Dom and say, this part has changed.

173
00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:58.430
I'm going to change the DOM now based on the virtual dom.

174
00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.460
And that is why react is really, really fast.

175
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:07.760
It creates these objects, which is really fast in JavaScript and only changes what needs to be done

176
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:08.660
in the DOM.

177
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:10.700
So just get used to it.

178
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:17.330
It's awkward at first, but again, as long as you wrap it in a bracket, you can write here a HTML

179
00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:24.170
as well as your own custom components such as hello that we used in index Jaspal.

180
00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:32.890
And now maybe it makes sense why we can't say class here.

181
00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:42.530
Because class is a reserved key word in JavaScript class is part of the language that JavaScript uses.

182
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:47.510
So if this is JavaScript, the fact that we're seeing class here doesn't make sense.

183
00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:54.840
In the old version of react, this actually broke react, but now it gives us a nicer air because this

184
00:15:54.840 --> 00:16:01.080
is JavaScript and not ASML, we have to say class name and it's something that you'll get used to,

185
00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:04.660
you'll get tricked up with at the beginning, but it becomes easy after a while.

186
00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:05.690
All right.

187
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:11.920
The last thing I'm going to show you is the power of react within the Halo component.

188
00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:16.140
I can now add something called props or properties.

189
00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:25.370
And these props can be called anything, think of them as animal attributes, I can say greeting equals

190
00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:32.510
and then within here I want to wrap it in curly brackets and this is a JavaScript expression.

191
00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:33.950
Whatever I want, I can say.

192
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:41.030
Ninja.

193
00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:44.380
And if I save this.

194
00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:51.750
I get an error saying that no useless concatenation, so it's saying that, hey, why are you even adding

195
00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:52.080
things?

196
00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.820
You can just put them all together.

197
00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:59.880
So it's smart enough to even give you suggestions or warnings of when you're doing something that's

198
00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:00.290
not clean.

199
00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:02.690
But for now, for demonstration purposes, this is fine.

200
00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:12.720
Now that I've given it what we call a greeting prop to hello, I now have access and hello dogs to props.

201
00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:14.579
I can now say.

202
00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:22.690
This dot props dot greeting.

203
00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:29.460
Go back and I say, hello, react ninja.

204
00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:40.910
You see with this syntax, it's saying that this object, which is hello, has properties, props,

205
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:49.100
that is greeting I know this is confusing is just the syntax you have to get used to, but now we have

206
00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:51.980
access to whatever property.

207
00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:57.590
And whatever property value we get from hello.

208
00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:05.040
This is a power that will come in handy later on, but I want you to build your own component here and

209
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.810
get comfortable with the syntax.

210
00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:13.660
It is really, really powerful, and once you get used to it, you can build any components you want.

211
00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.490
OK, one final thing.

212
00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:22.370
This index might be kind of difficult, but I want to show you that this is actually just a function.

213
00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.630
If I do const.

214
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.330
Hello, and in here, this function.

215
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:33.860
Accepts props.

216
00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:42.500
If I do an air function here, wrap it in curly brackets, and instead of doing this render.

217
00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:44.900
I just simply.

218
00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:55.640
If I save this.

219
00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:03.530
Well, I'm getting in her because this props out greetings doesn't really exist because it's not an

220
00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:06.070
object anymore, it is a function.

221
00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.220
So I don't need the props.

222
00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:11.960
It receives props, whatever parameters we give it, and props.

223
00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.540
That greeting is acceptable to us.

224
00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:16.730
I say this, go back and look at that.

225
00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:17.420
It's working.

226
00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.720
It's just functions.

227
00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:27.470
Think of reactors that we're just creating these functions that take parameters and these parameters

228
00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:35.870
which are given by giving attributes and values are just being rendered.

229
00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:37.890
I have access to props.

230
00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:38.450
That greeting.

231
00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:43.880
If I give it another prop here called let's say dog, then I'll have props.

232
00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.850
Dog dog available to me as well.

233
00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:54.170
And again, we get a nice little error saying that component, we're grabbing this, but we're not really

234
00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:58.820
using it and we're using unnecessary strain concatenation.

235
00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:01.340
Again, really useful, as you can see.

236
00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.110
Fairly simple to pick up.

237
00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:09.520
In the next lesson, we're going to start actually working on our robo friends app now that we have

238
00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:10.060
the basics.

239
00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:12.580
I've seen that one by.
