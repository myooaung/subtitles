00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:08.570
Oh, boy, is this exciting, we just finished two full parts of this float now, not everything is

2
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:09.460
hooked up together yet.

3
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.410
I that's that still needs to happen.

4
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.600
But we have the user.

5
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.330
We can get the credit card if we can get the straight talk.

6
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:24.620
And now our checkout screen looks like it's ready to integrate with a payment flow.

7
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.210
OK, so how do we go about building that payment flow?

8
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.700
Well, that's what the next series of videos are going to be about.

9
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.470
And the reason that we've constructed the stripe integration in this way, where I'm showing you this

10
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.440
really, really detailed flow diagram is because payments are hard, payments are inherently a hard

11
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.770
flow.

12
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.110
You really, really need to break things down.

13
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.540
And I admit, even though this diagram is here, it can still be quite difficult.

14
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.950
Don't worry about it.

15
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.520
But what I will admit to you is any time you run into a complex scenario, building a graph like this

16
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.090
to just explain it and break it down really comes in handy.

17
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.390
And it's something that is vital on the job.

18
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.209
Remember that.

19
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.500
Now, let's go look at how we're going to build out this payment for.
