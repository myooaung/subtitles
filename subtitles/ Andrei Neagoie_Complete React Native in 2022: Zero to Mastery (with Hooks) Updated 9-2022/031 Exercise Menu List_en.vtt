00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:09.710
Now that we have our restaurant card detail card rendering out the next portion of the feature is to

2
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.510
put in place a menu accordion group.

3
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.830
So what we're going to be trying to do is achieving the following.

4
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.540
We're going to be putting menu groups for breakfast, lunch, dinner and drinks.

5
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.770
And for that, we're going to be using react native papers, list accordion.

6
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.130
And that list accordion is going to work as follows.

7
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.260
When we look at the usage, what's basically going on here is we're going to have a used state for every

8
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:44.660
accordion group and that's going to basically have a title and a ikon that is going to be rendered as

9
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.190
well as the items internally inside of the list.

10
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.210
Now, every icon is going to be specific to react of paper.

11
00:00:53.220 --> 00:01:00.880
So when we go look at react native paper, it has icons and it can use many components of the Riak native

12
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.050
vector icon group.

13
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.240
That means you can pass the name of a material community icon as well as a Riak need a vector icon library.

14
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:17.260
They have a list of supported icons so that you can find icons and you can search for icons inside of

15
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.310
here that you want to put.

16
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.450
Now, what we'll do is we'll reconvene after this video and I'll show you how I put together my list

17
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:33.680
accordion groups in order to render out breakfast, lunch and dinner inside of the restaurant detail

18
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.960
screen.
