Hey, I just wanted to give a quick note on video playback speed in case you wanted the course to move

2
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.300
a bit faster, you can always press this little icon here down in the left bottom hand corner.

3
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.690
And this will allow you to choose a speed at which you want to play the set video.

4
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.900
So if you want to slow it down a bit, you can slow it down a bit.

5
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.630
If you want to speed it up, you can always speed up the videos to accommodate to your listening style.
