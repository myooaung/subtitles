1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:05,460
Now that we have log-in register should be a breeze, shouldn't it?

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,640
And for the most part, it will be.

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,570
What we're going to do now is we're going to go look at our authentication service and we're going to

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,210
set some things up that need to be set up in order for unregister to work.

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:24,030
So we're going to say CONSED on register and in unregister, we're going to see email.

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:33,270
Password, repeated password, and what we're going to do is we're going to call a firebase method,

7
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,570
which is basically firebase start off create user with email and password.

8
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,580
That's the function we're going to call.

9
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,690
Now, there's one small issue with this.

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,060
It doesn't do any password petion, verification.

11
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:53,940
So what we need to figure out here is, well, how are we going to create an error?

12
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:04,080
OK, well, let's say if password is not equal to repeated password, then we'll do set error.

13
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:15,460
Error passwords do not match and will return and exit the function, and that will allow us to check

14
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,930
on what exactly is occurring now over here in the create user, what password?

15
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:24,910
What we want to do is we want to use that same dot then the catch structure that we had here, because

16
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:28,510
when we register successfully will also be locked in.

17
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:39,130
Now, with that, what we want to do over here is we want to pass this on, register into the value

18
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,800
context, and then we can start using it.

19
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:49,300
And so with this, we basically have everything set up roughly in order for our register screen to work.

20
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,960
Now, what I want to do is, first of all, I want to go remove the secure here.

21
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,930
I have this because I copy and secure entry twice.

22
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,000
Secure keyword does not exist.

23
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,110
Do not use that.

24
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,630
But the secure text entry does exist.

25
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:08,350
Now let's copy paste everything that's in here and let's just go ahead and rename this register screen

26
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,900
because they look fairly alike.

27
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:14,740
Now, the main difference here is that register screen is going to have the repeated passwords, so

28
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:19,570
set repeated password and we're going to call this repeated password.

29
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:26,320
And then we're going to instead of taking all along and we're going to take on register and our register

30
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,260
is going to be passed to the button below.

31
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:36,540
Now, this is going to take email, password and repeated password, and that's going to allow us to

32
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,170
get the error back in case we do not have the password done twice properly.

33
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:49,590
Now we're going to need a second off input of the type password, which is going to be repeat password

34
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,220
as a label.

35
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,390
And we're going to give it repeated password as the value now, the last thing we need to do is we need

36
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:01,170
to use set repeated password and we need to put that in place over here.

37
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:08,040
Once we do all of that, what we can actually achieve over here is a fairly easy registration process

38
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,150
by doing this.

39
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:18,420
While, of course, we need to use the right icon here, which is mail, and then we'll do a contained

40
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,480
actually what did we call it over here, an account screen.

41
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,210
Let's let's use the same one, its account email.

42
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,760
So let's do that and then we're going to call it register.

43
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,990
That needs to be correct.

44
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:37,240
And so once we said all of these properties, what we can do now is we can do more plus one at beneath

45
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,180
audio, which is a syntax just to reuse the same email to register.

46
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,150
And we can do tests and we can do test again.

47
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,600
And when we hit register, oh, password should be at least six characters.

48
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,070
So we really got our errors back.

49
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,240
It was that easy.

50
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,790
So if we do test one, two, three and we do test, test one, two, three.

51
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,370
Well now when we register, we should log in.

52
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:58,640
Right.

53
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,920
It was that easy.

54
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:09,140
We just built an entire registration function in that many lines of code and it wasn't hard at all.

55
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,720
We basically set up our service.

56
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,220
We knew where to set that up.

57
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,330
We knew where to hook it up.

58
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,149
We knew how to do our repeated password logic.

59
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:25,340
So if we do MO plus two beneath audio and we do test one, two, three and we do test two, three for

60
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,260
what we're going to see here is an error.

61
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:28,280
Passwords do not match.

62
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,320
So we set up all of the logic.

63
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,850
We set up a register button, we basically copy paste of the entire login screen and tweak that a little

64
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:35,090
bit.

65
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:40,520
And we already have everything working as intended.

66
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,770
And if we hit the backburn, it's going to go back.

67
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:48,110
Absolutely amazing, just like that, built to full features.

68
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,570
OK, it took some set up on the London screen and and, you know, we have to go through some motions

69
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,670
over there and make sure that everything was tight.

70
00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:00,070
But once we did that, we were in a good state to just build the registration function.

71
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,930
No muss, no fuss.

72
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:09,760
And if we go look at Android here and we quickly go inside and we say reload, what we're going to see

73
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:14,200
is that it's going to work exactly the same way.

74
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:21,130
When we load up the app, we can see over here our login screen looks exactly the same register screen

75
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,120
looks exactly the same.

76
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:29,680
If we do more plus two Abney audio and we then go to password test one, two, three, test one, two,

77
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:29,980
three.

78
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,150
We can see when we register it's actually going to log in.

79
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:39,370
Now we don't have the instant feedback yet, like it was registering for a minute, but the button was

80
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:39,770
still there.

81
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,490
Now that's something we need to solve for, of course.

82
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:48,430
But you can see how instantly amazing this is and how simple it was for us to achieve all of this.

83
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:55,070
OK, so now that we have our registration set up, let's go tighten up some more loose ends.
