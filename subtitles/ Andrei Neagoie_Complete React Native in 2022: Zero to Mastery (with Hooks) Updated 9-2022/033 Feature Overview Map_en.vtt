Before we start getting into building the actual maps feature, we want to get a sense of what our feature

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.430
overview is going to be.

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.710
So any time we search for any given place, what we want to do is we want the map to swap out and then

4
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.290
show us the markers at that specific place.

5
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:25.620
And with that, we'll be able to create an experience for the user that seamless between the restaurants,

6
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.500
which also take into account that the location has changed and the map.

7
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:37.020
And when we click on a specific restaurant on the map, you will go back to the restaurants for you

8
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.430
and showcase the restaurant detail information.

9
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.500
That way we have the ability to create the seamless experience in the app, a flowing from the map screen

10
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.660
back into the restaurant detail information.

11
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.460
And so knowing that that's how our feature is going to work, the first thing we need to figure out

12
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.140
is how are we going to render a map?

13
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.640
And so let's get into that.
