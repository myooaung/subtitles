1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:09,290
I hear you wondering, Moe, I get it get is important, but it's also optional to push to get huben

2
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:10,130
all these things.

3
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,430
But it's I get in school too.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,200
I hear you saying motorcycle to school to.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,250
All right.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,570
But now.

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,530
What's up, what's what's going on here?

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:27,400
What are we going to do, like I get the whole revision tracking, I get that the files go up into the

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,870
cloud and can come back to me and I can see what's changing and all of that good stuff.

10
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:37,990
So I have a proper idea of how to do changes to my code and keep track of the changes.

11
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,070
OK, well, now now comes the good part.

12
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:46,450
Now we're going to run focus time locally.

13
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,910
But there's one thing I do need to tell you.

14
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:58,210
As a Windows user, you come with a massive disadvantage, and that is that the Mac ecosystem, Apple,

15
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:07,930
they only allow Apple computers to build four I OS, which means that at the end of the day, we're

16
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,740
only going to be able to run on Android.

17
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:15,160
OK, what kind of disadvantage does this give me?

18
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,710
Well, don't be afraid.

19
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:23,830
If you have your own iPhone, you can still run your focused time app on your iPhone directly through

20
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,040
the QR code that I'll show you.

21
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:35,710
But if you want to run something called an emulator and an emulator is defined as a piece of software

22
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,880
that is going to act as the phone on your computer.

23
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,680
If you want to run software on your computer, that's going to act like a phone, act like an iPhone,

24
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,830
act like an Android phone while on Windows.

25
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,910
You're only going to have the ability to do that with Android.

26
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,510
So we're going to install something called Android Studio.

27
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:00,070
And this is the one stop shop for Android developers.

28
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:07,610
Hands down one of the greatest tools for Android development, if you're doing it natively, but in

29
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,970
this case, we're not doing native Android developer.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,220
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

31
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:20,240
We're doing react native development, which is so much cooler because we write once targeted both platforms

32
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,000
so much cooler than just writing for one platform.

33
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,670
But OK, why do I need Android studio then?

34
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,590
You just said it's for Android developers.

35
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:37,880
It comes with tools that are required on your machine locally in order for you to be able to build on

36
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,210
your local machine to target Android.

37
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:46,820
You see, when we were running everything inside of the browser inside of the Expo snack, behind the

38
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,190
scenes, a lot of heavy lifting was going on for us.

39
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:53,640
And we didn't really have to concern ourselves with all of these tools and all of this set up and all

40
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,940
of this yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada.

41
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,330
But now the data is important.

42
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:08,720
Now we have to go and we have to get the tools that we need in order to build on our computer to push

43
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,190
these changes.

44
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:14,040
Or build these changes, rather, for Android.

45
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:20,700
OK, so this is a rather large package and it may take a minute or two, but what we can see here is

46
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,360
that Android studio is going to give us software.

47
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,820
And this software we're not really going to use is going to be behind the scenes doing some heavy lifting

48
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,390
for us.

49
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,490
We're not really going to interact with it all too much.

50
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,570
We're going to simplify things and build things.

51
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:43,170
But we need to set it up in order to make sure that we can build out the right way.

52
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:49,020
OK, so once this installation or this download has finished, we're going to start the installation

53
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,860
of Android studio and I'll be back for the UIF.

54
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:58,420
I felt like that took hours and made depending on your Internet speed, unfortunately.

55
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:04,920
So now that Android studio is ready to rock and roll, we're going to click it and when we click it,

56
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,660
it's going to start the installation procedure.

57
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,600
Now, this may be a longer process, so you have to be patient.

58
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,030
And this is where things can go wrong.

59
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,240
And depending on your system, you may run into cases.

60
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:21,360
Now, Google is always a good place to go look, but we always recommend reaching out to our community

61
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,400
first on this score.

62
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,970
So join our Dischord community.

63
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,340
Join it now.

64
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:34,140
It's amazing people will help you because with these types of setups, things can go wrong and you want

65
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,010
the best help out there and our community is the best help out.

66
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,660
Now, what we want to select well, we want to select Android studio and we want the Android virtual

67
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,310
device, we're going to roll with the basic settings, roll with the basic settings, and now it's going

68
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:52,560
to go through the installation procedure, which may take a while, and it's going to go through extracting

69
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,390
a bunch of files, installing a bunch of files, putting things in the right place for us.

70
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,480
These files that you're seeing happen and all this stuff.

71
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:07,610
This is all software that is used by Android to build Android apps.

72
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,170
It's the native stuff.

73
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:15,260
It's the guts of Android and what it needs to to build Android apps that it's installing for us right

74
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:15,430
now.

75
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,240
So when we press next.

76
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,710
What's going to happen here is it's going to say, hey, import settings, we don't have any settings.

77
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:25,830
All right.

78
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,980
Well, if we don't have any settings, what do we have?

79
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:34,350
Well, we have Android studio now, which is what exactly what we need is going to ask us today to share.

80
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,470
We're going to say, if you want to sense the sticks, you can send statistics.

81
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,390
It's going to take us through this wizard.

82
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,360
And this wizard is to set up our development environment.

83
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,820
So we're going to press next and we're going to select standard and always big dark thing.

84
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,010
Just always pick the dark thing.

85
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:49,870
It's so much nicer.

86
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:56,340
OK, so it's going to install it's going to now install all of the real guts that it needs.

87
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:00,390
So it's going to install something called an SDK or a software development kit.

88
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,840
And so it's going to take one point sixty nine gigabytes of space.

89
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,580
Make sure you have that space and it's going to install all of these SDK and all of this good stuff

90
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,150
that we need.

91
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:15,870
OK, so press finish and now it's going to go through the process of downloading these things and putting

92
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,830
them in the right place.

93
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:20,360
And if you press show details, it'll tell you exactly what it's doing.

94
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:21,720
It's unzipping a bunch of stuff.

95
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,550
It's going to pull a bunch of stuff from online.

96
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,610
It's going to install a bunch of stuff.

97
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:29,600
This may take a while, so be patient and once it's done, we'll be back at it.

98
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:37,410
So I went through my installation process and I saw this unable to install internal hardware acceleration.

99
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,070
Manager, your CPU does not support it and that's completely fine.

100
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,540
That's OK if you see that.

101
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,430
So let's finish.

102
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:52,810
And now we have Android studio, so I want you to configure and I want you to go to avoid manager,

103
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,330
this is the Android virtual device manager.

104
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,030
Now I want you to hit play on the emulator.

105
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:04,910
And it's going to say cannot start, why could it not start, right, what's happening here?

106
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,840
Why could it not start?

107
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:07,710
What's what?

108
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,330
What why?

109
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:16,380
Well, your computer does not support hardware, accelerated graphics.

110
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,820
So here are some of your options.

111
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:26,760
Use a physical device for testing, develop on a Windows X computer that has intel processor develop

112
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,700
on a Linux computer, use an Android virtual device based on an R.M. image.

113
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,170
This is ten times slower.

114
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:40,980
OK, so if your computer does not have this well, as we can see here, this default.

115
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,410
Is set up with something we don't have.

116
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:51,250
So this may work for you if you have hardware, accelerated management graphics, but.

117
00:07:52,220 --> 00:08:01,460
This one doesn't, so let's go over here and let's go down here and let's say let me take a Nexus five,

118
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,320
right.

119
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,220
And I'm going to go next.

120
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:11,160
And what I can say is, what are my other images, which ones do I have?

121
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:12,250
Right.

122
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:15,990
So I have this one over here, the R in the 86.

123
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:18,140
Huh?

124
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:19,690
Is this the one I need?

125
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:28,980
Probably so let's press next while it's saying my CPU does not support Vertex, while can I use the

126
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,370
stun?

127
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:37,400
Looks like I have to go to other images, right, and I have to download an Arem based one.

128
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:41,830
So let's go ahead and let's download that except next.

129
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:48,730
And once this installation is complete, we'll be able to create a virtual device that is supported

130
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:49,210
by.

131
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,730
Devices that don't have a virtual like an intel processor.

132
00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:02,420
All right, so we have an ARMM 64 beast image of Android now, and so basically what's going on here

133
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,990
is the infinite war between Intel and non intel devices.

134
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,930
Machine I'm running on does not have Intel.

135
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,880
So it may very well be true that a default Android virtual device that was set up may work for you.

136
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,840
It did not for me.

137
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,280
And that's why we're going through this setup.

138
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,390
Do not go through this portion if that play button initially worked for you.

139
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:27,390
OK, so now we have this, so let's press next.

140
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:33,880
Next, is this OK, we have an are all that good stuff.

141
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,620
It's an area based one, good, good.

142
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,200
Let's go to advanced settings.

143
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,510
And then let's say down here, is everything good?

144
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:47,520
Is everything good?

145
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,200
Everything looks good.

146
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,800
So let's finish.

147
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:01,710
And let's try the air in Beast one, and so that one was killed, why was it killed?

148
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:08,500
Well, it's guilt specifically because I'm technically running on parallels.

149
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:17,610
And because I'm running on parallels, some of these functionalities do not work on parallels, but

150
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,750
I was showing you how you could possibly go about doing this.

151
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:26,140
Now, if you have an Android device or an iPod device, you're still good.

152
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,230
I'm just trying to show you how to do this.

153
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:32,210
If this is still a showstopper, you can use your mobile phone to still do the app development.

154
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,180
Don't worry about that.

155
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,380
I'm trying to show you this.

156
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,750
So let me show you how it would look like on Mac.

157
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,560
If we went into Android studio here.

158
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,380
Android studio.

159
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:55,590
And we opened that up on Makk, for instance, which is the default device, and we went into a city

160
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,460
manager, you can see here that when I pressed the button.

161
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:04,720
Is basically what you should see, this device should boot up and this is what you should have available.

162
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,090
This is not what's happening on the parallels machine that I am running on.

163
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,470
And this is a limitation due to the software that Windows is running inside.

164
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:18,060
But just trust, if you press the button, you'll be able to launch an android.

165
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,780
And if it's if it's not possible, you can still use your mobile phone.

166
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,980
And that is completely fine.

167
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,990
Now, you do not need the virtual devices to run.

168
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,620
What you need is, is Android to be available.

169
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,340
And so we have gone through the Android installation.

170
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,620
Now, the next part of the installation is we need node and yourn.

171
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,890
What's that going to look like?
