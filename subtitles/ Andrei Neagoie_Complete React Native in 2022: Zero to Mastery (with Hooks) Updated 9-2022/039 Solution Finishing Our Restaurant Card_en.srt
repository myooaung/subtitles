1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:06,970
That was a bit of a tricky one, wasn't it, and it was a bit of a tricky one, because taking something

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:14,440
as simple as this and putting it at the end takes a lot of practice with Flex.

3
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:21,310
There's different ways of doing it, but doing it with flex box triggers that you have to kind of start

4
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,520
practicing certain concepts.

5
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:27,040
So what we did here is we did an equal spacing.

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:35,530
So on the one hand, we have our rating over here and next to the rating we have this section that kind

7
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,260
of pushes in all the way.

8
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,850
And so how did we achieve that?

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,750
Well, let's look at that.

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:52,350
Over here in our code, we can see that we kind of put a section wrapper around our section, so let's

11
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:53,100
just switch colors.

12
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,040
So we have the section over here, right.

13
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:00,900
And the section is wrapping the entirety of the rating and everything around it.

14
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,160
Right.

15
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:08,370
So if we just quickly see that everything is gone, so it contains rating and it contains something

16
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,860
we would call section end.

17
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,640
So section end is a special type of component.

18
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,270
And we'll look at what the CSFs looks like that contains a conditional.

19
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,480
If you are open now, it's going to show you an open.

20
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,110
What is an open?

21
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,090
What is this?

22
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,410
Well, let's take a look.

23
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,280
So if we go up here, what we can see is and this is only one way of solving it, you can solve it in

24
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,200
a bunch of different ways as long as you've gotten the desired effect.

25
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:41,490
What I'm trying to show you here is a potential avenue of how to solve it without breaking the layout

26
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,710
in specific ways.

27
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,260
No, you can solve this any given way, but this is the way that I chose to solve it.

28
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,900
So over here, we have our section.

29
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:57,680
In our section has a flex direction of Roe and Roe means that basically it's going to well put them

30
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:05,120
in a row style syntax and we align the items to the center and then we have our section end, which

31
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:10,220
also takes a flex direction of Roe, but justifies the content to flex end.

32
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:14,840
And the end outcome of this is that it's going to push out to the side.

33
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:22,370
And then we took open, which is a styled a custom styled of our SGML that also takes a flex direction

34
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,790
of Roe now.

35
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,180
Was this necessary?

36
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,180
Maybe not.

37
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:26,990
Maybe it was.

38
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:32,990
What happens if we remove this off of the SVG, XML while nothing.

39
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,370
So it goes to show you that you can try out different things.

40
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:43,070
But at the end of the day, the way that we decide to lay things out can vary heavily.

41
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:50,120
Initially, the way that I was solving this was by trying to create a custom open SVG, right.

42
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,580
A custom SPG, XML that was going to lay itself out.

43
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:58,210
But then I ended on having a section and a section and that kind of wrapped around the thing.

44
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,130
So at the end of the day, I don't really need this.

45
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:07,670
I can take this away and I can go down here and I can say that open is an example and my layout still

46
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,390
works perfectly.

47
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:13,280
And it goes to show you that sometimes you'll add properties that don't really make sense or aren't

48
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,360
really required.

49
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,650
And that's completely fine.

50
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,870
It's about testing and looking in the visual Ed..

51
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:18,850
What's going on?

52
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,150
So over here, you can see that we have a flex direction of rollover section.

53
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,240
And then inside of that, we have a.

54
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:34,000
Rating and then beside that, we have our view right here of our SGML, OK?

55
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,800
So what now, so we solve this?

56
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,020
Well, I want to add two more things.

57
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:45,980
What I want to add is I want to add the potential for the if it is closed temporarily.

58
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,200
So if it is closed temporarily.

59
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,290
What I want to add over here is this.

60
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,610
I want to say closed temporarily and I want to give it a color of red.

61
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:05,230
And then what I want to do beneath that is I want to add an image and that image right below this and

62
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:12,360
that image is going to be our icon over here, the icon of whether or not it's a bed and breakfast or

63
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,490
lodging or a restaurant or what it is.

64
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:21,209
Now, you can see that the spacing around these items is a bit all over the place.

65
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:28,390
And so a way to fix that would be, for instance, to say on the image padding left would be 16.

66
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:29,410
Right.

67
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,960
And that should kind of fix it.

68
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,910
Nor should it.

69
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,990
Oh, that kind of like doesn't do anything.

70
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,860
So what do we need to do here?

71
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:45,310
Well, we can put a view inside of here and kind of say, well, the style of this view is equal to

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,490
a padding left of 16.

73
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:52,390
And so we can take that and we can add it to our react native over here.

74
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,160
And does that do something, oh, yeah, that seems to do something.

75
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,740
So let's take that same view and let's put that over here.

76
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:04,880
And what we'll see here is that, oh, that adds a perfect amount of spacing on both sides.

77
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:05,200
Right.

78
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:10,650
So we're using an element to kind of create this fake space because the image was kind of overflowing

79
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:11,240
with the padding.

80
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:17,010
Now, we could have easily taken this and just said, well, instead of padding left, how about we

81
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,000
do margin left?

82
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,850
We could do that, too, right?

83
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,340
And that would work just as well.

84
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,560
This is now going to push off.

85
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:29,080
Now, the reason I'm showing you that I'm doing it in a view is this is a styling technique that I like

86
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,390
to use.

87
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,760
I like to use elements to push other elements aside.

88
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,830
I call it the concept of a spacer.

89
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:43,030
And so now that we have these two different techniques and we've basically built out the entirety of

90
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:48,820
our restaurant view because we're using all of the properties now, we've completed a feature.

91
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:54,310
First of all, I want to dig a bit deeper into the spacer concept and maybe clean up some of the code

92
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,560
because we still have some inline styles in here.

93
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,930
We still have some stuff going on that we could probably make a bit better.

94
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,180
So now that we've completed this full feature set over here, right.

95
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:08,020
We have this beautiful card layout that kind of showcases a restaurant.

96
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:12,680
Now, we can kind of go and do some reflection on what we've done so far.

97
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:13,750
Awesome.
