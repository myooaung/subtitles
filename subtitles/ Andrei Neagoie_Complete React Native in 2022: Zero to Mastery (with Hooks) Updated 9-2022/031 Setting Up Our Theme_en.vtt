00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:07.530
Setting up our theme, so this is going to be the crux of this part of the course right now we have

2
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:15.360
our components and we've used style components to achieve a form of consistency, a form of reasoning

3
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.590
about our styles and what components use those styles.

4
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.290
Now we want to set up a theme.

5
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.780
So what we're going to do is at the source folder level, we're going to create a new folder.

6
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.210
Now, you may have also seen that we have some warnings from Esslin that we haven't resolved yet.

7
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.100
And that's completely fine because we're currently building out all of the things that we need.

8
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.260
Once we finish a feature, a specific feature, we shouldn't have warnings anymore and we'll deal with

9
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.920
them as they come.

10
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.030
So we want to create a folder under source called Infrastructure, and we're calling it infrastructure

11
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.080
because a theme is part of the infrastructure of an app.

12
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.980
We're trying to reason about these things in a good way.

13
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.610
So we're going to create a folder inside of infrastructure and we're going to call it theme.

14
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.110
And inside a theme, we're going to create a couple of files, first of all, we're going to create

15
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:17.270
it next year and then we're going to create a size that, yes, we're also going to create colors.

16
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.170
Yes.

17
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.640
Well, colors remain.

18
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.430
We're going to have a speccing duchesse.

19
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.710
And we're going to have a fun start.

20
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.220
Yes.

21
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:42.150
And all of these files together holistically will form our theme now, first and foremost, we're going

22
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.410
to start with colors and all of these files that I'm putting together, we're going to be linking them

23
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.130
in the resources of the video so you can go copy paste this code from there.

24
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.990
So first and foremost, we're going to need our colors.

25
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.470
And the colors that we need are the colors that we would consider our brand colors.

26
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.400
So over here, you can see a colors object.

27
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:08.720
And in this colors object, we have the brand level, theming, primary, secondary muted.

28
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.310
We have the UI level colors, primary, secondary, tertiary, cautionary.

29
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.690
I can't say that word.

30
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.420
Oh, such a hard word anyways.

31
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.130
Disabled error and success.

32
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.080
And then below that we have our background colors, we have our text colors.

33
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.660
So we have all of our colors set up.

34
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.120
So let's go ahead and save that.

35
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.340
And then we're going to go to fonts and four fonts.

36
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.840
What we're going to set up here is we're going to set up, first of all.

37
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.240
We're going to set up the fonts that the app is going to use, so for the body, we're going to use

38
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.900
Oswald four hundred regular and we'll set that up later for the heading.

39
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.410
We're going to use LoDo and for Molyneaux Space, we're going to use Oswald.

40
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.300
These are all Google fonts that are freely available and will be installing them down the line, but

41
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.350
we're setting it up already.

42
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:05.430
So the fonts that our app is going to use, body heading and space, then we're going to set up the

43
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.120
font Waite's.

44
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.390
We're going to set up regular, medium and bold.

45
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.540
Well looks like for our app we're going to be using both.

46
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:22.430
For regular four hundred, which is the font that we're using, medium and bold is font weight, five

47
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.520
hundred and seven hundred, and then we go into font sizes.

48
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.760
And so for font sizes, we're using the pixel based ratios because we're working with style components.

49
00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.720
So for caption 12 pixels, 14 pixels, 16 pixels, title 20 pixels.

50
00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.490
Then we go up the chain all the way to each one.

51
00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.570
So we have a good amount of sizes available to us.

52
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:45.890
So our phones are set up here.

53
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.000
That is great.

54
00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.350
Now, what is going on specifically here?

55
00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.040
Is there an error in this file or what's going on?

56
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.240
And so.

57
00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:01.240
With that, OK, it seemed that there was a small speccing error in here, so then we go to sizes and

58
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.120
then we're going to talk about, well, what kind of size is small?

59
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:11.080
Well, when we talk about sizes, we're just talking about the sizes that are available to us, so eight

60
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.370
pixels, 16 pixel, 32 pixel, sixty four pixel and hundred twenty eight pixel.

61
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:22.110
So these are sizes that we can use to size various things, will just keep them around, it's useful

62
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.270
to have that consistency.

63
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.330
And then last but not least, we have spacing.

64
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.810
And for spacing, we're going to have both Lane Heights.

65
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.740
And we're going to have space, so these are spacing's that you can put in between things.

66
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:44.970
So we'll start at zero space four, eight, 16, 32, and so we increment for consistency sake.

67
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.660
And then in the index file, in the index file is where we're going to put our theme together.

68
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.680
So in the index file, what we need to do is we need to.

69
00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.630
We need to import the colors from the colors file over here.

70
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.000
We need to import the space in the line from the spacing file.

71
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.540
We need to import the sizes from the sizes file, and then we'll import the fonts.

72
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.380
The font waits in the font sizes from fonts.

73
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.680
And so we'll put our theme object together right here.

74
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.330
So we're exporting the theme that contains all of these objects.

75
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.280
And that's going to allow us to put together our theme in the theme provider that will be supplying

76
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.110
at the app level.

77
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:31.780
So with all of this and you can reach in the resources to go get all of these specific pieces and you

78
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:32.590
can play around with them.

79
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.470
You can play around what you want the font sizes to be.

80
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.840
You can play around with what you want your color palette to be.

81
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.470
I recommend playing around with the color palette if you want.

82
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.710
It's always a good idea to put together the colors and the color scheme that fits you.

83
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:52.780
OK, so now that we have our theme ready to go, what we need to do is now put it all together inside

84
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.430
of the app.

85
00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:04.450
So inside of the app is what we're going to do here is we're going to wrap our app with a theme provider,

86
00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:09.430
theme provider, and that is going to wrap the restaurant screen.

87
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.630
Right.

88
00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:15.970
And it's going to take a theme object that's going to be equal to theme.

89
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.980
Now, where is this all coming from?

90
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.530
Well, you're going to import theme provider.

91
00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.860
From styled components native.

92
00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:37.050
And you're going to import the theme import theme.

93
00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.130
From the source slash.

94
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:49.540
Infrastructure theme, and since there's an index file there, we should be good to go, and now we

95
00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:57.690
have our theme provider set up and this will allow us to basically utilize the theme in our app.

96
00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.230
So how do we do this?

97
00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:05.160
Well, if we go look at our colors, if we look at UI, the primary color is two six two six two six.

98
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:11.050
So if we go to features and then the restaurant info card and we said instead of red over here, well,

99
00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:17.440
what if we wanted props and we said props that theme that colors that.

100
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.370
Primary.

101
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:30.770
Now it says invalid color props supplied to stylesheet generated fallowed color props are the following.

102
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:32.770
Now, why is this the case?

103
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.890
First of all, let's wrap this.

104
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.720
And let's go look at what exactly is going on here.

105
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:51.260
So in our theme object that we're importing from source infrastructure theme, we have our colors object.

106
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.760
And in our colors object.

107
00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:59.040
Oh, it's on UI, so I'm referencing it wrong.

108
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:08.260
So if we go over here, it's props, colors, UI thought primary and that will give us the proper placing.

109
00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.570
So now you can see it's black.

110
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.870
But what if we chose error, well, then it should go back to red, right?

111
00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.410
So let's go try that out if we try out error.

112
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:21.500
What will happen here?

113
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:26.500
Well, now it's red, and if we try success, now it's green.

114
00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:29.650
And if we put it back the primary, now it's black.

115
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:35.240
So we have this ability to switch up our entire UI.

116
00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:40.080
Based on the theme that we just set up, that's amazing.
