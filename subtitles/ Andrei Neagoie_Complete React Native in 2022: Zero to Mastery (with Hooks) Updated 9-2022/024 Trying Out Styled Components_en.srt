1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,589
Where do we start?

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:07,740
Well, first of all, you can go ahead and try out the snack by XPO for reac freestyler components and

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,670
that will help you kind of understand what's going on.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,240
Now, the snack is already breaking and this is because it's out of date.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,660
So one of the dependencies that we need to add is styled components.

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,100
Native, and we'll give that a star.

7
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:32,229
And then once we do that, it still is feeling on styled components itself, so we need to add that

8
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:32,950
as well.

9
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,980
And down here will add the dependancy.

10
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,820
And right now, we can see that it is loading.

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:51,510
And if we change this to blue, it will change to blue, and so you can see over here that originally

12
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,130
we would go and import text, right?

13
00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:02,430
We would import text and then we would say, hey, text has a style where the color is blue.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,380
Right.

15
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,630
And then we would say, hello, world.

16
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:17,110
Text, OK, so you can see here this does the exact same thing, right, but style text has defined

17
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,090
its styles above.

18
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:25,660
So we could do something like name this title and then we could put title here and we would know that

19
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,880
title has these certain styles.

20
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:34,330
So we're separating the styles from the component and it does it in a very easy way so that we can kind

21
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:41,560
of decouple the styling and also give the styles a certain name at the component level rather than at

22
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,150
the stylesheet level where we have to do stylesheet create, then say, oh, this is the container or

23
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:50,620
this is the title, and then you would have a text component where you would have a style that title

24
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,580
and then you would not really know what this text is unless you go look at the style.

25
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:58,400
Well, now it's a first class citizen because it's become a component.

26
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,280
Now, you could very easily do this by defining a Capone and going down this whole rabbit hole.

27
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:08,979
But you can you see the power of styled components because we're able to use this syntax.

28
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:16,240
And the syntax is basically saying, hey, take styled and styled from styled native exposes all of

29
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,070
the components that Riak native exposes.

30
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:26,040
And with this syntax, this is called template string, template string is basically a way to have dynamic

31
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,570
strings.

32
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:33,120
But what we're basically doing here is we're seeing between this dynamic string, make the color blue

33
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:41,370
and we can kind of take what we were writing in here and write it as a more familiar style, write it

34
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,050
access.

35
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:49,290
So if we were to do background color instead of doing background color blue, right.

36
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,310
We could do that.

37
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,610
And that would also work.

38
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,380
First of all, I need to make sure that I need my title title.

39
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,830
We could do that.

40
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,920
That would still work.

41
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:04,410
But you could also now write it, asks if you wanted to so you could very easily copy paste your styles.

42
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,660
You could say this one is yellow.

43
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,510
Maybe that would work a bit better so that we could see both.

44
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,210
And so you can write your styles more dynamically.

45
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,340
If you're used to CSFs, you can write it this way.

46
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:18,660
But the original style intent from Riak native will also continue to work.

47
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:26,190
So you could do read the power of this is to be able to give meaning to the components that are being

48
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:26,850
styled.

49
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,380
OK, so now that we've tested this out, let's get into the installation.
