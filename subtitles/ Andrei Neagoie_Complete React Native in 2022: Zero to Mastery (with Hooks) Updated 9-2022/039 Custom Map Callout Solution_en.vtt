1
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:08.880
So for our map call component, in order for it to render out this version of what we want in the map

2
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.180
call out component, we could create an entire custom view.

3
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.920
Now I'm going to create a shared view called compact restaurant info, because at the end of the day,

4
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.500
what we want to achieve here is reusability.

5
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.150
And this is a component that we will end up reusing in the favors feature that we're going to build

6
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.630
later on.

7
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.100
So just think of it as if I was building all of the information in here.

8
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.080
And so compact restaurant info takes in restaurant as a parameter.

9
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.960
And with that, we can now import the.

10
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.940
Compact restaurant info.

11
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.710
And we're going to do it from thoughts, our thoughts, thoughts, components, restaurant.

12
00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:04.310
So in the core components, we're going to create a folder called Restaurant, and then inside of that

13
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.790
folder we're going to create a file called Compact.

14
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:17.330
Restaurant info, dot component dojos, and so this is going to be the component that is actually going

15
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.030
to contain the information that we want.

16
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.240
So we're going to import, react from react, and then we're going to do a bunch of different imports.

17
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.410
But first of all, let's let's export our compact image.

18
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:40.420
And what we're going to do inside of here is we're going to return a touchable opacity, so we're going

19
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.130
to make this a touchable component.

20
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.790
Well, actually, right now we don't need the touchable opacity.

21
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.910
So let's just focus on the raw, compact views that we need.

22
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:57.500
So let's import style from styled components native and let's create three components.

23
00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.640
So I want a compact image.

24
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:10.490
I want a compact image and a compact item, so these two elements are what's going to provide me with

25
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:20.060
the compact view now in our render function, what we want to do is we want to render out item and we

26
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.200
want to render out the compact image.

27
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.970
So we'll take compact image.

28
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:37.040
And then what else we'll need is we'll need to import text, so let's import text from Thout typography

29
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.970
text and so with text, what we're going to render out is the restaurant name.

30
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.550
So let's do that and for compact image, we're going to say that the source is equal to the U.

31
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.250
Or I of restaurant that photos zero.

32
00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:05.290
And so this will allow us to basically render out the entire compact item inside of the compact item

33
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.980
view area.

34
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.750
Now, inside of our map call out components, we have a error here, I believe.

35
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.930
No, this is not an error.

36
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:24.410
The air cannot be dismissed, so let's quickly restart XPO, sometimes that can happen and let's load

37
00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.500
the local meals to go and so unable to resolve all those components slashed restaurant.

38
00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:37.520
And then we, of course, we need to add compact restaurant info component and then we'll reload.

39
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.620
And so what we'll see on our restaurant screen here or our Matthew screen, rather, is when we click,

40
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.390
this will be able to see our contact info.

41
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.790
And if you're seeing an overlap, one clicking one of the markers, it is because you are not zoomed

42
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.770
in close enough to tap the ones that are close to each other.

43
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:07.270
So here we're seeing that we're able to click and see the information with the call out for the specific

44
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.050
restaurant.

45
00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.900
What is it looking like on Android, though?

46
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.829
So let's go look at Android if we go over to our map for you and we press on our composite image.

47
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.959
Well, it's not showing anything.

48
00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:25.810
And this has to do with another difference between Android and iOS.

49
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:33.490
Specifically with the map you call out, there is currently an issue where the initial render of the

50
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.620
image component inside of the map will not resolve the image correctly.

51
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.780
And so a way around this is to use the react native web view.

52
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:50.530
And so the Riak native Web view, if we go to Expo and we search for Westview is a.

53
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:58.030
Component that we can install by doing XPO, install, react native web view, it basically renders

54
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:05.430
a page, so to speak, like like if you were to go to a browser, it's rendering a Web page.

55
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:13.120
So we're going to render a Web page instead of an image component because that tends to work better

56
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.790
on Android and we're going to do it specifically for Android.

57
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.680
So let's go into our component code here.

58
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:26.440
And if we go into the terminal and we go to this one, we can do XPO install, react native web view.

59
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:33.480
And as we do that, what we'll do is we'll start building out the code that is required for this.

60
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.090
So we'll import what view from Riak native view.

61
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.070
That's the first thing we'll do.

62
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.060
And then we'll going to create a compact web view as well as a compact image, that's going to look

63
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.460
exactly the same, but it's going to wrap the web you.

64
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:56.740
And so inside of our component, we're going to do a quick check on platform, so let's import platform.

65
00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:04.570
From React native, and so what we can see over here outside of their end, their function is CONSED

66
00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:10.860
is Android and will do platform dot OS is equal to Android.

67
00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:16.960
And by doing this, what will be able to do inside of here is determine what the image will be.

68
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.010
Consed image is, is Android questionmark.

69
00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.530
So if we are Android, we'll take the compact Westview.

70
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.590
Otherwise, we'll take the compact image.

71
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:37.010
And with that, we'll be able to render out the correct image, so we'll use image over here.

72
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.620
And so now we're swapping between the wet view and the image for Android and iOS.

73
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.520
So let's quickly go over here and.

74
00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:54.160
Check what's rendering inside of the mafia of us, so if we go to iOS, it's still rendering out the

75
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.800
image and it's using the image itself.

76
00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:03.910
And on Android, what it should be doing is it should be rendering out the actual.

77
00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:09.510
Westview, so let's go over here and let's just quickly restart the app.

78
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.610
Because EXPL was crashing too many refreshers.

79
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:21.890
So if we start up XPO and then we go in to the app once it's ready to load.

80
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:30.120
We're going to see over here is that in our terminal, we won't we shouldn't have any issues.

81
00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:33.570
For The View.

82
00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:41.130
If we scroll all the way down to the bottom and now it's loading up San Francisco's restaurants and

83
00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:45.590
once those come in and so now that we're on the map, you and it's rendered out all of the markers,

84
00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:52.290
if we open out the call outs where you can see is that it's now properly rendering out the images for

85
00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:53.390
the different restaurants.

86
00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:56.190
And this is because it's rendering inside of the compact.

87
00:07:56.190 --> 00:08:03.600
Westview So it's important to note that certain packages in certain libraries may run into issues when

88
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.700
trying to render out the image.

89
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:09.570
And this may have been very well an issue you ran into as you were doing the implementation.

90
00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:18.000
It's important to note that these types of issues are not uncommon and can occur where something works

91
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.460
in iOS but doesn't quite work in Android.

92
00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:25.170
The same was true for the spacer component and now the same is true for the image component inside of

93
00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:28.220
the call, out of the mapu marker.

94
00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:35.429
So very strange issue, yet very important that we understand the differences and the limitations of

95
00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:38.159
certain libraries between the two platforms.

96
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:47.970
And so now we have a very similar user experience between both the actual Android map and the iOS map.

97
00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:55.470
In the next video, we'll look at how to put an unclick handler to make the restaurants go to their

98
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:57.450
subsequent detailed screen.
