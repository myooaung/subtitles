1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.830
Now that we have the full flow working from the context into the checkout screen.

2
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:12.430
The next logical step is to start building some UI and in order for us to do that, we need to figure

3
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.480
out what exactly we want to show.

4
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:22.270
So first of all, I want to handle some Aristide state if we do not have a cart or we do not have a

5
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:22.840
restaurant.

6
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.470
What are we going to show, right?

7
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:27.540
What are we going to show?

8
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.670
We don't have anything at all right now to showcase.

9
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.870
If I refresh the app here, while I'm not persisting, the cart might just yet, we haven't built that

10
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:39.750
functionality yet.

11
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.180
So if I go to checkout.

12
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:48.410
I'm not rendering anything, and so what I want us to build here is kind of like a screen that's going

13
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.630
to handle users not being able to see anything.

14
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.740
So we're going to do a safe area in that safe area.

15
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.310
We're going to have something called a cart icon content.

16
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.700
So we're going to start building out hypothetical components that that aren't there yet.

17
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.980
Right.

18
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.350
We're going to have some kind of cart icon container.

19
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.170
And then inside of that cart icon container, we're going to have the cart icon.

20
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:21.750
And that's going to take in an icon of cart off, so that's that's an icon that's going to showcase

21
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.810
like an empty cart of sorts.

22
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:32.350
And we're going to put in some text saying your cart is empty exclamation.

23
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.670
Now, the text isn't going to come from our typical text right here from Riak native, no, no, we're

24
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.160
going to get our text from our actual text component.

25
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.380
So the same way we implemented the safe area, we're going to go to component's.

26
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.560
We're going to go to typography text.

27
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:53.890
And pulling our tax component.

28
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.930
The same is true for our spacer because we're going to end up needing that down the line.

29
00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:59.900
So let's let's go ahead.

30
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.910
And just important right now.

31
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.610
It's always nice to have it here.

32
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:11.780
And so while icon and icon container are two things we don't quite have yet, so let's go ahead and

33
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.860
say import kaat icon, container and card icon.

34
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.590
But where are we importing them from?

35
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.950
We don't have anything yet.

36
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.820
Well, we're going to import them from a file called Thought Components, and we're going to create

37
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:33.000
a file called checkout dot style, and this file is going to contain these two components.

38
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.170
So if we go over here into components, we'll create a file called checkout dot styles.

39
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.580
And this is where we will be building out these two components.

40
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.250
So how do we build them out in that case?

41
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.570
Well, first of all, let's let's, first of all, export them.

42
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:51.230
Right.

43
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.580
So let's put them here.

44
00:02:53.270 --> 00:03:02.340
And first of all, let's just say that export const kaat icon and export consed write the card icon

45
00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.810
container.

46
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.420
Let's just quickly put them to null.

47
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:18.640
To enable the ability for us to expose them, let's import react from react and what we'll see here

48
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.710
is basically nothing at all.

49
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:29.380
Except we should be seeing right here the text, your card is empty, but we're returning null.

50
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.570
And this is the container.

51
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.000
So that's why we're not seeing anything, really.

52
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.130
OK, so what is this going to look like?

53
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.390
Well, our cart icon container is not going to come from react.

54
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:47.010
Rather, we're going to import style from styled components, slash native.

55
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.730
And then what we're going to do with style is we're going to build out a component here.

56
00:03:52.770 --> 00:04:01.380
We're going to say that our card I can't icon container is going to be a styled dot view and that's

57
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.710
going to have a particular style markup.

58
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.640
We're going to align items center.

59
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.830
And then what we're going to do is justify the content to the center.

60
00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.709
And we're going to say flex one.

61
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.590
And by doing that, we can see now your cart is empty and it's being sent.

62
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.800
OK, so now that we have that, what is our cart icon going to do?

63
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.010
That's a good question.

64
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.810
We're going to import something called Avatar.

65
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.280
From React native native paper.

66
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:43.840
And this is going to enable us to render out a icon, so what we're going to say is that the cart icon

67
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:51.250
is going to be styled of Avatar thought icon, and then we're going to give it particular attributes

68
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.280
that it's going to fulfill from the beginning.

69
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.930
If we go look at checkout here.

70
00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.710
Right.

71
00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.040
It's fulfilling the cart icon already.

72
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.620
It's a bit small, though.

73
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:08.370
So what we're going to say is that the size is going to be one twenty eight by default.

74
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.580
And there we go.

75
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.230
Just like that.

76
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.500
We've handled our cart empty state.

77
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.450
Right.

78
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.900
But this purple, this isn't our primary brand color.

79
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:25.360
So one more thing that I wanted to do over here is we can set the background color of this and we can

80
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.900
say that the background color should come from props and we can say props that background or and then

81
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.940
we'll say props start theme colors dot brand but primary.

82
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:46.440
And by doing this, we can either take it from the background property or from the colors, the colors,

83
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.730
the brand, the primer, and so right now it's set the blue.

84
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.240
So we're doing kind of a fallback here, a fallback scenario.

85
00:05:54.250 --> 00:06:00.700
We're saying either take the props background property or take props that female colors around the primary.

86
00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.190
Now, why do I need this background here?

87
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:09.550
Well, let's just say if I wanted to make this red, if I wanted to say do big red, now it's going

88
00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.520
to take this as the first I can make it yellow.

89
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:14.900
I could make it green.

90
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.720
I can make it all types of different colors.

91
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:23.090
And so the whole point here is that you have the ability to override the icon background color in a

92
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.210
nice way externally through the proper interface.

93
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.930
And so by doing this now, we've implemented the ability to handle the cart empty scenario.

94
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.150
But what about when we have items actually in our cart?

95
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.570
Well, right now we're not really handling that at all.

96
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.880
It kind of looks like a bunch of text on the screen.

97
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.330
So let's go take a look at how we can make that look a bit nicer.
