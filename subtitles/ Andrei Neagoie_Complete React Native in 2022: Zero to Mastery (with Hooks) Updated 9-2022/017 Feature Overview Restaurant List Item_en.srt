1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,540
All right, so we built our search of our feature, but next up is this amazing, amazing list for you

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:12,360
now, this list for you, this list of restaurants in our facility is something that we're going to

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,230
have to build out.

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:18,450
But first and foremost, what we have to do is we have to build out these individual items.

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:18,660
Right.

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:26,100
We have to build out this little card view that is over here and lay out all of the information as it

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:26,660
comes in.

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,020
So that's the first thing we're going to build out.

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,890
We're going to build out this visual.

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,320
And in order to do that, we're going to have to go step by step.

11
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:42,930
So first and foremost, we need to make sure that we have the right data in place and we have to determine,

12
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,110
hey, what all is going into this view?

13
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,160
Will we have the name?

14
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,600
We have the reading.

15
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:54,940
We have the address we have, whether it's open or not, we have a picture.

16
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,580
OK, so all of that are the things that we're going to build out.

17
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:04,920
We're not necessarily going to focus yet on the little favorite icon here.

18
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,990
We don't have that feature just yet.

19
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,980
And we also have whether a restaurant is what type it is.

20
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,820
So we have the type as well.

21
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:20,520
If it's a diner or if it's something else, we have this little icon to distinguish whether it's a cafe

22
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,330
or a restaurant.

23
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,380
So that's good.

24
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,280
OK, so let's go and see how we determine that shape.

25
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,720
Now that we've seen what it looks like, we can go ahead and start building it out.
