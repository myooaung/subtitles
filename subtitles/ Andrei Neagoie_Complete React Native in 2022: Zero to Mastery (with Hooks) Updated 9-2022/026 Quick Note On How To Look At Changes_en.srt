1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,830
A quick note on what you'll be seeing throughout the course, throughout the course will be linking

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,390
both the branch where the changes are happening.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:16,740
So you'll be able to take the code that is written in that shape, write the specific check point in

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:23,400
time, as we explained before, where we've added this specific step, but also will be linking the

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,160
changes that have happened between every checkpoint.

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,640
So if you're following along and you're seeing the code as the videos moves along, we've created this

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,880
nice visualization, these checkpoints, so to speak, where you can see, hey, this is the code that

8
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,920
was written in that specific video, and this is the code that was there before that specific video.

9
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,250
Now, you don't have to be making these checkpoints yourselves.

10
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,330
Don't worry about that.

11
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:55,650
But these checkpoints show you where the previous video left off and where the next video landed in

12
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,240
terms of changes.

13
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,500
And so if you're having a difficulty finding the template strings, you could, for instance, come

14
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:09,090
here and you could copy paste what is in here and kind of get an idea of why your syntax may be failing

15
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:09,840
or whatnot.

16
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,220
So don't get frustrated.

17
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,400
Just look in the resources folder and you can see the code that I wrote in order to help you out.

18
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:24,270
Also, something to keep in mind when you look at these changes is that there may be changes to files

19
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,410
like the lock file where you're seeing all of this gibberish.

20
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,770
Don't worry about this file.

21
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,280
Don't worry about the files where you don't understand what exactly is happening.

22
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:42,300
This file is generated by the yarn commands that we're running and it keeps track of the resources that

23
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,260
are being added.

24
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,050
So we don't pay attention to this yarn log file.

25
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,050
We need to pay attention to the code that has been written.

26
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,160
So when you're looking at this screen and you don't understand what's going on down here, don't get

27
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,690
flustered.

28
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,070
This is not something in our control.

29
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:01,140
But this code right here and this package, JSON file, this is in our control.

30
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:05,010
So sometimes you'll see changes in here that you may not quite understand.

31
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,680
But don't worry, it's just for reference.

32
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:11,280
Usually you can just check out the code and run it that way if you need to.

33
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,740
Also, as you're going through these resources that we link, you may notice that we have a number in

34
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,270
each of these checkpoints.

35
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:24,210
Don't pay attention specifically to the number, because these may not be consistent throughout the

36
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,140
course, but rather follow the resource link to the specific checkpoint.

37
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,280
And that will always be correct.

38
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,200
But don't use the number as a reference.
