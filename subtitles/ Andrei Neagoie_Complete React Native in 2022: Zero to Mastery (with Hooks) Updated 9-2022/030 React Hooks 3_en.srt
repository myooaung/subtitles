1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:09,010
All right, let's convert our robo friends app from using classes to using hooks and learn about what

2
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:09,760
the differences are.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,460
So the very first thing I want to do is, well, clone this repository.

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:23,500
So we'll use our robo friends example and I'll just say get clone and grab this repository from GitHub

5
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,540
or you can use your existing project.

6
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,320
Now, I'm going to go into the Robo Friends Directory.

7
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:37,700
And the very first thing I always want to do when I clone a repository is obviously npm install.

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,670
So let's round that to install all of our dependencies.

9
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:52,060
All right, NPM install worked now one of the things that will happen, and this is something we've

10
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:59,500
already talked about, is that whenever you're revisiting an old project or grabbing a project from

11
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:05,260
GitHub that has been around for a while, is that while you'll get a lot of vulnerabilities because

12
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,810
libraries haven't been updated.

13
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:14,890
So the first two commands that I always like to do after NPM install is NPM update to update my libraries.

14
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:25,280
All right, only one low severity vulnerability after the NPM update, and sometimes I also like to

15
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:33,370
run NPM Audit Fix just to make sure that we're not missing anything and looks like we're good to go.

16
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:38,750
You see here that there is one vulnerability that requires manual review, so we'll have to manually

17
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,830
update those.

18
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:42,110
But for now, I think everything's good.

19
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:45,260
Everything's up to date so we can start using hooks.

20
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:49,520
Now, the very first thing I want to do is to make sure that we can use this new feature.

21
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:53,240
Remember that Hooks came with React sixteen point eight.

22
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,100
So let's go check to see that we have a react sixteen point eight or higher.

23
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,530
So I'm going to open.

24
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:09,190
Visual studio code and I know shocker, up until now, I've loved Sublime Tax, but it looks like a

25
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:15,290
lot of people like Visual Studio Code, so I have to conform to what everybody else is doing just so

26
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,590
that you get to see a different editor as well.

27
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,250
All right.

28
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:24,250
So we have our terminal here to the right and then we have our robo friends app.

29
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,370
If we take a look at package DOT, Jason, let's see over here what version we have.

30
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:35,200
We see that we have sixteen point thirteen, so higher than sixteen point eight.

31
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,510
So we should be able to use Hooke's.

32
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,350
Awesome.

33
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:43,810
The very last thing before we move on to the next video and finally introduce you to Hooke's, because

34
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,700
I've talked to a lot about them and you still have no idea what they are.

35
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,360
Let's just do npm start to make sure that everything still works.

36
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,810
We've updated our packages.

37
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,790
We want to make sure that things are still working.

38
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,480
So ampm start.

39
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:57,940
Hopefully we get no errors.

40
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:07,890
All right, looks like things are loading up on the console, there's no air and I can search my robot

41
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:12,840
friends and again, things are working awesome.

42
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:15,090
All right, time for hugs.

43
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,420
I know.

44
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:15,750
I know.

45
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,020
I keep building the suspense, but I promise.

46
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:22,370
Next video, we're going to find out what folks are seeing that one by.
