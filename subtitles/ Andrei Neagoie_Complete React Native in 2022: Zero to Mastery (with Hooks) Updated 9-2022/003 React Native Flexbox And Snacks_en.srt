1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:08,400
Now comes a pivotal question here, you thinking, Mo, if this yoga web thing can make me lay out everything

2
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,740
and teach me how to put things in the proper position, why don't I just use that to build the whole

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:14,220
UI?

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,840
Theoretically, you could it's not as pleasant an experience to play around in the playground and build

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:27,610
complex UI, but understanding how these properties right direction alignment and justifying content

6
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:34,510
and all the stuff, understanding how it will work will help you understand how to layout things.

7
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:34,810
Right.

8
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:42,760
Because in Riak native, laying out with box is all about understanding kind of how Fleck's works.

9
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:50,320
And once things are in the right space, they will typically be in the right space across multiple phones.

10
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:55,030
Now, this doesn't mean that you won't maybe have to do adjustments for Android versus iOS or for a

11
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,020
specific screen size.

12
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:00,040
These things do tend to happen and we'll get into that as we build out the course.

13
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:07,270
But what's important to know here is all of these first principles in React Native, they have a place

14
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,500
and they have documentation.

15
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:15,280
Often times developers will come from the WebSphere and they will treat liying out inflects box the

16
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,740
same way they treat access.

17
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,450
But it isn't the same.

18
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,770
It is the same with a few exceptions.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,880
Now, if you have never written CSFs, you don't know what is.

20
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,750
I highly recommend you take our react course as well.

21
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:34,270
But what we need to understand here is Riak native, although it says react in the name.

22
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,800
And if you've heard of react, it behaves a bit differently.

23
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,640
Now we're targeting mobile phones, right?

24
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,590
So at the end of the day, what we need to know here is that.

25
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:52,430
REAC Netiv is targeting Android and iOS and the way that we're going to lay out what Fleck's is determining

26
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:55,230
how we're going to fill the area that we have available.

27
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,070
And so if we go to the Riak native dock's for Xbox.

28
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:07,780
What we'll see here is a high level documentation of how Fleck's interacts, not only that, how every

29
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,150
property works.

30
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:15,190
So if you really apply yourself to this material and dig deep and try to understand how all of these

31
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:21,070
things work, I promise you you will master react native like no one else.

32
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:27,400
Now, the awesome, awesome, awesome thing about the Riak native DOCSIS, whenever you go look up a

33
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:33,910
principle, whether it be Fleck's box or a specific element, they have revealed their documentation

34
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:41,760
with Grade A material as well as Snax directly embedded into the docks.

35
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,320
You see this over here.

36
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,050
This is code.

37
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,400
You see this over here.

38
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:52,390
It's being rendered in the UI and you can go so far as to run it on your own device if you wanted to,

39
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,790
and play around with the properties here and regenerate this QR code and try things out for yourself.

40
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:58,930
It's amazing.

41
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,660
We can take all of these first principles that we're looking at and we can literally practice them until

42
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,810
our face turns blue.

43
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,180
Now, don't do that.

44
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:14,590
But I'm just saying, like the ability for the cross pollination between documentation and live examples

45
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:20,160
with something as complex as mobile development is absolutely astonishing.

46
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,220
And so they have examples for all different types of things.

47
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:28,990
The first principles, how to do, call them, reverse what the layout direction means, what justifying

48
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,780
the content does and all that good stuff.

49
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,080
Right.

50
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,570
You see these three blocks here with the space in between.

51
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,470
Absolutely.

52
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,610
Mind boggling, isn't it?

53
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,970
But you can do that all with Flex and with very basic properties.

54
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:45,820
And so by understanding this, we're going to start understanding how to layer UI like a cake, a delicious

55
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,500
cake at that.

56
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:55,870
And so what I want to point out here is that Riak native documentation is absolutely amazing and you

57
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,780
should always reach to it to learn first principles.

58
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:05,290
And we will continue to reach out to it throughout the course to solidify our knowledge, but also look

59
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:09,490
at how properties work, because we don't just want to leave you with a beautiful app.

60
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:13,570
We want to leave you with a beautiful foundation of knowledge that's going to help you throughout your

61
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:13,990
career.
