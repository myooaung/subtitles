1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:05,400
Now, before we get into the nitty gritty of the second feature that we're going to build, one of the

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:13,110
things that I want to point out is that we've kind of been using sizing all over the place with different

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:13,860
types of numbers.

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:19,430
Right here we have 25, then we have margin 10, we have size 50.

5
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:26,240
We don't really have a consistent basis here and these magic numbers, they won't scale as your code

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,500
base scales just in general.

7
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:34,130
Now I know that this is just a code along and that a lot of these things may seem.

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,600
A bit over the top in terms of structure, or you may not do it this way, and that's completely fine,

9
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:45,340
but what I like to do is on top of a coloured utility.

10
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:54,850
Usually I'll have a Size's utility where I'll just grab kind of the most general sizes that are used,

11
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:02,530
right, whether it be font sizes, based sizes, and you can go ahead and export konst font sizes.

12
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:11,610
And we kind of use that as an object, and then I'll have expert cost spacing and I'll have that as

13
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,210
an object.

14
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:21,450
And what those basically will be for is kind of to do spacing parameters like so.

15
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:32,820
And I'll do similar for the font sizes, and that way we can consistently use parameters like font size

16
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,740
is that small medium large x large.

17
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,830
And so there's semantic meaning that we're adding here.

18
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:44,490
And if we go look at, for instance, our focus object, one of the things that we could do here is

19
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,580
we could import spacing.

20
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:57,860
From and then we'll do dot dot slash utils sizes, and what we can do then is we can, for instance,

21
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:05,550
say spacing dot small and oh, that moved over to pixels because sizing small eight.

22
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,419
And over here we can say spacing dot.

23
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:11,590
Large.

24
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,390
And let's go look at what that is, and our large is 24.

25
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:24,080
So it's off by one, but they kind of increment in times eight likes or eight, 16, 24, it's always

26
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,710
plus eight.

27
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,060
So it's consistent.

28
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,040
And by doing this, we now add semantic meaning.

29
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:36,050
Now, if we wanted to do kind of the sizing over here, we'd probably be looking at an XXL or even an

30
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,190
XL.

31
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:44,180
But for the button, I'm OK to leave it like this as a 50 because it's inside of the render cycle.

32
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,010
So we're saying, Hey, this this button here that's being run out, just give it 50.

33
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,630
But for the styles, I like to be consistent and use the semantic meaning of sizes.

34
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:54,200
Yes.

35
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:00,650
So that's just, you know, a little insight in how to clean up some of the magic numbers that we throw

36
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:01,520
around here and there.
