00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:08.640
So moving around infrastructure is kind of tedious, I will admit, but cleaning up your code is part

2
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.020
of the process of getting a better and better code, base and end product in the end.

3
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:20.940
And structuring your app for scale is where you have to make decisions like this, because refactoring

4
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.920
is inherently a part of removing technical debt and it's a skill that you need to get good at.

5
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:35.640
Leaving everything in place just makes things more difficult in the long run for extensibility, maintenance

6
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.620
and all those things.

7
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.890
So I have a philosophy that's Marie Kondo, your code base.

8
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.540
Make sure that you always put things in the proper place.

9
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.830
And that also means that we need to restructure things at times.

10
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:54.360
Now, the way that I went about restructuring my code is I created an index in the navigation infrastructure

11
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.940
folder and I created a wrapper called navigation.

12
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.080
I did this because I feel like navigation is this holistic concept that may have different decisions

13
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:04.890
that need to be made.

14
00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:09.090
Right now we have a Tab Navigator that is our core app navigator.

15
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.280
But at some point we may want to, based on certain decisions through a different navigation model when

16
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.970
the app boots up or and then show the tab navigation once you go through that, for instance, for authentication

17
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.030
purposes or other purposes.

18
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.070
So it's important to leave yourself open with the ability to extend.

19
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.970
So the App Navigator is the main navigator that we work with.

20
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.670
And here what I did is I basically just moved over all of our imports, renamed some of the imports

21
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.630
and left everything intact, as is.

22
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.770
And in the App Store, you'll see that now it's just rendering navigation.

23
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.370
So the main purpose of me restructuring the code in this way is that when we look at this tree, what

24
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.590
we want to achieve is a quick overview.

25
00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.810
When you go to the index file of your app, when you go to the index file of any app, you want to have

26
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.440
a quick overview of what's going on and where can I look deeper.

27
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.690
And so here we're achieving that.

28
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.740
We know that, hey, we have a theme provider, so we're providing a theme to the entire app.

29
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.990
We have a location context provider.

30
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.440
So somewhere in the app location is an important concept.

31
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.560
And then we're wrapping the entirety of the app with the restaurant context, because at the end of

32
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.150
the day, it is a restaurant app.

33
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.780
And so we're trying to allow every aspect of the application to have access to those restaurants.

34
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:39.660
Right now, the only aspects of the app are the TAB navigation, which needs access to the entire restaurant

35
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.390
context provider.

36
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.820
Now, if we extend the app with multiple functionalities and multiple functionalities, we may take

37
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:52.110
this restaurant context provider and put it deeper nested inside of navigation in order to achieve a

38
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.920
better access point for restaurant context.

39
00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.020
And this is because while maybe at a certain point the whole app doesn't need access to the restaurant

40
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.670
complex and maybe at a certain point it doesn't need access to the location, it's one of those things

41
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:06.960
where you have to play around with it.

42
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.990
But right now, our app is in a state where the whole app requires both of these contexts.

43
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.900
So it makes sense, make the right decisions for the right point at the right scale.

44
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.990
OK, so with that being said, we have our navigation here.

45
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:30.570
And what we need to do now is we need to create a specific navigator for our restaurant screen.

46
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.520
So let's go look at how we'll do that.
