1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:09,660
In this video, we're going to focus on adding a text input to input what we want to focus on because,

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,920
you know, having text focus feature really doesn't do much for us.

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,750
So let's go ahead and remove that.

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,890
And let's start focusing on what exactly we want.

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:30,480
So if we want a text input, text input is something that we're going to take from a library called

6
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,240
React Native Paper.

7
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,290
So we're going to take this.

8
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:40,170
We're going to say text input and we're going to say from React native paper.

9
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:46,190
Now you may be thinking, Mo, what is React native paper?

10
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:51,230
Well, React Native paper is a library that gives us.

11
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:58,940
A bunch of components out of the box, and so like if we go ahead and we say, Hey, let's go look at

12
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,960
React native paper.

13
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:07,200
It's a cross-platform material design for React Native, so it gives you a punch, a punch, a punch,

14
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,490
it components out of the box that you can use to build mobile apps.

15
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:12,990
And.

16
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:23,220
Create you guys that fit the eye of people using them, because we want to enable you to build components

17
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:30,060
that match what you want and what the user expects from mobile apps.

18
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:38,250
So for 11 to is the latest release now, if we go look over here in our snack, we can see that, hey,

19
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,170
do we actually have react native paper?

20
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:47,760
So we go, look at our packages and oh, it looks like it was already added as a dependency, but the

21
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,510
dependency is set.

22
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:53,250
The four point nine point two and four point eleven point two is the newest.

23
00:01:53,790 --> 00:02:01,590
So what we can do here is we can simply update this and Expo will go and install the latest version

24
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,760
out of the box.

25
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,220
Now if we go back over here.

26
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:13,940
Inside of React native paper, what we can see is that if we go and look for text input.

27
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:22,240
It will show us what a text input will look like on top of that, it will show us how to use text input.

28
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,120
Do we add a label?

29
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,200
Do we add a value?

30
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,130
How do we add on change text?

31
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,430
It'll show us what props are all available.

32
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,630
It kind of is the general overview of how you can use this component.

33
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:43,970
And so if we go to our snack and we say, Hey, I have a text input and let me give it the label focus

34
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:44,960
item.

35
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:52,520
Let's say that we set that as the focus item, and we quickly switch her device here and we tap to play,

36
00:02:53,330 --> 00:03:01,850
then what we'll see is the text input come in with a focus item as the label.

37
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,210
So we're quickly opening our project and here we go.

38
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,260
Focus item.

39
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,620
And when we click on it, it pops up, so the label pops up.

40
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:18,850
Now, if we don't add a label at all, then we'll see that it will render just the same, but it won't

41
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:19,570
prompt us.

42
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,080
Right?

43
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:28,600
So what we can see here is instead of focus item, we can say, what would you like to focus on?

44
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,470
Question mark.

45
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,790
We can put it in a sentence.

46
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,040
And then when we tap it, boom.

47
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,390
What would you like to focus on?

48
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,190
A little nice to have.

49
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:40,990
Now the placement of this is very key.

50
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,550
Right now, it's kind of in the middle.

51
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:55,440
So let's take our time to create the correct layout for our input, so let's put input container and

52
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,660
let's create it as Flex one.

53
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,710
And let's add some padding padding.

54
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,630
Let's do 50 and we'll say Justified Content Center.

55
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:09,740
Center.

56
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:15,660
And now if we go here, let's wrap our text input would have you.

57
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:29,940
And let's wrap it if we go, and what we'll see here is a few style is equal to styles thought input

58
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,450
container.

59
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:32,210
There we go.

60
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,160
Now we'll see what happens.

61
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,950
Oh, looks like I missed a comma here.

62
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:42,860
So by adding that there we go, Oh, this is going all the way to the bottom.

63
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,690
Why is that the case?

64
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,310
Well, this container has Flex one and this container has Flex one.

65
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,860
So this is now centering along the screen.

66
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:56,150
So if we say zero point five, let's give it half of the screen.

67
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:02,480
What we'll see is that, OK, now it's actually taken up half of the screen and it's centered itself

68
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,010
within that.

69
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:08,630
So now let's just say justified content top.

70
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,950
And that looks good.

71
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,130
But let's adjust our panning a bit.

72
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,190
Let's make our focus and put a bit nicer.

73
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:20,480
And then when we click on it, it asks us, what would you like to focus on?

74
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,970
And now if I input something in here?

75
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:24,710
Right.

76
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,020
You can see that it's filling itself in.

77
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,310
Now we need to store that input.

78
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:33,690
So let's look at that.
