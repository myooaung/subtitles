1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,280
Hopefully with that example, it all went pretty smoothly for you, but now let's take a look at how

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,380
we can implement this.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,420
So the first thing we need to do is we need to import camera from XPO camera.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,210
And this is going to allow us to utilize the camera functionality.

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:21,300
Now, let's open up and let's do a return function where inside of a return function we're going to

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,590
implement the camera.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,490
And this camera screen is what's going to show to the user.

8
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,970
We're going to give it a particular style.

9
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:35,480
We're going to give it width of one hundred percent, height of 100 percent, so we can already see

10
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,720
here that we're going to need a custom component.

11
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:46,460
So let's go ahead and import styled from styled components native.

12
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:57,610
And what we'll do is we'll say CONSED profile camera is equal to styled camera and we'll put in our

13
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:03,350
width of one hundred percent and height of one hundred percent.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,390
And by doing this now, we can actually use profile camera.

15
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,790
No more inline styles over here.

16
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,460
And let's close off profile camera.

17
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,600
Now, another thing that we need to do is you could technically decide to have a pivot between the front

18
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,460
and back camera for this particular feature, I've decided solely to use the front camera since it's

19
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,830
supposed to be a profile picture, a selfie seemed most appropriate.

20
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,000
Now, the way that we do that is we give the camera a type.

21
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,880
And so that type is type of camera that constants, but type that front.

22
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,770
And this is going to set the camera to always be the front camera.

23
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,510
Now, we're also going to give this a ref, so we're going to import use ref from.

24
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:51,070
React and we'll say consed camera ref.

25
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,600
Is equal to use ref of.

26
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:06,350
Inside of here will say Raif is equal to and will open the Brace's will declare a function of our and

27
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:17,000
we'll see over here that camera ref dot current is equal to R so that we can always know that we could

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,520
also just call this camera to make it more declarative.

29
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:27,620
And so now we know that camera ref is always going to reference the component over here.

30
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,810
OK, so having done this, what can we see in our app right now?

31
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:34,910
Can we see anything?

32
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,170
Well, let's go take a look.

33
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:46,150
And if we open up our settings and we go to hear what we can see is that, oh, it's not rendering out

34
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,630
on our simulator, of course not.

35
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:55,110
Our simulator does not have the ability to render out the camera module.

36
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,820
So let's go ahead and do this on the phone.

37
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:04,030
And so over here on the right hand side, you can now see my phone and if we go over to our profile

38
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:09,590
page and we tap the icon, huh, the camera's still rendering black.

39
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:10,770
Why is that?

40
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,810
What we haven't requested any permissions of the user.

41
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:21,790
So over here, if we go over to the permissions section, we can see that they're using, in effect,

42
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,410
to determine if the user has permission.

43
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,370
So let's copy this line.

44
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,410
Let's import use state.

45
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:38,860
And what we'll do is we'll above the use ref has permission set, set permission and we'll copy the

46
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,500
effect.

47
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,680
So we'll also import use effect.

48
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:46,850
And by doing that now, we can put this over here and.

49
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,540
Permissions are needed, huh?

50
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,580
We're getting our permissions, so if you press allow.

51
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:55,590
What's going to happen now?

52
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:02,910
Well, let us quickly reload the app, because it's probably in a faulty state and then what we'll do

53
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:10,020
is we'll go back to the settings, we'll go over here and, oh, the camera's working because we've

54
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,540
set our permission.

55
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:18,170
Now, of course, this only works if our permission has been set now.

56
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:23,700
So we also need to take into account, if you do not have a permission, if the permission is false,

57
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,480
we need to take those states into account.

58
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:31,490
So down here, we're going to have this where we render an empty view.

59
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,670
Now, what we can do is we can import view from react native.

60
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,510
Import view.

61
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,470
From React Native, and we'll just.

62
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:50,160
Render an empty view in the meanwhile and for text, well, we know that we can import text from our

63
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:57,740
components, so we'll import text from dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, slash components, slash

64
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,820
typography, slash text.

65
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:06,830
And so now if we do not grant permission, we also let the user know, hey, you do not have access

66
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,600
to the camera.

67
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,010
So we have a little bit of air handling in here.

68
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:16,520
And so with that, we now have the full flow working for our application because we can render out the

69
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,060
camera and we can take a picture just yet.

70
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,960
But what we can do is we can see ourselves.

71
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:29,150
So now that we have that set up and we have the permissions set up and we have the first part of our

72
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:33,710
solution, let's take a look at how we can take a picture, store the image.
