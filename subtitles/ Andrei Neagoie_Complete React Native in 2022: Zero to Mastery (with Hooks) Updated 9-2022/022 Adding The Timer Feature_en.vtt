00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:06.880
Now that we have our actual countdown component that we just imported, if we go back to what we're

2
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:07.780
building right now.

3
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:18.030
We kind of want to implement the same type of visualization over here when we add a focus item and we

4
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.840
flip over.

5
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.280
Well, right now we're flipping over to.

6
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:31.210
I'm going to render a timer for the subject at this point, we should actually be building our timer

7
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.810
component.

8
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.600
Now what exactly does that look like?

9
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:41.980
Well, if we look at our source code here, right over here, we have a view with some text and that's

10
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.660
kind of where we want to put our timer component.

11
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.680
So what we'll do over here is we'll create a timer component.

12
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.860
This timer component is going to be what gets us to the timer.

13
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:04.989
Overview We'll give it a focus subject, and that's going to be the current subject, the one that we

14
00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:12.670
just decided on over here in this view and the focus object being the thing that we're counting down

15
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.400
upon, the thing that we're going to Pomodoro style time.

16
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.340
You know, I'm working on a task like writing a doc, and I'm setting the timer to ten minutes for ten

17
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.110
minutes is purely focused on that.

18
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.690
We also want to say on timer end, we want to tell it what to do when it ends.

19
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:38.660
And we need a clear subject, which is going to tell us how to clear the subject.

20
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.000
These functions, we're going to leave empty for now, but we're just kind of getting through the flow

21
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.620
of like, Hey, what is my component here actually need to function?

22
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.840
What does the parent need to tell it?

23
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.360
And what do I need to supply it?

24
00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:02.460
So now that we know all of that, the next thing we need to do is over here in features, add a timer

25
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.830
dot jazz component.

26
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:13.040
So we'll do import react from react and then we'll do import view and text.

27
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.630
From React Native.

28
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.430
And will say export concert timer.

29
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:23.660
Is equal to.

30
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.160
And then what we'll do in here is we'll set of you.

31
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:30.540
Close the view.

32
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.780
And we'll set some text.

33
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.640
I will say focus.

34
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.230
Feature.

35
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.690
And that's what we're going to do now.

36
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:53.220
Over here, we clearly added some properties to pass into it over here in the app, so we have the focus

37
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.980
object, the on timer and the clear subject.

38
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.390
So let's pass those in.

39
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.490
So we go over back to here and we can say focus object.

40
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.130
Now we've given this a property, the other ones, we really haven't.

41
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.870
Let's render this out together, and let's make sure that that currently works.

42
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.080
So if we say test, we can say.

43
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.050
Plus, Belle cannot find variable timer.

44
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.840
Oh, of course, I need to import it over here, so let me go and import timer.

45
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.590
From false lash source components.

46
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.000
Over here, timer.

47
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.260
There we go.

48
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.080
Now, if I go back here and I say Test.

49
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.990
Plus, focus feature test in our focus feature, our timer is ready to be built.

50
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.060
So let's take a look at how that's going to go.
