1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,630
The moment is upon us.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,700
We're about to code and I'm going to give you your very, very first exercise.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:13,950
Now, this exercise may seem simple from the get go, but what we're trying to do here is set up the

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:20,790
layout for our restaurant list components.

5
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,230
So we're building our very first feature.

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:28,350
And the very first feature is we're going to build a restaurant list and it's going to have the ability

7
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:34,770
to search for a specific location and then load the restaurants in that location.

8
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,860
Now, before we get ahead of ourselves, we need to first go back to first principles.

9
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:46,800
How do we render out the spacing for the search and the spacing for the list?

10
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:53,430
Now, keep in mind, this will change as we go along and shift and change and as we play around with

11
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,270
properties.

12
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,510
But for our first exercise, what I want you to do is I want you to render two views, a search for

13
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,530
you with a green background and a list view with a blue background.

14
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,870
And I want you to space them apart.

15
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,900
And as you can see, it's a little hint here.

16
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,190
There seems to be a little bit of spacing around searching around list.

17
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,400
Could that be padding?

18
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:22,940
And another thing to notice here is that there's white at the top and white at the bottom.

19
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,190
So it's like we're avoiding.

20
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:34,620
The parts of the screen that the user still has to interact with in order to do things interesting,

21
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:35,580
so.

22
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:43,830
Another tip here, could that be something called safe area of you, who knows, take away from this

23
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:51,060
exercise that we need to go look at the docks of safe area of you and we need to position two views

24
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,300
with text that look exactly like this.

25
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,540
And in the next video, I'll show you how I solved it.

26
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:03,930
Now, again, it's not to say that you can't build the user interface in different ways with different

27
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,520
properties and different spacing.

28
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:11,760
I fully applaud you in taking whatever we build here and giving it your own flair.

29
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:18,380
But I'm going to show you the way that I'm going to build the UI and the properties that I will apply.

30
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,210
And in the end, we'll have a great product.

31
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:28,680
And you may have slightly differing styling and that's completely OK as long as it works on all the

32
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,730
phones you're testing on.

33
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,360
But for now, we're going to try to focus on first principles.

34
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,340
So let's try to get this output going.

35
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:35,610
All right.
