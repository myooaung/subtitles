1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,620
I know what you're thinking.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,010
Mo, cut all of the fluff and just get to the point.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:07,200
How do I upgrade?

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,640
What do I need to do?

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,380
Well, let's get straight into it.

6
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:16,550
Over here, I have the meals to go running as it is today.

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,600
If you want to run the same exact version, I'm running.

8
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:27,090
I am running a specific branch called full with mock and polish.

9
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:33,680
Now, if you go to our GitHub link and you go to the meals to go, then what you'll see over here on

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:41,060
the main page is I have a branch full mark with Polish and you can just grab this branch install and

11
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:41,780
you're good to go.

12
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:48,800
You have to fill in some of the information around your specific setup with Firebase.

13
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,860
But other than that, you can get going now.

14
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,920
You have to have finished the course in order to get to this point.

15
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,780
So make sure you've finished the course.

16
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,980
And then from there, what we're going to need is expo.

17
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:08,540
Now, if you've done the course as of today, you should have this and stop if you're coming back to

18
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,430
the course from a longer period of time.

19
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:14,840
You know, just make sure you have it installed globally and you can do that by npm.

20
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,620
Install Xposed Houli Global, right minus G.

21
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,730
We've been through this.

22
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:26,810
Once we have that, what we need to do is we need to go over to our Seelye over here.

23
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:38,280
And what we'll do is I'll just open a new window and so we'll go to projects meals to go and what we

24
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,210
need to do here.

25
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,760
And before we get to this, what we need, especially global.

26
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,060
Don't forget that because otherwise your command will fail.

27
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,390
All we need to fill in here is expo.

28
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:59,420
Upgrade and what this is going to do is it's going to say, Hey, oh, my working branch is dirty,

29
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,160
that means I currently already have changes.

30
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,330
Huh?

31
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:03,840
OK.

32
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,100
Would you like to proceed?

33
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:05,730
No.

34
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,440
So let's see what I have here.

35
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,470
Oh, I edited my app that ships with my personal information for my meals to go up.

36
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,550
So let me go over here.

37
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,230
Let me kill the app real quick.

38
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,460
Let's make sure we don't have the app running while we go through an upgrade that would be, you know,

39
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,030
dangerous.

40
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:27,160
Now that we have our branch in a good state, it's as simple as typing an export upgrade, and it'll

41
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,230
take you through the prompts to actually upgrade.

42
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:33,490
So what is it asking us saying you're currently running a sticky version 40?

43
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,730
Would you like to update to 43?

44
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:41,260
And of course, we're going to say yes, and then it's going to install Expo 43 as the first package.

45
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,790
And what it's subsequently going to do is it's going to go through the packages that are also installed

46
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:52,390
and it's going to update the packages to the compatible versions where it knows that there are expo

47
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,270
packages installed in your repository.

48
00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:02,200
So any package that is expo compatible is also automatically upgraded to the latest version.

49
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,430
How cool is that?

50
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:09,580
How simple is that they make it so easy for you to keep everything up to date and then they'll tell

51
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:16,120
you, OK, we updated the following packages so async storage is up to date safe area context reanimated

52
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,860
the gesture handler, the status bar, the SVG, you know, Lordi.

53
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:29,200
All of these things just came out of the box and then saying, OK, well, these packages weren't updated.

54
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,380
Also, it upgraded React and React Dom, which is very key.

55
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,150
But then it says we didn't update the following packages, right?

56
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,470
Which packages didn't it?

57
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:38,860
Update?

58
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,720
Well, it didn't update the fonts.

59
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,380
OK, that's fine, you know?

60
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,130
Do we need to update the fonts?

61
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,320
What's going to really change about font?

62
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,820
Then it didn't update the mask for you.

63
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:52,720
Oh, that's the one that you know, we utilize for the credit card, I think.

64
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,250
Or Oh, what was that?

65
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,300
Oh yeah, it's one of those packages that introduced a mask for you.

66
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:03,070
OK, well, the current version, as long as it's working, that's good.

67
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,520
And then a lot of react navigation stuff.

68
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,800
Firebase, of course.

69
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,460
You know, that's something that we need to manually keep in mind.

70
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,400
React native paper, which is our design system.

71
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,450
OK, that's fine.

72
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,500
Styles components.

73
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:20,700
Sure, you should update that because that can break all of the styling.

74
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:26,200
These are things that we manually need to look at and manually to upgrade prettier and Iceland.

75
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,680
So it made all of the right decisions.

76
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,850
It didn't update things it didn't know about.

77
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:35,920
It didn't update things that could break the core of the app, like the navigation, the styling, you

78
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:41,020
know, our design system, all of the things that we manually may need to intervene to update.

79
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:45,610
And it only updated the core of our app.

80
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,570
So the app is at its core, up to date.

81
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:56,890
Like everything that keeps the app from the foundational standpoint, running is all updated and everything

82
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,440
that is an add on isn't.

83
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:07,390
So our foundation is always going to be in a good state and we can decide from there whether or not,

84
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,660
you know, it's a good idea to go through an upgrade of south components or, you know, our design

85
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,870
system or react navigation for that.

86
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:23,950
And so from here, because our foundation has been updated, we should go ahead and look at what actually

87
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,000
happened to the app.

88
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,380
So let's take a look at.
