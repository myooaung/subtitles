1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,650
There's this thing that keeps bothering me, and it's that we keep seeing this error, this warning

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:10,950
popping up, each child should have a unique Kiprop check, the render method of restaurant info card.

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,020
And so what I want to do now is I want to go and solve that because it's starting to bother me, isn't

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:16,860
it bothering you?

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,230
And so if we go to restaurant info card component, what we're going to see here is if we go to the

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,690
render method, we'll see.

7
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,120
Well, what exactly is it complaining about?

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:37,200
Oh, over here, we put together a rating array, but we didn't give a key to each individual star,

9
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,130
that can be a problem.

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:45,210
So what we want to do here is we want to take the index of the array, which is not a great way to give

11
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:45,570
a key.

12
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:46,260
Right.

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,310
Any time you give an index as a key, it's not guaranteed to update correctly.

14
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,840
But what we're going to do here is we're going to use the index as part of the key.

15
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,970
So we're going to say key is equal to and we're going to construct the key.

16
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,420
We're going to say.

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:14,600
Star Dash, and then we're going to pick a property off of here, right, so we have a name orating

18
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,250
Placide ID.

19
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,730
So let's go look at the data.

20
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:24,530
Well, if we go look at our services and we go look at our mock data, we can see here in the mock data

21
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,300
that we have a police ID.

22
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,840
So that's equal to some place ID.

23
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,840
Usually this is kind of like a random string right now.

24
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:39,530
I put it as kind of this now will take that place ID and remember we Camil Keystart.

25
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:48,200
So it's going to look like this and we're going to say Star Police id dash I just to make sure that

26
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,520
it is completely unique.

27
00:01:50,180 --> 00:02:00,590
And so by doing this now, what we'll see happen inside of our terminal when we run our code is if we

28
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,970
scroll all the way to the bottom.

29
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,340
And we refresh here.

30
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:11,070
What we're going to see is that we will no longer have this key issue popping up any more.

31
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,730
OK, that's great.

32
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,290
So by doing this, what we've basically achieved is the removal of a warning.

33
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:25,370
These can pop up anywhere, any time you do any type of map, any time you do any type of iteration

34
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:30,560
where you're trying to render the same element multiple times, you have to make sure that you're generating

35
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,380
unique IDs.

36
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:37,730
Now, in this case, Placide is guaranteed to be something unique because it's coming from an API at

37
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:43,010
some point and it should usually be one concurrent string that's going to work well.

38
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:47,600
And then the AI is going to allow us to iterate and say, well, that's the start one to start to the

39
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,530
start, three in the start for it's a combination of things that make it unique.
