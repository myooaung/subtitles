00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:07.230
OK, so we've integrated our cart into and we're pretty satisfied now with what it looks like, but

2
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.350
there's one more thing I want to do, right?

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.770
Because we have navigation over here, over in in this component, we can pull in navigation.

4
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.690
And so the one last thing that I want to do to go kind of semi full circle is after you add the cart,

5
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:31.560
I want to do navigation, dot navigate and I want to automatically navigate us to check out and that'll

6
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.189
make it look nice.

7
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.550
There we go.

8
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.490
So any time you add the cart boom, you're in the checkout.

9
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.600
Now, I have four specials in my cart for this restaurant.

10
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.290
Amazing.

11
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:49.140
Now, what what we also have to note here is that we already built in the logic to clear the cart right

12
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.910
in the cart context.

13
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.060
If you add the cart and the restaurants don't match up, we're going to clear it.

14
00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.030
So if I go over here and I added over here, you're going to see.

15
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.730
Whoa, what's going on here, is this actually working as intended?

16
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:15.680
Doesn't look like it, does it, right, if I reload here and I looked at Zuni CafÃ© and I ordered a

17
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.050
special from there and then I went to a different restaurant.

18
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.800
Like Brenda and I ordered a special from there.

19
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.710
Well, now I have two items in my cart.

20
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:38.390
But the business is is being set to Brenda, but I have two specials in my cart that doesn't make sense

21
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.250
at all, right?

22
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.550
It shouldn't still keep the previous cart, it should reset the cart.

23
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.380
So why isn't it doing that?

24
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.640
Well, it's because we aren't exiting out of this function.

25
00:01:52.940 --> 00:02:00.580
So any time you do this, you either have to return here or you have to wrap this in an else statement.

26
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.160
Otherwise it'll just execute both.

27
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.820
Right.

28
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.100
So it was adding twice.

29
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.449
So if we go look here, small logic error.

30
00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:16.070
But now if we go order from Zooni Gaffey, one item, if we switch over to Brenda's French soul food,

31
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.360
one item.

32
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.450
So we're clearing our cart properly.

33
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.440
Now, these logic errors, they can creep up on you, though.

34
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:32.090
So either add a return here or add an else statement to wrap the else of this particular logic.

35
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.730
Those things can come and catch you.

36
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.050
And you wouldn't even notice, right, these small little bugs.

37
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.640
Same thing would making a little little typo here in values without calling it values value.

38
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:45.320
Right.

39
00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:52.180
Those types of things you need to watch out for, they can cause tiny little bugs that could basically

40
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.440
not show themselves to you until you take a closer look.

41
00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.830
So it's important to always test this logic.

42
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.860
And now that we have the full end to end integration of an order button into our cart, we can start

43
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.710
building out the UI here to look a bit nicer.

44
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.910
So let's go ahead and do that.
