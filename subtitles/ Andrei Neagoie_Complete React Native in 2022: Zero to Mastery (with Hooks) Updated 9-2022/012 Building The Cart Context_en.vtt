00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.450
Now that we know kind of had our feature needs to look like the first thing we're going to need to do

2
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.670
is built a cart of some sort, but we don't have the concept of a cart.

3
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.470
And so the way that we're going to build that is in our services folder, we have our checkout.

4
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.180
But next to our checkout, we're also going to have a cart.

5
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:28.210
Now, just like in other parts of this course, the cart may not have an external service right now.

6
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.450
Right.

7
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.880
It may just be contained in the application, may just be state in the application for now.

8
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.410
But we're putting it in the service folder because eventually we may want to sink it somewhere, save

9
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.550
it somewhere, have it stored on the server and kind of that kind of stuff.

10
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.420
But for right now, what we're going to do is we're going to build something that's called cart dot

11
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.680
context, dot J.S..

12
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.760
Right.

13
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.760
And that cart context is what's going to contain what we would call the user's cart.

14
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.480
And so the first thing we're going to need to do is we're going to import, react and create context.

15
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:15.400
Also, use state use effect and use context, and we're going to import that all from reac, these are

16
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.050
all the things we're going to need from Rhea.

17
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:24.600
Then what we're going to do is we're going to import the authentication context, authentication context

18
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:31.380
from dalts authentication, authentication of context, because we're going to need the user in some

19
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.700
way, shape or form to utilize the information that they.

20
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:46.120
Then what we're going to do is we're going to import our storage, just like we did for our favorites,

21
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:53.140
right in our favorites context, we import async storage and we're going to do a type of storing mechanism

22
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.160
for our cart.

23
00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:01.180
So we're going to store it so that it kind of stays in state just the same way that we did with Favourite's.

24
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:08.020
And this feature is going to be quite nice because it's going to contain all of these different things

25
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.100
in one file.

26
00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.970
So we're going to say export const Kaat context.

27
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.070
Now this kaat context is going to be create content.

28
00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.670
This is what we're going to utilize in order to kind of pull the information off of it.

29
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.900
Then we'll say export consed cart context provider and we'll say that that is equal to.

30
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:37.300
Taking in the children and as always, what we're going to do initially is we're going to just return

31
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:38.170
children.

32
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:46.460
Now, over here, inside of this part context provider is where things start getting great, so we'll

33
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.740
say we'll pull the user off the authentication copy by doing use context.

34
00:02:53.210 --> 00:03:00.350
Of the authentication company, and by doing this now, we can utilize everything the user has in order

35
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.250
to make our case, then we're going to need some state, right?

36
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.900
We're going to need const.

37
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.240
Cart and then set cart is equal to use state.

38
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.530
And that's going to be an empty array, so our cart will be in array.

39
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:24.880
Then we'll say constant restaurant and set restaurant, because we're only ordering from one restaurant

40
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.400
at a time, so let's do use state and let's set that to not because we don't currently have a rest.

41
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:38.030
Now, the next thing we need to do is we need to build our functions that will add and or remove from

42
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.510
our cart.

43
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:45.680
So the way that we do that is cost add is going to be a function that takes on an item and in a restaurant.

44
00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:46.310
Right.

45
00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.950
And, well, we can we can say Oreste for short for restaurant.

46
00:03:52.430 --> 00:04:00.470
And the add function is going to say if we don't currently have an actual restaurant in state or the

47
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.650
restaurant, that place idee is not set.

48
00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.900
Right, or we don't have a restaurant, a place.

49
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.250
Right.

50
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.410
So we want to check this.

51
00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.090
So if we don't currently have a restaurant we're ordering from or the restaurant, that place ID is

52
00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.810
not equal to Aristide, that place.

53
00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:24.920
So if if the restaurants are different, then the first thing we're going to do is we're going to set

54
00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:34.700
the restaurant to the current Aristide and then we're going to set the cart to be the cart of only the

55
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:35.420
current item.

56
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:41.300
So if you change restaurants, we're basically catching the case in which you would change restaurants,

57
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.250
in which case you're ordering from a different place, then we're going to do is if that's not the case,

58
00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:53.590
will set the cart and we'll give you the ability to take the current cart and add the item to it.

59
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.410
And this is the case where if you wanted to order multiple specials, right.

60
00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.590
Because we're only building him the ordering of one special.

61
00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.780
And the reason I'm building it this way, instead of first putting the visuals on the screen and then

62
00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:11.480
hooking them up, because I want you to also get comfortable with building the logic ahead of building

63
00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.380
the visualisations.

64
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.800
Sometimes you do things in different orders and that's completely OK.

65
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.030
Now that we have our ADD function, the next thing we're going to need is a clear function.

66
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:27.980
And so we'll say consed clear is equal to setting the cart to empty set cart to empty.

67
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.880
Right.

68
00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.690
And that's basically going to enable us to clear out the cart.

69
00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.410
And we also have to set the restaurant back to know.

70
00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.550
And this is just to give us the safety to to know that the cards.

71
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.220
Now, Mo, why aren't we doing a remove from cart?

72
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:48.200
Well, because we're only able to order one special at a time from one restaurant.

73
00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:53.300
We're not building out the full, full, full cart integration because we're not able to order multiple,

74
00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.110
multiple items.

75
00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:00.440
If you wanted to look at, you know, what what a remove integration would look like, const remove

76
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:06.560
would be something along the lines of taking the item and then going ahead and saying.

77
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:14.540
Something along the lines of if you had an item that ID write, you would go and check the cart, right?

78
00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:15.690
Cart, dot filter.

79
00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:21.850
For I and then check if item that ID is on there and then you would kind of remove that off, but we're

80
00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:26.860
not building out the remove functionality right now as it's not pertinent to our feature, as we're

81
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:35.200
trying to focus on the end to end flow of a payment rather than the fully fledged markups of a cart

82
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.910
integration.

83
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:41.290
We're ordering specials and we're keeping it as simple as possible to focus on that stripe integration.

84
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.980
OK, so we're able to add the cart and we're able to clear the cart.

85
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.960
So in both cases, we're kind of covered for the user, right?

86
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:58.100
Now, now comes the interesting part right now comes the part where, well, we can add the cart, we

87
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.000
can remove from cart, but we don't really have anything.

88
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:06.260
So let's return the cart context dot provider.

89
00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.710
And let's close that off, right?

90
00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:18.300
And then what we're going to put on the values of this is equal to we're going to put on the add to

91
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.490
cart as the ad.

92
00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:30.240
We're going to put the clear cart as clear, we're going to put the restaurant, we're going to put

93
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:40.200
the cart itself, and then the last thing we're going to put is the children inside so that we can render

94
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.040
out everything subsequently.

95
00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:48.630
So with these four functions, we basically cover exposing the cart outside of this file.

96
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:50.940
So let's take a look at what that looks like.

97
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:55.910
If we went went ahead and actually implemented the button that we need.

98
00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:04.200
So if we go over here to restaurants components and we went over to the restaurant info card component

99
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:11.200
over here is where we're going to do the bulk of the integration for this particular feature to add

100
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:11.700
to CART.

101
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:12.030
Right.

102
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.890
And now that we have our cart context in a state that it's ready to integrate, let's go take a look

103
00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:18.690
at what that integration looks like.
