1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:00,980
All right.

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:07,620
So now that we have our focus history rendering out, let's go back to the app and let's go look at

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,960
what we actually need to do to fill up this array.

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:16,470
Well, every time the timer ends, we know we've successfully focused on something.

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:23,760
So the most basic use case here would be to do something along the lines of, well, we saw that in

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,720
timer when we call the on end.

7
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:32,740
Well, we're not calling the actual.

8
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,130
On time timer in.

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,830
So we'll grab that from over here.

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,590
We'll go back to our timer.

11
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:49,970
And what we want to do here is on time, and we want to take the subject that we were focused on the

12
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:50,870
focus subject.

13
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:57,080
And before that is cleared, we want to pass it back up, right?

14
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:00,130
We may focus on it multiple times, and that's completely fine.

15
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,180
We'll store the amount of times we focus on something.

16
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:03,380
That way we know.

17
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,970
So every time the timer ends, we know we successfully focused on something.

18
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:16,070
So all we have to do here is take in the subject that was focused on and we'll set the history to be

19
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,140
taught our thought history.

20
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:26,680
And we'll add in the subject, so every time we focus on anything now, it will be added to the list.

21
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:37,150
So now if I do test and then I start it and I wait for it to actually complete its cycle when it's done

22
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:37,810
vibrating.

23
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,870
It has now called on timer end.

24
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:46,750
Now if I say like, I'm done focusing on this test item and I clear it, we can see, Hey, I've successfully

25
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:47,620
focused on test.

26
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,200
Now, if I do failed.

27
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:50,920
Right?

28
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,320
Because this is going to be one that we fail.

29
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,600
And I say, I'm going to focus on this.

30
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,660
And hey, I'm like, Nah, nah, I'm done.

31
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,500
And I didn't wait for the timer to finish well.

32
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,560
I didn't successfully actually focus on it.

33
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:07,330
So why would I keep track of it?

34
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,210
It's not something I actually focused on.

35
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:14,350
It's something that I tried to focus on, but I did not complete.

36
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,010
So now we can add like test to.

37
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:24,710
And we can see how that works, and if I start it and I wait for it to actually complete here.

38
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:32,360
Now, once it completes and my phone starts vibrating, I know I've successfully completed a round of

39
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,890
concentration against test you in effect, clear here things we focus on Test two.

40
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:41,840
And so this list will continue to grow and grow and grow.

41
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,720
And that is amazing.

42
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:52,880
So now we basically can keep track of everything we've focused on in one go in one app.

43
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,320
Isn't that awesome?

44
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,680
Now, one final thing we should look at here is in our focus history, we defaulted to not rendering

45
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,200
out anything when we didn't have a length.

46
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,510
But what we should actually do is say.

47
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:15,270
We haven't focused on anything yet, and that will give someone the indication that, hey, we haven't

48
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,860
actually focused on anything yet.

49
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:23,980
We kind of still need to go through the motion so you can give them the indication of, Hey, we need

50
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,670
to start over.

51
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,700
We need to start here in some way, shape or form.

52
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,750
Now we can design this any given way we want, right?

53
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,670
We could put it in the center of the screen.

54
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,410
We could do all types of things with it.

55
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:44,920
But in essence, here now if I go test and I say plus and I start pausing and starting once this actually

56
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:52,690
completes, that's when we know that when the phone vibrates, I've completed and hey, things we focused

57
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,830
on test.

58
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,210
Awesome.
