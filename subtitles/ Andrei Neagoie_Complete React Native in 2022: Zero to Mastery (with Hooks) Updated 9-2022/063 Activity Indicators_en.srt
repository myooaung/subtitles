1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,760
There's one more thing we need to do on Log-in register, and that's ensure that the user is being told

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,950
when something is happening.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,880
And for that to happen, we need to grab the imploding indicator.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:18,060
And when we grab the loading indicator from the off context, what we also need to grab is some type

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,680
of activity indicator.

6
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:26,010
And so what I want us to do is I want us to grab activity indicator and colors from react native paper.

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,810
And so in order to do that, we'll grab this, we'll grab our activity indicator and the colors.

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:38,430
And over here at the bottom, what we're going to do is we're going to say if it is loading.

9
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:46,710
Is loading questionmark, we're going to show if it is not loading, we're going to show the off button,

10
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,980
otherwise we're going to show the activity indicator.

11
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:56,400
And this is going to allow us to switch between the authentication button, which is going to allow

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,110
you to register and the activity indicator, which is going to show you that something's happening.

13
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:05,099
And, of course, we need to do the same on the login screen, which means we're going to need to do

14
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,640
the same import we did over here in the login screen.

15
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:15,680
Over up here, and then once we do that, let's grab the activity indicator from the bottom.

16
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:17,800
Right on here.

17
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,340
And so now will grab is loading from the Authentications State.

18
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:29,830
And with that property, what we can do over here is say if it is not loading.

19
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:40,880
Show the off button, otherwise show the activity indicator, and that will allow us to again.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,460
Tell the user that something is going on, and if we look at what that looks like, if we refresh here,

21
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:55,380
we reload the app, what we're going to see on login is when we do know at Beeny that I'll test one,

22
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,790
two, three on log and we're going to see the activity indicator interoperate.

23
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:06,960
And if we look on register, what we're going to see is if we do Moule plus three Beeny that audio test

24
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,080
one test one, two, three, test one, two, three.

25
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,160
And we register.

26
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,230
Something isn't happening on register.

27
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,660
Why is that?

28
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,750
Well, let's take a look at that, because that's strange.
