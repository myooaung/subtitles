1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:07,340
So far, we've done a lot of the initial setup, but we haven't run our application just yet.

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:14,210
And so one of the crucial components of running Riak native is something called Node James.

3
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:20,230
And so when we use NOGs, we can install it locally on our computer.

4
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,690
Now, we always want to go for the ELTs.

5
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,820
This is the long term support version.

6
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,960
It is the most stable and it's recommended for most users.

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,520
If you go to the one with the latest features, you may run into potential issues.

8
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,780
But that being said, would react native.

9
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,820
You never know what version it's going to need.

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,250
It may need later versions or or whatnot.

11
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,070
For now, with the ELTs, we should be good.

12
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:43,990
So let's allow that to download.

13
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:48,880
And if you already have node installed, just set it to fourteen point fifteen point zero.

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,890
If you have a version manager or reinstall it with the newest version like we're doing over here, we're

15
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:59,260
going to go through the installation pretty quickly and just accept, accept, accept, because all

16
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,700
of this is pretty standard.

17
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,019
And so it's going to start writing files, routing files and we're good.

18
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,460
Now it's going to say the package was installed over here.

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,430
Make sure that user local bin is in your path.

20
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:14,650
Interesting.

21
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:15,490
What does that mean?

22
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:21,390
Well, let's go look, let's move that to the trash and let's do something called Echo Path.

23
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:22,810
Well.

24
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:29,930
As we can see, it echoed out Yusra, local, Ben and all of the stuff and it said, make sure the user

25
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,830
local bin is available.

26
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,230
Well, it is.

27
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:36,090
OK, so how do we know that it works?

28
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,580
Well, let's do node minus Phee.

29
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:47,140
Oh, fourteen point five point zero, we have node installed, amazing, amazing, amazing, amazing.

30
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,270
OK, so now that we have node installed, we're halfway there.

31
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,910
But the next thing we need is something called Yorn.

32
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,160
And what is yourn?

33
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,240
Well, it's not a ball of yarn, I can tell you that much.

34
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,280
It is a package manager that works to get our packages.

35
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:10,139
Now this one is developed by Facebook and you could just as easily use something called NPM, which

36
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,080
ships standard with node.

37
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,240
It's also a different type of package manager.

38
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,430
But since this one is built by Facebook, right.

39
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:23,880
Jaan is built by Facebook and since React Native is built by Facebook, I've always found that yarn

40
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,660
has been more reliable with Riak native projects.

41
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,210
So we want to make it as easy as possible.

42
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,710
So how do we get started?

43
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:36,030
Well, if we go through the getting started and we go to installation, it's going to tell us to do

44
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,900
NPM install minus Gihan and I just told you about NPM.

45
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,150
NPM is a different package manager.

46
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,790
Will AMPM ship's standard with node.

47
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,610
So if we did node minus Phee, we're gonna have fourteen point five points here.

48
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:51,600
And if we did AMPM minus five, it's going to tell us we have six point fourteen point eight.

49
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,940
So NPM shipped with the node installation.

50
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,840
Now what we're going to do is we're going to do something called NPM Install minus G yarn.

51
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,500
This is a global installation.

52
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,470
If we run that command, what's going to happen?

53
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,630
Access denied, permissions denied all of the stuff.

54
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,420
Now, why is it doing that?

55
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,440
Well, that's because we don't have root possibilities.

56
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,380
So should we run it with pseudo.

57
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,720
Well if we run it with Suto now it will have access.

58
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:24,410
Sudo is kind of like the ability to run something as a super user.

59
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:29,340
And so now if we do yard minus Phee, we're going to have one point twenty two point zero.

60
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,980
Now, you could also do this with homebrew, but it's best to do it this way.

61
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:41,850
And now that we have this one point twenty two point zero, we're making sure that we're in the focus

62
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,600
folder that we created and we're going to do something called the yarn.

63
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:54,180
It's now it's going to start installing all of the different dependencies that you need and feel free

64
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,990
to slow this video down, go back, follow the commands step by step.

65
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:01,140
If you run into any issues, please reach out on our Dischord community.

66
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:08,190
That being said, the majority of this, if you're coming from a clean install, should be pretty straightforward.

67
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,250
This particular MacBook that we're doing this on has had a clean install, so we're starting fresh,

68
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:20,940
just like anyone who doesn't have prior packages, be aware that if you do have prior known versions

69
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,040
and versions, make sure to align them with the versions that we showed in this video.
