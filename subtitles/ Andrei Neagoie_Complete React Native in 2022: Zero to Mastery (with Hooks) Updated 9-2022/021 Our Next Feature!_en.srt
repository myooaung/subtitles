1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,860
It's time to get into our next major feature, as you can see in our current app.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,920
We have a full search functionality.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,840
We can figure out where, what, how we can search a location.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,790
We can get the restaurants in that location.

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:19,650
We have nice random images and information rendering for every location.

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,050
We can even show if they're closed temporarily or not.

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,230
We have set up all of this amazing infrastructure.

8
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,570
But the one thing we don't have that the real app currently does have well, there's a couple of features

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,009
that we still need to work through.

10
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,150
But one of the big features is we need a detailed screen.

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:42,270
We need to be able to show a detailed screen with a nice, smooth, scrollable action.

12
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:42,570
Right.

13
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:48,090
That screen is going to showcase the card information that we currently have.

14
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:52,290
But what is also going to showcase is kind of a static menu.

15
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:59,670
And that static menu is there as a purpose to kind of categorize what kind of details we could show

16
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,210
at a restaurant.

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,590
Now, Google doesn't send us back the menu information, unfortunately.

18
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,000
So this entire feature is going to be static for the menu.

19
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:18,750
And there is no real API out there that can go and figure out the menu per restaurant without doing

20
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:26,640
some type of scraping action or kind of like some more advanced types of things that extend way beyond

21
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,730
the capabilities of what Google supplies us or otherwise.

22
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,420
So with that, this feature inside of here for the menu is a static feature, but the restaurant information

23
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,050
is dynamic and all of the information around the restaurant is dynamic.

24
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:48,000
And the modal feature is here to showcase from a UI perspective kind of that usability aspect of that

25
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:53,280
that finish that you would expect from a mobile application that you can showcase in the workplace.

26
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,450
In the production level.

27
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,610
Apps also require production level.

28
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:03,540
Apps require this smooth transition, this buttery, smooth kind of feel, as well as this nice UI separation

29
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,940
with the drop shadow from the menu.

30
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:11,580
And that in itself, that holistic feature is what we'll be focusing on now.
