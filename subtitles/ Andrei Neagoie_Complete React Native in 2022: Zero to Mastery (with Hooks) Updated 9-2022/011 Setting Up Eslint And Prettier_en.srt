1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:06,820
As I promised, the project we're building here is not only going to teach you react native, but it's

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:16,120
also going to use industry standards in order for you to be more focused on tools that are effectively

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,540
used in a day to day job.

4
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,060
Two of those tools.

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:27,620
Are prettier and Eastlands, and we are going to set those up right now.

6
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,270
Now, you may be wondering what's the.

7
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:39,390
Well, Iceland is this tooling infrastructure to find and fix problems in your JavaScript code, it's

8
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:47,250
this extensible type of framework that you can basically use to find and fix problems, and it can even

9
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,420
fix them automatically.

10
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:53,610
And you can customize it to find errors in specifically your code.

11
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,540
If you prefer certain styles, it can enforce code styles.

12
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:06,030
And so they have a whole section on getting started, what rules they have, what kind of different

13
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,470
interactions you can use.

14
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,860
And they have a developer guide for contributing and setting it up and running unit tests.

15
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,740
It's a huge, huge ecosystem.

16
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,020
And if you've never heard about it, it's honestly amazing.

17
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:23,360
They even talk about their architecture and how it fits into the big picture and what exactly it does.

18
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:31,830
It's a great read and a great tool, but setting it up is easier than you would expect because we're

19
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:42,120
going to do is we're going to use the react native communities pre configured react native setup.

20
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:49,680
So they have put together for us all of the tooling and all of the rules that we need for Riak native.

21
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,320
So we don't even need to go into detail of what all the different rules are.

22
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,420
Here's a preset pre configured lintang.

23
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,930
So Lintang is the process of going through your code and making sure that it adheres to the style.

24
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,130
So they've gone ahead and they've configured it.

25
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:10,440
So they have baseline configuration and so they use also something called prettier and prettier.

26
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:18,980
Pretty hard, James is an opinionated code formatter, so prettier is also an industry standard at this

27
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,460
point because what we want is consistency in code.

28
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:29,090
And prettier is basically one of those things where you see the code here on the left, how it's being

29
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,730
formatted and how it's not that readable.

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,710
Will Prettier will do this to it.

31
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,260
It will enforce a code style that always looks the same.

32
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:43,140
It'll format your code to always, always, always look the same.

33
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:50,720
And so these two tools, prettier in conjunction with Iceland, are two of the main tools that teams

34
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,590
use in order to create consistency in an ecosystem that has so much entropy, entropy, meaning there's

35
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,430
so many different people that code in a code based on a team.

36
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:08,660
Well, these two tools enforce you to write similar code to each other and have the rules in place for

37
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:13,430
you as a team to know, hey, I prefer this or I prefer that.

38
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,550
And the discussion arises and you kind of come upon rules.

39
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:22,480
Now, the react native community has gone ahead and given us a preset amount of rules that we will use.

40
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,440
So all we have to do is go to react native community and run this command.

41
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,180
So will press command.

42
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,440
SISA will copy that.

43
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:36,940
And then what we're going to do is we're going to go over to our visual studio code and remember how

44
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,850
we ran the terminal.

45
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:42,340
Well, you can go up here if you don't have a terminal running a new terminal or if you have a terminal

46
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,690
already running, you can hit this icon here.

47
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,520
This will open up the console here and you can hit terminal.

48
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,330
And this will also allow you to get to a terminal.

49
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,620
Now, don't worry about the errors that I see here.

50
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,370
Those are for my system.

51
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,490
But you may not see anything like that.

52
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,420
Now, here, we want to run this command, right?

53
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:10,870
So let's go ahead and run that, and that's going to install all of the dependencies that we basically

54
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,170
need.

55
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,660
And then on top of that, we need to create a new file while this is installing and we're going to call

56
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,880
it Dot Esslin RC.

57
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:24,310
And in that Esslin Darsey, we're going to copy paste these lines.

58
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,800
And by copying these lines, we're telling, excellent, hey, you're going to use the riak need of

59
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,090
community configuration.

60
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,600
Awesome.

61
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:38,490
OK, so now that that's done, we're basically set up or are we?

62
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,010
Well, let's take a look at that in the next video.
