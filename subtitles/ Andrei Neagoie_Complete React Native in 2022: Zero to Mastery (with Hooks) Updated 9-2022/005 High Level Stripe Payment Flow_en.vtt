00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.820
In order for us to understand where we need to begin, we need to understand the flow of a payment,

2
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:07.350
right.

3
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:14.110
We need to understand how user is going to go about processing and doing a payment with Stripe.

4
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.420
And in order for us to understand that there's a couple of things that we need to know, we need to

5
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.640
know how to pay what stripe.

6
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.540
And so here I've drawn out a diagram that's basically illustrating at a high level what exactly we are

7
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.210
going to be doing in specific steps.

8
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.430
So first of all, we have our user here that is utilizing our app and that user needs to process a payment.

9
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.930
So in order for that user to process a payment, we need some kind of payment information from that

10
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:44.310
user.

11
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.830
So we'll have a credit card field where in which the user will fill in credit card info.

12
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.490
That credit card info will then subsequently be used to create a stripe payment token.

13
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.580
Now, this is a token that strike gives us to do one off payments to process a payment.

14
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.550
So you give it credit card info, valid payment information.

15
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:13.320
And what Stripe does is it creates a temporary token that you can then utilize to process payment information.

16
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:19.210
So we get that token back, we get that token back, and now we have that on the user for the current

17
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.230
payment session.

18
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.700
OK, so we understand that we need to process the information of the user for the payment.

19
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.770
We need some kind of ID for the user to do a payments.

20
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.470
In that case, it's credit card.

21
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.390
Now, don't worry, we're in a test sandbox and stripes of this credit card info is going to be fake

22
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.840
credit card.

23
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.540
So but then once we have that payment token, what do we do?

24
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.730
Well, then the user has a token that they can utilize to do a payment.

25
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.850
So we take that token and we go to our checkout flow and in our checkout flow now, we have subsequently

26
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.530
have to take that token and do something with it.

27
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.110
We need to pay.

28
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:05.010
And that's where we end up building our fire base function at the step at which we have our payment

29
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:11.250
token for the users payment information, we can now go to a checkout flow where we can utilize that

30
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.530
token to process the user's payment against a certain basket or cart or whatever else.

31
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:24.000
And so over here is where our firebase function will live, and it will take that payment token and

32
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.160
it will go talk to Stripe and we'll say, hey, this is what the user is paying.

33
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.740
This is what for process this payment with this payment token that they gave me.

34
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.830
And then the processing of the payment will return a status to our payment endpoint, which it will

35
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.600
bubble up to our application checkout.

36
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.460
And then our checkout will be able to process whether or not the payment was successful or herit.

37
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.490
And once we know that we can give the user back the state, we can tell them, hey, your payments exceeded,

38
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.290
your payment failed.

39
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.840
This is why maybe the credentials for the credit card were wrong.

40
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.260
Maybe something happened, maybe Stripe's now you never know.

41
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.370
But this is the core flow we will be building.

42
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:12.140
And so the first step is to go ahead and try to figure out how to create this payment token.

43
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.860
So let's take a look at that.
