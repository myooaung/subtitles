00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.980
Now that we're able to deploy our firebase functions, nothing stopping us from shooting for the moon,

2
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.860
but we need to set up our code base for scale.

3
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:17.350
Now, first off, as you can see here, the URL that we used before changed, right?

4
00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.440
The suffix behind here stayed the same, but the URL had to change because we went to a live instance.

5
00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.220
Now, how do we set this up so we can swap out between both?

6
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.330
Well, that's a good question, because we want to be able to use both.

7
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.510
Right.

8
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:39.370
We could say CONSED Live is equal to this and we could say consed local is equal to.

9
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:47.580
This and, well, how would we then determine how to switch between constant local?

10
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.640
Huh, that's a good question.

11
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:59.490
Well, if we did something like console dialogue, process, dot, dot, know, then inside of our React

12
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:06.150
Native app, what we would see if we went to the terminal is we would see that we're running on something

13
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.050
called the development node environment.

14
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:19.950
OK, so we could say something like CONSED host is equal to process dot end dot node and is equal to

15
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.260
development.

16
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.310
And that would give us either local if it's true or life if it's false.

17
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.650
And so with that we could we could swap out.

18
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.890
Right.

19
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.160
We could, we could then just say here, over here.

20
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.200
Well up until here, let's just replace that with host.

21
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.720
And that's that's completely true.

22
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:40.590
We could do that.

23
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.230
But we're going to have to do this in multiple spots, though.

24
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:52.170
So what I suggest we do is we scale this out a bit more and what we'll do is we'll say import host.

25
00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:02.150
From and we'll do dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, utils, and we'll have to go over here and see in our

26
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.060
source folder.

27
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:12.380
We need to create a new folder called Utils, and we'll do utils again, and then we'll create an end

28
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.490
dodgiest file and then we'll say over here.

29
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:25.690
The live host and the local host are two different things we'll say also.

30
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.120
And we'll export all of these, but what we want to do is we want to see export CONSED is development.

31
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.560
And that's equal to.

32
00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.720
This and so now we can use this everywhere if we need to.

33
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.110
And we'll also say export concert host.

34
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.750
Is equal to is development.

35
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.870
Question mark, then we'll do the localhost or the live host.

36
00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:00.550
And so now what we can do is we can utilize this in both spots, we can utilize this for.

37
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.420
Over here in our restaurant request, and we can utilize this over here in this request.

38
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.570
And so now we're guaranteed that we'll pick the right host for the right environment.

39
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:18.660
So if we went to a production type of build, we would we would point it to the right, a host.

40
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.000
But it's also easy for us to now control.

41
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.260
Well, hey, I just I just want to point it to the live host so I can just remove this part and host

42
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.030
of The Life host.

43
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.600
So we have that sense of control here where we can do that.

44
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:37.470
Now, in order for this to now work, we would have to do yard serve so that we could actually get data

45
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.800
back, because right now we aren't receiving anything.

46
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.720
And if we reload here now, we're getting our information back and our moch is working as intended.

47
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:48.080
Great.

48
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:56.070
So we just layered on an additional utility that is going to help us scale our code base in a clean

49
00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.320
way.

50
00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:57.450
Amazing.
