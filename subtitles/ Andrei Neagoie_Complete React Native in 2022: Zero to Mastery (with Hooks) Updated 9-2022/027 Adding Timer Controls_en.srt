1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,410
All right, so now that we have all of that hooked up, you know, our timer ends, we vibrate the phone,

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:05,280
it's looking nice.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:11,550
One of the things I want to add here now is the ability to select timings.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:18,500
And by timings, I mean, the ability to have different times, because once you start with a focus

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,290
subject, right?

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,390
We don't want to predefined a time for you, like right now, we're pretty defining it to six seconds.

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,490
Now, obviously, that's not going to be it's not going to be perfect for you.

8
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,250
Maybe you want something like 20 minutes as a default range.

9
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:34,980
And you know, that's all great.

10
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,900
Like if we pre default this.

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,290
But what if we had some buttons that allowed us to choose and we had three choices five, 10, 15 minutes?

12
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,540
Wouldn't that make it a lot easier?

13
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:53,790
So let's go over here at the bottom and right below our start button is where we're going to say we're

14
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:54,840
going to take a view.

15
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,470
And we're going to see Slash for you.

16
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:05,650
And let's make it take the style button wrapper as well, which may push some stuff up right here.

17
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:11,200
And as you can see, it will push some stuff up because this is zero point five flex.

18
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,940
This is zero point three, and we're adding another zero point three, so zero point six plus zero point

19
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,740
five is one point one.

20
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:25,620
That won't really work, so we want to flex goes up to one, so we'll want to put this down to a zero

21
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,510
point four, which is great.

22
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,380
And then what we'll do over here is will add something called timing.

23
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:43,060
And will say change time is equal to and then we'll just say, set minutes.

24
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,710
Actually, let's say on changed time.

25
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,410
And then every time timing changes, we're going to set the minutes.

26
00:01:53,430 --> 00:02:01,650
So let's go over here and our features folder and let's create a new file called timing tags and timing

27
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:05,850
that yes, is going to import react from react.

28
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,500
And then we're going to export contest timing.

29
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:19,380
And what timing is going to do is it's going to return, and then what we'll need here is to import

30
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:23,490
view from React Native.

31
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:25,460
Sweet.

32
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:30,380
So now we'll out of you here, and we'll add another view.

33
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,840
And let's take a minute to think here.

34
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:36,860
So we want timing buttons and we want them to look right.

35
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:46,010
So maybe we'll import our rounded button and we'll import that from the iPod slash and we'll grab our

36
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:46,370
rounded.

37
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,270
But because we want to have some rounded buttons as some changes.

38
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:55,200
And in here, we'll take the prop on changed time that we defined.

39
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,370
And this will be what sets the time fairly, fairly simple.

40
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,290
Now, if we went to the fine view.

41
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,890
Well, we're going to need some styles, so let's add a style sheet here.

42
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,830
And over down here, let's go see a concert.

43
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,960
Styles is equal to stylesheet thought create thing we're all familiar with.

44
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,580
And let's say that we create something called a timing button.

45
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:31,630
And let's give that a flex of one hand and a line items of center.

46
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:41,800
OK, now let's say that this has the style of a style start timing button and then inside of that will

47
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,720
add a rounded button, and we'll say that the size is seventy five.

48
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:57,380
And we'll say that the title is ten minutes and on press is equal to.

49
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:59,630
On changed time.

50
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,720
Of 10, because we're sending it to 10 minutes.

51
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:05,710
Great.

52
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:13,450
Now we need to close our component over here and then over here in timer, we need to go and actually

53
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,130
import timing.

54
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,380
So let's go say import.

55
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,070
Timing.

56
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,690
From.

57
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,450
Thoughts.

58
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,560
Timing.

59
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:25,340
Boom.

60
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,150
And there we go, we have our button 10th now, free press it.

61
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,920
Our timer has become 10 minutes, right?

62
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,400
And so that's kind of the goal we're going for now.

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,030
Do we want our timing bottoms at the bottom or at the top?

64
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:46,840
You know, you can really decide that I think maybe I'd like them a bit more if they were over here.

65
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,750
Also, like they seem to be taking up a lot of space.

66
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,150
So let's say timing rapper.

67
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:01,200
And let's put this back to zero point five.

68
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,190
And let's say that timing wrapper is flecks of zero point one.

69
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,430
And let's try to add that at that point.

70
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,190
OK, so let's add some padding to it over here.

71
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,270
We still had a padding.

72
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:20,790
So let's add spacing that medium and let's give this spacing up medium as well.

73
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,360
And maybe this needs a spacing of large.

74
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,720
Now, do I want them at the bottom?

75
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:36,710
Let's add this as padding top, I don't want that to pad the bottom because it's pushing down the content

76
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:41,090
below it a little too far and maybe we'll give it XXL.

77
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,330
There we go.

78
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,050
Now, do I want the Start button in this position?

79
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,380
Like over here or do I want it up here?

80
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,760
And do I want the timing buttons below?

81
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:56,500
And again, it's playing around with it, like I play around with UI all the time, especially when

82
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,370
I'm designing it.

83
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,560
Maybe I'll have a design ahead of time, but in general, like, you know, you kind of want to get

84
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,050
a sense of what exactly is necessary.

85
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:12,530
And so if I do that, then I probably don't need this padding, which will pull up the button 10 15.

86
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,680
No, actually, I think I prefer it at the top.

87
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:22,120
And so I'll go and put it back over here at the top because I liked the idea of, Hey, let me decide

88
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,790
to make this ten minutes, five minutes or whatever.

89
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,700
But now I need to add more timing buttons.

90
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:35,440
So what I can do over here is I can use something called a fragment in React, which allows me to define

91
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,120
multiple elements without needing to define them inside the same view.

92
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:47,110
So now I can just create three buttons and I can say 15, and then I can say 20.

93
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,250
And if I do that.

94
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:54,190
Then over here in my timer, if I refresh.

95
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,080
What we're going to see is that, hey, they're overlapping each other.

96
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,990
Why is that the case?

97
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:07,230
Well, over here we need to actually give it Flex Direction Row so that it renders in a row.

98
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,110
And that will allow them to space out in a row sequence.

99
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:17,720
So now I can select 10, 10, 10, oh, I forgot to update my timing values.

100
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,760
So 15, 20, amazing.

101
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:30,690
Now I have three buttons that have the ability to change my time accordingly to what I need.

102
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,610
And the last thing that we may want to add is a clear button, right?

103
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:38,790
Like let's say we want to cancel this timer completely.

104
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,320
How would we add a cancel button?

105
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:47,640
Well, down here, we could probably add a rounded button, and we could say that the size is equal

106
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:56,550
to 50 and then we can say the title is equal to, you know, minus sign and then on press will do something

107
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,330
eventually.

108
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,780
For now, we'll just leave it as empty and empty function.

109
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,670
And let's see what that looks like.

110
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:09,640
OK, well, that's not positioning itself correctly, so we'll need a wrapper around it.

111
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:19,240
And then if we prettier that oh, we'll need a clear subject rapper.

112
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,270
And then we can go down to our styles again here and we can say clear subject wrapper.

113
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,500
And now we've got to think about here.

114
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,110
What is clear subject look like?

115
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,220
Well, it's not positioning itself to the middle.

116
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:36,159
So let's give it a flex direction row.

117
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,350
And then, let's say Justify Content Center.

118
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,950
And now it's centered along the content.

119
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,030
Amazing.

120
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:51,400
So now we have, you know, 10, 15, 20 minutes, we can start the timer.

121
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:56,650
It'll start counting now and we can pause a timer and then we need to determine what do we actually

122
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:57,430
do on clear?

123
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,940
Well, if we go back to our app level, we had this clear subject prop that we were passing to the timer.

124
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:13,120
And so basically, we want that to do is we want it to set the current subject to no, and that's what

125
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,900
it will do.

126
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:21,110
And then if we go back to our timer, we'll need to pull in the clear subject.

127
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:32,210
And then over here, we can just call clear subject on press, and so if we do 10 15 and we press start

128
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:37,270
right here, if I don't, if I pause it, I posit if I start again, I start again.

129
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,400
But if I press the minus, I cleared the subject.

130
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,050
I go back to the home view.

131
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,280
That's amazing.

132
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,540
And we did all of that.

133
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:49,430
We had a timing button and we were able to clear the subject to go back to the home you and start focusing

134
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,060
on something else.

135
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,510
All in that short amount quote awesome.
