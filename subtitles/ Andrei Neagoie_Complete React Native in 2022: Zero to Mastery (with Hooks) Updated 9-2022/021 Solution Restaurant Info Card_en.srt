1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:07,880
Dissolution is a bit more involved, and it combines everything that we've seen so far in a way that

2
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:13,130
addresses a lot of the things that we will be going through in this course and again, will be learing

3
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:17,510
this like a cake will be introducing more and more complex concepts as we go along.

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,050
So first and foremost, let's look at what the solution looks like.

5
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,100
So the solution looks something like this over here.

6
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:32,060
You can see that we imported card from Riak native paper and we imported stylesheet from Riak native.

7
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:34,120
Then what we did.

8
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:40,300
It's in the return function, we implemented a card and I gave it an elevation of five because that

9
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:45,970
felt about right visually when I was looking at it and I implemented a style in styles like card, so

10
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:49,690
I created a style sheet and I gave it a background color white.

11
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,370
And then I took a card cover, which is an image.

12
00:00:54,850 --> 00:01:02,140
I gave it the key of the restaurant name and I gave it a style styles cover and I gave that a padding

13
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:02,910
of about 20.

14
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,940
You could play around with this whatever looks right to you that you don't have to take the exact numbers

15
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:07,990
that I put in here.

16
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,230
It's whatever feels right aesthetically to you.

17
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,520
And I also gave it a background color of white.

18
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:19,350
And then beneath it, I put a text name, so I put a text field and I gave it the property name, and

19
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:25,380
so this is how we put text from props between.

20
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:34,260
The text component, so this is at its finest, and so what you can notice here is that next to the

21
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,290
Styles cover, I also gave it a source.

22
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,480
So this is considered an image component and I gave it a source.

23
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:45,780
And I said in the inner object, in the inner object, I said that the URAI is going to be equal to

24
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,460
photos zero.

25
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,120
So photo zero because photos up here is an array.

26
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,080
The very first photo is what we are going to use as a.

27
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,140
Cover photo.

28
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:06,520
And the reason for this and the reason that we're using this structure is because eventually again will

29
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:13,360
be implementing against an API of Google and we want to kind of keep close to the shape that will be

30
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,220
returning us.

31
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:21,280
We may change some properties around for ourselves, like it is closed temporarily and is open now.

32
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,770
We're not using these properties just yet.

33
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:33,760
But in any case, what we've done so far is we've built out this nice little cover item that is spaced

34
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,200
correctly in between the blue.

35
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:39,760
So giving this the blue background really gives us the ability to see what is happening.

36
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:44,590
And we could go even farther and we could say style equals style title.

37
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:49,990
And we could say that title over here has a padding of 16.

38
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,770
We could do that.

39
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,630
We could say that.

40
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:57,040
And that way the restaurant gets a bit more breathing room.

41
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,530
And that's obviously nice.

42
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,200
But you can see that here it's not really taking into account.

43
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:04,990
Why is that?

44
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,630
So let's go and let's show the element, Inspector.

45
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:13,150
And we can see here that the text well, looks like I made a typo.

46
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,410
It has to be style.

47
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:15,910
And there we go.

48
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,460
Now it's taking into a court padding.

49
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,880
So you have to make sure that you use the right property names as well.

50
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,500
And so otherwise.

51
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,410
Otherwise, visualization may not render you may not even get an error.

52
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,880
If you do get an error, you can always see it in the console.

53
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:36,460
So in the console, it will basically show you any errors that you may be going through.

54
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:41,490
If you're running the app, if you have any errors of the app isn't rendering, it'll show you the error.

55
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,420
So, yeah, a nifty little feature that we built just there very quickly.

56
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,220
And look how nice it already looks.
