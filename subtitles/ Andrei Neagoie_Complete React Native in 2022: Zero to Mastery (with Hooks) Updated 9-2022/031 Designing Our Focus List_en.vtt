1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.260
So we're passing in our history, which is an empty array as of right now.

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.280
And over here we can see focus is taking history.

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.920
Now the first thing we want to do is we want to ensure that, you know, if we don't have in history

4
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.400
at all.

5
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.120
Or we don't have a history that length.

6
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.130
Let's just not render anything out, let's just keep it very simple.

7
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.430
We don't want to see the focus history if we haven't focused on anything.

8
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.590
And then what we would like to do is kind of build out a title.

9
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.490
So what we're going to grab here is we're going to grab stylesheet.

10
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.330
And we're going to do.

11
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.670
As we always you can't styles is equal to stylesheet.

12
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.460
Doc, create.

13
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.940
And what we're going to put in here is we're going to put in a title.

14
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.180
And we're going to grab our colors from our colors map.

15
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.210
So we're going to import colors.

16
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:11.780
From start slash utils colors, and we're going to see over here color white colors that white.

17
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.410
That's the first thing we need to do, and then we can do font size.

18
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.500
And we can say fine, and then we'll grab font sizes.

19
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.550
So let's grab font size all sizes from sizes.

20
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.620
I think it's you two sizes.

21
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.830
So let's cap font sizes thought large.

22
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:44.460
And over here, what we'll do is we'll say style is equal to styles thought.

23
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:46.550
And title.

24
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:48.060
Boom.

25
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.190
And with that, let's disable this line for a second and see if our styles come through.

26
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.200
OK, focus features will be built here.

27
00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.780
Now the first thing we're going to do over here is while we build this feature, let's fill up our array

28
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.000
with something so that we can.

29
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.420
Figure it out, temp feature focused.

30
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.039
So we go back to our focus history.

31
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.510
We go back over here.

32
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:20.820
And the one thing we want to do is we want to text Align Center so that the text is centered on the

33
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.830
screen, but we don't want this title to be focused featured.

34
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.700
We want it to be what should we fill in here?

35
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.420
Things we've focused on?

36
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.920
And now that we do that, you can see like it looks a bit off like, I don't want it to be this large,

37
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.130
so let's put it to medium.

38
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.260
That looks a bit better.

39
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.110
It looks a bit better, but centering it really doesn't feel right, like it looks a bit off on the

40
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.490
screen, so let's remove that.

41
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.610
And then over here, this doesn't look right because it doesn't have any padding, so let's add some

42
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:07.680
padding to it, and let's say we take the spacing here and let's say spacing that medium.

43
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.070
And that way, it doesn't stick to the size of the screen.

44
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.560
Is that a comma here?

45
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:15.120
Boom.

46
00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.280
Things we focused on.

47
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.400
And maybe we'll make it.

48
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.890
Font weight and we'll say bold.

49
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.560
There we go.

50
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.970
That's nice, now that we have that, we basically need to figure out, OK, how am I going to visualize

51
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.980
things onto the screen?

52
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.860
And so for that, we're going to need something called flat list.

53
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.730
Flat list is an interface, a react component, react native components specifically that allows us

54
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.310
to render out lists of items.

55
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.160
And when we look at it, it's very basic usage is you give it an array of data.

56
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.630
You tell it the shape of your item.

57
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.120
You define the function that's going to render out each individual item.

58
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:09.710
And then you give it data, you give it the render function that it requires, and you can potentially

59
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:10.850
give it a key extractor.

60
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.880
Now, key extractors in React Native are used to extract the unique key for a given element.

61
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:24.650
Key is used for caching in react to track the item ordering the default behavior.

62
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.600
A flawless is to look for item key.

63
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.450
So it expects an item in an array to be an object is looking for item LAKI.

64
00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:33.820
Then it'll look for items that it.

65
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.460
If it can't find either, it will just use index.

66
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:44.370
Now, keys are an important concept in React lists for performance, but also ordering and react defining

67
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.860
when dynamic elements come into the list.

68
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.470
If you just use index, if you're trying to insert things in the middle of a data array, what could

69
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.670
happen is that things start jumping around and things don't look right.

70
00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.750
So it's important to use unique keys whenever you do this.

71
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.510
Now, it's not absolutely necessary.

72
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:10.410
And in this specific scenario, I don't necessarily see a need since we're not dynamically injecting

73
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.150
in the middle of arrays and things like that, so we could fall back to index here.

74
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.190
It's important to know, though, that if you're using more complex data, shapes always use keys.

75
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:27.240
So what we're going to do here is we're going to grab a flat list and what we'll do is we'll define

76
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.010
the flat list below our text.

77
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.240
We'll say flat list.

78
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.850
And now we need our data, our well, our data array is equal to our history.

79
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:47.090
We're going to say render item is equal to render item and will define render item up here after this,

80
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.000
we'll say render items equal to.

81
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.110
And the default behavior for us will be to use text.

82
00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:00.810
And what we'll see is we'll take an item and we'll render out item.

83
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:07.850
By doing this, what will visualize is black text on the screen that just shows us what we put into

84
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:14.300
the array, and the default key will be the index, which is OK for our use case right here right now.

85
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.730
Now one of the things we want to do, though, is kind of create.

86
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.880
A item.

87
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:31.250
And give it a specific look because we don't want it to just be like any old item.

88
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.950
So let's give it font size, medium.

89
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.030
Just like we did over here.

90
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.280
And we'll make it white as well.

91
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.650
And then let's give it to the item.

92
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.230
Style is equal to styles.

93
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:49.280
Thought I'd.

94
00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.940
And over here, we can now see that our item is being rendered out.

95
00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:58.120
Now we don't want to apply padding to everything.

96
00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.840
So let's go create a container class here.

97
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:05.650
And then, let's say spacing about Medium.

98
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.360
Let's format it prettier.

99
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.730
And let's say style is equal to Styles container.

100
00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:14.570
Boom!

101
00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:16.170
Now.

102
00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:22.810
I want the padding top on each item to be small.

103
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.880
To give it a little bit of spacing.

104
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:29.830
And let's see what that does.

105
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:35.200
And I want every item to have kind of.

106
00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:40.230
A indicator that they are an item, but not right there.

107
00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:41.910
Let's do it over here.

108
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:44.090
There we go.

109
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:50.090
Now we can see what we focused on in a list, and it's a flat list.

110
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:51.320
So.

111
00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:57.590
Eventually, when it reaches a certain size, it should be scrollable.

112
00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:01.840
Now let's make sure that this is Flex one, so that takes up the full space.

113
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:08.890
And then now we can see, hey, now I can actually scroll it when we didn't give this Flex one, it

114
00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:13.090
was only filling in the space it required, which doesn't allow us to scroll.

115
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:20.770
But when we apply Flex one right here now, our flat list is taking up all of the space it requires.

116
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.920
So now we can scroll nice little interactive feature.

117
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:31.190
Now that we have all of that working in the next video, let's look at how we can fill up our focus

118
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:33.770
list with the items that we focused on.
