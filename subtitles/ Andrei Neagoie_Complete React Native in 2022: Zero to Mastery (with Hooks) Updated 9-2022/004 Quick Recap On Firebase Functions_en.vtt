00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.670
Hey there, so quickly, I wanted to show you what exactly our function is going to look like now,

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.430
if you haven't set up Firebase yet in a way that allows you to go onto the blaze plan.

3
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.540
I would suggest you go back to the bonus section on the Google integration.

4
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.820
And over there we go through the step by step process of how to set up functions and how to go through

5
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.970
it.

6
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.800
We don't want to repeat ourselves here.

7
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.300
So just go back to the bonus Google section if you're having any trouble getting your functions up and

8
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.040
running and setting up your business plan.

9
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.430
Now, what you can see over here is that we have a third function we will be deploying called meals

10
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.870
to go pay.

11
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:47.480
And this will expose a payment and point that we will then use in order to process our payments.

12
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.630
And this is going to be a function that is going to be vital to us in order to achieve our goals.

13
00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.290
Now, one thing I do want to point out is if you're doing a firebase configuration here, the way that

14
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:11.280
we originally did it is we put it all into one project, all into one singular project, both our authentication

15
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.900
as well as our servers.

16
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.800
What I can tell you is that it is completely possible for you to split the firebase functions into one

17
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.880
project and the authentication to another.

18
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.260
And the way that you do that is you just create two separate projects in one project.

19
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.740
You set up the authentication portion like we did before.

20
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.240
Just the same steps to set up authentication in Firebase like we did.

21
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.100
And then instead of setting up functions in that same project, you can create a secondary project and

22
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.050
you can enable that one onto the police plan and then set up functions.

23
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.190
Now, is this necessary?

24
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.630
No, this is completely optional.

25
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.690
And I just want to point that out in case you wanted to separate out the authentication and the servers.

26
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.610
This is completely optional.

27
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.450
This is a completely optional way of of doing that.

28
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:10.110
And I wanted to point it out more so not because you need to do this, but some some of you may be more

29
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:17.000
advanced in the configuration and wanting to understand maybe a more scalable way of setting this up.

30
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.650
And so I wanted to showcase that to you.

31
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.590
Again, this is completely optional and we do not support this first hand in our integration because

32
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.120
it is not a necessary step, but it is something that you can look at.

33
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.320
So with that said, when we go over to your to our functions, we're going to have three functions and

34
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.000
the third function being the function is what we will be focusing on.

35
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.950
This is the function that we will be trying to deploy in order to handle the majority of the strike

36
00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.420
payments.

37
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.540
But now comes the question, more like I get it, we need this firebase function, but where do we start?

38
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.310
Where do we what do we do in order to get stripe into our code base?

39
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:00.890
That's a good question.

40
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.490
It's a very good question.

41
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.990
Well, the very first step we need to do is figure out how we're going to get straight into our riak

42
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.250
need of application.

43
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.520
Before we go ahead and try to process payments, so let's take a look at how that would work.
