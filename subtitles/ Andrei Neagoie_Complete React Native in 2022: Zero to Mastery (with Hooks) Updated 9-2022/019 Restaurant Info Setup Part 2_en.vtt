00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.200
First things first, we have our restaurant info component over here, but it's not really rendering

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.550
anything out that's quite useful to us.

3
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.750
So what we want to do is we want to set a blank canvas for ourselves and we need to determine what restaurant

4
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:15.800
info is going to take.

5
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.430
So initially is going to take in a restaurant.

6
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.360
And so that restaurant is going to be the object that we work with.

7
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.850
And what we need to do here is in the return statement, we're going to return.

8
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.650
For now, we're going to return text with the info.

9
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:42.980
And we're going to say text, let's just leave that there for now and we're going to say CONSED and

10
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.490
we're going to say it is equal to restaurant.

11
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.970
This is a de structuring.

12
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.220
So what's happening here is we're going to start taking properties off of restaurants.

13
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.740
So a restaurant is an object, right?

14
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.300
An object that contains properties that we want to take.

15
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.870
So one of the properties we want to take is name.

16
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:10.700
Another property we want to take is the icon, another property would be photos, those would be potentials

17
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:18.020
that we would want we would take in, let's say, address we would take in the opening hours.

18
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.650
And we would take in rating.

19
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.510
And we would check if we would have a flag to say is closed temporarily.

20
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.770
All of this information is going to map to information that we're going to be able to get back from

21
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:40.630
our Google API once we integrate that later in the course, what we're basically trying to determine

22
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.790
the shape of the object that we're trying to get.

23
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.660
And we're getting a bunch of errors here because this isn't formatted properly.

24
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.390
So what we're going to do here is since we don't have any integration to anything, we're not integrated

25
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.670
to any API or anything at all.

26
00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:02.770
The number one thing you want to do when creating a piece of UI or creating some type of component is

27
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.990
you want to determine some defaults so that you can start building the visualization without really

28
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.460
worrying about the data just yet.

29
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.880
So we're going to say that the name is some restaurant.

30
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:24.160
For the icon, we may need to get some temporary data and for the photos, we're going to have to see

31
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.290
what type of data we can get.

32
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:35.740
So, for instance, if we wanted to get, let's say, a specific type of restaurant picture, well,

33
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.480
I'm going to go and get a temporary one.

34
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.310
So what we would want here is a photo URL.

35
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:53.180
So we're seeing photos, which means it's going to be an array and we're going to give it a temporary

36
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.500
URL, so we're going to get a you URL from any type of photo off the Internet.

37
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.950
You can get it anywhere or you can take this URL from the get that we will be linking in the resources.

38
00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.470
We can say that the address is one hundred some random street.

39
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.250
From the opening hours, we need to know if it's open now or not, how should we use opening hours or

40
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.890
should we say open now is open now.

41
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.250
So let's really changed that.

42
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.580
The shape we're getting back from Google would be opening hours, but let's change it to a flag is open

43
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.680
now and we're going to say true or false.

44
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.740
Right, and so then we'll get a rating.

45
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:43.960
And so that rating is going to be anywhere between three and five stars, so how do we determine what

46
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.250
exactly that's going to be?

47
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.970
Well, we know that the rating is going to be somewhere between three and five or zero and five, rather.

48
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.140
So we can set the rating to four for now.

49
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.690
And so you may be asking yourself, why would we do it like this?

50
00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.590
Why would we put a D structure against a restaurant?

51
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.030
The restaurant info should already come in this way.

52
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.990
And you're right.

53
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.360
So let's take this.

54
00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:16.399
And let's not have to send in a specific object, but I'd rather send in a specific restaurant, so

55
00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:22.010
I'd rather send in the whole object of the restaurant and then know what I'm going to take off of it.

56
00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.680
Rather than have this have a specific shape.

57
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.240
It's going to take the restaurant.

58
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.250
And we know that the restaurant's going to contain this.

59
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:34.280
And so with that, we can now save and that's going to restructure.

60
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.610
And so we can go ahead and we can check out, hey, what's name?

61
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.300
Restaurant, that name.

62
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:48.160
Oh, and we have to here's a good thing, we need to also set restaurant to be an empty object, otherwise

63
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.810
it's going to be undefined.

64
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:50.830
Right.

65
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.520
And if it's undefined, well, this will break.

66
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.750
So we need to make sure that our restaurant starts off as an empty object and then we can set our defaults.

67
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.170
We'll come back to the icon when we're going to build it out.

68
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:07.740
But for now, we have enough information to set the scene and start building out our card.

69
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:08.740
So let's do that.
