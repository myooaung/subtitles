00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:06.260
As with everything we do when we're trying to implement the new feature, we can reach to the documentation

2
00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.180
to give us a sense of how we can accomplish this.

3
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.620
So if you press the search function and we said camera, what we can see here is that they have an entire

4
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.360
document specified for how to use the camera.

5
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.500
And so they have a package called XPO Camera, which provides a react component that renders a preview

6
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.220
for the device front and back camera.

7
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.850
It also takes in zoom autofocus, white balance, all that good stuff so we can adjust parameters if

8
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.290
we see it fit with the use of the camera.

9
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.890
We can also take photos and record videos.

10
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.320
And so it works on the Android device, the iOS device, but it will not work on the emulators because

11
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.890
the emulators, these things that we use over here to render out on the computer are app.

12
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.610
They do not have a camera module, so it will not work on the emulators.

13
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.950
You will need to use your device in order to test this.

14
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.390
OK, so how do we go about this?

15
00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.510
Well, the installation is pretty straightforward.

16
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.520
It's what we've always done except install XPO camera.

17
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:10.940
OK, so if we copy this and we go over here and we open up our terminal and we open up a separate terminal,

18
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:20.090
what we can do is we can run our XPO install command and this will allow us to install the camera dependencies

19
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.520
that we need in order to get the camera running.

20
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.780
Now, in managed apps, the camera requires permissions.

21
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.700
That camera video recording requires permissions, not audio recording.

22
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.440
This means that we're going to have to request the user for permissions the first time that they open

23
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.230
up the camera module and subsequently will always check if that permission has been met just in case.

24
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.520
Over here, you can see a usage, a type of usage with which you can use the camera from XPO camera

25
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:58.180
and you can try out the use effect with the permissions and so forth to set up a proper flow.

26
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.920
If you don't have permissions, we'll show you in our case.

27
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.340
And with that, we now have the ability to basically.

28
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.900
Enable a camera.

29
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:16.110
In our emulator here, which we can then run on our actual phone because the emulator will not be able

30
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:22.410
to render out the camera screen, it will be able to do everything up until actually rendering the camera

31
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.250
output because it cannot do that.

32
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.430
So with this example in place, what I want us to do is I want us to do a short exercise.

33
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.380
I want us to go over to our camera screen.

34
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.900
And what I want you to do is I want you to take the example here.

35
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.830
And with all of the principles that we've put forward, try to implement a camera implementation.

36
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:51.600
Now, what you can see over here is that with this camera implementation, they have everything from

37
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.550
setting the front and back camera and they have an example over here in a snack that you can try.

38
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.850
And I just want you to use this information to try it out.

39
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.530
Just try to implement this feature.

40
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.330
And in the next video, we'll take a look at all of the different steps that we need to take in order

41
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.530
to get the camera working and show the user their picture.
