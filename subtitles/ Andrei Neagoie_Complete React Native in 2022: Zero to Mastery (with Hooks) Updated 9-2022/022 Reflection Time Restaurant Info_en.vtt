00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.410
There's a little something I wanted to come back to here, and that is that we called.

2
00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:11.640
Restaurant info, we called it restaurant info, but now we're using a card element.

3
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.270
So should we rename this?

4
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.160
Will you can you definitely can.

5
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:24.860
We can rename it to restaurant info card component and we can rename this restaurant info card.

6
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.540
And maybe that feels a bit better.

7
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.150
So it's about evaluating our choices here.

8
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.950
And of course, if we do that, we have to go and rename the references everywhere that they were used.

9
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.660
So for instance, here we use restaurant info that becomes restaurant info card, so.

10
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.160
We always have to evaluate what exactly it is we are using.

11
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.110
And that is extremely important, and you can see here, I'm still hitting an error, and that's also

12
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.720
because I have to change the name of this import.

13
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.820
And so when we do that.

14
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:04.730
Of course, renaming the info card now has become easy, so now we have a restaurant info card, which

15
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.240
makes a lot more sense in terms of a naming convention.

16
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.640
And this is also something that we're going to be going through in the course.

17
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:17.900
What naming conventions should we use y and kind of going through that practicality of evaluating our

18
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.980
code as we go?

19
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.100
Because evaluating our code is an extremely important thing.

20
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.500
We want to make sure that we write good code.

21
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:32.240
OK, so with that small little additions, small, little extra small little reflection point, then

22
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.650
I want to introduce these reflection points as we go, because we have to keep reflecting on what we're

23
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.950
building.

24
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.040
If we don't reflect on what we're building, we won't write the best code.
