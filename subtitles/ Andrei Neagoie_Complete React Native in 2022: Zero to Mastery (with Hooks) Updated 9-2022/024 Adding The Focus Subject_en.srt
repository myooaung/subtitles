1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:06,320
Now that we have our countdown timer set up and ready to go, the next phase of this is to actually

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:12,170
add some visualizations that add proper indications to the user.

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,100
So one thing we would want to know is, Hey, what am I actually focusing on?

4
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:21,770
And in order to do that, well, what we're going to need to do is we're going to add a few in between

5
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:28,280
the button wrapper and the countdown wrapper, and that view is going to serve as where we're going

6
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,260
to store the indications.

7
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:38,300
So we're going to give that a style and we're going to say, Hey, padding top is equal to spacing about

8
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,770
x x l.

9
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:41,330
Let's do XXL.

10
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,000
And we need to import spacing over here.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,250
So let's go over up here and let's say import spacing from.

12
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,230
And then slash it.

13
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,370
We'll go get sizes.

14
00:00:53,330 --> 00:01:00,380
And by doing that now we have a properly spaced view over here and we need to put some text in here.

15
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,830
So we'll grab text from React Native.

16
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,680
And what we'll do is we'll create a text.

17
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,030
That has the style.

18
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:22,950
Of styles about title, which will create and will create a text that has a subtitle view or task view.

19
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,210
Let's go with this and then let's do prettier.

20
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:35,220
And let's put PASC, let's go down here to our styles and let's see title.

21
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,500
And then let's say task.

22
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:46,550
And so over here, four title and task, what we want to do is we want to grab our colors, so let's

23
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,620
import colors.

24
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,290
From then thought out slash utils colors.

25
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,830
Let's run prettier again.

26
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:04,580
Entitled What we'll say is that the color is colors that white.

27
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,130
In task, we'll say that colors, those colors thought white.

28
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:16,690
Now, the only thing we need to do here is potentially give them.

29
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,580
Font weight.

30
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:26,310
So let's say font weight and let's say bold and then over here for the task.

31
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,080
Hmm.

32
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,850
Actually, let's also fill in some text here and see what we actually have.

33
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,540
So we're just going to say focusing on.

34
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,230
And then over here, we'll put task.

35
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,690
What task is actually the focus object will see?

36
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,720
And so now we have bold.

37
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,010
So let's say over here that we put text the line.

38
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,290
And let's center it.

39
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:04,320
And over here, let's put text align and let's center it, and let's run prettier once more.

40
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,940
And now we have our focusing on parameter.

41
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:13,860
And by doing this, we now know exactly what we're focusing on at all times.

42
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,760
OK, so what now?

43
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:25,770
Well, I'd also like to have a progress bar of sorts, something to kind of report to progress over

44
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:29,280
here so that I know exactly what's going on.

45
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:36,000
Now, one thing I'll note here is that spacing XXL seems like a lot, so let's do spacing large.

46
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,590
I think it was large, but do we put in spacing?

47
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:39,960
Let's go.

48
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,260
Look.

49
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,660
So sizes algae.

50
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,610
So let's go back to the tamer.

51
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:45,960
Let's put algae.

52
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,210
So now it's going very far.

53
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,510
So that doesn't look right to me.

54
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,690
So let's put small.

55
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,980
And it's jumped a little bit.

56
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:00,920
Now, one thing you'll note here is that it's really pushed down over here, so what would happen if

57
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:07,010
we put this in side of the view that has the countdown timer and we ran for a year?

58
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,020
Well, now it's closer to here.

59
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,050
So now maybe XXL makes sense.

60
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:13,900
Oh, yeah.

61
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,070
Now it's pushed it down.

62
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,800
Now it looks in a nice position, and that's pretty good.

63
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,529
So you have to play around with your views.

64
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:26,650
And here's the thing you need to know about views is the more you play around with them, the more that

65
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:33,010
you'll find that different combinations of styles with views here, and we'll learn all about Flexbox

66
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,240
when we get into meals to go.

67
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:41,350
The different combination of styles that you use because it's kind of like a flex orientation will yield

68
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,640
different results.

69
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:48,250
Now we'll get into the details of all of this and how the flex containers work when we get into meals

70
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:48,670
to go.

71
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:54,460
We're trying to kind of shorten the amount of time you need to build an app here.

72
00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:01,570
The styles are an extremely important part of this as we're learning because we have, you know, all

73
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:05,260
of these flex properties that we're using and we have these spacing variables.

74
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:12,280
But the placement of those views can make a difference in terms of what the visual layout will look

75
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,030
like, and sometimes you'll have to play around with it is what I'm trying to get at.

76
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,580
So in the next video, we'll look at adding a progress bar.
