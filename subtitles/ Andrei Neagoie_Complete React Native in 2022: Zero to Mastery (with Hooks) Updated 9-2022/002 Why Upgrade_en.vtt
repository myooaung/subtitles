00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.270
Before we dive into the actual upgrade process, we already covered, why upgrade, right?

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:12.040
Like we want to keep our packages up to date, we want to have use of all the new goodies, right?

3
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.280
And I just want to take some time to run you through some of the great things that come with upgrading,

4
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.580
because that may not be so clear all the time, right?

5
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.730
This experimental support for Hermes what is Hermes?

6
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.840
Well, Hermes is a new engine to process JavaScript, right?

7
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.910
And it's now available on iOS.

8
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.620
Now, whether or not you want to toggle that on, that's up to you.

9
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.340
But as for the future of React Native, they're investing heavily in this new engine.

10
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.820
And so although you may not want it today, maybe you'll want it a year down the line.

11
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.810
And so this support, right?

12
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.160
This is why we want to keep the package up to date improved and simplified module infrastructure.

13
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.850
Right?

14
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.380
OK, so what does that mean?

15
00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.260
Oh, we've replaced a certain package with the next bow package and we've approved mono repos support.

16
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.890
So all of this comes to the question of what do I need this today?

17
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.550
Well, needs to go didn't really use any of the module infrastructure.

18
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.740
We weren't really a mono repo.

19
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:18.430
But oh, wait, what if I'm trying to build a project that you know I want to build a company around?

20
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.260
And so right now, it's just this mobile app, this rag tag mobile app.

21
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.250
I'm trying to get it out.

22
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.410
I'm trying to prove market fit.

23
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.770
Well, eventually you may want to go to a mono repo support.

24
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:29.430
Right?

25
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.320
So just covering more of that, why more of like, what's the use of this?

26
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:43.660
Then they introduced a new package that makes it easier to bring export modules to any React native

27
00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.930
app.

28
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.120
The new version of React Native very important to keep this up to date so that you get all of the bug

29
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:56.710
fixes, enhancements, improvements, security patches, new React 17, which you know, brings in all

30
00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.280
of that good practice that React has been putting in to react, right?

31
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.590
They've been solidifying the API, they've been making it more maintainable.

32
00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.900
So, you know, it's very important, right?

33
00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:15.460
And it adds support for all of these things that right now, right this second you may not need, but

34
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.990
maybe a month from now, you'll try to install a package and then it requires React 17.

35
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.880
You'll be like, Oh, I have to upgrade.

36
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.260
Why didn't I upgrade?

37
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.090
Why didn't I take the time before?

38
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.430
It's very important to keep doing this right?

39
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.600
And then there's just improvements to Expo Seelye.

40
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.850
You know, some things that may improve bill time.

41
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:45.150
Some things that may improve auto completion in vs code, a QR code that's more compact in the SEELYE.

42
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.680
Some beta flags.

43
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.900
Some nice to haves all around, right?

44
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.540
That we can experiment with in case we know we have a team and they're struggling with, you know,

45
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.790
speed of delivery, speed of development.

46
00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.320
All of these things come with upgrades because you don't want to build it all yourself.

47
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.030
They're maintaining X before you.

48
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.550
So why not get the benefits out of it?
