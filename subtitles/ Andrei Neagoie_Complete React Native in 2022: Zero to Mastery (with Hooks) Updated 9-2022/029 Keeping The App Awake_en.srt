1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,510
We should be really proud of what we accomplished here, because basically what we have here is an app

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,410
that allows us to focus on tasks as we go along.

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:17,520
Now one of the things that I wanted to point out here is that, you know, focus time and the timer

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,210
itself.

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:26,010
It's all great having, you know, long times and long timeouts and being able to focus for 20 minutes.

6
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:32,940
But really, what is important here is the phone staying awake.

7
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:40,190
And the phone staying awake is something that is vital to us having the countdown, we don't want the

8
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,810
phone to fall asleep in the middle of our countdown.

9
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,660
We want to see the time proactively contact.

10
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:47,930
I may want to take my phone and put it in, leaned against something to see how much focus time I have

11
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:48,230
left.

12
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:52,660
And so what we want to do is use something called Expo, keep awake.

13
00:00:53,710 --> 00:01:00,550
And Expo Keep Awake is a library that expo gives us out of the box, and what it allows us to do is

14
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,130
just use keep awake very simple.

15
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:03,990
It's just a hook.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,390
You put it in there, you pop it in there and I remember the boom.

17
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,940
Your phone will stay active.

18
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:15,830
Now, if we go ahead and take this important statement of use, keep awake.

19
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,640
And then what we can do is, oh, we don't have this.

20
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:20,750
So what do we do?

21
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:26,540
Well, down here, we just add the dependency and it says XPO Keep Awake is not defined as the dependency

22
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,590
and dependency.

23
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,630
And now it is installing it.

24
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:34,700
And now all we need to do is add it here to the top use.

25
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,240
Keep awake.

26
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:36,720
Boom!

27
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,910
Our app will stay awake for the entire time that the timer runs.

28
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,620
That's how simple it is.

29
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,880
Amazing.

30
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:45,780
All right.

31
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:51,210
In the next video, we're going to look at tying up some loose knots, creating like, you know, an

32
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,390
overview of what we focus on and so forth.
