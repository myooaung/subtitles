1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:07,580
We've looked a lot at how Iceland fits into the picture and how we're going to lend our code and figure

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:14,960
out errors in our code and consistent styling in our code, but we really haven't looked at how to make

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,220
our code adjust itself in the format that prettier gives us.

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,350
You see, prettier is integrated into Iceland.

5
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:28,370
So Iceland is going to tell us and complain about things that Prettier wants to fix.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,110
But we really don't have a way yet to enforce the code style.

7
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:40,460
So if we go here back to Extension's and we looked for prettier, what we're going to find is that.

8
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:45,290
Well, there's a very popular package downloaded over nine million times.

9
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,810
Wow, and it's the prettier formatter for visual studio coat.

10
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,930
It's the opinionated formatter, right.

11
00:00:52,290 --> 00:01:00,560
So what it's going to do is it's going to allow us to write our code however we want to.

12
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,710
And when we save, it's going to adjust the code.

13
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,250
So if we hit install on this, it's now enabled globally.

14
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,790
But how does it work?

15
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:16,130
Well, let's say that I went over into my code and I put a bunch of these over there and over there.

16
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:20,750
Well, now biosolids is going to play with prettier and like when we hover over the problem, we can

17
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,010
just press quick fix.

18
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:30,370
And we can say fix this pretty prettier problem, so we see how we can adjust every individual line.

19
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:37,730
Now, if we want to fix all of the issues, let's say I had multiple lines out of order, you know,

20
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:44,510
I can hover, I can peak the problem, I can see what the problem is or I can hover again.

21
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:48,890
I can do the quick fix and I can fix all fixable problems.

22
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:58,070
But what I want to teach you is if we go to code preferences settings and we search for format on save

23
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:03,230
and we turn on this option format on save, you want to turn it on.

24
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:04,190
Right.

25
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:11,270
And once it's on and I did a bunch of issues, my file is now in a noncommitted state.

26
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:11,580
Right.

27
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:17,540
So if I do this and I do this and I make this out of order and I do that and.

28
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,350
To come here for some reason?

29
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:26,310
Well, if I press command or control now, if you're on windows, it auto fixes all of the issues.

30
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,440
It's auto fixing everything.

31
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,840
It's applying prettier, right?

32
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,530
That is honestly awesome, because format on save is going to run prettier every time we save a file,

33
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,580
and that's going to save us a lot of time and a lot of effort in formatting our code.

34
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:49,410
All right, so now that we know that now that we've set up and set up prettier, we're basically in

35
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:55,820
a good state in our project to have consistent formatting and consistent styling for our code.

36
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:56,670
And that's awesome.

37
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,700
That's something that the industry also always looks for.
