1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:04,059
So we've reached the end of set up or have we?

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:13,350
Now, one thing to note would react native here is that issues may arise with your set up for random

3
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,210
reasons.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,730
This may be due to a faulty state.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,790
Something went wrong inside of the package for all types of things can happen.

6
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:29,610
So I want to give you some simple debug steps to help you along the way, because it can be frustrating

7
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:33,750
when you're first starting out to get all of this set up and get all of this in the right order.

8
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:40,980
So there are a couple of solid steps that we can always take in order to make sure that everything is

9
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,600
running as intended.

10
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,030
First and foremost, make sure that your packager is running.

11
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:54,210
And to do that, you can always run yard, start to make sure it's running.

12
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:01,620
And when you run, you start, the packager will run and it should bring up this localhost.

13
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,150
Nineteen thousand and two screen.

14
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,599
That's the very first step.

15
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:11,160
Now, if for some reason you're hitting any errors inside of here or it won't even get to that step.

16
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,550
Well, then there's something else we need to do, also remember to exit any process you can press control,

17
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:18,000
see?

18
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:24,320
OK, so here's the thing, let's say for some reason you can't start already.

19
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:31,820
ERARD Well, what we would need to do here in this case is if we go to Visual Studio Code.

20
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:40,880
What we would tend to do in this case is, for instance, if we look at our code here, the first thing

21
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:48,290
we would do is we would delete the node modules folder and by deleting the node modules folder will

22
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:54,500
be able to basically get to a place where we can restart everything.

23
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,290
So you can you can do that in different ways.

24
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:56,780
You can right.

25
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:02,280
Click here and press delete or if you're in a terminal, it depends.

26
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:07,800
You could run R.M. node modules if you're on windows.

27
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,169
This may be a bit different.

28
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:14,390
And if we do that, we have to do minus R node modules.

29
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,820
And so that's going to delete the entire node modules folder.

30
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:20,990
This may take a minute.

31
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,100
This is a very large folder.

32
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,610
Even when you right click to delete it, it can take a while.

33
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:30,230
But once that's deleted, what we want to make sure is that we run yarn again.

34
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,450
And this is going to reinstall all of our packages.

35
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:39,530
So always make sure that if you're running into any issues, you clean node modules and rerun it from

36
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,250
the start.

37
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:46,550
Another debug step that is very, very important is, you know, from time to time, if you're using

38
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:52,130
simulators, close them and reopen them because they can get slow as time goes on, they can be consuming

39
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:52,580
memory.

40
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:57,370
So you may want to shut them down and restart them the way that we showed you, too.

41
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,410
That's another important debug step.

42
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:04,730
And if you're hitting certain errors that are just blocking you and you don't know what's happening.

43
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:12,890
Well, what I would suggest is always taking that error right, whatever the error may be, and going

44
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:22,130
to expose GitHub, page the issues and remove this here and try to search for your issue, use different

45
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:22,730
keywords.

46
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,800
You can search for bundler not starting.

47
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,250
You can search for the specific error that is happening.

48
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,420
And there may be different issues here that come up that could help you.

49
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,920
Another way is to go straight to Google and just copy paste part of your error.

50
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:44,810
Selecting part of your error may help you or doing react native XPO bundler not launching, not starting.

51
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,790
That can put you on the right track.

52
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:54,100
If all of that fails, always reach out to either the section or directly to the community.

53
00:03:54,140 --> 00:04:01,040
We prefer reaching out directly to the community on our amazing discord because we will help you out,

54
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:08,150
whether it be myself as the instructor MO or some of our awesome students that may have run into the

55
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:15,840
same problems, because, again, all of what we're learning here is new and set up can be difficult.

56
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:23,090
So it's important to reach out and program along with your peers because this is a learning experience

57
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,010
and we want to make the most of it.

58
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:28,940
And you can learn from the others in the community and you can teach something to the others in the

59
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,240
community.

60
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:35,390
If you find something, it's always nice to share knowledge and receive knowledge from others that have

61
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,620
done the same thing.

62
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:37,820
All right.

63
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,450
So with that, we'll get into the set up of our master project.
