00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:06.270
Now that we've exported focus time locally, the next thing we need to do is put it in a right place.

2
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.560
So pick a folder.

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.680
Any folder doesn't matter if you're on Mac or Windows, just go ahead and drag it over or copy paste

4
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.060
it to a place on your operating system where you want it to be.

5
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:24.390
And so in this case, I'm going to create a folder projects and in that folder projects, I'm going

6
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.660
to put focus time and now focus time is inside of documents, projects, focus time.

7
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.290
So just make sure it's in the right place.

8
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:41.530
And then the next thing we need to do, the next thing is we need to have something called get now what

9
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:51.820
is get get is nothing more than a tool that we use in order to be able to manage our code.

10
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.580
Right.

11
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.700
It is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from large

12
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.630
to small projects.

13
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.570
OK, so how do we installed this?

14
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.560
Well, that's a good question.

15
00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:10.840
The first thing we need to do is open something called terminal and we open this thing called terminal.

16
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:18.910
What we can do now is we can write a command code and when we press the tab button, we can go to documents

17
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.350
and we press tab.

18
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.630
It'll autofill and will allow it access to our documents folder.

19
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.770
And then what we'll do here is we'll go into projects.

20
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.060
And then if we listen here, we know we have focused time, right, let's let's open this a bit.

21
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.710
So we have focus time over here.

22
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:50.300
OK, so if we go into focus time, we now know that we have all of our files, so is get installed by

23
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.170
default on Mac?

24
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.280
Well, let's take a look.

25
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.320
Let's write something called Get in it.

26
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.180
And it's going to say, oh, hey, you know, you're trying to use the git command.

27
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.920
No developer tools were found.

28
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.780
If you already have everything installed, this command will have worked, but otherwise you may see

29
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.410
the screen.

30
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.690
So we're going to just hit install and we're going to agree and it's going to start finding the software.

31
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.970
It's going to start installing all of the tooling on your Mac that you require now.

32
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.060
The software update server is out of order.

33
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.190
So what happens then?

34
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:22.360
Well.

35
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.470
Then we just go ahead and download it from here.

36
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.390
So how are we going to do that?

37
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:34.560
Well, the first thing we need to do is if you have home brew, you can do something like this or you

38
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:42.180
can do what we did before and you can maybe try again until the software center does have the code that

39
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.750
you need.

40
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.440
You know, sometimes this may flake out and you may need to try again.

41
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:47.910
Don't get frustrated.

42
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:48.960
These things can happen.

43
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.190
You see, again, I can install software because there is no currently available from the update server.

44
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.040
So what do we do in this case?

45
00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:03.360
We can go to the App Store and we can go ahead and try to install something called Xcode.

46
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.900
And when we install this, well, what it's going to do is it's going to install a bunch of developer

47
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.480
tools and together with those developer tools will come a lot of different software.

48
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:23.520
OK, so don't panic just yet because even I on a new install of my Mac, hit a brick wall in this can

49
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.030
happen.

50
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.550
But but again, if you hit a brick wall, reach out to our amazing community on this keyboard and they're

51
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.730
more than happy to help you out, whatever you're facing.

52
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.090
Now, let's just wait for this to install.

53
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.360
And once it's done, we can continue trying to set up our environment.

54
00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.280
All right, so we fully installed, echoed, and this can take a while, so be patient.

55
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:55.250
Now, when we open it, what we're going to see is that it's going to take a while to take into account

56
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.560
everything that needs to.

57
00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.630
It's going to pull together resources, basically.

58
00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.300
So this also can take a while.

59
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.120
This is a game of patience mostly.

60
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.180
So let's agree with the SDK agreement.

61
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.550
Let's fill in our password and it's going to install a bunch of components.

62
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.660
It's going to do a bunch of things that it needs to do in order to run.

63
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.180
And then hopefully by installing this, maybe we alleviate our git issue or maybe we need to go look

64
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.360
at what exactly is happening with the software update service.

65
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:31.340
But sometimes it's as simple as understanding that some of the resources that are required can be looped

66
00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.480
in with other packages.

67
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:39.740
So Xcode may indeed install the component we need for gett as well, because we want to be able to keep

68
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.320
track of what we're doing.

69
00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.920
We don't want to lose progress.

70
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.480
It's very vital and you may already have gittin installed and at that point you should be set.

71
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.480
But this is for those who don't.

72
00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.880
And also looping in the Xcode installation helps out.

73
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.120
So let's loop back when it's installed all of the components.

74
00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.390
All right, so it's just done installing all the components and now we get the welcome to Xcode screen

75
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.970
and so with that, we have everything installed here.

76
00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.110
So let's go back to our terminal window and let's run get in it again.

77
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:18.800
And what's going to happen here is, as you can see with the Xcode installation, it looped in the Gett

78
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.530
installation.

79
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.440
So that's important to note.

80
00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.960
By installing Xcode, we now have gett available.

81
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.890
And we have installed initialised an empty git repository in the focus time app.

82
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:38.480
And so what we want to do next is we want to do get add thought a get commit Dasch A.M..

83
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:40.850
We're going to call it initial.

84
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.580
And that's going to add everything into here.

85
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.520
And so the next step I'm going to show you is how to push this code up so that you can keep track of

86
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.140
it on something like GitHub.
