00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:06.400
Wouldn't you agree that this image is a bit stark, we want to lighten it up a bit, it's it's kind

2
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.140
of overpowering.

3
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.680
There's too many colors going on.

4
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.330
So to lighten it up a bit.

5
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:17.260
Well, we're going to do is we're going to create an authentication cover, kind of like something to

6
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.210
cover the background image and we'll call it expert const account cover.

7
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.810
And we're going to say that it's a style dot view.

8
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.280
And we're we're going to give it a good style here.

9
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.350
We're going to we're going to spruce it up a bit.

10
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.990
Now, what do we want it to look like?

11
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.950
Well, if it's going to cover the entirety of the screen, well, we don't want it to conflict with

12
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:39.540
anything else.

13
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.860
So we're going to give it a position absolute, because we just want it to fill up the whole screen

14
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.620
and we're going to give it a width of one hundred percent and a height of one hundred percent.

15
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.420
And we just want it to overlay basically we want where we put it to overlay everything.

16
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.010
So it's kind of like a stack.

17
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.220
We want it to be all the way at the back of the stack and we just want it to look nice.

18
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.960
Now we're going to say that this is going to have a background color, which is going to look a little

19
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:08.740
something like this.

20
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.280
It's going to be giba to five, five to four or five to four or five.

21
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.900
And we're going to give it a opacity.

22
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.680
This is the opacity parameter of zero point three.

23
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.110
So we're going to say, hey, it's only this much visible.

24
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.820
Now, let's look at what that looks like, actually, because I can say that all I want.

25
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.220
But the visual speaks more than words, doesn't it?

26
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.500
Account background.

27
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.940
Let's close that off and then let's go inside of here and let's say let's get our account cover going

28
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.120
on and let's let's self close that tag.

29
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.260
Let's import it.

30
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.390
And once we have that.

31
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.370
What's going oh, this is the register screen.

32
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.340
Well, first of all, I need to be on the account screen, which is the one being rendered right now.

33
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:58.560
And so once we're in the in the screen, we'll do account cover and then we'll open up the tag here

34
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.510
of account background and we'll put the account cover in here.

35
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.470
And once we do that, automatically a bit lighter.

36
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.950
And you can see here, if we play around with the opacity, we put it at zero point five zero point

37
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.800
six zero point nine.

38
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.480
It's going to get lighter and lighter until we don't see anything.

39
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.570
Zero point three for me, felt like the best middle ground.

40
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:28.440
You can put point four point to be a little more color interference coming in zero point three, honestly,

41
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.510
for me was perfect.

42
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.860
And so I kept it at that level.

43
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.170
And let's look at what's going on on Android and if we open up that app in the expo.

44
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.770
We'll see the account cover pop up as well.

45
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.410
Now, playing with the aesthetics of these things obviously can be a bit.

46
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.810
Like tinkering, you want it to look nice for your visual, it doesn't necessarily need to be the exact

47
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:55.490
same thing we're doing.

48
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.490
You could you could even do a light green, light blue background.

49
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.310
Let's do twenty five.

50
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.120
But you could you could do something like this and give it a blue opacity.

51
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.540
You know, it really depends on the eye that you have and what you find to look nice, personalize this

52
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.620
app as much as you need to.

53
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.190
And as we can see here, an android looks exactly the same.

54
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.080
Beautiful, absolutely stunning.

55
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.630
Blueberry's we're in right straight competition with you with our meals to go.

56
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.340
Just joking.

57
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.560
We can't compete with Obreht breeds.

58
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.950
That being said, visually very pleasing app.
