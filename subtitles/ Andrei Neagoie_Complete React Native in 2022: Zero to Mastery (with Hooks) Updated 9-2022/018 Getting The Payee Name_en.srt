1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:06,240
I always think to myself, when I build the future, hey, how difficult is this really going to be

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,790
at any time, check out flaws thrown at me.

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,670
Get excited because they're so difficult, like, sure, we're decomposing this into a simple way,

4
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:23,630
but to be honest, payment flows are one of the most complex things you may run into.

5
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:29,830
And in this particular scenario, we're giving you the grassroots implementation of one that you can

6
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:34,840
build upon, that you can make more complex, that you can add and remove from and all of that good

7
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,080
stuff.

8
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,500
And that that makes me excited.

9
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:41,910
Now, over here, are you guys built to the extent that the credit card information can be filled in,

10
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,530
but we want to add some more sush to it, right?

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,120
We want to judge it up, if that's a term at all.

12
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,180
We want to make it prettier and more nice.

13
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:59,740
But in any case, over here, after the last section, we have our total and then we have a spacer in

14
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,640
our credit card input.

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:08,650
But we want to add some more interactivity here again, should it up now in order for us to do that,

16
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:15,420
what we need to do is also implement the name input.

17
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:15,820
Right.

18
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:21,030
Because in the credit card component, we need to take in the name of the person.

19
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,740
Right now, we just hardcoded it, but let's get rid of that.

20
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:29,350
So let's go back to our checkout screen and let's figure out how we're going to get that name input

21
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:29,660
going.

22
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:36,910
So the first thing we'll need is we're going to need a name over here, name and set name.

23
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,100
And that's going to be equal to use state.

24
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,670
And we're going to give it an empty text.

25
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:43,470
Right.

26
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,760
That's what we're going to input here.

27
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:50,320
And the reason that we're going to do it that way will actually, you know, let's let's give it.

28
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,250
No, let's not let's not even give it a value at all.

29
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:58,510
And so the reason we're going to do that is because right here before credit card input, we're going

30
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,640
to build something called a name input.

31
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:08,800
And that name input is going to be very important because if we do not have a name, we're not going

32
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,150
to show the credit card.

33
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,240
We're going to hide it until you fill in a name that's going to give it a little bit of, you guessed

34
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,140
it, judge.

35
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:17,990
Oh, God.

36
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:22,440
I'll stop now, but it's going to make it a bit more interactive and a bit prettier.

37
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,920
So now that we know that we're going to build name input, where's that going to come from?

38
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:33,550
Well, it's going to come over here from our components in the styles, Check-Out Styles and the name

39
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:38,970
input in checkout styles is going to be very important to us.

40
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:46,930
So right over here, what we're going to do is build out export consed name input and that's going to

41
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,950
be equal to a styled text input.

42
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:56,930
And what we're going to give it is kind of a nice margin around it.

43
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:08,740
Let's let's go ahead and grab margin and let's say props and we'll say props, dot theme thought space

44
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,850
and let's see three.

45
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:11,830
There we go.

46
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,640
Where is text.

47
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,140
But if we're going to come from the well that's going to come from react need of paper.

48
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:17,760
You guessed it.

49
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:18,250
Right.

50
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,510
And so now if we go look at our checkout flow, there we go.

51
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:28,040
A nice name input, but why isn't our name hiding?

52
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:34,710
Oh, well, we have to make sure that we have a name value not not have a name value.

53
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,130
OK, so the logic is important there.

54
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,820
So now I feel in MO, is it going to show.

55
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,250
Oh but yeah.

56
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,660
Well we haven't really added any interactivity to it of course.

57
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,780
So how would that work.

58
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,020
What is that going to look like.

59
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:54,520
First of all, let's give the name and put a label and let's call it name.

60
00:03:55,270 --> 00:04:00,850
And then what we're going to do is we're going to say the value is equal to name.

61
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:07,570
And then what we're going to do is we're going to say on change text, we're going to get some type

62
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,130
of text value.

63
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:09,490
Right.

64
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,800
And we're going to call that and then we're going to say set name to T.

65
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:21,670
And so now we've linked the name input into our set name.

66
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:27,940
And that means now when I fill in MO here, any time I fill in anything, oh, text strings must be

67
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,320
rendered with a text component.

68
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,570
That's not good.

69
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:35,140
That means that when we delete our name right over here, it's breaking.

70
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:39,490
So what we need to do is we need to say over here.

71
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,190
Ifti.

72
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,860
Right, so if text length.

73
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,100
If that length.

74
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:55,640
Otherwise, we're going to set name.

75
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:04,940
To not and by doing this, what we're going to enable ourselves to do right here, I seem to have a

76
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,000
small issue.

77
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,520
There we go.

78
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,620
Let's do this and that.

79
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,520
And then let's put this here where we go.

80
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:17,990
So we're going to say over here and on change text, if the text has a length, set the name to the

81
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,630
text, otherwise set it to not.

82
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,860
And this will allow us the following.

83
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,680
If we add this to CART, we fill in MO here.

84
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:28,430
Now it's going to show, but if we delete, it's going to hide.

85
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,610
And that's because we're setting the name to not in this case.

86
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:34,070
What it was setting the name to over here was this.

87
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:40,310
And if you set the name to an empty string, well, now this is going to break.

88
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,950
Another way to get around that is, for instance, we could remove this logic completely.

89
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,490
Right.

90
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:55,010
And what we could do up here is we could say set name by default to an empty string and then here if

91
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,240
name the length.

92
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:06,860
And that way now if we go look, huh, must be rendered with a text component, so let's do greater

93
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:13,640
than zero and there we go at and if we put Moe here now, it's going to show if we remove it, it's

94
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,120
going to hide.

95
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,520
Mau Mau Mau, Mau Mau Mau Mau.

96
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:18,810
There we go.

97
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,960
So we have the interactivity there for the name and put.

98
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:30,050
Next up, we're going to link this back into the credit card input.

99
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,770
So we're going to say name is equal to name.

100
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:38,870
And now when we fill in a credit card input, we're going to get the name that we fill in to this field

101
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,030
to come in to the credit card input.

102
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:45,320
So if you fill in Rubini Mobeen, he's going to come into the credit card input.

103
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:52,130
OK, so now that we've made it here, next up, we should look at how to process the payment, what

104
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:56,120
what that button is going to look like and how to clear the card.
