1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:09,730
Oh, we have a bug if we look at a restaurant favourite's bar here, the images are loading on iOS but

2
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:10,730
not on Android.

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,580
Now, why would that be?

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:21,560
Well, remember when we originally set up the restaurant compact info to work in a certain way?

5
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:29,950
Well, if we go look at compact restaurant info, if it was Android, it was going to load the Web view,

6
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,700
but we wanted that specifically only for the mapu.

7
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:44,080
So what we should add here is a specific trigger that we're going to check and we're going to call it.

8
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:48,880
Well, we know that naming is hard, so we'll call it is map.

9
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:57,880
And we'll check if it is Android and and it is MAP, then we'll render the compact with you and so on

10
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:03,730
the map, we're going to go inside of the screen and we're going to say that the map call-out, which

11
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:08,560
is this component over here, we're going to say is map.

12
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:17,320
And so this will allow us to render out the correct view for the favorites locally.

13
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,080
Right in the favorites bar.

14
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:24,760
We still want to use an image component, even if we're on Android, because we specifically only had

15
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,430
the bug with the image view inside of the mapu.

16
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:32,460
So we didn't want to trigger that logic when we weren't on the map for you.

17
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,630
And so that's important to note here.

18
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:41,260
And so what you can see here is, of course, the images don't correspond because we're randomly selecting

19
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:41,560
images.

20
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,360
Of course, if I deselected reselect, you'll see the image pop up.

21
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,270
This is because we're randomly selecting images for each restaurant.

22
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,830
And so this can happen.

23
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,950
The images may not match up, but that's completely fine.

24
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:57,470
As we can see, the feature is working as intended.

25
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:04,590
And on the map view, we are still rendering out the images in the Westview correctly as intended.

26
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,180
So the bug fix for the map is still there.

27
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:10,530
But we aren't breaking the favorites bar on Android anymore.
