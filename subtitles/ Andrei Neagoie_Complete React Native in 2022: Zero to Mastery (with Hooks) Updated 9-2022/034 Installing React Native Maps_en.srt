1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:06,870
Now that we have to render a mapu, we have to do our research, what exactly do we use?

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,690
And luckily, because we are in an export controlled environment, the export docks can point us in

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,700
different directions when it comes to utilizing specific functionality.

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:24,630
And when we look it up, what we can see is that they have a MAPU implementation, specifically with

5
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,640
Riak native maps, which provides a map component that uses Apple Maps or Google Maps depending on the

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,400
platform you are on and on.

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:39,700
Android and EXPL uses react native maps from the community, no set up required for use within the client.

8
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,370
Now what do we need to do in order to get this up and running?

9
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:49,140
Well, all we need to do is run expo, install react native maps.

10
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,540
So let's go ahead and do that.

11
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:57,930
So if we go over here to our app and we open up our terminal, what we're going to be able to do is

12
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,880
run that command in a new terminal X will install react native maps.

13
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,880
And while that's happening, let's go back to the documentation, as we can see here, in order to utilize

14
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,570
Riak native maps.

15
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,500
And you can see the full documentation app react, native community, react, native maps.

16
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:21,780
We can import a map for you from Riak native maps to say that 50 more times react native maps.

17
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,700
In any case, we're able to import a map you and with that map, you were able to give it a specific

18
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,580
style and it will just render out a map.

19
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:36,750
Now with that map, we can then give it directionality in terms of which location to render out what

20
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,830
specific zoom level to be at and where to put pin markers.

21
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:47,600
Now, you can try this out on an example stack, and that will bring you to an example snack that will

22
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,280
run react native maps.

23
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:56,180
And if we tap to play here, we can obviously run the map inside of an actual project and test it out

24
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:02,150
before we get into the nitty gritty of specifically what we're trying to accomplish ourselves.

25
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:09,380
Now we have Riak native maps installed and the next thing we need to do is we need to make sure that

26
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,420
our navigation is set up correctly.

27
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,910
So if we go into our.

28
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:21,120
Infrastructure and we go into navigation, what we can see here is at the App Navigator level, we still

29
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:30,770
have the setup that was previously done for the map, which is an inline function right here.

30
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,040
Well, not an inline function.

31
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,660
It is a component function outside of the body, but it's in line in this file.

32
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:44,040
And so what we want to do here now is, first of all, we want to go into our restaurants and we want

33
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,060
to build for the restaurants a new feature, what we're going to call it.

34
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,910
Well, we could we could either build it inside of restaurants, but we're going to create a new feature

35
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,820
and we are going to call it map.

36
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:05,000
And that feature map is going to have a screens folder and you folder screens and inside of that screens

37
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:05,390
folder.

38
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:10,450
We're going to create a new file and we're going to call it the map screen.

39
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:18,890
My thoughts screenshot G.S. and so inside of that map screen, what we need to do is we need to, first

40
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:23,540
of all, import react and the mapu from react native maps.

41
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:33,120
Then what we need to do is we need to ensure that we're able to utilize all of the functionality that

42
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,930
we require.

43
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:42,720
So what we're going to do is we're going to export CONSED map screen and that's going to render out

44
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,910
the map view initially.

45
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,230
That's what we'll do.

46
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:55,350
And then we'll take map screen, we'll go back to our app Navigator will remove this initial map implementation

47
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:06,570
and we will import the map screen from dot, dot, dot, dot slash features, map screens, slash map

48
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:06,930
screen.

49
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:14,420
OK, now that we have our map screen me, we have to ensure that it is properly being used here.

50
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:21,110
And once we do that, what we can see here in our app is that when we reload.

51
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:30,020
If we go to the map now, once everything is loaded, we go to the map, oh, nothing's being loaded

52
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:30,720
just yet.

53
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:31,940
Why is that?

54
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,560
Well, let's give it a style.

55
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,810
And let's say that the style is height, 100 percent width.

56
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,270
And then let's let's leave the with off for now.

57
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:44,240
And now we can see that we're rendering an entire mafune side of here.

58
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:51,920
And if we go over to Android and we run the same exact thing, what we'll be able to see over here is

59
00:04:51,920 --> 00:05:00,590
that once it loads the map, screen should also render out the map, but this time with Google Maps.

60
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,710
So we have our map implementation working here now.

61
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:11,120
And from here we can start layering on the functionality in terms of rendering out the right zone,

62
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:19,010
putting on the map markers and all of that good stuff, as well as triggering a redirect to the restaurant

63
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,240
detail when we click on a marker.

64
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:22,550
Good stuff.

65
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,450
A couple of easy installs and we are good to go.
