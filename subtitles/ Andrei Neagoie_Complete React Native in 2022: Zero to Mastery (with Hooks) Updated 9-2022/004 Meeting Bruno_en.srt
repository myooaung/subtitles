1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:02,950
Congratulations.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,920
This is a big day for you, why?

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:10,240
Well, you just got hired at the biggest tech firm in the world.

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:11,260
That's right.

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:11,920
You know it.

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,570
I know it.

7
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:16,930
It's Kako Corp. They do a bunch of things.

8
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,900
They're a big Silicon Valley tech startup.

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,260
And they recently created their mobile division.

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:30,370
Right here in this new mobile division is going to create some amazing apps that are going to take over

11
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:30,800
the world.

12
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:38,740
And lucky for you, Bruno, right here with the perfect hair, just hired you as the lead of their mobile

13
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,940
division and.

14
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:41,880
Classic Bruno.

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,300
He has a great idea, you know what people love?

16
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,600
People love to be on their phones.

17
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,170
You know what else people love?

18
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,490
They love food.

19
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:51,710
People need to eat food.

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:59,690
So he's combining the two ideas and says, hey, let's build a mobile app that allows our customers

21
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:04,310
to discover new restaurants, new food places, new takeout options.

22
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:10,130
He thinks this is going to be the next big idea and he wants you to build it.

23
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:16,310
But here's the thing, you're just starting out, sure, you passed the interview and Bruno hired you,

24
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,230
but how do you actually build a mobile app?

25
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,760
What technology does how do you even get started?

26
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:25,150
And this course is all about that.

27
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:31,910
We're going to take you from scratch to building a fully production ready mobile app and making our

28
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:37,850
boss, Bruno, happy, because I have a feeling that when things don't go his way, he's going to be

29
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:38,860
very angry with us.

30
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,080
But don't worry, we got you covered.

31
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,740
We're going to start from the beginning.

32
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,160
Learn the basics, figure out how we're going to build the app.

33
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:46,920
Hint, hint.

34
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,730
We're going to use react native and then build an app that will take over the world.

35
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,810
Exciting times ahead.

36
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,270
Let's get started.
