WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:06.100
So we've installed yarn and now we actually need to get into the majority of the setup here.

2
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.060
The next thing we need and the thing that the snake was focusing on so heavily for us is everything

3
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.950
to do with XPO, which is a package.

4
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:14.260
Right.

5
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.140
It's a package that's handling the majority of this for us.

6
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.660
So what we want to do is we want a pseudo again and we want a pseudo NPM install minus G explosively.

7
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.950
And that's going to globally install especially for us.

8
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.600
And that specialize is what's going to be handling, you know, running the app, communicating and

9
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.380
all of this different stuff that we're going to see.

10
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.190
So just wait until this fully installs.

11
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:49.580
And once it's fully installed, we'll be able to try to run our app locally.

12
00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.120
Now that it's done installing explosively, let's do something called cat packaged up, Jason, and

13
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.740
I know we're doing a lot in common line and we'll get to installing an ED and all of that good stuff.

14
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.970
But I want to make sure that your local setup is as robust as possible.

15
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.170
So if we can package that, Jason, in the focus time folder, always make sure that you're in the right

16
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.540
folder.

17
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.590
We can do something called scripts.

18
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.240
Scripts can be executed.

19
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.410
So we have a start.

20
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.440
We have an Android, we have an iOS, we have a Web and we have an object.

21
00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.850
And ejecting is the ability to eject out of XPO at any given point.

22
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.810
We don't need to do that right now or maybe at all.

23
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.260
Who knows, following the course jokes.

24
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:42.220
But we installed Xcode locally, so let's try to run Jaan HIJOS and so it's going to do expose start

25
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.620
iOS, it's going to open the developer tools.

26
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.860
And so over here you can see that it's going to ask us to allow access to the control system events

27
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:51.940
to the documents folder.

28
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.950
We're going to allow all of that.

29
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.470
And over here you can see it's starting.

30
00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.000
A simulator in the simulator is going to be what's running our app.

31
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.160
And over here you're going to see that it's it's going to be doing a bunch of stuff, open expo dev

32
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.700
tools.

33
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.650
It's going to tell you what you're really running.

34
00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:13.920
This is the same you URL and it's going to say starting the iOS simulator.

35
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.500
This may take a moment and this can take a while, as you can see over here.

36
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.100
It's trying to install and it's waiting because this is still booting up, we're just waiting for all

37
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.800
of this to kind of round out and once it's rounded out, we'll see the simulator pop up boot and have

38
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.090
the expo app installed.

39
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.790
It's going to ask us to open Expo.

40
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.260
We're going to say open and boom.

41
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.310
Expos opened and what's happening now, it's bundling, the JavaScript that's bundling, it's getting

42
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.380
our code on the phone, on the simulator, so we're running it on our own computer.

43
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.130
Exciting stuff.

44
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.090
Exciting stuff.

45
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.500
OK, so it's bundling.

46
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.960
And down here, you can see the progress it's making.

47
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.750
And over here you can see the same amount of progress.

48
00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.870
So you have two indicators of the progress.

49
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.110
And now that we're running it locally on our simulator, what you're going to be able to see is that,

50
00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:15.410
hey, our app Focus Time is running on this simulator and we can fill stuff in, we can press plus we

51
00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.490
can start it off.

52
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:24.020
It's going to start counting down and eventually it's going to finish the task and boom, we're done.

53
00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.480
We're able to run our app locally.

54
00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:36.650
OK, so running the app locally tells us that we're in a good state and you could even take this local

55
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:45.380
installation and run it on your phone by saying, hey, um, scanning this QR code and as long as you're

56
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.340
on the same Wi-Fi network, you can run it off of your own computer.

57
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.900
That's great.

58
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.790
You could toggle production mode.

59
00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.770
And so then it's going to make a production build.

60
00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:02.550
Honestly, so simple, couple of commands, a couple of installs, a couple of packages we needed and

61
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.320
we're running it on iOS already.

62
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.700
Amazing.

63
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.450
Now let's look at how to run it on Android locally.
