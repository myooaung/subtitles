00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.580
One feature we haven't gotten to yet and one that would really spruce up our app is the ability to take

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.660
a profile picture.

3
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.870
And the way that we want to do that is we want to store it locally, but we want to initialize a camera

4
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.990
module in order for us to be able to take pictures of ourselves while we record in this case.

5
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:28.080
And so by doing that, we'll be able to store the image of the user and no, subsequently who they are,

6
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.800
where they are.

7
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.800
And we will do it with the front facing camera in order to have the ability to store that profile picture

8
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.330
against the user account and thus load it when they log in.

9
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.790
And that ability will allow us to have a more personalized experience for the user.

10
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.340
So knowing that, let's get started on how to do this.
