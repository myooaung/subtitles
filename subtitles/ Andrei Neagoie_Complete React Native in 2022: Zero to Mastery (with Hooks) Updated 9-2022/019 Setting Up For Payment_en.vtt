00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.990
Now that we're able to process the name of the person that's going to pay, what we want to do next

2
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.930
is we want to set ourselves up to be able to pay and also to handle Arab states as well as clear the

3
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:12.830
cart now.

4
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:21.530
First off, I want to create some more space between this name input and the actual credit card input,

5
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.650
because I feel like they're too close together.

6
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.700
And by doing that, a bit more breathability here, don't you think, now?

7
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.430
Next stop, what we're going to want to do is we're going to want to add two buttons.

8
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.090
We're going to add a pay button.

9
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.630
And we're going to add a clear button.

10
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.610
And yes, that these buttons, they're going to come from the styles file, pay button, clear button.

11
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:54.690
So what we want to do with these buttons is basically we want to enable ourselves to render out the

12
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.410
proper kind of interaction for the user.

13
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:05.670
So let's do export consed pay button and we'll do that equal to a style of type of button.

14
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.360
Now that button, of course, coming from Riak need of paper is going to be the button we'll be using.

15
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.210
And what we're going to do with that button is we're going to set the attributes ahead of time.

16
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:26.310
So some props and what we're going to set is we're going to set the color to colors, the brand thought

17
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.090
primary.

18
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:36.340
And then we're going to set some particular styles on it, what we're going to set first is we're going

19
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.910
to set the width to 80 percent, right?

20
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.920
And so by doing that, where you can see here is, well, first of all, isn't defined here, so let's

21
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:52.540
go ahead and import colors from and then let's say dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, slash infrastructure

22
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.280
theme colors.

23
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.780
There we go.

24
00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:02.950
And if we go over here to check out and we added something to check out, oops, the clear button hasn't

25
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:03.540
been defined.

26
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.210
So let's go ahead and take that, let's say clear button over here.

27
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:15.160
And for the clear button, we might want to use colors, dot ui dot error, because we want it to be

28
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.830
a little bit less flashy.

29
00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.640
So if we add to the special over here and we went to our checkout screen, well, we're missing something

30
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.000
nothing is showing right now.

31
00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.310
Well, of course not, because we're not really rendering anything.

32
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.870
What we want to say here is clear cut and then we want to see clear button.

33
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.600
And over here, we want to say pay now.

34
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.120
Or rather pay and let's say pay button, and if we do that and clear.

35
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.730
OK, great.

36
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.830
So now we can do something along the lines of what we've done so far, which is we'll set mode equal

37
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:55.940
to contained on them.

38
00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.050
And you could do this on the attributes as well.

39
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.680
I just prefer to do it right here.

40
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.410
It really doesn't matter.

41
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.250
So you can see over here is that the pay button in the clear button are on the screen now.

42
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.730
Now we want them to align a bit more.

43
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.270
So how are we going to do that?

44
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.750
Well, first of all, let's do a line self center on both of these.

45
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.110
Right.

46
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.210
And so they'll center themselves.

47
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.070
And then next up, what we need to do is we need to give them a little bit of padding.

48
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.530
So let's take this margin and let's do padding instead.

49
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.490
And then let's add the same padding over here.

50
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:42.750
Now, three is a bit big, so maybe we should go with something a little less on the nose, maybe a

51
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.140
two.

52
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:51.950
Two feels a little bit more spacious looks that looks pretty good to me now if we add Moe here, they're

53
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.910
a bit close to the input as well.

54
00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.730
It's a bit it's a bit much.

55
00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.740
So what we can do is we can we can just add, you know, a couple of spacers here.

56
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:04.120
Right.

57
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.940
If we do this still a bit close, that's a bit better.

58
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:08.780
Maybe a little more.

59
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.080
There we go.

60
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.820
That feels good.

61
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.500
So maybe we should add a new type of spacer extra extra large, maybe.

62
00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:24.600
Well, if we go into space or we can kind of see what we need to do in order to achieve that.

63
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:32.670
And so for us to be able to achieve a different type of spacer, what we can do is we can say extra

64
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.560
large is for an extra extra large as five.

65
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:44.400
And by doing that now, we've created the proper amount of space between the buttons and the input.

66
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.750
But we still need some space between these two buttons.

67
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.260
Now, maybe not an extra extra large, but maybe just a regular large.

68
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.740
And doesn't that look good?

69
00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:03.090
Now, you could go ahead and wrap this around the clear button again in order to allow yourself the

70
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.120
ability to see it when you are debugging the UI.

71
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:13.470
And so now that we have these buttons in place and we're able to pay and clear, well, what should

72
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.720
the clear button do and what should the button do?

73
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.870
Well, first of all, let's let's take it a step back.

74
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.780
Let's add some icons cities, because it would look nicer with icons.

75
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.840
Let's say icon is equal to Cache USD.

76
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.580
And over here in the clear button, let's say that the icon is equal to cart off.

77
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:38.650
There we go, that looks a bit better and then one more thing we need to do is we need to add the ability

78
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.320
of on press and so on press.

79
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:48.910
I want to clear the cart here so we'll we'll take an clear cart from the cart functions over here.

80
00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:57.320
And on success, well, on press, I really don't have anything I can just do yet, right?

81
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.980
I can console vlog success, right.

82
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.200
Or I really don't have my payment right.

83
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.110
Or it's like P now is rather what it is.

84
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.380
So if I order the special right now, this is console logging, this clears the cart.

85
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:18.670
If I order again, clear the cart for order again and so forth and so forth.

86
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:28.220
So now we kind of have everything more or less set up to start building out, first of all, the press

87
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:34.340
for the payment function and also some light error handling if that comes into play here.

88
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:42.120
Now for the next portion, I'll be focusing on the payment flow first and then we'll come back to Aaron.
