00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:06.810
Hey, folks, so I know it may seem like we're going a bit slow here at the start, but that's because

2
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.460
I absolutely want to make sure that everyone can follow along.

3
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.930
And it's imperative that during this course you have the easiest time possible hitting the ground running

4
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.370
and building your mobile app.

5
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.940
And part of that is this phone connection over here.

6
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.610
That's 80 percent of the challenge.

7
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.650
The code is easy, but being able to visualize what you're doing is so powerful.

8
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:40.950
And just with all of that, I wanted to give a quick summary of some of the core things that we're seeing

9
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.730
over here, some of the core things that you're going to have to pay attention to.

10
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.350
So, as we said, you can tell your preview on and off.

11
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.640
You could see how many devices are connected.

12
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:57.030
Most iPhone is connected and you can reload the app, but you could see the version of overrunning.

13
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.780
You can put your editor in a dark theme or a light theme, whatever you prefer.

14
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.840
I'm going to switch it to dark theme if you want the mode.

15
00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.540
If you're aware of what that is, turn it on.

16
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.040
If you're not aware of what it is, I would steer clear of it because it can be daunting.

17
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.590
It's a whole different skill that you would need to learn.

18
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.000
And then you see here, over here the prettier.

19
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.830
So let's say you're typing a bunch of code and you're doing like and and all of this stuff.

20
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.270
If you hit prettier, well, it's not going to do anything because all of this code is invalid.

21
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.550
But let's say you did something like.

22
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.100
Color white, you see how this is off balance.

23
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.280
Well, if you hit prettier boom, everything makes sense.

24
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.720
It makes things pretty.

25
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.730
No pun intended, it's just the name of the tool.

26
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.360
So with that, we've gone through a couple of interface run downs by now, and I just want to show you

27
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.960
a bit more.

28
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.640
But now comes the interesting part.

29
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.570
So we're looking over.

30
00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.730
Here are our entry file where we are coming in.

31
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.130
And where the core of the application is, think of it as the tip of the sword, it's where everything

32
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.820
comes together.

33
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.949
It's where our app comes to life.

34
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.680
So over here, you can see we're importing react from react.

35
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.150
This is because we want to be able to write what is just X, you ask?

36
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.920
Well, it's JavaScript markup.

37
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.260
It basically allows us to write things like this and have them be able to be processed and understood

38
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:36.090
and react is one of the core libraries that react native users to achieve the simplicity of being able

39
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.130
to write, react like syntax without needing to learn.

40
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.510
Android, iOS.

41
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.200
It's the language in the library of choice for making the UI work.

42
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.460
But, of course, react is just one piece of the puzzle, because we're not writing react, no, no,

43
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.570
we're writing react native.

44
00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.250
And so he over here, you can see we're importing text view stylesheet in this import.

45
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:09.990
What this is basically giving us is it's pulling the right components that we need in order to build

46
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.740
up our UI.

47
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.410
So we're able to input text like we can see here.

48
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.160
Hello, world.

49
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:20.340
We're able to put blocks on the screen, like if you're aware what web development device, you're able

50
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.540
to position them on the screen and give them a nice, pretty look in position.

51
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:30.600
And a stylesheet and a stylesheet is a concept that you may not be familiar with unless you've written

52
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:39.870
Kissinger's a stylesheet is basically for us the ability to write our styles, give our views a specific

53
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:48.570
position, markup, text, color, background, color, give our text a specific text color, bold italic,

54
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.340
specific font family.

55
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:57.660
Give it a nice pizzazz, you know, and then we see here, XPO, Constance and the Constance are basically

56
00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.720
constants that can be used for specific values.

57
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.580
We're not currently using it in this file.

58
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:10.300
But over here, you see one of the core things that you will see export default function.

59
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.720
This is a whole mouthful of words.

60
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:21.269
Export default is basically telling us this file exports this one main thing.

61
00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:24.850
Now, it can export multiple things, but this is the one main thing.

62
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.940
It exports and it exports function app.

63
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.400
This is the thing that pulls everything together, that tip of the sword, if you will.

64
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.980
It's the thing that is going to build up the UI in such a way that we're going to be building focus.

65
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.830
Time now over here where the parentheses open.

66
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:49.660
You can see the function body and in the function body we're returning a simple react UI that consists

67
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.300
of a view and a text Hello world like we saw and saw this view.

68
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.700
As you can see, it has a style.

69
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.610
So it has a specific look and feel to it.

70
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.430
Now, what does that look and feel look like?

71
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.390
Well, it's referencing styles, dot container object dot.

72
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.850
And then something in that object, so object or container, so in that object, we have another object

73
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:19.530
called container and we can see over here it's giving it Fleck's one and padding 50.

74
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:25.010
Now, something you need to understand is if you've written CSFs before, if you're familiar with Fleck's

75
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.890
box and all these things, this will be very familiar syntax to you.

76
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.890
But if you're new to all of this, basically what Fleck's box is, is it's a paradigm that will be going

77
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.800
deeper into as we go along the course.

78
00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.830
It's a way to make the UI.

79
00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:48.500
But fit in a way that makes sense, and so flex box, as it says, it flexes itself out.

80
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.590
And so with the container, as we see flex, one container is the top level.

81
00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.790
So what Flex one says is, hey, I'm going to fill everything of the parent.

82
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.310
Now, everything of the parent is the app.

83
00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:02.810
So it's the whole shell.

84
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.190
So Flex one is basically saying, hey, I'm going to fill the whole screen.

85
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:08.900
That's basically what it's saying.

86
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:15.470
And then padding fifty saying, OK, well, I'm going to put a padding on the outside from here, from

87
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.400
the right, from the bottom of 50 pixels.

88
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.930
If we said, hey, do it a five hundred.

89
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.840
Well we're going to see hello world shift off screen.

90
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.280
If we did it of one hundred, we're going to see hello world pop up over here.

91
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.660
If we did it of ten, we're going to see it pop up over here.

92
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.910
And so basically padding is a way for us to say, hey, where am I?

93
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.440
And you could specify padding top specifically.

94
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.030
You could specify padding left, you specify padding, right, padding bottom.

95
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.150
If you just do padding, it's going to apply to all four.

96
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.790
Padding, top, bottom, left, right.

97
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.430
And why do we use stylesheet thought?

98
00:06:52.760 --> 00:07:02.630
Well, it has inherent optimisations of applying certain memory, efficient styling, right?

99
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:07.240
It's not going to always have to recalculate everything.

100
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:13.760
It kind of is a bit smarter because you could also do something like this and override it in line.

101
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:19.140
But now on every render of the app, it's going to have to recalculate this.

102
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:23.380
So there are many benefits that come from using the stylesheet create.

103
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:29.030
And there are many other libraries that you can use on top of it and and do more complex UI layouts

104
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:29.960
and all of this jazz.

105
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.250
And we're going to get into all of that.

106
00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:31.780
Don't worry.

107
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:35.240
But this is the most basic that you can get.

108
00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.320
And so it's important to know what exactly is going on here.
