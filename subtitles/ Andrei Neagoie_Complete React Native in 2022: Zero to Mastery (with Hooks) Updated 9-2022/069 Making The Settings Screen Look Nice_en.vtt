00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.120
So first and foremost, we want to polish this screen a bit more.

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:12.300
And in order to do that, let's go ahead and let's import styled from styled components native.

3
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.280
And what we're going to do here is we're going to say expert const settings item we don't need to export.

4
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.060
Let's just say const settings item is equal to styled.

5
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:31.800
And let's take list that item, which we're going to style specifically with the padding that we require

6
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.330
over here, which is a padding of 16 all around, which means we're going to take the props and we're

7
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:46.290
going to say props that theme throughout space and we'll say maybe three, three sounds about right.

8
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.600
And by doing that now, we can replace list that item with setting that item.

9
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.110
Now we only want to replace the ones in the list.

10
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.460
So that means these two.

11
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.370
And that means we can also replace these two lines no longer needed because they're done over here.

12
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.390
Now, with that, we've cleaned up our implementation and the next thing we need to do is it'd be nice

13
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.500
to have an avatar to kind of show that this is the user page.

14
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.620
So let's import Avatar from Riak native paper.

15
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.030
And what we can do here is right above the list section.

16
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.540
I want to put an avatar icon of one hundred eighty of a human and let's give it a background color blue.

17
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.220
And what we can see over here is, oh, that looks great.

18
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.620
It's just not really centered, is it doesn't really look like it's in the right spot.

19
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:45.240
So what we're going to do is we're going to see CONSED Avatar container is equal to styled dot view.

20
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:53.250
And what we're going to see here is that the line items of this view is going to be set to center and

21
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.960
we're going to take that Avatar container.

22
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.140
We're going to wrap that around the Avatar icon.

23
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.960
And by doing that, we should now have centered our avatar icon.

24
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.950
Beautiful.

25
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.870
Now, one more thing we want to do is we want to grab user from here, because I would like for us to

26
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.770
render some text.

27
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.770
So let's go ahead and import text from settings, components, typography, and then we'll say tech

28
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:20.700
stock component.

29
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:29.900
And we'll do a underneath the avatar, potentially, we'll do a spacer, let's also import a spacer.

30
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.450
Spaces are great, so let's import spacer from spacer spacer component.

31
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:46.670
And let's do a spacer of the position equalling top and the size equaling large.

32
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:54.720
And let's do that for a typography text where we're going to be rendering out the email of the user.

33
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.870
So let's say text here.

34
00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.290
Let's say variance is equal to caption.

35
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.870
And by doing this, what we're going to be allowing us to do is render out the user dot email.

36
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.110
So on the user, there should be an email profile.

37
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.870
And now if we open up our app oh, the emails right there.

38
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.060
So why isn't that rendering in the right spot?

39
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:22.420
Well, we should put that inside of the Avatar container so that it's also rendered inside of the center.

40
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.260
Amazing captures a bit small, so how about we use label and we can test that, we can try things out

41
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.270
that looks much, much better.

42
00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.560
And now favourite's is over here, which is rendering nothing currently and the logout feature works

43
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.690
great.

44
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:44.930
So now we've gone through and cleaned up our settings interface and it looks much, much more professional

45
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.980
by doing this.

46
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.190
Now, it says you've passed them in line function for the favorites, which is our render null over

47
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.050
here in our settings navigator.

48
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.570
And in the next video, what we're going to do is we're going to build out our favorites screen.
