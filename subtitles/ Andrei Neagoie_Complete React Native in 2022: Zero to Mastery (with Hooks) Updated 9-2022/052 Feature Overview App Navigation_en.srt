1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:01,940
What's next on the docket?

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:07,710
Well, it's good you ask, because now that we have the majority of our UI intact right here, right?

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:09,980
We have our search bar, we have our main content.

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,480
We have our list rendering.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,440
Well, what's next is we need some navigation up in here.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,440
We need to have that navigation goodness going on, which will also avoid this bar from showing up,

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,300
because with the navigation, we're basically negating the fact that this ugliness is happening.

8
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:33,020
So navigation is the next crucial piece that we will be focusing on.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,060
Now we'll have a restaurants tab, a map tab and a settings tab, and that's what we'll be focusing

10
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:38,250
on.

11
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:40,370
So let's go through the setup.
