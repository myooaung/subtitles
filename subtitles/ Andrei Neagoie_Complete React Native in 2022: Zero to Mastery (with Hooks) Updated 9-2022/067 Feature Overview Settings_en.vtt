00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:07.480
Now, we've reached the final part and one of the final features that will be building for the main

2
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.840
flow of meals to go, that is the settings flow.

3
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:20.470
Now, when we log in, whenever we log into our account, what we want to do is once we're logged in,

4
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.890
well, we're able to search for specific cities.

5
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:32.170
We're able to view our favorites, and we're even able to view our map view with our specific highlighted

6
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:33.490
dialogues.

7
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.380
But now our settings panel is kind of bleak.

8
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.040
It's kind of bleak.

9
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.820
And so we need to make it look a bit nicer.

10
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.140
And in order to do that, what we're going to do is we're going to build out an entire settings panel

11
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.460
where we will be able to view our favorites and also log out.

12
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:52.370
All right.

13
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.250
So let's get to it.
