1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:06,710
Now that we have a clean implementation for the UI when the cart is empty, now we have to look at when

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,230
the cart actually has it.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:14,990
And so the first thing, the easiest thing we can do is go play around with the restaurant.

4
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:15,760
Right.

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,730
We can go and fix up the way that's going to look.

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,630
And the way to do that for us is take this away.

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:30,650
And very simply, what we need to do is run throughout the restaurant info card.

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,560
And what we give it is the restaurant.

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,130
And if we set that equal to the restaurant, what we have now is a fully fledged feature.

10
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:40,410
Right.

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:47,600
So if we go over here and we were to say, you know, import the restaurant info card and we did that

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:55,250
from that start and then got out and we went to restaurants and we went to the components, then we

13
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,580
could say restaurant info card the components.

14
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,920
So we're importing a component from a different feature.

15
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:06,260
Now, this typically would mean that you would kind of split it out in some way.

16
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:11,960
I prefer to keep it in the feature because it's only being reused for visualization purposes, is not

17
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,920
really doing anything with it here.

18
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:19,970
So what we can see here is if I went ahead and I took this and I ordered a special.

19
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:25,940
Boom, that easy, and now this UI looks amazing.

20
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,970
It's already so much cleaner just by doing that one simple thing.

21
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:39,350
But now our cart cart really doesn't look all it does, it doesn't doesn't look special at all, doesn't

22
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:42,480
look like it's doing anything out of the ordinary.

23
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:48,010
So the first thing we're going to do over here is we're going to take a scroll, right.

24
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,600
We're going to take a scroll view from Riak native.

25
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,500
And the reason we're going to do that is because we want this interface below the card to be interactive,

26
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,330
because this takes up a lot of space already.

27
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:05,720
So we want to make sure that we have, you know, the proper amount of interaction available for the

28
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:12,320
user to be able to scroll because this is kind of a limited space right now.

29
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,770
What we need to do is take our credit card input, also put it inside there, of course.

30
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,180
And now we can start building up what the card should look like.

31
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:20,600
Right.

32
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,970
And what the card should look like is first of all.

33
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,520
Well, we need to use some spacers, don't we?

34
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:36,260
So what we want to do here is we want to say put a spacer here and wrap it around this text.

35
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,460
But will that make it look nice?

36
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,910
Well, let's take a look right here.

37
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,880
We put the spacer, let's order something and it's spacing it from the top.

38
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:51,870
So the first thing we want to do is we want to see space it from the left.

39
00:02:51,880 --> 00:03:00,370
So we say position is equal to left and then we say the size is equal to medium and that's indented

40
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,540
a bit from the side.

41
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:07,860
OK, now that we've done that, what we want to do is add some kind of title.

42
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,280
So there's really not much space between the top here and the text here.

43
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,360
So what we're going to do is we're going to say a top large.

44
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,710
And then what we're going to do is we're going to add a spacer here and what we're going to do with

45
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,220
that spacer is we're going to put some text inside of it.

46
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:32,940
And that text is going to be our actual title and what the title is going to be is your order.

47
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,620
Your order.

48
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,930
That's what it's going to say, so over here is where we'll start building up our order.

49
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,430
OK, so how do we do that?

50
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,360
What does that look like?

51
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:50,520
Well, we need to use some stuff that we would get from react native paper.

52
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,920
First of all, we need the list.

53
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:59,460
So let's import list and let's do that from react native paper.

54
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:08,100
And if we take the list, what we can do now is we can take our cart, right, because our cart is actually

55
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,750
a Arae.

56
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:18,029
We'll do a list that section here and inside of that list, that section is where we'll do an actual

57
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:21,870
map over our cart to figure out what exactly is in our cart.

58
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,600
So we do cardboard map and then we get an item.

59
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:32,740
And inside of that item is what we can consider to be our list dot item.

60
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,740
So what is going to be in our list item?

61
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,180
Well, this is a good question, because right now we're just mapping over we're not really returning

62
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:40,510
anything.

63
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,750
What should be in our list item?

64
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,410
Well, we could say that the title is equal to price item about price.

65
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,930
And let's see what that does.

66
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:57,900
So if we do that, we order twelve ninety nine, OK, so that doesn't look fairly like.

67
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:58,660
Right.

68
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,240
So let's divide that by one hundred.

69
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,190
And so now we're getting the right price.

70
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:10,530
OK, so maybe we'll put this in a template string and then we can start building up like more of a dynamic

71
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:11,520
string situation.

72
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,880
So then let's put in item that name.

73
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,590
Right.

74
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,890
Is that what we called it?

75
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,980
Oh, no, we called it item, that item.

76
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,650
So should this actually be called item?

77
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:28,630
Well, let's just the structure item off of here and price and that way we don't need to do a dot at

78
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:28,930
all.

79
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,650
And so now special twelve ninety nine.

80
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:37,310
Well, that looks much better already, doesn't it?

81
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:45,710
So right here, we've kind of built out this ability now if I order a second special and third special,

82
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:55,640
fourth and fifth special, now you can see that my order is spacing them out appropriately and that

83
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,900
looks way, way, way better.

84
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:05,660
Now, we could go and say, like, let's change it up and add some.

85
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:12,150
Right, because we see all the individual items, but we don't really see what the total is.

86
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:17,330
So if we say some set, some is equal to use state.

87
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:24,740
And we'll set it to zero to begin with and then we'll import you straight from react now, we can start

88
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,600
building up a some.

89
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,070
Now, how are we going to visualize that so?

90
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:36,860
Well, right here outside of our list section, what we can do is we can say text and then we can say

91
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,370
total.

92
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,580
And we'll put some right here.

93
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,090
I will do text.

94
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,370
Now, how do we calculate the sum?

95
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:52,420
Well, if we add something to the cart right now, it's set to zero, our total is zero.

96
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:56,210
So how could we go about calculating the sum?

97
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,030
Well, one of the ways we could do that is through, you guessed it, a use effect.

98
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:03,050
Right.

99
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:08,410
And if we grab a use effect and we put it right up here in the cart.

100
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:16,890
And we say run this use effect when the user cart changes, so any time the cart changes, run this

101
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:24,790
use effect, what we can do then is we can say something along the lines of if you do not have a car

102
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,500
length, then set the sum to zero.

103
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,650
If you do have a cart length, what you want to do is say something more complicated.

104
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,070
We can do set some.

105
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:42,310
And over here, obviously, we need to return in this case because we don't want to go ahead and do

106
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,100
this otherwise.

107
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:51,820
So otherwise, what we want to do is do cart thought, reduce and reduce function, takes in an accumulator

108
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:56,150
and then returns the object, the item that we're accumulating again.

109
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,170
So this would contain an item in price.

110
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,770
What we need is price.

111
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:07,780
And what we could see here is that once we take that accumulator and that price, we can run a function.

112
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,630
And that function can do something for us, so right here, this is our accumulator.

113
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,690
So what we could say here is that let's take this out of here.

114
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:23,860
Consed new some is equal to this.

115
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:32,830
Let's set up by default to zero and then let's say return accumulator plus equals the price.

116
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,320
And by doing this now, we can set to something new, some.

117
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:43,390
And by doing that, what we'll see over here is twelve ninety nine.

118
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:48,770
Now the last thing we need to do is also divide some by one hundred to get the actual price.

119
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:55,190
And now if we add multiple things to our cart, you can see the some updating.

120
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,980
So we're getting a new total each time.

121
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,620
Now, you may be asking yourself the question, well, why isn't this logic in the cart context?

122
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:10,620
Well, you could argue that the some of the cart is part of the cart context, but depending on where

123
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,640
you want to put it, I felt like the checkout screen could handle this now.

124
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:23,160
In essence, what you could also do is say take this code directly from here, like all of this, and

125
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:31,920
you could take in the sum from here and then you could go to cart context and you could do a very simple

126
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,720
implementation right over here where you taken the some.

127
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,130
And you return to some and boom, there you go, you've cleaned it up.

128
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:49,570
So if we go over here now and you do this twelve ninety nine, twenty five, ninety four and so forth.

129
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:55,060
So we started off in the checkout screen with the some action and then we we thought to ourselves,

130
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,700
huh, shouldn't this belong to the cart context.

131
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:58,540
Yeah.

132
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,690
It should be a cleaner if it just came from the cart.

133
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:02,050
Right.

134
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,470
The some, the some of the cart.

135
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,180
Yeah.

136
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:04,660
For sure.

137
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:09,790
So it's, it's about making those trade offs and making sure that you make the right decisions here.

138
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,650
And so now that we have the majority of the cart showing here.

139
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:15,040
Right.

140
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:22,210
And we have everything we need in order to kind of say, hey, this is the cart, this is what we're

141
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:25,690
ordering, can we start building our payment flow?

142
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,890
Baby, we're definitely close.

143
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,630
Maybe we should start looking at that.
