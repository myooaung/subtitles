1
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:08,029
Now that we have all of our dependencies installed and firebase functions set up properly, we can go

2
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:09,230
over to the package on.

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,500
What we can see here is that it has different scripts.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:21,720
It can run scripts, meaning that it is able to serve individual functions for Firebase out of the box.

5
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:26,960
Now, the ones that we have is serve, shell, start, deploy and logs.

6
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,350
All of these have a very specific function.

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,320
Deploy is going to deploy live and the shell is going to start a shell interface.

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,240
The serve is going to serve it locally and the logs is going to show us logs.

9
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:47,870
OK, so with that, the two most important ones we need to keep in our mind right now as we're building

10
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,800
something fairly simple is the serve and deploy.

11
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,230
The deploy is going to push it live.

12
00:00:54,410 --> 00:01:00,170
So it's going to be hosted on Firebase at that point and the serve is going to host it locally.

13
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,080
Now, why would we want to host it locally?

14
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,920
Why would we want to take our function and try it out locally?

15
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:11,300
Well, while we're developing, what we want to be able to do is we want to be able to test what we're

16
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:17,330
doing in a local environment so that if we did anything wrong, anything wrong at all, a for loop that

17
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:23,870
went wrong, an infinite loop that's happening, anything at all, it can be caught before it goes live

18
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:27,200
into production and potentially incurs this costs.

19
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:33,680
And we have the benefit of developing locally before pushing globally so we can test everything out

20
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:34,510
locally.

21
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,490
So what happens if we do can't serve.

22
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:45,790
Well, if we run your serve right now, it's going to host our functions on localhost five thousand

23
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:46,210
and one.

24
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,120
And we can see it in the Emulator UI through localhost 4000 function.

25
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:57,570
Now it's saying watching the directory functions for cloud function.

26
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,310
Interesting, so it's watching directory right now, we don't have any cloud functions, and if we go

27
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:06,070
look at next year, well, everything is disabled.

28
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:14,260
So if we remove the marks over here and we save so that we use our excellent and our prettier, what

29
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:21,230
we're going to see is that, oh, initialize the function htp five thousand one miles to go.

30
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,430
So our project ID the U.S. central one.

31
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,020
Hello World.

32
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:32,290
So this has become a function that is now being served locally by the Firebase Emulator Suite.

33
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:40,060
So this is something that's emulating Firebase itself on our local machine so that we can run functions

34
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,790
for Firebase, test them out on our machine.

35
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,850
OK, so what happens if I go to this URL directly?

36
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:54,260
Well, it's going to say hello from Firebase and hello from Firebase is exactly what we put in the response

37
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,000
thought send.

38
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,220
Now this is basically a node Jase's function.

39
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:05,780
It's a server, but it's running on Firebase as a singular instance, one function that's just going

40
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,420
to do something for us.

41
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:13,970
So if we say hello from Firebase, what we're going to see over here is if we refresh.

42
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:22,650
Oh, and it updated and over here, we can see how it updated, why it updated when it updated what

43
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:27,260
execution it is currently running, so we can test all of that out.

44
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:33,090
We can test our firebase functions on our local machine, super useful.

45
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:39,280
And if you see any issues, you can report them and you have the log inside of your terminal as well.

46
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,210
That is so, so powerful.

47
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,570
These are how we write functions.

48
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,430
OK, so what do we do, Namal?

49
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:54,640
Well, obviously, we have this hello world, and obviously we have this different way that we need

50
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,690
to write our functions.

51
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:02,790
This doesn't really look like how we've written our react code, and that is completely fine because

52
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,180
our firebase functions are going to be written differently.

53
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,170
Don't try to use import syntax here.

54
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,760
Don't try to use anything fancy.

55
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,780
We have to follow the structure that is given to us.

56
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:18,089
And with that structure, we can build out two simple functions that are going to talk to Google for

57
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:18,350
us.

58
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:27,270
But before we do that, what I want us to do is I want us to migrate a portion of our app that is supplying

59
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,830
us with mock information.

60
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,090
Right.

61
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,740
We have mock information for locations and we have mock information for our current restaurant searches.

62
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:41,880
And I want us to move them into the firebase function that is going to function as what's going to talk

63
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:48,660
to Google so that we can link our actual app to quote unquote server.

64
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,110
So we're going to move everything that was moch into these functions.

65
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,500
And then once we have these functions running locally with the Mac and the app running in the same way,

66
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,060
then we can start talking about building out our infrastructure to talk to Google.

67
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:04,980
So let's get started on that.
