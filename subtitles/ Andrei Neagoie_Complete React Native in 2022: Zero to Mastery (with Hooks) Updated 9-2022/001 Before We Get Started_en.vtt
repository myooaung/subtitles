00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.290
So you may be wondering, how do we distribute apps on the App Store and what goes into that?

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.650
Well, distributing our app on the App Store is a critical process.

3
00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:13.470
Now, it's not one that can be done easily and it's not one that we can show you end to end.

4
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:21.210
As deploying applications to the App Store requires a lot of additional meta work meta, meaning that

5
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.980
you have to fill in a lot of documentation.

6
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.690
You have to put together a lot of resources.

7
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.040
You have to look at so many different aspects of your app.

8
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.140
But what we do want to give you is the general guidelines that you can go through in order to get your

9
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.780
app in the right state to deploy to the App Store and play store, meaning that we're just going to

10
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.270
show you how to build a standalone app, create that need of build that you can then supply to the App

11
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.170
Store in the play store.

12
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.840
When it comes to the eventual submission process, that is something that we cannot show you and we

13
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.060
do not recommend that you go through with either meals to go or focus time, as neither app is really

14
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:05.390
set up to be submitted to the App Store as they are just test apps for learning purposes.

15
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:12.590
Now, you could go and adjust focus time or meals to go and build out a more rigorous and more well-rounded

16
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.870
implementation of all of the different features.

17
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.930
And you could try to submit that to the App Store.

18
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.440
But at the end of the day, the submission process is one tailored to both platforms.

19
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.840
Both iOS and Android have very different requirements in terms of the process you need to follow.

20
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.640
Expo has amazing documentation on how to deploy your app to the App Store, what best practices to follow.

21
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.550
They have an installation guide for setting up windows in order to do the builds and that you have the

22
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:50.120
ability to really understand how to generate these builds as well as Expo is going to manage the builds

23
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.590
for both iOS and Android.

24
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.000
So it doesn't really matter if you're on Windows, Linux or otherwise.

25
00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.640
As long as you set up your system correctly, you can generate the build and Expo will do the rest for

26
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.880
you.

27
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:10.850
Now, knowing that if you choose to build for iOS or Android, what we were going to show you is solely

28
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:18.290
the basics of generating that build output that you can then go and use to follow along the documentation

29
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.400
of the Apple App Store or the Google Play store to go through the submission process.

30
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.790
But getting that native build is the biggest step and biggest hurdle that you will need in order to

31
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.990
set yourself up for success when going through that submission process.

32
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.860
And so we'll be showing you part of the documentation that takes you through that.

33
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.980
And you can always reach back to the documentation in order to set yourself up for success, as well

34
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.930
as go to the Expo, Help and guidelines section, the Expo, GitHub.

35
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.240
They have a lot of resources if something happens to your build or things are going wrong.

36
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.820
But again, do not try to deploy either meals to go or focus time to the App Store.

37
00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.600
They are not set up in order to be accepted to the App Store.

38
00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.520
They are solely learning materials.

39
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.340
You can, however, adapt them and adjust them in order to try to go through this process.

40
00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.000
But again, we will not be helping you go through the individual processes of filling out all of the

41
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.280
documentation for Android and iOS.

42
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.710
This is merely setting you up for success in order to understand what all goes into it.
