1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,250
One of the last things that we need to do to set you up on Mac is we need to give you a place to code.

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:11,310
Now, we're not going to have the ED that we originally had on XPO Sneck.

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,900
And now that we're running locally, the code that we wrote on Snack Expo DOT.

4
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:22,670
Right, if we go to our snack, this is a random snack, for instance, the code that we brought in

5
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,160
here isn't going to work locally.

6
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:26,060
This runs inside of the browser.

7
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:33,250
So we need an environment specifically for us to write code on our machine, on our computer.

8
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:38,010
And for that, we're going to use Visual Studio Code.

9
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:43,580
This is a code editor and it says Code editing redefined.

10
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:49,370
And that's an understatement because this is a tool that once you master, it's used in many, many,

11
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:50,660
many workplaces.

12
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:58,280
It's used in a variety of different tech industries, whether it be front and back end and even Python

13
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:58,850
developers.

14
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:07,220
You can use it for pretty much anything at these days because it is so basic and can be enriched through

15
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,110
something called plugins.

16
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:13,320
But for our purposes, we just need the basic version.

17
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:18,110
So what we're going to do here is we're going to download it for Mac and that's going to initiate the

18
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,570
download of Visual Studio Code.

19
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:28,460
And then once it's done downloading, what you're going to see is that it is going to become available

20
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,920
to drag and drop in your applications folder once you do that.

21
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,540
So it's going to be in a zip file.

22
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,770
And then once you undo that zip file, what you're going to see here is that you have something called

23
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:44,270
Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio Code, too, because I've downloaded it multiple times at this point.

24
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:50,120
And what you do is you can drag and drop that right into your applications folder where you keep all

25
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,160
of your applications.

26
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,620
Now, I already have a drag and drop in there.

27
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:59,030
So once you drag and drop it in there, when you open it up for the very first time, what you are going

28
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:06,360
to see is this interface and this interface is what we're going to work with throughout this course.

29
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,790
Now, don't be overwhelmed here.

30
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:11,980
Like there's a lot going on, but we're going to go through it step by step.

31
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:20,210
Now, over here, you can see on the left hand side, there is a panel in each one of these icons goes

32
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,700
to a different place.

33
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,350
This goes to the Explorer file explorer.

34
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:28,530
If we were to open a folder here, we could see all of the files.

35
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,390
This is for searching for specific text or whatever else.

36
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:37,220
If you're trying to search through your code, here is source control.

37
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:45,080
So remember when we installed Git, you can control everything that has to do with get from here and

38
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,930
we're going to control everything from here.

39
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:50,870
This is going to be our one stop solution to handle everything.

40
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,180
We're not going to try to go outside of this.

41
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,830
This is going to be where we do the bulk of our stuff or rewrite our code and where we do everything.

42
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,100
Now it has a bunch of different tools.

43
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:06,950
You can install extensions and everything else, but we don't need very many of those.

44
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:14,210
Basically, with just this installation, we can write code, we can write our master project.

45
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:18,960
And so now you are basically set up to hit the ground running.

46
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,380
Isn't that amazing?
