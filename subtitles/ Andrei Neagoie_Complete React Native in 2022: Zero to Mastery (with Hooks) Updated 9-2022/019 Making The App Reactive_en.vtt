00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.290
We've made some amazing progress so far.

2
00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:10.760
But what's next is kind of tricky now that we're able to input our subject right now that we know what

3
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.990
we want the focus on.

4
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:20.960
When we pressed the plus button, we probably want the screen to flip over to something else.

5
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.950
We don't want to see the focus and we would probably want to see the timer.

6
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.840
So how do we go about that?

7
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:35.270
Over here, we're storing our subject, but once we have our subject, we're not passing it up.

8
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.200
So the subject is isolated to our focus feature.

9
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.390
Our app has no clue what's going on.

10
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.180
One way of going about this is we can get a you state in here.

11
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.790
And what we'll do over here is we'll grab this, you state, and we'll see concert.

12
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.830
Current subject.

13
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.630
And then set current subject.

14
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.610
Is equal to you, state of not.

15
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.860
Now, what we can see here is.

16
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.350
If we do not have a current subject.

17
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.650
Show us the focus feature, otherwise show us a view.

18
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:26.090
With some text inside of it that says I am going to render the timer.

19
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.090
And I will do text.

20
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.200
And we'll do the.

21
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.350
And then we'll just pretty that.

22
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.360
And what you can see here now is, hey, if I add a value inside of here.

23
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.240
I am going to render the timer.

24
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.650
That's what we're visualizing.

25
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.930
OK, so that's good.

26
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:58.840
Now we know that we can swap between both, but we need to be able to set the current subject, so too

27
00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.860
our focus time.

28
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:09.310
Feature like our focus feature will say we'll add a prop called Add Subject and add subject will call

29
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:14.680
set current subject, so whenever we call, add subject inside a focus.

30
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.440
We'll know we'll have to pass it a value.

31
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.560
OK, so how would we go about that?

32
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.960
Well, while we're inputting, we don't really want to do anything just yet.

33
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.540
But when we're done inputting and we pressed the plus button, that's when we want it to happen so we

34
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.550
can add an arm press here where we say, Hey, when this is pressed.

35
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:39.970
Let's just call.

36
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.900
Hard subject with our subject.

37
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.620
Now, whereas at subject coming from add subject is now a prop on focus.

38
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.770
And so by doing these simple steps now, if I say, hey, subject is what I'm focusing on and I press

39
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.540
plus, then it's going to say over here it's going to switch over and say, I'm going to render the

40
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.990
timer.

41
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.980
Now, let's go and clean that up a bit because it doesn't really look nice.

42
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:17.080
Let's say that we give the text style, and let's say that we give it the style color for now of colors

43
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.240
stop white because I want it to look a bit nicer and I'm going to render the timer for.

44
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.040
And let's just say here the current subject.

45
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.430
And let's run prettier on that.

46
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.800
And then let's go up here and say, Well, I'm going to mow the lawn, and if I press plus it's saying

47
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.100
I'm going to render the clamour for mow the lawn.

48
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.770
So that's our current focus object.

49
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.820
And now we've created the back and forth where in this short amount of code, we've been able to take

50
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.740
our focus feature, pick the subject that we input into the text input box.

51
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:05.230
Pass it up to the app so that the app can be reactive to us adding a subject and then swap out the view

52
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.350
for something else.

53
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.930
That's awesome.

54
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.880
But now we kind of have another feature to build.

55
00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.080
The focus feature.

56
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.339
So let's take a look at how this interaction is going to play out.
