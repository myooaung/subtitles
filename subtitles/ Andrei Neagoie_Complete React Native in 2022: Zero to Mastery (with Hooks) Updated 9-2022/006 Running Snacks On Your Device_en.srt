1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:07,000
So in the previous video, we mentioned that, hey, whatever we called in here, whatever we do at

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,070
all, we can run it on our own device.

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,800
We don't need to use these iOS and Android tabs and Web tabs.

4
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,260
We can run it on our own device.

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,480
Now, how do we go about that?

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:25,450
Well, if you were to go into the App Store, what we would be searching for and this is the exact same

7
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:32,350
for both iOS and Android, just the different store, whether or not you use the play store or the Apple

8
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,140
App Store, you're going to be searching for XPO.

9
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:40,210
And what you're specifically going to be looking for is the client and you're going to download that.

10
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,510
And as you can see, I already have it installed.

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,910
So that's great.

12
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:53,680
And so now, just because I have the app, I can actually go directly into my camera and I can scan

13
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,640
this QR code and it's going to say, hey, open it and XPO.

14
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:04,780
And then when I open it and XPO now I can suddenly see all of my code changes.

15
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:09,540
Now it's opening my project locally and it's saying device connected.

16
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:17,350
So at any given point, if I make these changes and I save them, you can now see them happen live.

17
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:18,340
Right.

18
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,790
And it is absolutely amazing.

19
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,390
We can just see this live on our device.

20
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:29,080
No need for anything other than the app.

21
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,290
And a quick QR scan.

22
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,220
That's how easy it is.

23
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:38,950
And hey, if you're having some difficulties, we can always go back to the U.S. and Android app and

24
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,420
make it easy on ourselves.

25
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,900
So there's multiple ways to see what you're doing if you only have a nice device.

26
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,690
Well, here you have the Android app.

27
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,920
You only have an Android device.

28
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,800
Well, let's run it on iOS as well to just see what we're doing.

29
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,000
That is the power of an XPO snack.

30
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:58,570
It's better than a bag of potato chips, I promise you that.
