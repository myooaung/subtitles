00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:08.540
Now that we have Android installed, the next thing that we need is node James and what no jailhouses

2
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.390
is not the top search result.

3
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.300
No, no, we have to go down here and we want to download this.

4
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.690
No, Jess is a software that is basically vital to running react native locally.

5
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.480
And so we want the latest version, the long term support.

6
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.000
This is the recommended for most users.

7
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:32.810
And once we download that, what we want to do is we want to go ahead and go through the installation

8
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.130
procedure once it's done.

9
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.350
And what this is going to give us is is going to give us a whole suite of tools that need of can use

10
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.820
to basically launch and manage, react native.

11
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.390
Now, we'll go through the preparation of installation, will press next, accept the licensing terms

12
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.630
next, so keep everything to the default.

13
00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.090
We're going to leave everything as it is going to press next, automatically install the updates.

14
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.140
Next, we're going to go through the installation procedure.

15
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.099
We're going to say yes.

16
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.160
And then once all of this is done.

17
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:15.090
We're basically going to restart Visual Studio code and I'm going to show you why, because once we

18
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.790
restart Visual Studio Code, I want to show you something.

19
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.920
I want to show you something really, really cool.

20
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:29.370
So now that this is installed, we're going to see finish, we're going to press, enter and enter and

21
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.400
it's going to install additional tools for no.

22
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.330
Yes, we're going to say, do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device?

23
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.450
So press enter, make sure you press enter when it asks you these things.

24
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.590
We're going to press, enter, enter.

25
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:49.890
And so what it's going to do is it's going to install chocolatey, some type of software that allows

26
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.840
Power Shell to do all of this extra cool stuff.

27
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.970
It's going to go through this entire procedure.

28
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.630
Things can go wrong here.

29
00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.580
So make sure if things do go wrong that you reach out to our amazing community or copy.

30
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.390
Pasting the error into Google often leads you onto a good trail.

31
00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:14.940
Now, all of these installation steps are basically so that your Windows computer will be enabled to

32
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.190
use nogs in the right way.

33
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.050
And so we're going to let it do this.

34
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.170
We're going to let it run with this do this entire installation procedure.

35
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:30.510
And once it's done, doing this will have no jobs available to kind of utilize with visual studio code.

36
00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.500
So it took a good five or six minutes for that to finish up and then the blue screen, the power shell

37
00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.860
disappeared.

38
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.800
Now, if we open up, power shall.

39
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.930
What we'll see here is that we now have access to the command node.

40
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.000
Now this is what we want, so let's exit that.

41
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:58.970
And now in Visual Studio Code, what we have the ability to do is we have the ability to use the terminal.

42
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.310
So if we open a new terminal, we will be able to see here is that we also have access to the node command,

43
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:06.270
huh?

44
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.650
No, it is not recognized as a command.

45
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.070
Why?

46
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:18.780
Well, let's restart Visual Studio Code because it may not have updated everything that it needed to.

47
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.750
So now let's try that again node and now it has access to it.

48
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.210
So if we type exit, it's not going to work.

49
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.040
But if we press control, see press control, see again.

50
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.360
So you have to press twice pressing control, see twice exits you out of node.

51
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:43.020
So now that we have access to node, what we want to do is we want to install something called Yorn.

52
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.300
And yarn is a different type of package manager, and what we want to do with yarn is we want to install

53
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.540
it.

54
00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:00.120
So the installation kind of goes like this NPM install minus G yarn.

55
00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.460
So let's run that command.

56
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.030
NPM is another package manager that is installed with node.

57
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.040
So if we do NPM minus install minus G yarn.

58
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:18.630
What this is going to do is it's going to install yarn globally, so now if you press yarn.

59
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:26.410
It's going to say, hey, I don't know what your is, so let's go ahead, close this.

60
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.020
Open visual studio code again, and it will have refreshed.

61
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.780
And now if we run the command.

62
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.510
Huh?

63
00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.720
Why is this happening?

64
00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:45.040
NPM Yorn cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on the system for more information.

65
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.820
Figure out this part.

66
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:49.460
So let's go ahead.

67
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.190
And let's copy this link.

68
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.670
And let's go look at what's actually there, because it doesn't make sense.

69
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.310
So if we execute this.

70
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.290
What we're going to see is we don't have something called an execution policy.

71
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.240
So how do we go about turning that on?

72
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:21.290
All right, well, it seems that we need to enable an execution policy, and so how do we do that?

73
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.850
So what we're going to do now is we're going to open a power show.

74
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.790
And by opening power shell, what we're going to type is the following set.

75
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.100
Dasch execution policy space remote signed.

76
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:44.310
Space vache, scope current user, so you want to fill this in as it is right here, and by doing this,

77
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.800
what we're going to do is we're going to give the current user an execution policy.

78
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.270
So we're going to say yes.

79
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.480
And then by doing this, we're going to restart Visual Studio code again.

80
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:05.990
And what we're going to see is that when it reboots all of this and we press yarn now, it's going to

81
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.530
work.

82
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:15.980
So what we basically did here to summarize it, is we installed node with node came NPM, which is node

83
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:16.850
package manager.

84
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.330
It's basically something that's going to install a bunch of stuff for us.

85
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:26.630
But we didn't want to use that because the recommended one by Facebook is something called yarn.

86
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.620
Yarn is also a package manager.

87
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.580
So we needed a node and yarn.

88
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.580
And why we need yarn is because safe, stable, reproducible projects.

89
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:43.970
So basically if we go look at our package, JSON of our project, it has a bunch of dependencies right

90
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:44.270
here.

91
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.070
And yarn is what we need to use to install all of these dependencies.

92
00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.780
So the question is, why did I need to install node and why did I need to install yarn?

93
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.910
Well, node is what's used by Riak native to basically run Riak native.

94
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:03.920
And Yorn is what is necessary to install all of these dependencies.

95
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.260
That's why we needed to go through these steps.

96
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.800
And Yoran initially wasn't available to run as a command because we didn't have the right permissions.

97
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:16.180
So by running that command and power shell, we gave ourselves permissions.

98
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.590
That is the summary of what went on here.

99
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:20.270
It's super confusing, I know.

100
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:23.870
And there's a lot of different steps and permissions and all of this stuff.

101
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:25.840
But two things remain certain.

102
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:31.550
Make sure you install node, make sure once you install node that you're patient because the installation

103
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:32.360
can take a while.

104
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:37.070
Once you install node, make sure you install Yorn.

105
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:43.640
Make sure also that you reboot visual studio code like I did because it may not be immediately accessible.

106
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:48.200
And you may you may hit some walls there and then install yarn globally.

107
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:55.370
NPM install minus Gihan and you'll see once you install yarn it's going to install, but it's not going

108
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:56.210
to be available.

109
00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.410
Then we set the permissions and so now everything is set up.

110
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:06.560
We've installed we now have our yard lock file, which means that you've been successfully installed

111
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:07.640
all of the packages.

112
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:13.700
And now that we have our yarn log file and all of our dependencies are installed, we can go ahead and

113
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:18.550
try to run focus time, which is what we wanted to do all along.

114
00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.550
So I'm so excited.

115
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:21.590
The next video, we're going to jump right into it.
