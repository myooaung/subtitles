1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,680
Now that we have our request in our transform function down, one of the things that we really need

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,100
to look at is more or less the component that we built.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,940
So in the component we built, we had these two properties is closed temporarily and is open now.

4
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:22,860
Now, these are properties that if we go look at our actual data, right, our mark data, we don't

5
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,980
really have and is closed temporarily.

6
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:26,250
Right.

7
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,740
Or is underscore closed temporarily.

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:34,710
What we have is an opening hours and then an open now property on it.

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,600
That's true or false.

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,330
And the same is true for a closed.

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,850
We have a business status which is equal to close temporarily.

12
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:49,440
So in this case, what we have to do is we have to do a transform and not transform.

13
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:58,600
Is part of this so Canalis is the first part of this transform, but in order for us to actually figure

14
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:06,660
out what needs to happen, we need to first and foremost map the results.

15
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:07,190
Right.

16
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,010
So what is the result?

17
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,420
Well, the result that we're trying to get at here is an array.

18
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,210
So it's the array of results.

19
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,560
OK, well, good to know.

20
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,940
So first of all, what we need to look at here is.

21
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:31,120
Our result has a result that results that length, and if we open our terminal over here, what we'll

22
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,400
see now is that it has a length of 20.

23
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,160
So that is the actual restaurant results.

24
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,110
OK, good to know.

25
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,700
So we know that result has results on it and we'll default that to an empty array.

26
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:50,470
Because that's the one that we want and then we'll know now that we can call results at length, which

27
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:50,950
is 20.

28
00:01:52,070 --> 00:02:01,330
OK, now, caramelizing will be the last step, caramelizing will be the step that we do from the output.

29
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,730
So first of all, let's return results.

30
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:11,450
But what we want to do is we want to say consed mapped results is equal to results.

31
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:18,920
Dot map and a map is a function that will iterate over every individual restaurant and will return us

32
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:24,350
if we return like for instance, one and we consult the logs map results.

33
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:24,710
Right.

34
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:32,120
Then we're going to see that we're going to see one second there seems to be a small problem here.

35
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:41,360
Well, I put it at the wrong spot, so right here, that's going to and then we'll cancel that log.

36
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:48,970
I have to put this in here, I was outside of the function body and then what we'll see is that at the

37
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,750
bottom here, right?

38
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,270
What else do we have?

39
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,310
Consolo logging.

40
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,530
So let's remove this for a second.

41
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,440
And what we'll see is that we're printing one 20 times.

42
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,630
OK, so why are we printing one 120 times?

43
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,230
Because we're returning one.

44
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:09,340
So what we want to do here is we want to return the original restaurant.

45
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,910
But we also want to adapt some properties, so what we're going to say now is that we're going to have

46
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:21,150
a property is closed.

47
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,980
Temporarily.

48
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,030
And this is going to check if.

49
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:34,190
The business status is set to temporarily closed, so we're going to say restaurant.

50
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:42,740
That business status is equal to closed temporarily and then we're going to have is open now as well,

51
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:51,320
is open now and that is going to say, well, if the restaurant, the DOT and then we'll say opening

52
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:51,800
hours.

53
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,560
And and restaurants are opening hours that open now.

54
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,530
Then we know if it's open now or not.

55
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,890
OK, so what's going on here now?

56
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:14,610
Well, what we can say is that our map results have additional properties, is open now, is false because

57
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:17,779
open now is false and is closed temporarily is false.

58
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:23,520
So we add a D and now what we need to do is we need to take our mapped results and return those and

59
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,130
we're going to caramelize those specifically.

60
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,070
So we're going to take the original information.

61
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,330
We're not stripping it away.

62
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:35,460
We're adding additional properties and we're caramelizing the rest of the results.

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,850
And so that in itself allows us to look at the information.

64
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:52,690
Be assured that the information that we're looking at here is of the right type, so if we scroll up

65
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:59,710
beyond the errors here and I add back my console log down here, what we're going to see is now we have

66
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,560
the business status, which is upper case.

67
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,910
So we're leaving the original information, but we're also adding information.

68
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:13,270
We're adding to properties is close temporarily and is open now, which are two boolean flags that we

69
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,770
need for the rest of the information.

70
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:16,540
Awesome.

71
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:23,590
So we have our request and we have our transformer, but now the question becomes, well, how do I

72
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,400
utilize this?

73
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,450
And that's a good question.

74
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:30,220
So first and foremost, what we need to do is we need to go inside of here and we need to remove this

75
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,000
restaurant request because that's not the place that we want to use it.

76
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:37,150
We don't want to use it over here and we don't want to console that log.

77
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,610
Let's take the restaurant.

78
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:49,510
Restaurant request, request, where is it, where did I use it so oh yeah, because I imported it already

79
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,660
worked, OK.

80
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:57,520
So with that, now that we've removed that here and we don't need this anymore because we're going to

81
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,700
use this somewhere else, we now have our request and our transform ready to use, but we have to figure

82
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,470
out how to use it.

83
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:10,180
So in the next video, we'll be setting up our context, which is going to be doing the request for

84
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,400
us and also exposing the data globally.
