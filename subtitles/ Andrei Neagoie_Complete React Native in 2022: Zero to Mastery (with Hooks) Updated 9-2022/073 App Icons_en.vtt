00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.840
One of the final steps of Polish is kind of looking at our app holistically and looking at the configuration

2
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:13.130
that is currently in the app, and if we do that, we can quickly see that our app is lacking a proper

3
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.260
splash screen as well as when we go over to the home.

4
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.920
What we can see here is that no icon is loading.

5
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.600
This is the icon, the app icon that the Apple load both on Android and iOS, if you were to release

6
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.360
it on the App Store.

7
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.490
So currently we don't have any of that.

8
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.150
Now, we did put together some icons for you, some XHTML icons, but you could create whatever icon

9
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.970
you like as well as a splash screen.

10
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:43.220
And if we go over here to assets, well, what we want to do is we want to get rid of our adaptive icon

11
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.900
because that's not something that we want.

12
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.020
And we also want to get rid of the icon.

13
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.530
And once we do that, then we'll get rid of what is the home background look like?

14
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.520
That's correct.

15
00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.560
The icon, we don't need that of these things kind of give us.

16
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.240
A bad user experience, so we want to make sure that we clear it out and then what we'll do is we'll

17
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.480
pull an icon icon at 2x, an icon at three and the splash page, pull that into our assets.

18
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:22.990
And if we go to our apple, Jason, what we'll see here is adaptive icon will now be iconic and we'll

19
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.580
make sure that that's correct.

20
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.600
Icon that PJI.

21
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.440
Will remove our Web clothes because we don't really need that.

22
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.790
We're not focusing on the Web, the support tablets at the true.

23
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.670
Splashed up PMG icon that PMG, the orientation's portrait.

24
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.830
And so if we save that, what we'll see is that when we go home.

25
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:53.020
And we load the app now, it's loading our splash screen as well as if we go to home and we were to

26
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.400
refresh this list.

27
00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.690
Well, clearly, it still doesn't have the icon.

28
00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.540
So something is still caching.

29
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.810
And if we refresh our XPO app now, we can see that Meals to Go has the Zero to Mastery logo as well

30
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:08.710
as the splash screen.

31
00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.110
You can create whatever splash and logo you prefer, but it's a little bit of Polish that you have to

32
00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.890
be aware of that can be configured for you and it adds that extra bit of finish to your application.
