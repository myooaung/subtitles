00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.200
The one thing that remains to be done is to install the packages.

2
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.990
But also next to installing the packages and let's open another terminal, another power show, another

3
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.240
thing we want to do is yarn and expo Seelie we want to add globally.

4
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.820
So Global Basche Global, and this will install yarn Clie globally.

5
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.980
And so we'll wait for both of these commands to basically succeed.

6
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.820
This is installing the local dependencies of the project and this is installing Expo Zeolite globally.

7
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.420
And once both of these are finished, what we'll basically have is the ability to run focus time locally.

8
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.380
So now that we have everything installed, what we can go ahead and do is we can run, start and this

9
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.990
is going to run start and it's going to open the expo dev tools, open the dev tools, and it's going

10
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.220
to run everything.

11
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.130
So that expo runs locally.

12
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.500
So Expo is now running locally.

13
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:07.620
And what we can try to do now is if you don't run it with the Android emulator, if you wanted to run

14
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.140
it with the Android emulator, however, you could do something like Jaan Android.

15
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.080
And if you run this command, it'll run inside of the emulator that you've started with Android studio.

16
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.580
But we, Ranaan, start because we want to run it on our phone.

17
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.860
So let me grab my phone and then we can see how it runs.

18
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:36.260
All right, here we are, XPO is running, and all we have left to do is to scan this QR code over here.

19
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.600
So if I point my phone at the QR code, it's going to say open an expo.

20
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:52.260
And if I open that an expo, what's going to happen is it's going to connect to Expo in Windows.

21
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.950
And you can see that this happened because if you go to a visual studio code.

22
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.280
This is going to get help, that's the console log that we just had, and if I refresh it again, well,

23
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.570
you're going to see it pop up again.

24
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.420
So we are effectively running off of windows.

25
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.110
And if I feel something in here like test, well, then.

26
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:22.160
That's going to start playing back paws remove and we didn't complete test amazing, so we've just gone

27
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:29.420
end to end with running on windows and it was that simple, just a couple of commands that we needed

28
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.420
to run and we were good to go.

29
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.580
And so now there's just one more thing that I need to show you, and that is if you were able to run

30
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:44.090
your emulator with Android studio and it is up and running and it's booted and you don't have an Android

31
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.560
or iOS phone, which is highly unlikely these days, but it can happen.

32
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.670
You may have a Windows phone, you may have something else.

33
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.500
They do tend to dominate the market.

34
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.660
But let's say you have to run the emulator.

35
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.800
So if you have the emulator up and running and this is a precondition, you always have to have the

36
00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.760
emulator up and running.

37
00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.620
What you can do is inside a focused time, you can run your own android.

38
00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.030
And what this will do is it will run the same yarns, start that we did.

39
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.130
It's going to open up the bundler.

40
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.200
And then it's going to target our emulator, but not only target our emulator, it's going to install

41
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.420
everything for us and focus time will be up and running inside of our emulator.

42
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:28.390
Before you know it, we can say, hey, let's focus on some gardening, but bring about a boom.

43
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.360
We're good to go, and here it is.

44
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:41.480
All right, so now that we know how to run both on our phone and on our emulator from the setup that

45
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.790
we just did, we're good to go.
