00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.390
I know, I know you just want to get coating started, but we're almost done, and I promise this is

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.320
an important thing to learn before we dive into the code so we understand exactly what the code is doing.

3
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.000
Now, back to that history lesson.

4
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.060
We're now at the native like part.

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.660
We know that native mobile apps are really performer really good, but you almost need two separate

6
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.910
teams to create an app.

7
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.680
Web was great because you only had to write it once and it worked on both phones.

8
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.230
However, it just didn't have that good performance.

9
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.600
Then we have native like tools.

10
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.930
We first had something called Samarian and Zimmerman was something out of Microsoft.

11
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:54.460
It's a way for us to write iOS mobile apps and Android apps using the dominant framework created by

12
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.040
Microsoft in the C sharp language.

13
00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.810
And essentially what it does is compiles code to native.

14
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:08.380
So you write the code in C Sharp and then it converts that code composite to native code.

15
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.060
Now, there's a bit of extra things that they usually do to make this work.

16
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.780
But for now, let's just simplify things, essentially what they're doing is you get to write it in

17
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.310
some other language and then compile it to native and it works on both phones.

18
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.930
Sounds pretty nice, doesn't it?

19
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.920
And that was a pretty popular tool with the Microsoft world.

20
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:38.430
But then came react native and react native who really took off this idea of native like development.

21
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.640
You see, the difference between something like Riak native and Cordova is that Cordova runs inside

22
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.190
this web.

23
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:54.730
You write Riak native because it's native, like actually have direct access to this native side of

24
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:55.180
the phone.

25
00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.320
So with REAC native, we can have native views.

26
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:06.910
So views that get actually compiled to, what, iOS intense, what Android intends so that they're really

27
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:07.510
performing.

28
00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:14.620
So with Riak native, we can use just like Samarian JavaScript, which is a very popular language,

29
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:23.560
and the React Library to create this views that get compiled get converted to their individual iOS or

30
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.870
Android native views.

31
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.420
So Riak native apps have the same feel and performance as that of native application.

32
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:40.840
Now REAC native came out of Facebook because Facebook has a lot of mobile apps, so they've invested

33
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:49.390
a lot of money to have something that's able to write an app in both mobile operating systems using

34
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.350
just one team.

35
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.410
Now, Flutter is a more recent native like framework that we can use to do the exact same thing, like

36
00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.060
we act native.

37
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.780
There are some subtle differences, but Flutter came out of Google for Google to try and keep up with

38
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.280
this trend.

39
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.940
Now, you're taking this course because you want to learn, react native, so I'm not trying to sell

40
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.590
you on react native or anything like that, obviously you're already interested, but I do want to talk

41
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.330
quickly about which one to choose because you'll get this question a lot.

42
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.350
For example, Bruno wants you to build an app.

43
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.730
How can you convince Bruno that Riak native is the way to go when you have so many options?

44
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.910
Bruno is going to ask you, why are you doing it in React Native?

45
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.460
Why aren't you using CÃ³rdova Ionic?

46
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.870
Why aren't you doing native using Swift and codling?

47
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.970
Why aren't you using flutter?

48
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.550
So because Bruno is going to ask us this question in the next video.

49
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.550
Let's tackle why we should use REAC Native when we have all these options.
