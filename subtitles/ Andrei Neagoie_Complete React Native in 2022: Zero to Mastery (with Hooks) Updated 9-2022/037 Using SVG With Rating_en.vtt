00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.070
Now that we have the restaurant name and the restaurant address rendering, the next thing we want to

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:11.430
do is we want to render out the rating in in order to do that, what we want is we want to get a star

3
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:11.990
icon.

4
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:17.130
And so over here, I have Starbucks, which I'm going to drag into my assets folder, and then we're

5
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.790
going to look at it.

6
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.110
It's an effigy.

7
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.380
So it's a scalable vector graphic.

8
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.510
It's going to scale based on screen size.

9
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.440
And so all of the stuff in here is basically not relevant.

10
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.590
And you can get this file from the linked solution will also link it as an asset on the video itself.

11
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.000
But basically it's just an icon of a star.

12
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:48.380
And so over here in our Expo app, what we want to do is we want to start using SVG elements.

13
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.280
And so how are we going to do that?

14
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.430
Well, first of all, what we're going to need is we're going to need some type of SPG handling library

15
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.820
like react native SVG.

16
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.030
So let's go look at react native SVG and react native.

17
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:12.710
SVG is a standalone library that can be used to render out squeegees and you can use it with XPO.

18
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:20.070
So all we have to do is xpo, install, react native SVG and we can start using SVG elements.

19
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.080
So let's do that.

20
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:27.090
Let's take this, let's go back to our code, let's open up the terminal and let's run that command

21
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:34.220
xpo install react native SVG, let's hit enter and that's going to install Riak native as Fiji.

22
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.010
Now one thing to note here is that.

23
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:47.470
The majority of what's in here are the cases in which you want to install it bare bones, but what we're

24
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:55.540
trying to get at is, well, you can either load directly from a YORO or we can do something called

25
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.820
SFG XML.

26
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.050
And this is a plugin that can be used.

27
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.020
Right.

28
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.740
We import it from React Native SPG and you can give it directly an XML output.

29
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.430
So the file that I just spoke of.

30
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.260
So what we're going to do is we're going to copy this line.

31
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.780
And this is done installing and what we can do over here now is at the top we can import.

32
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:32.720
CFG ximo from Riak native Fiji, right, and when we use that over here in between title and address,

33
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.720
we can use SFG Zimmel.

34
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.570
We're going to have to give it an example value.

35
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.170
Now the XML value is going to be the asset that we spoke of.

36
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:51.860
So we're going to import star from dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot assets slash star.

37
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.050
So it's way up there in the file there.

38
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.150
But what we need from this one is we need to give it to the XML property.

39
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.000
And so when we do that, boom, we have a star icon.

40
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.530
Now it's way, way too big, like a very, very, very big.

41
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.930
So what we need to do is we need to give it a specific width and height.

42
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:13.760
We'll give it a width of 20.

43
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:21.180
And we'll give it a height of 20 as well, and that's going to make it so that if it's a bit better

44
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.160
in between here, OK.

45
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.010
But now now comes the crazy part.

46
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.720
Now we need to render it.

47
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.610
The amount of times that the raiding occurs, so how are we going to do that?

48
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.660
That's a good question.

49
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:44.910
Well, basically, we need to iterate over four times, so what we can do now is we could do something

50
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:54.510
like Consed Brading array equals a red dot from new array and we'll give it rating.

51
00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:03.330
And that's going to allow us an array, so if we cancel that log, this console, that log reading rating

52
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.780
or a.

53
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.060
And so now that we're also logging rating or if we reload over here and we open up our terminal or you

54
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.910
can open up your terminal directly in via code, we can see that we have an array that has one, two,

55
00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.250
three, four on the fines.

56
00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:23.280
OK, but what if I had a three point to what's going to happen then?

57
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.490
Well, what's going to happen then is this is going to break.

58
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.950
So what we need to do is we need to make sure that this is always a whole number.

59
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.390
So we're going to mathaf seal it.

60
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.620
We're going to round it because we don't want to deal with fractions.

61
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.890
So we're always going to have an array that is.

62
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.260
Of that size, so this is going to round up to four.

63
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.800
Well, maybe we'll do floor, maybe we'll always round down.

64
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.260
Maybe that sounds a bit better.

65
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.810
So if we have four, it's a four.

66
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.580
OK, so what now?

67
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.580
We have this array that has four empty items.

68
00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:03.330
So what we can do now is we can say, well, we could say reading array, dot map and for every item

69
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.720
we're basically going to return.

70
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:15.460
This SFG Zimmel, and so now we're rendering four of them, OK, but why are they rendering underneath

71
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.230
each other what's going on here?

72
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.110
So that's a good question.

73
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.010
Why are they rendering underneath each other?

74
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.620
Well, that's because it defaults to column.

75
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:33.580
So what we want to do around here is let's go take our styled view and let's say that we call this row

76
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:39.010
and we'll call this flex direction and we'll say row.

77
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:47.710
And if we do this and we put this around SFG Zimmel, what's going to happen here is this is going to

78
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.580
render in a row format and there we go.

79
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.570
But.

80
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.400
We don't want to call it Roe, we want to call it rating, right?

81
00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.360
We just spent all this work doing this thing, and then we'll add some padding around it, but we'll

82
00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:12.850
add a smaller amount of padding because it's a bit much so if we add padding top and we'll add some

83
00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:14.270
padding to the bottom.

84
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:15.610
Let's do that.

85
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:23.360
And so now there's a decent amount of space between the rating and the address and the name.

86
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:25.050
Amazing.

87
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:26.900
So what now, what's next?

88
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:36.380
Well, what's next is now that we have our rating set up here, what we need to do is we need to add

89
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.800
the little icon that's going to tell us.

90
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:39.080
Right.

91
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:45.480
We have the icon here that's telling us whether it's a diner or whether it's a cafe.

92
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.290
So let's look at how we're going to implement that.
