00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:07,890
Hey, everybody, we have our robo friends app now on GitHub, and you should be able to put up your

2
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,810
robo friends project on GitHub.

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:17,800
But here's the thing, would it be nice if we can use GitHub pages to actually check out our robo friends

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:26,050
app without having us to clone, download, NPM install, just like we've done with simple HTML projects?

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,470
Well, with the Korea reactor, there's actually a way to do this.

6
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:40,250
Using GitHub pages now, I'll link to this resource so that you can follow step by step, but let's

7
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,160
just go through it and see how easy it is.

8
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,960
I have the project right here.

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,360
It says that I need to add a home page to package that, Jason, so let's do that.

10
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,350
I'm going to copy this.

11
00:00:55,370 --> 00:01:00,860
And added in our package, God, Jason, it doesn't matter where it is, let's had it right after the

12
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:01,130
name.

13
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,120
Make this a little bit bigger.

14
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:12,130
I'm going to add my username here, and this is the repository name in our case.

15
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:12,820
What was it?

16
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:19,870
It was Wrobel friends, so again, use your GitHub username and then in here add.

17
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,180
Your GitHub project name next.

18
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,890
If we go through the steps.

19
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:36,290
It says that I need to install GitHub pages, this package, and then added to my deploy script, so

20
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,970
let's just copy and paste this.

21
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,510
So if you're using AMPM, you can do that if you're using your yard.

22
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,530
This is the command.

23
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,400
So let's install GitHub pages.

24
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:55,790
And while that's getting installed, let's go back here and it shows here that we need to add these

25
00:01:55,910 --> 00:02:00,300
two lines, a pre deploy and deploy in our scripts.

26
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,230
So once again, go to our scripts.

27
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:15,320
And then copy and paste this line, so we have the pre deploy and the deploy, so the pre deploy runs

28
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,560
NPM Run Build, which we know what that does.

29
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,760
It builds our project.

30
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,790
It creates a production version of our project and creates a built folder, and then the deploy is going

31
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:32,170
to use this GitHub pages so that we just installed and use our built folder.

32
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,170
Let's go back.

33
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,790
All right, and then finally, we had to deploy this site by running NPM run, deploy.

34
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:42,580
So let's do that.

35
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,360
Let me save.

36
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,620
And then and here.

37
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,010
Do let's clear this do npm run.

38
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:00,560
Which is this script, and remember, the pre deploy is going to be run before it, so if I run, this

39
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,820
looks like I have an error in my JSON package.

40
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,310
Let's see, what am I missing here?

41
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,250
Well, I have a comma at the end here, which I don't need.

42
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:10,910
Let's.

43
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,360
Run that again.

44
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:21,880
You see that the build folder was just created, it's creating an optimized production bill, that's

45
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,150
great.

46
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,480
And there we have it.

47
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,800
Our project is now published.

48
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:35,320
Now, all we have to do is go back to our repository, go to settings.

49
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:40,670
And if we scroll all the way down to GitHub pages.

50
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,210
We have to change the source to GitHub pages branch.

51
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:53,640
Now, you might have to wait a couple of minutes or even refresh the page to make sure that the changes

52
00:03:53,640 --> 00:04:00,420
have been applied and if all goes well, remember, we're selecting the GitHub pages branch and I click

53
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,140
on this link.

54
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:11,880
And I refresh there you go, our robo friends app is now live at this URL, so I can just copy this

55
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,370
URL.

56
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:21,200
Click, edit, and then add our website right here.

57
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:28,440
So next time anybody comes and checks out our repository, they can just click here to see the live

58
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,020
project.

59
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,570
How cool is that?

60
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,130
Nice and simple.

61
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,300
And just like that, we have a production ready app.

62
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:44,730
Because remember, Krave wrapped up for us, optimises everything and keeps everything really, really

63
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,110
tiny for production.

64
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:53,580
Our JavaScript files, while they're minimized, they look very small and well, nothing like we had

65
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,870
before with containers and components.

66
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:03,900
All of that because we use query, ACTTAB gets optimized for production.

67
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,760
Congratulations, go show off to your friends.

68
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,870
I'll see you in the next one.

69
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:09,940
Bye bye.
