1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:07,280
Now they come back and they say, hey, well, the restaurant info card component, right, restaurant

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,240
info card.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:17,580
Well, this component is basically elevating, and I don't like how far to drop shadow is, could you

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,140
lessen that?

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,400
So you say, yeah, sure, let's just put it to two.

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:27,690
And by sending it to two and quickly refreshing, we quickly notice that the bleed is way less in there,

7
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,580
like, oh, that looks amazing.

8
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:30,450
Crisp.

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,150
They're also like, hey, the map screen.

10
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:39,150
So you go to the map screen, could you zoom in a bit more and you say, well, I've researched this

11
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:45,270
for a long time and the lowest level that we could give it is zero point zero one, which is potentially

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,550
a bit closer, but but not by much.

13
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,850
And so they're like, OK, OK, that's fine.

14
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,130
How about looking at the cart?

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,260
You're like, well, what about the card?

16
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:02,190
So you look at the checkout screen and you're like, what about the carts?

17
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:02,520
Wrong.

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,900
And so you quickly notice, oh, we forgot something here.

19
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,860
Just a code wise.

20
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,660
You're like, oh, we forgot to add a key.

21
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,090
So you say key is equal to and then you say item dash.

22
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:20,420
I and you quickly add the index here and so.

23
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:26,160
Another react warning on not really something the designer was concerned with, but you noticed it because

24
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,180
you were looking at the coat and so they're like.

25
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:39,120
Well, in the checkout, could we potentially add a divider before the name and put like, sure we can,

26
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,930
so you go ahead and from react native paper, you grab the divider.

27
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,150
And down here by the name and put.

28
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:55,920
Right here, they say, OK, add the divider, so you add it and there you go, the visualisations is

29
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,450
there, they're like, oh, could you add a bit more spacing in your like?

30
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,180
Sure I can.

31
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,440
I have a spacer.

32
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:07,820
So you quickly put a spacer before the divider and they're like, OK, that looks much better.

33
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,229
Great, that looks clean.

34
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,670
And you're like, thank you.

35
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:20,560
So then they're looking at the favorites screen, right, the favorites bar, rather, and they're looking

36
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,630
at it and they're they're asking themselves, hey, well, when I add favorites, when I look at the

37
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:33,010
favorites bar, it's kind of weird that it's breaking the UI while we're scrolling.

38
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:33,880
Right.

39
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,370
That shouldn't happen.

40
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:35,710
Right.

41
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:42,540
And so you go ahead and you think to yourself, huh, huh, how am I going to fix that?

42
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,540
Well, you go to the favorite bar.

43
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,790
And you think to yourself, well, right now the favorite rapper is a view.

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,720
Huh?

45
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,060
OK, well, you know, let's get react native people in here, maybe I can use something from there.

46
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:05,100
So you go ahead and you test something out, you say, well, let's grab a card.

47
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:12,150
And you say, well, let's wrap styled with a card instead and we'll leave the padding.

48
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,810
We'll add a Z index of nine nine nine.

49
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:23,300
And you put an elevation of three.

50
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:29,140
And so they go ahead and they look at it and they're like, oh, that divide is way nicer.

51
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,800
At least I can see now where the favorite spa begins and ends.

52
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:33,920
Great.

53
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,190
But could you potentially add some rounding to the corners?

54
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,950
And you say, sure.

55
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:43,360
So you do border radius of 15, 15 pixels, rather.

56
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:50,450
And so at that point, the rounding is happening here very subtly in the corners to create even more

57
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,520
visual separation.

58
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,990
And they say, oh, that looks great.

59
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,860
That looks pretty good.

60
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,060
Amazing.

61
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:04,160
Just with those couple of lines of changes, we've visually reinterred faced our app almost right.

62
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,250
The purple theme, the small adjustments here and there.

63
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,760
And that is what good UI setup allows you to do.
