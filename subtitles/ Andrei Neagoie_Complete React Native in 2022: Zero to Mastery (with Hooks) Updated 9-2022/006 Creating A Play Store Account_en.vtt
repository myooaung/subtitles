00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.660
Now that we've built our standalone app for focus time and we're technically ready to release the prime

2
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.140
time, there's one more thing we need to do on the Google side.

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.820
We need a developer account.

4
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.340
And so when we choose to create a developer account, the Google account will be the developer account

5
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.910
that's trying to join the developer pool.

6
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.280
Right.

7
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.110
So if you are in an organization, do not use a personal account, but in this case, this would be

8
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.560
your personal Gmail or just email in general.

9
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.480
Now, a developer account, you'll need to pay a one time twenty five dollars registration fee.

10
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.810
So there are costs linked to deploying to the app and the play store on the Google Play store.

11
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.990
It's a twenty five dollar registration fee for your app account and they'll ask you for ID verification

12
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.010
for your account registration.

13
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.320
So there's more work that goes into actually getting your app ready for the prime time and all of the

14
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.970
work that goes into setting up your developer account and making sure that everything is good to go.

15
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.310
Now, if they can't verify your identity, your registration fee won't be refunded, so you have to

16
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.590
make sure that you give them real information.

17
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.850
Now, first, you need to choose your public developer name.

18
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.320
I can choose McGeeney.

19
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.230
They'll choose for a contact email address, a contact phone number.

20
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.890
They'll ask you to confirm all of these fields and then they'll ask you to create the account and pay.

21
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:29.300
So once you go through that, what you'll see after that is and I'll go through the registration steps

22
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.620
and I'll show you what comes after.

23
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:37.370
Once you go through the process of registering, they'll create a developer account for you and then

24
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.090
you can say go to the play console.

25
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.430
Now, once you're on the play console, it'll show you how to publish and manage apps.

26
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.800
It'll show you a short video introduction of everything you need to go through in order to do this.

27
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.740
And you can go next, next, next.

28
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.240
And you can say use the play console.

29
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.900
And so over here, we're in the Google Play console.

30
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.880
This is where we can create an app for release.

31
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.770
And if we say create app, we can give the app the name meals to go.

32
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.020
We'll say it's an English app.

33
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.199
We'll say publish it as an app.

34
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:10.789
It's a free app.

35
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.790
We can say confirm that it means developer policies, US export laws, because it's a very simple app,

36
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.350
will create the app.

37
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.710
And then once we've created the app, now we can go into the management of the meta information for

38
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.490
the app, set up the app for you, the tasks.

39
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.290
There's all types of things that we need to do in order to get our app ready for launch.

40
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.480
And so, as you can see, there's a bunch of tasks that we need to go through in order to get to the

41
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.410
step at which we can actually upload our SDK and get it into the App Store.

42
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.780
So in order for us to publish to the Google app and play store, we need to go from building that binary

43
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:59.760
into the Google Play console and create our app and go through the task of filling in all of this information.

44
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:07.260
And once we filled in all of this information, uploaded the app, only then will it go into the review

45
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.800
process.

46
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.890
And once it's through the review process, that's when you get a yes or no answer from the Google Play.

47
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.260
People in terms of you can release this, we need this additional requirements to be met.

48
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.770
You're missing these things.

49
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.190
So there's a back and forth here.

50
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.160
There's no easy process to releasing publicly.

51
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.550
And over the years, they've gotten more and more strict, more and more rigorous with all of the things

52
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.700
that they need you to do in order to get your app on the Google Play store.

53
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.370
But here is a quick and simple overview of all of the small scale steps that you need to take in order

54
00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.700
to get to this phase where you need to just fill in information, make sure that everything is in the

55
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.160
right order, and then you can release.

56
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.790
Right.

57
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:59.430
So with that, here's a fast overview of how to get the right pieces in place in order to get to this

58
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:05.240
place where all you need to do is fill in information in order to go through the release process.

59
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.020
There's no simple way of skipping this, making this go faster.

60
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.140
It's just a process of paperwork at this point that you need to go through.
