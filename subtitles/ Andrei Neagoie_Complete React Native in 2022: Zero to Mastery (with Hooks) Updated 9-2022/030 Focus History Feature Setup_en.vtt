00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:07.230
Now that we have the majority of the functionality built when I go back to the app level and I am done

2
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:14.910
focusing on an item, what I would like to see over here is something called my focus history.

3
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.770
So basically, what I want to do is I want to build a new feature here.

4
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.430
And don't worry about the red screen coming over here.

5
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.760
We're going to build something called focus history.

6
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.810
And this is going to be a new, fully fledged feature.

7
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.920
Let's remove the use state here that we defaulted to test so that we got back here.

8
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.660
It can't find focus history.

9
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.410
That's completely fine.

10
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.750
This is a new feature we want to build.

11
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.060
And basically, what we want to do is we want to pass it.

12
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.670
The focused items were, you know, let's pass something called the the history.

13
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.990
Let's call it the history.

14
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.910
And this is going to be the history of items that we focused on now.

15
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.760
We're not currently tracking that or storing that in any way.

16
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:05.450
So, you know, you state we're going to track history and we're going to set history, and that's going

17
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.780
to be a use state of an array.

18
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.970
Now, any time you know, history items come in, they're going to be pushed into this focus history

19
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:22.030
and this focus history is going to visualize us a list of focus items.

20
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.570
So we're going to build a new feature and we're going to call it focus history.

21
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.600
Thought, J.S..

22
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:37.670
Now, as with all other components, important, react from react, let's import view and text.

23
00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.480
From React Native.

24
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.190
And then what we'll do is we'll export here, export Konst Focus history.

25
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:56.300
And what that's going to be is it's going to be a component that returns us a view right for now.

26
00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.320
And within that view is going to be taxed.

27
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.530
And it's just going to say focus history will be built here.

28
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.259
And that's all we're going to put in there for now.

29
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.870
Now we'll go back to our feature.

30
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.480
We're here and we have to import focus history from.

31
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.570
Dot slash source.

32
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.640
And then we'll go down the focus history.

33
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.480
From the features.

34
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.370
Why isn't it visible anywhere?

35
00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.440
What's going on here?

36
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.050
Well, basically, you know, our focus feature is taking in the entire view.

37
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.930
So it's over here all the way at the bottom and it being all the way at the bottom isn't great.

38
00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.630
So we're going to have to go look at focus and see what it's doing internally.

39
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:54.190
And now that we know that, you know, this container is basically just this feature, what we can do

40
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.290
is we can give this a 0.2.

41
00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:04.810
Or even zero point one, we don't need that much space or we could just let it auto grow.

42
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.980
Right?

43
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.840
And by not giving it a specific flex, it's just going to take up the space that it needs to take up.

44
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.980
That's great.

45
00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:19.640
And so if we go over here back to our app, you can see that focus history is not all the way up here.

46
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.810
Now it's in dark text, but we've made focus only take up the space that it actually requires.

47
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.590
And so from there, we can start building out our focus history.
