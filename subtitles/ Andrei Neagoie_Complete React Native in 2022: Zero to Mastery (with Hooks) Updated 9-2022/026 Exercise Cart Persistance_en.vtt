00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:06.280
I know you may have been wondering why weren't there many exercises, trial and error based?

2
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:13.610
Well, a lot of the information in this particular section is quite new, and a lot of it had to do

3
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.170
with payments and payment flows.

4
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:22.610
And in order for us to structure this correctly, for when we wanted to show you the best way to implement

5
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.310
a small scale version of a payment system so that you can take that and you can understand the concepts

6
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.220
and you can go to Stripe now and you can read the documentation and understand how payment, intense

7
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:40.340
work and open yourself up to the entire world of payments as a service.

8
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.590
That is the intent.

9
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.340
But I did want to end on one crucial exercise.

10
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.680
It's something that we've seen before.

11
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.290
What I would like you to look at is the correct context.

12
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.930
And over here you can see already from the beginning, put in some Easter eggs, the async storage and

13
00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:57.380
the user.

14
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.300
And I was fully intent on coming back to this, although we left it there.

15
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:09.770
I would like you to implement persistance for the cart across sessions and in the next video will look

16
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:10.880
at how to solve for that.
