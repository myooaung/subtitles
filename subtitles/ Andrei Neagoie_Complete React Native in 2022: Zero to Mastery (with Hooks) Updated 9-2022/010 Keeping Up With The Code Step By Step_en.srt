Hey, all I wanted to give a quick note on something that is going to be extremely important as you

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:14,140
go through the course, so as we go through the course, every time we reach a milestone or we do some

3
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:24,970
type of configuration or add something, I will be providing a branch a you role for you in the resources

4
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,380
section of that video.

5
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:31,020
In the resources section of that video, there will be a call to my GitHub.

6
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:37,930
And what you will see is that you will be pointed to a specific point in time at which we did this thing.

7
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:44,740
So if you get stuck at all or if your code isn't running, what you can do when I give you this URL

8
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,950
is you can go over here, you can go to code and you can say download zip.

9
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:52,980
And that's going to download you that snapshot in time of what we did so far.

10
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:59,380
And so you can take that, you can put that folder somewhere and you can do the same steps that we did

11
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,120
during setup to get that code up and running.

12
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,600
Or you can just verify the code inside of here against what you wrote to make sure that you're on the

13
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,730
same path and you have the same things going on.

14
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:17,020
Because if you get lost anywhere along the way with what you're doing or what's going on, this is a

15
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:22,400
good way for you to take that snapshot in time and continue on or verify it against what you're doing.

16
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:29,680
We want to give this to you as an opportunity to continuously follow along with the code that is being

17
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,940
written and what is happening.
