00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:07.840
Our contacts in our service are built out now remains the question most how are we going to get authentication

2
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.560
to run?

3
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.210
When are OP immediately loads on the screen?

4
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.890
Well, let me show you, because this is an interesting this is an interesting concept that we need

5
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:18.640
to work through.

6
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.160
Now, if you remember when we went through our setup, we set up this infrastructure folder and the

7
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.380
infrastructure folder had a navigation folder.

8
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.570
And in that navigation folder, we set up the index file and we set this up with a purpose back then.

9
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:39.100
And that purpose was eventually to extend out the App Navigator, to also render out the authentication

10
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.100
navigation at some point.

11
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.010
This is that point which we now need to make smart decisions.

12
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.780
And so what we're going to do is we're going to import use context.

13
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.060
From react and we're going to.

14
00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:03.920
Get the is authenticated from the authentication context, so if we go and we say import the authentication

15
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:12.140
context and we do that from dot, dot, dot, dot, slash services, slash authentication, slash authentication

16
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:19.580
context, we now have the ability to know whether or not you are authenticated and based solely off

17
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.870
that we can make so many smart decisions.

18
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:29.000
So let's go ahead and import view and text from react native.

19
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.050
And what we can see here is that if we said something like is authenticated.

20
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.670
Questionmark, then Warrender App Navigator otherwise will render out the view.

21
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.550
With some text that's going to show us you're not authenticated.

22
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.000
And this is going to allow us to build out our long term goal, which is the infrastructure for authentication,

23
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.770
and we can see right here, we're not authenticated.

24
00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.700
So what we would actually want to build inside of here is not necessarily the view in text.

25
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:03.690
No, no.

26
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:11.220
What we want to do is we want to build out something way better, which is the account navigator, which

27
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.970
is going to be the account level, consideration or feature with which we're going to interact with

28
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.530
authentication, because when we're talking about authentication, we're talking about authenticating

29
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.220
an account.

30
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.180
So let's build out an account navigator.

31
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.040
That account navigator is going to come from account, that navigator.

32
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.020
And then we're going to go in here.

33
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.260
We're going to say new file account dot navigator.

34
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:45.150
That's going to allow us to basically build out everything we need in order to be able to log a user

35
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.480
in.

36
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:53.800
OK, so if we if we know that, well, what is the account navigator look like, well, we'll import

37
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.550
react from react, we'll take in a navigation container.

38
00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.710
Mo, you told us we don't need a navigation container, we don't need a navigation container because

39
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.650
it's already being used at the app level.

40
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.960
Oh, yeah.

41
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.320
Is it?

42
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.470
Huh?

43
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.420
I thought it was being used at the App Navigator level.

44
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.220
Oh, it's over here.

45
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:17.330
Over here.

46
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.220
We're using a navigation container.

47
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:20.540
OK, OK.

48
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.360
So because the navigation container is wrapping up navigator, we actually do needed an account navigator.

49
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.390
Now could we move it up to the index.

50
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.760
Potentially.

51
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.590
I like to put the navigation containers closer to the actual navigator that is using them.

52
00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.140
But in any case, it's perfectly fine to say let's take the navigation container here and let's move

53
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.140
it up a level because we don't really want to duplicate some code just because.

54
00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.100
So let's take this let's go over here.

55
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.270
Let's take that.

56
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:59.720
And what we can do now is we can put this in braces and we can say, hey, return us a navigation container.

57
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.000
And let's slash that navigation container and then let's just put this code right inside of there,

58
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.980
and that's going to allow us to render out the correct navigation container when we need to.

59
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.200
And that way we don't need a navigation container here.

60
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.220
So we moved it up from the navigator.

61
00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:19.860
Both both ways are completely acceptable.

62
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.810
But this is slightly better because now we don't need to duplicate the usage of navigation container.

63
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.570
Let's just structure our imports here.

64
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.070
I don't like these imports mixing with these imports.

65
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:40.410
OK, so knowing that now we can go back to our account navigator and what we need to import is a stack

66
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.910
navigator.

67
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.700
So we're going to create a Stack Navigator and we're going to just call it Stack.

68
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:53.450
And now what we need to do is we need to define what our screens are going to be now, for that, we're

69
00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.940
going to export CONSED Account Navigator.

70
00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:03.980
That's going to return a function that's going to have the stock navigator set up for us and we're going

71
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.780
to do that thought navigator.

72
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:13.350
OK, Hederman nun, we don't want to in or Steck, and now we can start setting up the stack screens.

73
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:19.260
So first off, we're going to have our main screen, which is going to be just our screen, where we

74
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.800
kind of decide if we're going to log in or register.

75
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.690
We're going to call that our account screen.

76
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.460
But for now, let's just render out.

77
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.910
No.

78
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:35.940
Well, actually, you know what, let's render out import text and view from Riak native, just temporarily

79
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.550
put something there from Riak native.

80
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.150
And what we're going to do is put up a view.

81
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:51.880
And that text is going to be filled with text, the account screen.

82
00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:00.830
Then we're going to have our login screen just as well, so we're going to have something called login.

83
00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.970
And we're going to call that login screen I mistyped here.

84
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.530
And now that we have both these screens, what we can do is we can go look and we can see that we are

85
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:13.640
on the account screen.

86
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.470
So that's the screen that's rendering when we're not authenticated and what we're going to do on the

87
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.250
account screen in the next video.

88
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.440
First of all, we're going to build out what the accounts screen looks like and then we're going to

89
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:30.380
build out the login screen and eventually we'll look at, well, how do I register, how do I log out

90
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.610
and all of that good stuff.
