00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:09.150
Last we left off, we integrated the Google Maps Node SDK into our application and we partially implemented

2
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.270
the Geocode API, but what we ran into is that when we actually wanted to do our request to get the

3
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.270
geocode information, our API, he was invalid.

4
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.210
And that is because we didn't really fill in an epic.

5
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.240
Now, you may have gone and tried this out and filled an API directly in here, but the problem here

6
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.990
is you do not want to put your API keys directly in your code, especially if you're going to push it

7
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:39.740
up to GitHub, because now at that stage it is publicly available.

8
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.370
So what you usually do is you have the server maintain the environment configuration so the server is

9
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.650
going to store our keys.

10
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.880
Now, how do we do that?

11
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.680
Well, environment configuration, often you'll need additional configuration for your functions, such

12
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.990
as third party Epic's tunable settings.

13
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.630
Firebase has a built in environment manager to retrieve this type of data for us.

14
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.780
And so it's showing us specifically how we can do this to store environment data.

15
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.130
You can use the firebase functions, config set command, and so this can be namespace.

16
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.900
So what we need to do is we can do something like this.

17
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.770
And when we utilize this, some service thought key is now going to be available to us after running

18
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.220
functions, that you must redeploy the functions to make the configuration available.

19
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:32.430
Now, you must note here that when you set this configuration, it is not immediately available to the

20
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.120
local environment.

21
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.870
But let's go through it.

22
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:34.830
Let's see what happens.
