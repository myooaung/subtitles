1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:08,580
Right now, we have our focus time running locally on an Iowa simulator, and we got that far, but

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:15,230
now the next step is, well, how do we get it running locally on an Android simulator?

3
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,620
And that's a good question.

4
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:26,090
First of all, to do Android development, you need something called the Android SDK, but in order

5
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:30,230
to download the Android estimate, there are multiple, multiple ways we're going to show you the simplest

6
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,040
path forward.

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:37,520
And that's something called Android Studio, the fastest tool for building on every type of Android

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:37,810
device.

9
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,310
And this is made in conjunction with jet brains.

10
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:48,590
And this free tool is basically what a lot of developers use to develop Android applications and it

11
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,040
ships with all of the information that you need.

12
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:55,100
So what we're going to do here is we're going to press download under a studio.

13
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,990
We're going to say I have read and agreed to the above terms and we're going to download it for Mac.

14
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,540
We're going to allow the download to come through.

15
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,070
And once it's downloaded, we're going to run through the installation process.

16
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,550
All right, so another downloader we're going to see something called Android Studio ID, we're going

17
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,570
to press that in a press that download and it's going to start opening that download file.

18
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:28,210
And once that's fully opened up, what we're going to see is the start of the installation procedure.

19
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:32,340
So what we're going to do is we're going to drag Android studio into applications.

20
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:40,560
And that's going to put all the necessary files in place for us to be able to use Android studio.

21
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:50,330
All right, amazing, now that we've downloaded and applied and receiving applications, let's see what

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,620
other steps we need to take.
