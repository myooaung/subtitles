Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.140
So I want to give you a quick intro into focus time.

3
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.830
The app that will be building throughout this section of the course.

4
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:17.160
Now this app borrows from the Pomodoro style focus aspect of being able to take a task and focus on

5
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.660
it for a specific amount of time.

6
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.290
Let's say we wanted to code, and we added that while the default timer currently set to six seconds,

7
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.450
but you could switch it to 10 15, even 20 minutes and you can start the timer.

8
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.220
You can pause the timer.

9
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.140
You can start the timer again and say, Hey, I chose 20 minutes, let me set it to 10 and it will continue

10
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.980
counting down.

11
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.980
We're making this reactive app that's going to allow you to track what you have successfully focused

12
00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:45.160
on.

13
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.220
So right now, we haven't successfully focused on anything.

14
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:56.710
So if I were, say, cancel coding, it wouldn't show up in my list if I read had coding and I focus

15
00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.910
on for the entirety we can see we're building a progress bar here.

16
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.790
We'll be doing a countdown timer and at the end of the countdown, we're going to make the phone even

17
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:07.420
vibrate.

18
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.890
Now I've successfully focused on coding for six seconds.

19
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:18.190
I could say, Hey, I want to focus on it for another 10 minutes, right?

20
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.140
I don't want to switch it up just yet.

21
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.560
Or I could say, Hey, I'm kind of done with coding.

22
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:24.520
Let me cancel it.

23
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.220
We can see that coding has successfully been added to the list as something that we focused on it.

24
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:31.840
That's awesome.

25
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.220
So this is the app that will be building throughout this section of the course.

26
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.690
I hope you're all excited.
