1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:07,530
We're getting into our first feature built, and so like we did in focus time, we're going to set the

2
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:11,340
stage for us to be able to build proper components.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,800
And in order to do that, what we want to do is we want to create a new features folder.

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,840
And in that features folder, we want to create a different folder called restaurants.

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,600
Now, next to restaurants will also be building other different features.

6
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,640
But inside of restaurants, what I want is a components folder.

7
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:41,570
And other than a component's folder, we also need a screens folder, so we're going to also build a

8
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:42,880
new folder screens.

9
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:47,120
This is going to be useful for when we get into how navigation is going to work.

10
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,610
But for now, we're just going to leave that alone.

11
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,590
Now another.

12
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,820
Feature that we will be building is the account feature and the settings feature, but for now we're

13
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,020
focusing on restaurants.

14
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:10,560
So the very first component we're going to build is going to be a restaurant info dot component thought

15
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,170
jazz.

16
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:17,410
And we're also going to be already building out the screen restaurants.

17
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,520
Dot screen dot, yes.

18
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,580
OK, so we have our our info component and we have our screen component.

19
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:32,310
And so right now all we've been doing is building directly inside Appalachia's.

20
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:40,000
But the thing that we want to do here now is we kind of want to move things over into the feature itself

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,700
because we don't want things to live here for the long term.

22
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,020
Right.

23
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,650
That wouldn't be useful.

24
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,790
So we're going to take our safe area of you and everything to do with that.

25
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:56,380
And what we're going to put here is restaurants screen, and that's going to be the screen that we will

26
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,010
be rendering.

27
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,110
So right now, we're going to see a bunch of red.

28
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:03,820
But right here in this file, in the restaurant's screen file.

29
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:13,390
Right, what we're going to do is we're going to import react from react and we're going to export CONSE

30
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,120
restaurants screen.

31
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:24,840
And that's going to be a feature in which we're going to render out everything that we already had,

32
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,420
so in here you can see that, well, we need to do a bunch of imports.

33
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:36,300
So we're going to go back to our APGAR'S file and we're going to grab everything that we had here from

34
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,200
these imports and we're going to put them at the top.

35
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,820
Now, we can already see that we we need our stylesheet as well.

36
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,780
So we're going to grab that because we're not going to use it over here.

37
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,140
We're going to use it in here.

38
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:58,670
And once we have our stylesheet right, we have to look at everything that we have in here and our restaurant

39
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,500
screen is basically ready to consume at this point.

40
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:07,370
So if we go back to Appalachia's, what we need to do now is we need to look like we're not using any

41
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:07,940
of these.

42
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,410
We're not using the search bar.

43
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,660
So let's go ahead and do an import.

44
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:19,460
So we're going to import restaurants screened from that source slash and then we're going to go to features.

45
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:26,270
We're going to go to restaurants and we're going to go to screens and we're going to go to restaurants

46
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:26,640
screen.

47
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,540
So this is the screen that we want to render out.

48
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:35,810
And once we do that, what we're going to see here is that we're now rendering the same exact thing,

49
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,790
but we're structuring our code.

50
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:42,030
So we're structuring our code so that we're set up for the long term success.

51
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:51,170
Now, inside of here, what we basically need to do is we need to build out what the list is going to

52
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:51,670
look like.

53
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:57,110
So the first thing we're going to do is we're going to get rid of the blue background, although it's

54
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,720
beautiful.

55
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,650
Well, let's leave it for now.

56
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,610
What we want to do here is inside of lists.

57
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:06,860
What we're going to do is we're going to render out restaurant info, which is a component that we're

58
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,290
going to build out inside of here.

59
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,760
So we're going to import, react from react.

60
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:18,019
And again, we're going to export CONSED restaurant info.

61
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,810
And that's going to render out.

62
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:34,350
For now, a text that says restaurant info, text, and we're going to make sure that we import what

63
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,690
we need to import, so we need to import.

64
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,380
From React Native.

65
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:51,040
And so that in itself, we now need to import inside a restaurant screen because we don't have the import

66
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,910
here, right?

67
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,440
We don't have this file.

68
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:05,160
So what we do here is we say import restaurant info from THARTHAR components, restaurant info component.

69
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:06,110
Right.

70
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,200
And so now what we're going to see here is restaurant info.

71
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:17,110
So we've set the stage to start building out restaurant info component and building out the card view

72
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,740
that's going to show the information of the restaurant info.

73
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,300
So in the next video, we'll start building that out.
