WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.430
Time to button up some more things, but on top of that, we're going to build one more thing.

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.900
So if we go home and we load the original meals to go up, where we can see here on the authentications

3
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.490
screen is what looks like a watermelon from Lordi animation.

4
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.220
So we're going to import a custom animation here.

5
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.290
And before we do that, we're going to do a little bit of cleanup and then we're going to go look at

6
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.980
how we do this.

7
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.940
Well, the one thing we noticed in our app that is kind of breaking the user experience, so to speak,

8
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.220
is we don't have a background color set.

9
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.190
So what we want to do here is we want to set quickly a background color to our safe area of you.

10
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.600
So let's take in props and let's say props, that theme, the colors that.

11
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:50.620
Primary.

12
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.580
And let's go see, this may not be the correct one, the color white is UI dot.

13
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:10.220
Big primary colors, that big primary, and this will set the background color of the safe area for

14
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.130
you to white so that everything looks uniform a little and it goes a long way.

15
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.790
OK, so now if we log out, what we can see here is that once our background screen losen, don't worry,

16
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.290
once we build a production, build it, it will go faster, it will load faster.

17
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.570
This is because it's a development built currently.

18
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.710
Now what we can see here is no watermelon.

19
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.350
Well that's because we need something called.

20
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.460
And so if we look up Lordi react native.

21
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.460
What we're going to see here and we look that up, for example, if we look up Laddy and XPO documentation,

22
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.190
what we can see is XPO includes support for Lordi, the animation library from Airbnb.

23
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.510
And so what we need to do here is install Lordi Riak native.

24
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.360
But before we do that, let's look at what Lordi is.

25
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.440
Lordi is a easly ad high quality animation to any native app.

26
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.750
So it's an animation library that basically Airbnb built for iOS Android, Riak native to render after

27
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.850
effects animations and allow the app to use the animations easily.

28
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.190
So any any time you create anything an after effects, you can basically utilize that and utilize that

29
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.790
effect in your Riak native Android and iOS.

30
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.480
And so we want to quickly show you how you can integrate that in your app fairly easily.

31
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.580
So first off, we're going to XPO install Lordi react native.

32
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.720
And let's go over here to our command line.

33
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.180
And once we do that, what we can do is open up a new one.

34
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.220
And we can.

35
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.830
Render out or we can run the X, will install Lordi, react native Kamat, and so that's going to start

36
00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:00.460
installing Lordi Riak native, which is what we need in order to build our Lordi view.

37
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.590
OK, now that we're doing that well Mo, what is Lawdy REAC native going to look like?

38
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:15.280
Well, if we go look at Lawdy React native, what we can see is that there is a GitHub page for Lawdy

39
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.970
React Native that is basically going to allow us to understand how to integrate this properly.

40
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.910
Lawdy is a component for Riak native iOS and Android.

41
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:31.840
It's a mobile library that parses after Adobe after effects animations exported to Jason and renders

42
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.170
them natively on the mobile.

43
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.710
Now we've already gone through the Expo installation, but basically what we want to look at here is

44
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.510
they have some examples down here.

45
00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:51.020
Some examples of things you can render and over here, you can see here is our little kind of animation

46
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.020
of a watermelon that we want to take and utilize and see how we integrate it.

47
00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:04.910
So if we go to example and we go to this, we go to example and we go to jazz and then we kind of look

48
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:12.200
at the animations, we can see here that there's a watermelon, Jason and this watermelon Laugesen is

49
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.500
the thing that we want to copy from Lawdy React Native.

50
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:24.550
If we go over to our assets folder and we say Watermelon Dodgson, and we quickly add that in.

51
00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.220
What we'll be able to do here is once we reload, we'll have our watermelon, Jason.

52
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:39.870
And once it's done, installing Lordi react native and we we run our app again, what we can do is we

53
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.890
can start integrating that particular Lordi feature.

54
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.050
Now, let me show you how to do that.

55
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.820
What we need to do is we need to go over here to our login screen and once we're on our login screen,

56
00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:59.780
what we need to basically pull in is the law review from Lordi react Netiv.

57
00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.630
Actually, we need to be on our account screen, not our login screen.

58
00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.700
We could we could add the watermelon to the login screen, but we want it to be the first animation

59
00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.850
you see when you come in.

60
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.130
So and we don't want to subsequently show it everywhere.

61
00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.840
So what we want to import is lawdy view from Lordi react native you.

62
00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:25.300
And then what we're going to do is we're going to put in a Lordi view right above meals to go.

63
00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.880
And that law review is going to have the key animation.

64
00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.250
We're going to put it on auto play.

65
00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.760
We're going to put on loop, we're going to put the resize to cover and we're going to give it watermelon

66
00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.510
that JSON.

67
00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.240
And once we do that, what we're going to see here is that, huh?

68
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.200
It through an exemption, trying to identify a read only property.

69
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.360
So let's just see and make sure that our assets are being imported correctly.

70
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:51.830
And so they are.

71
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.120
And so if we reload here, let's just make sure up there it is.

72
00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:57.940
There is our watermelon.

73
00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.650
It's a bit big, isn't it?

74
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.200
It's a bit big, but it looks great.

75
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.450
And so what we want to do here is we basically want to wrap it in something called an animation wrapper.

76
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:14.000
And this is something we're going to create in our account styles or we can create it locally.

77
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:18.920
I feel like we should create it locally, since it's something that's only going to live in this file

78
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.830
and we basically need it for this particular file only.

79
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:32.330
So let's go ahead and take this animation wrapper and we need to close the tag like this, obviously.

80
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.960
Once we grab that, what we can do is we can define const.

81
00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:47.550
Animation rapper is equal to styled thought of you and then we'll go ahead and, well, maybe we should

82
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:53.100
maybe we should put it inside of the styled components because we already have styles defined there.

83
00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.810
So it's best to bundle everything together.

84
00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.520
Let's do export consed animation.

85
00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:05.910
Rahbar view equals style dot view and then let's go ahead and determine what styles this needs.

86
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:14.320
So if we look at this from the perspective of how it's going to run there on the screen, we'll obviously

87
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:20.440
we want it to have a width of one hundred percent because we want it to fill the screen, but we don't

88
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.170
necessarily want the height to be all that crazy.

89
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.420
So let's give that a 40 percentile.

90
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:32.480
And then let's say that the position should be absolute because we don't want it to take into account

91
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:37.250
flex positioning, we just want to render it on a specific portion of the screen.

92
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.700
And then we'll say top 30 pixels.

93
00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:47.770
And we'll say padding and we'll say prop spacing, too.

94
00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:52.990
We'll take this over here, we'll put that up there and then let's see what happens.

95
00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:54.910
Oh, that looks perfect.

96
00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:56.560
That is so ideal.

97
00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:57.970
Look at where it's positioned.

98
00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:00.480
Absolutely amazing.

99
00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:06.270
And it was that simple to integrate a whole effect into our login screen.

100
00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:07.920
No effort at all.

101
00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:10.300
We just had to install a library.

102
00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:18.360
OK, granted, creating the after effects effect is something that may require some effort.

103
00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:24.600
But there are places on the Internet where you can pull after effects effects in JSON file and as long

104
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.720
as you have those after effects, you can just take those.

105
00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:32.640
You can dump those inside of a law review as as a JSON file.

106
00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:35.159
And they will render on the screen.

107
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:36.120
They will render out.

108
00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.409
And doesn't this look amazing?

109
00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:40.460
Doesn't it just add a certain wow factor to our app?

110
00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:42.059
It's absolutely amazing.

111
00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:43.470
And it was that simple.
