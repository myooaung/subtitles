00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.460
Something feels off, something feels off about the way that we're doing things, and not necessarily

2
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.790
because we're doing things wrong, we aren't, but.

3
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.130
There must be a more optimal way to do these things.

4
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.710
What am I referring to?

5
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.600
Well, you see here we're doing these stylesheets, right?

6
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:24.420
We're doing these stylesheets, an app and restaurant screen, and we're creating styles based on,

7
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.170
you know, specific outputs that we need.

8
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.940
So we're giving specific elements, a specific style by creating this object.

9
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.890
And you can see here that we're putting padding here and putting 16 here, inflects one here, inflects

10
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.450
one there, flex one everywhere, flex, flex, anyways, whatever.

11
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.290
Trying to get at here is, well, these style sheets that we're creating.

12
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.830
We don't really have any way to create consistency among them, right?

13
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.800
We're basically like we wrote right here, and then we have to write white over there as the background

14
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.300
color and give this a padding of 20 in this of 16 already a bit weird.

15
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.060
We're not having consistent padding everywhere.

16
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.280
Why is this a padding of 20 in this padding of 16, for instance?

17
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.560
And why are my styles all the way down here?

18
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.680
Well, when I should be able to read them as part of the element itself, right.

19
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.330
It feels a bit off.

20
00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.380
And not because it's wrong, because a lot of people write apps like this, but again, we're trying

21
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.160
to get at industry standards here and job ready.

22
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.380
And so one thing that's a very big in the industry right now is something called design ops.

23
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:42.670
Design ops is where design, when you're building a product, is taking into account all of the constraints

24
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.430
and making sure that the constraints are fit.

25
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.730
Picture perfect along the way.

26
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.070
Right.

27
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.760
Padding 16 everywhere, having a color palette, for instance, a color palette for the theme to have

28
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.680
consistent colors and branding.

29
00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.120
And so with that comes something we would call a design system.

30
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.430
Now, this is a bigger term and a bigger path than just what we can achieve in this app, because this

31
00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.450
is interdepartmental.

32
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.710
This is design, working with development and all of these things that come into play.

33
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:20.560
But one aspect that enables design ops and design systems is theming theming is one of those things

34
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.360
that we look at in the small scale and we say, well, we need a theme because a theme is just going

35
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.490
to apply consistency along the way.

36
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.490
And that's true.

37
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.640
Now, you can fit that into the bigger picture of all of these other things that I discussed.

38
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.110
And that would be great.

39
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.480
But what we're trying to get at here is consistency.

40
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.730
We want consistency.

41
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.840
And so how do we get consistency?

42
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.630
Because the style she creates stuff.

43
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.860
Well, that doesn't really feel right, does it?

44
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:52.270
And so in order to do that, what we want to do is we want to go look at something called styled components.

45
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.980
Styled components for react native is.

46
00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:05.220
Basically, the way that we achieve wonderful enhancements of Riak components and this is a standard

47
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:12.060
as well, and react as react native now s components can be used, react native in the same way that

48
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.130
it's used in react.

49
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:21.570
And so basically will be moving away from this stylesheet creates impacts and creating components that

50
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.970
have their styling already on it.

51
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.620
So there's the syntax here, right.

52
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:35.010
Basically will be using styled components to create components that have their styling embedded.

53
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.090
And on top of that, not only that.

54
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:47.530
It will be able to use a theme object in order to have consistency along all of the styles, so we'll

55
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.530
set up a speccing object that will have all of the spacing, small, medium, large, will have fonts

56
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.990
and font family and will have all of the good stuff and will have a color palette and because of that

57
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:05.190
will be able to reference the right things along the way and have consistency in our design.

58
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:12.910
And so the reason for this is because we want to create this system in our code base where styling is

59
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.880
a first class citizen and theming is very, very important.

60
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:23.290
It's a pillar of our application because when we want to create beautiful apps, first of all, beauty

61
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.450
comes from consistency, equal padding everywhere and all of these things and having the same colors

62
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.820
everywhere that will create that beauty.

63
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.730
OK, so how do we go about doing all of this?

64
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.100
Well, let's get into that.
