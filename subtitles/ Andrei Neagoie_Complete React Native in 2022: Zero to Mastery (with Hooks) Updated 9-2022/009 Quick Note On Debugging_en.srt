00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:06,250
Hey, all, so I wanted to go over something really quickly that I may have gone over fairly quickly

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:14,570
in the previous video with Android, and that is the menus that you can pull up inside of Expo.

3
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:20,410
So when we're inside of these apps, if we go and we say, shake the device, we're going to be pulling

4
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,830
up this menu or we can press command em.

5
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:30,430
And on Windows, the equivalent will be Control I and so that will pull up the menu.

6
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:36,130
And that menu is available for us to do multiple things.

7
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,080
We can reload the app if we want to.

8
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,840
We can copy the link for our app.

9
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,850
We can go home, we can disable the fast refresh, which is the refresh that happens when you save a

10
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:46,390
file.

11
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,140
We can go into a debugging mode, which we won't be using right now.

12
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:57,250
We can show a performance monitor that's basically going to allow us to see certain things.

13
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,290
Now, on Android, you do need to allow an overlay.

14
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:09,960
So once we allow that, we'll be able to show our UI so we can see that we're running 60 FPS.

15
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,970
And on iOS, you can kind of move it around on an android.

16
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,920
It's static, but it can show you while the UI is rendering at 60 frames per second and the jazzes is

17
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,340
rendering a 60 frames per second.

18
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,150
So we have these cool debug tools that are kind of useful.

19
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:30,240
And like I showed you, you also have the element, Inspector, that, you know, can show us different

20
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,540
styles of different things, which is super useful.

21
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:33,870
Right.

22
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,240
And so with that element, Inspector, let's just hide the performance monitor while we do this, if

23
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:46,000
we show the element Inspector, we can tap in on certain things and we can see what exactly they're

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,480
doing.

25
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,820
And on Android, we can do the same thing.

26
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,900
We can go look at list and search and all that good stuff.

27
00:01:52,600 --> 00:02:00,640
So these tools are there to help you figure out what exactly is going on in your UI and my rendering

28
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,910
as fast as I should be.

29
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,010
Are there any others?

30
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:04,150
Are there any dropoffs?

31
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,800
What are my elements looking like?

32
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:06,910
How are they laid out?

33
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,980
These Dybbuk tools are just as important as first principles, and I just wanted to highlight them once

34
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:12,310
again.

35
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:17,590
For those of you who haven't touched them just yet or haven't seen them, they're an important tool

36
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,510
in our tool belt.

37
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:27,520
So just making sure that we all have everything we need to hit the ground running and know what to do

38
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,080
when we're building layouts.
