WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.610
Now that we have all of our building blocks in place, we can basically start creating the view that

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.570
we require for the focus feature.

3
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.870
So what we're going to do is we're going to add a style sheet and we're going to do comm styles is equal

4
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.730
to stylesheet thought create.

5
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.450
And what we're going to see here is we're going to have a container which is Flex one.

6
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:32.200
Inside of here, we're going to see style is equal to styles dot container and inside of that, we're

7
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.190
going to create a view which is going to wrap our countdown timer.

8
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.530
So we're going to say style is equal to styles.

9
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.630
Start Countdown.

10
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.370
Now this doesn't exist yet, but let's go over here and create it.

11
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:55.810
When I say countdown now, we don't know what it looks like yet, so let's go ahead and import our countdown

12
00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:56.200
timer.

13
00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.320
From components.

14
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.660
So we'll go back once and we'll do that.

15
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.520
And then what we'll do over here is we'll say.

16
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.510
Count down.

17
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.520
Now over here, if we go and fill something in and we say test now for testing purposes, we don't always

18
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.600
want to see the screen.

19
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.600
So what we'll do over here is we'll fill in a test subject for now so that we know that we'll always

20
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.680
be here.

21
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.520
Now we can see that it's failing because it's trying to render the timer, but nothing has been given

22
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.920
to it.

23
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:42.990
So let's go say on progress, and we'll say that it's an empty function for now because we don't know

24
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.720
what to do yet when we want to report on progress.

25
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.190
And we can see over here that we are now counting down immediately.

26
00:01:52.730 --> 00:02:01.640
So let's say is paused so that we pause it immediately and let's add an on end function where we determine

27
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.850
what we want to do on the end of the timer.

28
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.120
That way, we now can see over here.

29
00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:10.550
Hey, it's stretching the entire screen.

30
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.170
Why is that?

31
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.390
So what we'll do is we'll give this flex of 0.5.

32
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.170
And we'll say a line items.

33
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.900
Centre.

34
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.860
And that'll center it now, if we wanted to get a quick visual, if things are out, we can always use

35
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.400
background color to kind of see, Hey, what are my elements of doing so I can see that, you know,

36
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:48.150
my container is taking up the full length and my background color for my countdown is taking up half

37
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.100
of the screen, which is great.

38
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.340
So that's working out amazingly.

39
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.570
Now looking at this, I can see that my timer is stuck at the top and I kind of want to center it.

40
00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.870
So that means that the one thing I need to add here is a justified content center, which will take

41
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.410
the content and then center it inside of its yellow box.

42
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.530
Now, if I gave this Flex one, this would fill up the hole and it would be centered inside of the center.

43
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.290
That's why we're giving it half of the flex of the screen.

44
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:28.250
Now let's remove our background colors, and now our timer is available inside of our component.

45
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.330
OK, now what else do we need?

46
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:40.070
Well, we need a start and a pause button, so let's add a button wrapper, and let's say that the button

47
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.330
wrapper is equal to certain styles.

48
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.930
Let's see.

49
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.590
Let's give it a flex of 0.3.

50
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.740
So let's give it a small amount of screen space.

51
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.610
Let's give it a flex direction of row because we want the buttons to be in a row structure.

52
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:07.270
Let's say that the padding is equal to 15 for now, and let's justify the content to the center and

53
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.980
align the items to the center.

54
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.120
Now, we've just written styles without actually doing anything over here, so we got to go and validate

55
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.950
that, that these will actually work.

56
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:27.410
So what we'll do is we'll add a view over here with the style of button wrapper and we'll add Weigert

57
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.650
for you over here.

58
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:35.910
So our button wrappers over here, if we give it a background color over here of yellow, it's not really

59
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:41.160
going to show us anything because nothing's being rendered inside of it, but we can see the space that

60
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.510
it's taking in, right?

61
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:51.960
So over here, what we basically want to do is add a rounded button, so let's go and grab our rounded

62
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.520
button from.

63
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.070
Our components.

64
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.440
Components rounded, but.

65
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.590
Now that we have around the button, I want us to add a start button.

66
00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:11.570
And that start button is going to set the countdown to start timer.

67
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.940
So let's go over here and let's say that the title is equal to.

68
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:18.560
Start.

69
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:21.840
And there we go.

70
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.030
Now let's remove the yellow background color.

71
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.380
And what we can see here is now we have a nice start button now is paused.

72
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.330
Is currently true.

73
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.980
So let's go ahead and hook up our button to actually do something.

74
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.710
And the way that will do that is we'll go ahead and open up the component body, run some prettier here

75
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.560
and grab our use state.

76
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:56.310
From React and what we'll do then is will create a parameter saying is started set is started and we'll

77
00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.200
say use state of.

78
00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.560
False.

79
00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:00.820
It is not started.

80
00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.010
So here we can say.

81
00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.000
In the countdown timer, the countdown timer is paused.

82
00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:17.020
If the countdown has not been started and then our start button will say, Hey, on press, start our

83
00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:18.250
timer.

84
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.220
So that will go ahead here and say.

85
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.410
Set is started.

86
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.910
Too true.

87
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.250
And that's what that's going to do.

88
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:36.720
Now, if we start the timer and if we press this button, we'll see that the timer starts counting down

89
00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:37.710
to zero.

90
00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:39.820
Awesome.

91
00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.440
Conversely, we also want something to posit again.

92
00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:47.280
So what we'll do over here is will conditionally render this.

93
00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.320
So we'll say if it isn't started.

94
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:50.930
Show us.

95
00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.360
The Start button.

96
00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.990
But hey, if it is started.

97
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:01.740
Show us the pause button, right?

98
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.330
And so that's let's just run per year here, so if it is started.

99
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:12.030
Show us the pause button and what this is going to do is set started to false.

100
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:16.770
And what we'll see over here now is if I press start, it'll start counting that.

101
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.230
If I press pause, it'll stop counting down.

102
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:23.130
Start countdown, stop, stop counting now.

103
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:31.920
And with all of that, we've now hooked up our timer completely to start the countdown sequence.

104
00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:37.950
Now we don't have any logic yet around our focus item and what's happening with our focus item, and

105
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:38.820
that's OK.

106
00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.330
But we're very, very close to a fully functional app.

107
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:49.170
And so in the next video, what we're going to look at is kind of adding the ability to select different

108
00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:54.240
timeouts and also the ability to visualize, Hey, what are we actually focusing on right now?
