00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,150
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:07,110
Let's learn about Hooke's and also teach you how the process should be when you learn something new

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:14,130
with a library, because, again, your job as a programmer is to be really good at problem solving,

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,930
be able to adapt to changes and solve problems.

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,850
So let's say Hooke's was just introduced to react.

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:28,800
The very first thing I would recommend to do is to read the documentation, but more importantly, read

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,820
the motivation.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,220
Why did the library add this?

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,360
Why did react decide to add this thing called Hooke's?

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,310
Now we see over here that there are new additions as of sixteen point eight.

11
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:46,530
And if you're watching this video now, there's probably a way later version of REACT.

12
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:52,400
So as long as you're using this version or higher, you're going to be able to use this new feature.

13
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:57,550
Now, I'm not going to read through the entire documentation for you, but I do want to point out one

14
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:57,850
thing.

15
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:03,400
The number one thing I do when I look at her library and see some of the new changes, I want to look

16
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,390
at the motivation.

17
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,349
Why did they add it?

18
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,960
So if I scroll down.

19
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,060
Look at that, they have the motivation, why do we need Hooke's in the first place now?

20
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:21,180
Sometimes to learn what the motivation is, you have to actually understand the library and have used

21
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,270
it before and hopefully by now you're comfortable with react.

22
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:31,050
So let's just go through the motivation quickly and then we'll get to coding, because I know that's

23
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,240
the exciting part and that's when we'll actually learn.

24
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,720
But the three things to keep in mind.

25
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:46,550
Is that one with the ways that we've used react up until now, it's really hard to do this reuse stateful

26
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,010
logic.

27
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:47,600
What does that mean?

28
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,840
Well, if we had some logic of, let's say, changing state in our class components, sometimes if we

29
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,750
want to do something similar in another component, it's a little harder to do with the way that we

30
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,410
had it before.

31
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:05,710
Hooks makes this a little bit easier, again, something that we'll see shortly.

32
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:14,460
Next is that complex components become hard to understand, you see, as components become bigger and

33
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:20,670
bigger, especially class ones with component Dedman component did update component Will Armont, all

34
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:26,460
these Life-cycle Hock's things that can happen within a component.

35
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,860
Hooks make things a little bit cleaner.

36
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,850
You can see over here, Hooke's let you split one component into smaller functions based on what pieces

37
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:37,690
are related.

38
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,260
Again, hard to really understand unless we code it.

39
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:47,290
But the biggest motivation, and I think this is something that a lot of people overlook when talking

40
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:54,460
about hooks, is that some people find classis confusing the this key word, the BINDE function that

41
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,210
we have to do.

42
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:01,090
Classes are just daunting for some people, such as doing super props.

43
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,390
Why do we do that in a class so.

44
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:13,390
Hooks allow us to not use classis, not use the this keyword in our REACT applications, and another

45
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:19,510
major reason that is overlooked is that REACT wants to do something called Ahead of Time compilation

46
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:24,460
one day, hopefully for performance, something that things like svelte, angular and Glymour do.

47
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,770
And by not having classes, it makes this easier for them to do so.

48
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,400
But you know what?

49
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,990
This is a lot of talk, a lot of gibberish may be hard to understand.

50
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:41,830
I think the best way to learn about hooks is to actually convert our robo friends out from using class

51
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,080
components to using hooks.

52
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,020
And I'll show you what that means and the next video, Bhabhi.
