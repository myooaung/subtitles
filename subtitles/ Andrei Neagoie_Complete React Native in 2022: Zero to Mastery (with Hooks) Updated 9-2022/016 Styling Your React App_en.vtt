00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.830
OK, are Roma friends up is starting to look good, it does some searching, which is great, it's very

2
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.880
interactive, but let's add some style said just so it looks like this.

3
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.740
And I mean, Styles is something that we've already covered.

4
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.030
I just want to get you up and running quickly.

5
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.490
Let's start off with first the background.

6
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.410
As you can see, we can just generate a gradient and have that background.

7
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.820
I've already found a really good background gradient that we can use.

8
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.920
You can use the background generator that we've actually already created in previous videos.

9
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:43.230
For now, as you know, if we want to change the success of our entire app, well, we have index success,

10
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.520
which is perfect for this.

11
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:53.220
And then we can just put in the gradient that we want going to save this and look at that.

12
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.180
It tells us that there's an update and gradient has outdated direction.

13
00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.340
Syntax, new syntax is like two left instead of right.

14
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:04.970
Well, isn't that convenient?

15
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.230
Let's do that.

16
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.700
Two left.

17
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.270
Let's see if that still works.

18
00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:18.460
OK, everything's looking nice, perfect, let's fix our font now, if you see over here, we have this

19
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.320
cool font.

20
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.220
How did I get that?

21
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.830
Actually, I just Googled for the second logo font.

22
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.220
And I found this website that has free fonts that you can use.

23
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.430
And we can actually just click on generate font face with font, and this is something that you don't

24
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.070
really need to know is just a matter of Googling.

25
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.480
You find the font that you want, but if you download this file, you'll see that.

26
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:52.430
It actually has the W o f f, which is actually a font file and styles access, so it actually tells

27
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.830
you what you can include.

28
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.040
Let's copy that.

29
00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:05.080
Added to our had our one, which if you look over here, he lives in App Dot J.S..

30
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.640
Using Aptos access, which I think we've deleted that already, so let's bring it back by adding a new

31
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.130
file app DOT success, so we'll just copy and paste what we did.

32
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.310
And Font Face just tells us our font.

33
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.060
And in order to use that, we'll just say each one.

34
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.680
Has Phonte family of ciga.

35
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.460
Logo, font.

36
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.970
Now, this won't actually do anything because, well, we need the font file so they can find Saige

37
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:42.630
logo font.

38
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.060
And that's simply a matter of us.

39
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.010
Dragging in our font file, let's minimize this.

40
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.060
Into our robo friends.

41
00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.930
And let's see now, it should be right over here.

42
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.180
And we can simply access it by looking at the euro.

43
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:13.820
If our app DOT successful has access to this font, we can just move it.

44
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.940
Into our source folder.

45
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.970
All right, and one thing you might notice is that, well, nothing will change because in order for

46
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.060
this case file to work, we have to import it.

47
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.950
So always remember import.

48
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.890
Aaberg CSFs, save it compiling.

49
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.710
All right, I don't know if you can see it, but it's there, so we want to make it bigger and obviously

50
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.050
the color black doesn't work well with this background.

51
00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.620
Again, this part is in, so I'm going to go through this quickly, I have a few stalls here, font

52
00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.770
weight and a color that is nice.

53
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.480
Make sure that we have it imported.

54
00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:15.200
And using tachyons, we can just make this bigger, we can just say class name equals.

55
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.399
You can do F1, F2, let's do F2.

56
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.370
All right, that looks pretty good.

57
00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.400
Our app is looking nice and clean.

58
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.300
There's still a few changes that we want to make.

59
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:43.230
But overall, everything looks good, we've played around a bit with the success, we've added a new

60
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:50.910
font file and we've changed the background of indexed thought JS file with the index dot file.

61
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.040
All right, we're going to get back to learning more react in the next video, I'll see in that one.

62
00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.860
Bye bye.
