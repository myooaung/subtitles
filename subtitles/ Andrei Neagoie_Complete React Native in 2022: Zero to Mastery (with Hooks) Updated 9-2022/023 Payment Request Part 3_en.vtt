00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:07.280
Now we're going to take a look at how we're actually going to process the stripe payment, and in order

2
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.070
for us to do that, we need to understand how this is going to work and we're going to use something

3
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.180
called payment.

4
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.100
Intense payment, intense guides you through a process of collecting payment information through the

5
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.790
customer.

6
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:26.650
And then we use that payment intent object to process the actual payment.

7
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:33.020
So we're going to give this object to an endpoint and it's going to push and publish a payment for us.

8
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.170
Now, how is that going to work?

9
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:43.940
Well, if we go over to our index of the payment, we have our stripe client over here as the third

10
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:44.480
parameter.

11
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.370
And what we want to do with that stripe client is we want to call a function on it.

12
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.680
We want to call stripe client dot payment intent.

13
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.510
And then we're going to say create one.

14
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.650
And what we're going to do with that is we're going to give it the amount, we're going to say that

15
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.680
you're going to process this in the currency us.

16
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.790
And then we're going to see the payment method pipes are card, so we're going to give it an array and

17
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.580
we're going to say the payment method types are card.

18
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.900
And then we're going to say that the payment method data is of type card.

19
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.750
We're going to say that the card is our token.

20
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:39.960
And by doing this now, well, we first first of all, we need to grab our token contact token amount

21
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.390
and name off of body.

22
00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:44.500
And then will.

23
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.070
Delete the rest of this.

24
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.410
Do not muddy up everything, so let's do that.

25
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.730
So now we have our token and we filled in our card into our payment intent.

26
00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.560
And then at the end of this chain, we're going to say confirm true battle process, the payment for

27
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.570
us and with all of this now.

28
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.479
Well.

29
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.090
Where does our name come into play?

30
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:12.970
What do we use that for?

31
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:23.160
Actually, the name is an important right here, we don't need to use it right now, the name is linked

32
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.110
to the token.

33
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.260
The name was linked when we created the token.

34
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.170
That's why we have to pass our name in to the credit card field to create that token.

35
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.440
Right.

36
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.950
That's why we utilize this credit card input and give it the name here.

37
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.850
So all of the information is actually linked inside of this token.

38
00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.720
OK.

39
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.380
So if this is our payment intent, we can then see that then.

40
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.050
And we can say payment intent, because that is what is what will be returned to us.

41
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.410
And we'll say response, thought Jason, of the payment.

42
00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.430
So that's what we're return to us in a case where it succeeds and then we'll catch an error and in the

43
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.160
case of an error, we'll say console that, log the error.

44
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.540
And then in this case and response, thought status 400.

45
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:22.740
And send a response to the scent of something went wrong with your payment.

46
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.650
Now we could bubble the error up.

47
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.950
That's that's potentially a best practice to do here.

48
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:28.790
You could do that.

49
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.930
We're going to override this in the UI anyways.

50
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.330
It's always best to send the error back with the response.

51
00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.660
We could leave the console log or we take it away.

52
00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.270
But in this case, what we're seeing here is and let's break it down, right.

53
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:45.740
Because this is a lot of code.

54
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:52.920
A payment intent is a way for us to tell stripey, we have a token from a credit card and we want to

55
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:53.630
do a payment.

56
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.930
So we're going to go through payment intense, which is the intent to pay.

57
00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.420
We're going to create one.

58
00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.930
We're going to create this payment and we're going to give you the amount for which we want to do a

59
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:04.310
payment.

60
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.260
We're going to give you the currency in which we're going to process this.

61
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.890
We're going to tell you what type of payment method we're using or we support.

62
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.750
In this case, we only support credit cards.

63
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.529
We're going to force this for this end point.

64
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.660
You can only pay with credit and then we're going to see the payment method.

65
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.550
Data is of tight credit card and we're going to give you our token that we generated from the credit

66
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.850
card.

67
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.730
OK, so by doing all of this.

68
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.410
Will I be able to look at a payment all the way through to my UI?

69
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.150
Let's take a look at that if we reload over here.

70
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:49.490
Right now, if we do an order and we say new order, right, let's just give the person the name New

71
00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.830
Order.

72
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.190
It's not like this is a real order and we fill in the information for the credit card and we hit pay.

73
00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.970
Now we're beginning the execution of pay and we finished it.

74
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.170
So what's going to happen here?

75
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.170
Well, if we go over here, we go into payments.

76
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:15.020
New order, he showed up, he paid awesome wow Verisk evaluation, level three, so it was a successful

77
00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.370
payment.

78
00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.780
The payment started at ten forty two, ended up ten forty two.

79
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:24.290
It was for twelve ninety nine USD, which is equivalent to sixteen Canadian, which is what my account

80
00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.920
is set up in.

81
00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.830
So it tells me what I have gained.

82
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:33.410
It tells me the origin was from the United States because we haven't filled in the origin information.

83
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.660
There are no risk insights.

84
00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:42.190
It tells me where it was made from and it tells me all of the information about this payment.

85
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.180
Amazing, amazing, amazing.

86
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:51.740
You just done a complete end to end payment and now we can see our payments show up here.

87
00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:59.000
If I said new order to and I paid again, well, what you're going to see is in payments.

88
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.070
If I refresh your.

89
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:08.370
New order to should show up now isn't why, isn't it?

90
00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.050
Let's try this again, new order to it's because.

91
00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:19.320
I need to make sure that all of this information is filled in correctly and there we go, beginning

92
00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.240
execution of P finished.

93
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.250
And if we go refresh here.

94
00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.160
We should see that show up.

95
00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:26.640
There we go.

96
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:33.440
New order to so now that we're able to process end to end payments.

97
00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.940
Well, are you I really isn't responding to this at all, is it?

98
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.140
It isn't telling us, hey, you succeeded.

99
00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:41.900
Hey, you failed.

100
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.930
Something went wrong.

101
00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:43.680
Something went right.

102
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.290
It really nothing's happening.

103
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:51.880
And so we need to we need to improve on that, so let's go look at how we can do that.
