00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:07,740
In this video will be focusing on getting the input from the text input to be a stored value and by

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,210
stored value, I mean, we're going to be keeping track of what's been input into here.

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,350
And for that, we're going to use the hook use state.

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:25,920
This use the hook is a hook from React that allows us to store values during the component lifecycle,

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,080
so as long as the component is mounted.

6
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,840
So if we do this and we go over here and then we say return.

7
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,540
What we're going to do is we're going to hit prayer here real quick, and we're going to say can't.

8
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,750
And the syntax is an array.

9
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,070
And we're going to see subject and then we're going to say set subject, we're going to say is equal

10
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,330
to use state.

11
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,630
And we're going to set no as the default value.

12
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,290
And by doing this, what we can do now is we can say here text input, hmm, how would I go about this?

13
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,820
Well, let's go look at the box.

14
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:10,740
If we look at the box and we look at usage, we can see here that they have this on change text property

15
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,980
that gives us the text as it changes.

16
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:21,450
So if we go back over here and we say on change text, what we can see here is.

17
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,960
That this prop.

18
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:32,880
Is equal to a function that has the value that is being input, and let's just go ahead and console

19
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,760
dot log that value.

20
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:45,750
Now, what you can see here is that I declared the prop, as would all props I put in the brackets and

21
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,460
then inside of that I declare the function that is going to output something.

22
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,160
So if I go on my phone here and I say hello.

23
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,070
Students.

24
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:57,810
We can see here that.

25
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,030
Hello, students is being console locked.

26
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:08,130
So what we can do here instead of doing this is we know that the value is the first property that is

27
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,090
returned in the function.

28
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,030
So all we have to put inside of here is.

29
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:20,500
Set subject, because set subject is a function that takes in a value, right?

30
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:25,060
And by doing that, if we call it with like, hello, it will set hello.

31
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,640
So by calling it this way, it's basically a shorthand for us saying.

32
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,190
Val is equal to set.

33
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:41,540
Subject of Val, that's the shorthand that we're doing, I think on change sex is equal to that subject.

34
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:50,000
Now if we go over here, what we can say outside of here is console log subject and then we'll be seeing

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,060
the same exact thing happening, right?

36
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,840
So if we do this now, we can see that, hey.

37
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:58,650
Right.

38
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:06,270
All of these emojis are being input into the subject, so we're now storing it in the state parameter.

39
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:12,840
And we now have it available for us to use in any given way we see fit.

40
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,400
That's awesome.

41
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,360
OK, fairly fairly simple, right?

42
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:25,440
Like, we already have so much done and it's kind of only like 20 lines of code.

43
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:26,700
Awesome.

44
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,610
So with that, we can now store our focus object.

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,680
And let's just go ahead and clean up some of the debt styling over here and in next video.

46
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,380
What we're going to do is we're going to try to save this subject.

47
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,650
We're going to try to save it so that our app knows about.
