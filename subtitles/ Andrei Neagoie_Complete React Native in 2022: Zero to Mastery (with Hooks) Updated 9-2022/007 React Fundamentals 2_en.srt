00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,160
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,609 --> 00:00:03,320
Does your head hurt yet?

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:08,500
I remember when I first saw REAC code, I was really confused.

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,550
It looked impossible to learn.

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,730
It seemed so different from what I've known before.

6
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:18,560
But as with anything, it's just a matter of time and getting used to it.

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,280
And trust me, by the end of the course, you'll get used to it.

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:29,180
But I do want to mention a few more things before we start building our Robot Friends app.

9
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:39,140
First is that in this source folder, we have a few more things like set up tests or report web vitals,

10
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,390
which we're not really going to worry about.

11
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,280
These are just configuration files that are nice things to have.

12
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:52,130
Again, create React app provides a lot of nice extra things, but they don't really help us build the

13
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,780
app, so we're not going to worry too much about it.

14
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,940
If you want, you can always go to the React app documentation.

15
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:03,620
You can click on, get started and read some of their documentation.

16
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:11,250
The key for us and the things that we want to focus on is index stages and app dogs.

17
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:17,460
These are the main things that allow us to build components and build this reactor.

18
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,890
Now I want to test our assumption.

19
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:25,860
Remember how I said that the reactor gets rendered right in here inside of this?

20
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,210
So as a developer, always test your understanding.

21
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,350
How can I test my understanding to verify that what I said is correct?

22
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:40,800
Well, we can simply go to app dogs and update this like I did.

23
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,260
But we can go even a level higher.

24
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,040
Remember how I said we're rendering the app right here?

25
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,720
Well, could I do this each one?

26
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:01,140
Hello, world and render each one header like this.

27
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:02,900
Hmm.

28
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,000
Pause and think, is this going to work?

29
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,740
Well, let me find out.

30
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,240
I'm going to save this.

31
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:15,730
It's compiled with warnings line for app is defined, but never used again.

32
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,230
Another nice thing about react.

33
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,790
And that makes sense, right?

34
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,230
I'm importing app from App Dogs, but.

35
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:30,400
I'm not using it, so it's just a warning it's still fine, because instead of app, I now have Hello

36
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:30,730
world.

37
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,440
Let's see if this is still working.

38
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,390
Fight, go to my app.

39
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,290
And I refresh.

40
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,130
I get.

41
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,210
Hello, world.

42
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:42,930
That's working.

43
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:53,760
And why is that as we're going to discover with React, we're essentially using HMO like syntax like

44
00:02:53,790 --> 00:03:02,250
H one plus creating our own custom H HTML like syntax using something called GSX.

45
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,760
Again, we're going to learn more about that in the not coming videos.

46
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,990
So I could have something like this here where, say, app.

47
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:12,360
Safe.

48
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,820
Go back and refresh, and I have hello world and.

49
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,610
Our default app.

50
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:29,690
So again, I'm testing my assumption that I can add things in here and react.

51
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:33,020
Dom renders it on the Asimo page for us.

52
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,210
Very, very cool.

53
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:41,750
Now, in some of the upcoming videos, you might not see things like report web vitals.

54
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:45,440
Instead, you might see something like register service workers.

55
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:51,530
That's an old version of Cory racked up and something we won't really get into in this course because

56
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,950
again, it's outside of the scope of what we need to know.

57
00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:01,850
The key and the focus that I want you to have for the next couple of videos is what we do inside of

58
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:02,840
the source folder.

59
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:09,890
To be a good react developer is learning how to work within this source folder and building the React

60
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:10,460
components.

61
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,730
And that's what we're going to teach you throughout the next couple of videos.

62
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:21,170
The final thing I want to show you is this if you're on sublime text, you might have.

63
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,270
The syntax highlighting a little bit messed up like this.

64
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:32,300
So if that's the case, why you need to do is instead of JavaScript, because these are DOGE's files

65
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,010
you can actually select.

66
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,940
OpenGL with current extension and use GSX.

67
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:43,210
So go to JavaScript and select GSX and this.

68
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:52,090
We'll give you proper syntax highlighting for what we call these GSX files that the React package allows

69
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,760
us to write more on that later.

70
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,820
For now, let's take a break and I'll see you in the next one.

71
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:58,480
Bye bye.
