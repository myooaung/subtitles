00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:07,850
At the beginning of this Riak section, I told you that things are going to get a little bit overwhelming,

2
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:11,330
but at the end you're going to understand everything and things are going to make sense.

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:19,040
I want to show you exactly how much you've learned, you've learned that component's well now this makes

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:19,530
sense, right?

5
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:26,060
You are building components during this section to combine things into containers and then finally have

6
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,260
a page or an app.

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:36,550
You also learned that there is one way dataflow, that is everything flows from state to props and you

8
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:42,780
can have multiple children, but the only people that can change state is a container component.

9
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:49,570
In that case, we only have one container component, but you can have multiple and data just flows

10
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,800
down one way.

11
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:56,740
And any time a child component changes, they just trigger an event on the parent.

12
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,480
And you saw how awesome that was.

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,420
We didn't think about how we should render things.

14
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,569
We were doing things deterministically, that is.

15
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,220
Here's the state of the app.

16
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,200
Render it accordingly and react.

17
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,250
Took care of it for us.

18
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:17,460
We also learned that, well, exactly what I said, react worries about painting and making the website

19
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,610
look good, we just give it the data and the components.

20
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:31,120
We learned that React has an awesome ecosystem, we had great tools where we're able to start and build

21
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,800
and gave us great ideas.

22
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,090
So all these pain points that we had when we were first building our websites.

23
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:37,900
Well, they're gone.

24
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:43,270
Everything is built for you so that you're ready to just focus on coding without having to worry about

25
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:43,990
configuration.

26
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:49,450
When we get to our final project, we're going to be using Riak components to build something really

27
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:53,170
fast and just plug and play these components.

28
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,710
And finally, well, this shouldn't look confusing to you anymore.

29
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:06,690
This makes sense, this whole thing that looked intimidating at first of all, this is just react in

30
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,440
this one image.

31
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,990
You have majority of why react is.

32
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:18,480
And once you get used to the syntax, it's an elegant solution to building beautiful Web apps that are

33
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,880
simple, scalable and easy to manage.

34
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:28,750
Good job getting this far in the course, it takes a lot of dedication to get through this, but you

35
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,060
did it.

36
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,430
You're almost there.

37
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,080
I'll see you in the next one.

38
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,120
Bye bye.
