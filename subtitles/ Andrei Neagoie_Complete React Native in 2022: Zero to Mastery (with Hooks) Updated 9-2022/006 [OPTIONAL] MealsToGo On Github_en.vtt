00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:07.520
Now that our Meals to Go project is set up and we have the core of the application ready.

2
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:17.110
To roll, what we want to do next is optional, but you can go ahead and do it is on GitHub, you can

3
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.360
go and create a repository.

4
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.870
Now, I'm going to call it meals to go.

5
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.270
And I'm going to make it public, you can make it private as well.

6
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.560
And what we want to do in there is we want to create that repository.

7
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.050
So now that we have that ready to go for us, we can go back into visual studio code and remember that

8
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.250
I said that we wanted to push up our code or keep track of our code.

9
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.900
Well, meals to go has been set up, but it isn't really set up quite there yet because we don't have

10
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.220
get set up right.

11
00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.530
We don't have our source control setup for this project and we're looking at the high level folder.

12
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.330
So what I want you to do now is I want you to go in.

13
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.430
I want you to press open again, and I want you to open meals to go directly because we're opening the

14
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.280
projects folder.

15
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.550
We don't want to commit the projects folder to GitHub.

16
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.290
We want to commit meals to go.

17
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.680
And so now that we're Ishmael's to go specifically.

18
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:24.040
What I want you to do is go over to the Gett section and I want you to press the three little dots because

19
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.410
it already set up gett for us in this project.

20
00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.940
And I want you to say Pushtu.

21
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.920
Now, no remotes configured so at a remote and we're going to add it from GitHub.

22
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.590
Now, I clearly haven't signed up on this computer just yet for Visual Studio Code, so I'm going to

23
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.320
open open like we did in the setup phase and now it's going to find Miles to go.

24
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.930
So I'm going to set that as my remote and I'm going to call it origin, like we did in the original

25
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:52.950
set up for focus time.

26
00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:01.850
So now Origin has been set up and I'm going to say push to origin.

27
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.850
And so now it's pushing my code, my initial repository up to GitHub.

28
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:18.450
And if we go over here to meals to go and we refresh, you can see that I have my repository ready and

29
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.620
populated and on GitHub.

30
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.220
OK, so all the code is in GitHub.

31
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.120
Good.

32
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.680
Now we can start building meals to go.
