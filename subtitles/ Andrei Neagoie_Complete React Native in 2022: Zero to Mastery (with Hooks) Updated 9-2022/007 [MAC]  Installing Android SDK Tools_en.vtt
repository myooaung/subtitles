00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.800
Now that Android studio is installed, we want to open it up and how do we open it up?

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.690
Well, the first thing we can do is we can press command spacebar and we can look for Android studio.

3
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.590
And when we find that and we open it up for the first time, what we're going to do is we're going to

4
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.100
run through a couple of things.

5
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.700
It's going to tell us, hey, this is an app download from the Internet.

6
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.550
You sure you want to open it open?

7
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.320
Because it's fine.

8
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.780
And we're going to say do not import any settings because we don't have any prior settings.

9
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.140
And it's going to start initializing Android studio for us.

10
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.720
We're not going to send statistics.

11
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.600
And so now it's going to go through a small setup wizard for us.

12
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.450
And what we're going to do is we're just going to follow it.

13
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.570
We're going to say, hey, we want a standard setup or maybe we want to customize it, but most likely

14
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.620
we want a standard setup.

15
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.490
We can choose between a light in a dark theme.

16
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:56.850
I prefer the dark theme.

17
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.740
And what it's going to say to us is it's going to say, I'm going to download the Android emulator,

18
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:07.380
I'm going to download the software development kit for Platform 30 and all of this other stuff.

19
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.610
Amazing.

20
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.580
It's doing the standard installation that we need and we're going to finish.

21
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.160
And now it's going to go through the download procedure, getting all of the things that the Android

22
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.500
software development kit needs.

23
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:27.620
And that is in turn what's going to allow us to run our Expo app on the Android simulator.

24
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.300
And so once this installation procedure finishes, we're going to set up our first emulator.

25
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.900
We've hit a critical portion in the insulation process, it's going to ask you a couple of times potentially

26
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.730
to fill in your password because certain software that is trying to install is trying to make changes.

27
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.210
And this is just something that the installation procedure requires.

28
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.950
So we're just going to fill in our password and say, OK, because it's OK that it needs to do these

29
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.340
things.

30
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.140
Now it's going to say, hey, the system extension is blocked, so let's open privacy and security and

31
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.260
it's going to take you to the right place.

32
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.210
And what we're going to do here is we're going to press the little icon and we're going to use our password

33
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.790
or finger if you have that ability and we're going to say allow.

34
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.430
And that's going to allow the software to do its thing that we always want to make sure that we're following

35
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.120
along and reading exactly what happens.

36
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.040
The whole point of this is that the installation happens completely and correctly.

37
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.610
Now, with that said, if you do run into any issues again, you can reach out on our amazing Dischord

38
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:45.330
community or in the Q&A section, we really recommend joining the Dischord community as we really help

39
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.080
each other out there.

40
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.240
We've obviously fast forwarded through the majority of the installation process as the installation

41
00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:01.050
process and the installing of all of these different portions of Android studio can take a while.

42
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.030
So be patient.

43
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.910
And then once you reach the screen, you can press finish.

44
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.630
And once you've finished, you've now completed the Android studio installation.

45
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.670
So now let's go see how we're actually going to run on a simulator.
