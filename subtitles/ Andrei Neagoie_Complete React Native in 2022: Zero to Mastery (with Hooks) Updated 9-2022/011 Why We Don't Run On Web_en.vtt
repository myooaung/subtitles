00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:07.320
Now that we've set things up and now that we're ready, we've rendered our Hello World app and we have

2
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.930
everything set up to start building focus time.

3
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.800
One thing to note here is that when you're in the preview tap and you're trying to run your app.

4
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.550
Note that you know you have the availability to run it on your own device.

5
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.890
You have the availability to emulate it in iOS and you have the ability to emulate it in Android, but

6
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.970
also expose ships natively with the ability to run a native app.

7
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.410
That we're building here for iOS and Android on Web.

8
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:45.480
Now it does this because it uses something called React Native Web internally and React Native Web is

9
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:55.080
a library, just like React Native, just like React that allows you to take views, take text and it

10
00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.820
traps, piles them and maps them to each HTML and CSS.

11
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:07.340
OK, so with that in mind, if we look at React Native, React Native is targeting iOS and Android.

12
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.090
It's it's a native library.

13
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.680
It's for native app development.

14
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.930
This course is not tailored to taking an export app and running it in web mode.

15
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:25.390
None of the choices that we make throughout the course are choices that are geared towards being able

16
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.280
to run both on Web, iOS and Android.

17
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.760
We are solely focusing on iOS and Android.

18
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:39.610
This is because this course is focused on getting you familiar with the native ecosystems of mobile

19
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.920
development, and running on web comes with its own challenges because we're trying to take something

20
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.750
that's supposed to run on phones and then trying to say, Hey, run in the browser now, you know,

21
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.390
that's great if you're trying to build an app within one ecosystem.

22
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.890
That's a phenomenal way of getting your app across multiple platforms, but we're solely focusing on

23
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:00.600
iOS and Android.

24
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.190
So just note that if you run in web mode, you're going to run into issues, issues for which we do

25
00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:14.710
not provide solutions, issues for which we do not recommend any particular solve because we focus solely

26
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.450
on iOS and Android.

27
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.090
And I want you all to keep that in mind.
