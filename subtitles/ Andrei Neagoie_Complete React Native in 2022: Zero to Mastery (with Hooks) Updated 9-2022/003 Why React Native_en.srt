1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,130
So why should we build something in React Native?

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,980
There's three main reasons why.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,850
One is that it has a big community.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,730
Whenever you are using a technology, you want to make sure that there's enough documentation out there

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:16,170
for you.

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,830
Let's say you encounter a problem.

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:22,810
You want to be able to Google it and find solutions that perhaps others have discovered.

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,560
You want to be able to find solutions on stack overflow.

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,980
You want to find libraries or tools that others have built that you can use.

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,250
If you're using a brand new tool, then it's going to be really hard for you to solve those issues when

11
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,320
nobody else in the world has had them.

12
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:44,560
So react native out of Flutter or Samarian has the biggest community.

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:50,650
That means there's a lot of tools, a lot of components, a lot of libraries that you can use with react

14
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,600
native to make your life easier.

15
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,360
And we'll see that throughout the course.

16
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,360
Next is that big companies are using it.

17
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:06,040
You want to use a technology that has been tested, that has scaled, for example, some of the companies

18
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:13,060
that are using Riak native Facebook because they've created it uses Riak native for their Facebook ads

19
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:13,540
manager.

20
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,900
Their Uber eats app uses react native.

21
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:18,460
So does discord.

22
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,980
So does Instagram, so does Skype.

23
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:29,500
And React Native is backed by really big companies like Shopify, Walmart, but also Microsoft, who

24
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:36,100
has Zammar and have actually made a commitment to react native and have invested a lot into this framework.

25
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,310
As a matter of fact, if we look at hiring trends.

26
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:46,060
Now, this is hiring trends on Hacker News, one of the most popular programmer sites in the world,

27
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:53,180
you can see a clear distinction here between job interest and job posting for Riak native versus something

28
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,590
like Samarian or flutter.

29
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:02,090
Companies are using it and companies are hiring for it, which at the end of the day is always a good

30
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:02,400
sign.

31
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:10,430
But finally, the most important point, because with these two points, I would argue that you should

32
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:16,460
use native Swift or Colline to build your iOS and Android apps.

33
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:22,820
But the big thing that Riak native really helps us with is this idea of cross platform.

34
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:31,490
Instead of as a company hiring two separate teams, maintaining two separate apps, both on iOS and

35
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:39,890
Android, you could write in, react native ones and have it run both on iOS and Android.

36
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:47,390
And whenever there's cases where there's differences for Android or iOS, you can still do that with

37
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,110
REAC native.

38
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,880
You see, Riak native apps are infinitely extensible.

39
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:58,610
What that means is that you're not actually constrained to react native and coding in JavaScript.

40
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:06,200
If you want, you can always write in pure native code like Swift and Colin in your app, in your native

41
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:13,340
app, if you want to do something outside the framework so you can always use Riak native with Swift

42
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,340
if you want to create something that needs to be really, really performing.

43
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,430
So there you have it.

44
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:25,850
I guess what I'm saying is you picked the right technology to learn, but we've been talking a lot and

45
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:30,440
I think it's time for us to actually learn instead of just hearing me blabbering on.

46
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,890
So let's get started.
