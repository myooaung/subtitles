Hey, everyone, I hope you're super excited to get started.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.780
Now, a quick note on the flow that we will follow during this course for the majority of the course,

3
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.910
I will be using the simulator.

4
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.450
Now, a majority of you may not be using the simulator.

5
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.650
You may be using the Android simulator or an Android phone locally.

6
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:28.520
So what you may see happen throughout the course is me test on Android through certain points of the

7
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.200
course and we may see something break here or there that isn't breaking on iOS.

8
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.480
Now, rest assured, this is completely normal and it will happen sporadically.

9
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.200
But throughout the videos further down, you will find the video explaining why Android is breaking

10
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.590
and what is breaking and how we can fix it.

11
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.530
So don't panic if Android is breaking.

12
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.500
But on my simulator over here on iOS, it is working.

13
00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.290
We've done our best to curate the material to showcase the differences between Android and iOS.

14
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.400
So it is completely normal to see some differences and we will cover those.
