1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:06,440
Now that we've solved one part of the equation, which is the full authentication flow, finishing the

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:12,560
full authentification flow end to end, then making sure that Firebase has full control over our session

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:18,230
and can properly manage our session because you never want to fix a feature when your infrastructure

4
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:18,900
is half built.

5
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,480
Now that we've done that.

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,870
How exactly do we fix the issue in here and so one would argue that, well, the favorite context is

7
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:32,860
broken because the favorites aren't uniquely identified in that that would be completely correct.

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:38,040
So the first thing we're going to do is we're going to import authentication context and we're going

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:44,070
to import that from dot, dot, dot, dot, slash services, slash authentication, slash authentication

10
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:44,700
context.

11
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,040
And once we have that, we're going to import use context.

12
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:55,620
And when we have our context here available, what we're going to do is we're going to see CONSED and

13
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,440
we're going to structure the user is equal to use context of authentication context.

14
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,290
And by doing that, what we now have is the user object.

15
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,260
OK, now what we need to do here is we need to uniquely identify this in some way.

16
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,170
Well, how do we how do we do that?

17
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:17,460
Well, we'll we'll retype at Favourite's because that part was OK.

18
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:23,250
And now we need some type of unique identifier between here in order to identify the user.

19
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,960
Well, we have the user object right here, so how about we use user Eweida?

20
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,160
How that could work?

21
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,480
Well, let's just put you IDM.

22
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:40,070
We don't need to do user ID and let's make that a parameter of the function the function takes in the

23
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,970
user identity in order to save and load the favorites.

24
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,240
And that way we uniquely identify the favorites at any given stage.

25
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,670
Now we have to go to our use effects.

26
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:53,060
And when we look at our use effects, will we have one main problem?

27
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:58,400
Load favourite's only loads when the uploads doesn't reload, when the user changes, and the same with

28
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,260
the favorites, it doesn't receive the favorites when the user changes.

29
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,510
So we have no idea here what the ideas.

30
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,419
So we need to add user as a dependency and user as a dependency here.

31
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,430
And we need to add a check to both.

32
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:14,390
If the user has a value, then we'll load the favorites.

33
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:20,600
If the user does not have a value, let's not try because we'll run into gnarly situations in that case.

34
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:27,230
And then in that case we'll add user uid as the parameter here and user UID as a parameter here.

35
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,130
Huh?

36
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,540
Would this solve it, would it be that simple?

37
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,220
Well, let's go take a look.

38
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:40,880
So if we go into our log function now and we log in as more beneath audio and we do test one, two,

39
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:46,040
three, we log in and we see all of our favorites.

40
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:54,870
What's going to happen here is basically when we log in, we're going to have the favorites for McGeeney,

41
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,720
which are these two.

42
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:04,600
But when we log out and we, for instance, register MO plus 12 at Beeny Audio and we do test one,

43
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,990
two, three, test one, two, three, and hit register.

44
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,380
Well, something is going to go wrong here because we're still loading the favorites of MO.

45
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,080
Why is that?

46
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,330
Why isn't it on mounting?

47
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:24,830
Well, let me show you, if we look at where the favorites context is loaded, it's loaded all the way

48
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:30,020
at the top around the authentication context provider.

49
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:37,620
Now, this is a problem, right, because all of these context providers are basically at the top level

50
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,250
and they never, ever, ever get unmounted.

51
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,680
Now, are they all our favorites, location and restaurant?

52
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,780
Absolutely necessary.

53
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:51,470
At the top level, they aren't anymore because now we have to navigator's.

54
00:03:52,020 --> 00:04:01,560
So what we want to do is any time our App Navigator mounts, that's when we want these contexts to mount.

55
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:09,600
Any time the App Navigator is mounted right over here so that around the tab navigation, that's where

56
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,830
we want to add these.

57
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:18,630
So we'll go ahead, we'll copy these and I'll just take these and then we'll save here and we'll go

58
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:24,660
over here and at the bottom will piece these, make sure that all the navigators are there.

59
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:31,950
And what we'll do now is we'll grab all three of these, which need to be added at a lower level.

60
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:37,440
Now, they can be at the app level anymore and we're going to put them at the App Navigator level right

61
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,280
over here.

62
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:44,420
And what we're going to do is we're going to make sure that they're imported from the right spot, so

63
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:52,110
that's about that and we'll make sure that that's true for all of these and this one as well.

64
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,900
And once we do that.

65
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:58,760
Now, all of these should be imported correctly.

66
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:06,620
And if we go over here to our load function, OK, now we see that we're loading the correct ones for

67
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:13,100
the user, but now when we log out, we should see when we register a new account.

68
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:22,250
So for instance, NMO plus one twenty one, two, three at Beeny audio test one, two, three, test

69
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,000
one, two, three.

70
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:30,260
If we register that account, what we should see now is that it shouldn't be rendering the favorites

71
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,370
of more one.

72
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:35,360
And that's because the context is getting unmounted.

73
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,890
It's cleaning itself up.

74
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:44,540
Previously, when the context was at the app level, we were unable to clear the app context.

75
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:49,250
We were unable to clear the favorites context because it was an app level consideration.

76
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:53,720
So navigation was rendering after all of the context.

77
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,430
So the context never got unmounted.

78
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,280
The favorite context never got cleared between sessions.

79
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,660
So every session the favorite context would stay the same and the favorite context would say the same.

80
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:10,070
And so what we learned here is that navigation plays a vital role in where we should load specific contexts.

81
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:15,950
So at the App Navigator level, once we're logged in, that's when we should start mouthing the favorites,

82
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:21,680
the locations and the restaurants, because that's where we need that information.

83
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:28,850
When we render our tab navigation, when we render our main app, when we log out, they should be cleared.

84
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:34,550
And when they're cleared and we go back to the account screen so we load up a different navigator.

85
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,870
All of these are unmounted and thus their memory is cleaned.

86
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,390
When they were at the app level, they stayed in memory.

87
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:50,000
So now what we can see is if I do NMO plus to be Nutrio and I do test one, two, three and I log in,

88
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:58,610
what I'm going to see over here is that when I load up Mobily two, I'm going to load up Mobily 2s favourite's.

89
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,010
So I'm not going to load up Mobeen ones favorites.

90
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:10,550
And when I log out here and I log in to Moab Nidderdale, that's going to enable me to load up specifically

91
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,260
Moaveni I favorites.

92
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,120
So we solve that problem.

93
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:19,280
But the bug was so nesh it had to do with code structure.

94
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,750
It had nothing to do with the actual implementation.

95
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:28,940
It had everything to do with the way in the place that we were structuring our contexts.

96
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:36,020
So putting all of the contexts right, all of the context at the entry level is not always a good idea.

97
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,910
It isn't always the best plan.

98
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:43,700
We need to put the context in the place where they're needed because we were loading the favorite context

99
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:49,850
all the time and it never got unmounted, even though we were logging out, even though we went back

100
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,870
to the account screen.

101
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:58,200
And even though we were loading a completely different navigator in the account, navigator, right,

102
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:05,010
because we swapped them out here, we weren't clearing the state properly and that was causing issues.

103
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:09,980
Now, the best way to solve this is, of course, to put the context inside the navigator.

104
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:16,920
There are other ways to clean this up in order to make sure that you can potentially inject it at the

105
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:17,790
level.

106
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:25,860
But in my opinion, that would just be hacking around context because context should only be used in

107
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,040
the spots where it's necessary and when it's not necessary anymore.

108
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:34,830
You don't need to keep it in memory anymore because why would we keep favorites, locations and restaurants

109
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:35,309
in memory?

110
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,909
Those are a consideration of the user being logged in.

111
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:44,670
And if they're a consideration of the user being logged in, that means that when we go look at indexed,

112
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:48,660
yes, they should only ever be loaded if we're authenticated.

113
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:55,950
So they should only ever be loaded if we're loading the App Navigator and that solves our bug.

114
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,210
Amazing.
