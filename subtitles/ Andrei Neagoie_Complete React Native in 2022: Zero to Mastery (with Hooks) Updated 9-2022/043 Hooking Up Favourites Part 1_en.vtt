1
00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.790
Now that we have our context set up, we want to put it in the right place, which means we have to

2
00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.140
go over to Apache's and we have to import it from the favorites context provider.

3
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:16.970
So first of all, let me take this over here, duplicate the line and put favourite's, and then I'm

4
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.890
going to import it from favourite's favorites, dot context.

5
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.730
And then what I'll do is I will wrap the top of the tree from the context provided perspective and I'll

6
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.060
wrap all of the context providers with the favorites context provider.

7
00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.100
And this will allow me to pass the methods down all the way through the tree.

8
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:44.450
OK, so now that the fever's context is set up over here, but we can go over to our features, we can

9
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.060
go to restaurants and we can go to the restaurant screen.

10
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.530
And what we could do over here is we already have used context set up.

11
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.380
So what we're going to pull in is the favorites context.

12
00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.740
And we're going to pull in that from favourite's favorites thought context.

13
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.570
What will set up here is a.

14
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.840
And we're going to pull that from favourite's context, and if we console that log, this favourite's

15
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.960
what we're going to see in our log is an empty array.

16
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.410
And as we can see here, we're seeing the empty array show up after a rerun there.

17
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.920
And just to double check to make sure that this is the correct output, we can go and we can see Materi.

18
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.010
And I'm theories being pulled in three times because there's three different Rehren, there's because

19
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.760
the data comes in and the loading and all that good stuff.

20
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.320
So we know that our favorites are set up here.

21
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:49.760
But now what we need to do is we need to figure out, OK, how are we actually going to hook this up?

22
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.760
So let's remove this real quick and let's start thinking about it.

23
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.160
We don't want to prematurely go ahead and build a feature without thinking it through.

24
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.170
When we looked at our screen, what we saw was that there was a little heart icon in the top right hand

25
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.710
corner of every single one of these cards.

26
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:15.680
So does that mean that we should go ahead and go into the restaurant info card component and build a

27
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.730
favourite's icon right inside of here?

28
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.300
Well, we can do that.

29
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.320
We can definitely do that.

30
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.550
We could go ahead and put it right beside the restaurant card cover.

31
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.510
But the issue with that is going to be that there's also logic coupled to this favorites button.

32
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.100
So first off, let's go ahead and declare our favorites button.

33
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.180
We're going to call it favorite.

34
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.260
This is going to be the feature that we're going to hook up here.

35
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:48.710
So we're going to say, hey, we're going to have a favorite and let's call it a let's call it.

36
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.870
Well, it's not really a button.

37
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.670
It's more like an icon.

38
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.140
So we're going to call it favorite in this specific case.

39
00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.580
So the favorite is going to position itself right along here, right next to the restaurant card cover.

40
00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.150
And where are we going to declare it?

41
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:12.170
Well, that's a good question, because the favorite icon needs to work and a lot of different places.

42
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.620
So we could potentially declare it as a component.

43
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.780
And what we could do is we could say, here's a new folder called Favourite's and we'll put our favorite

44
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:22.610
thought component.

45
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.830
Favorite thought component of in their.

46
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:34.490
And that's going to be the component that holistically wraps the ability for us to favored something.

47
00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:35.990
So how would that work?

48
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.730
What we're going to do in here is, first of all, we're going to get rid of the Earth, so we're going

49
00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.730
to import, react from react and then we're going to export CONSED favorite.

50
00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.640
And we're going to say that that is a component that returns null for now and then we're going to go

51
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.700
into our restaurant screen and we're going to say import favorite.

52
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.570
From that are such components of such components.

53
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.540
Favorite, favorite dark component.

54
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:11.440
And now we've gotten rid of the error and we can start building out the favored component.

55
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.790
So what is this component going to look like?

56
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.720
Because right now nothing is visual.

57
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.149
So let's close off our.

58
00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:23.810
Find her here and let's go look at how we would build out this favorite feature.

59
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.680
And so if we look at it from a ten thousand foot view, what we're basically trying to get here is the

60
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.030
ability to favorite a specific item.

61
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.720
So what we're going to need here is use context, because we're going to need the methods from the context

62
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.870
and we're going to import favourite's context.

63
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.910
We're going to import that from Balthasar, that slash services, slash favorites, slash favorites

64
00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:50.680
for context.

65
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.430
And we're going to see CONSED.

66
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.540
We're going to pull in favorites.

67
00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:03.130
We're going to pull in, add to favorites, and we're going to pull in, remove from favorites our three

68
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.970
methods and we're going to do use context, favorites, context.

69
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.930
So now we've pulled in everything we need to kind of get it going here.

70
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.330
There's something else we need here.

71
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.910
First of all, we need our styles, components from style components native, because we're going to

72
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:22.900
add some styling here.

73
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.100
We're going to add some nice styling.

74
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:30.070
We're going to add something called and design from vector icons because we want to put in a nice Hata

75
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.990
icon there and then we're going to import touchable opacity.

76
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:45.210
And let's do that from react native and what we're going to do here is we're going to see that the CONSED

77
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:52.140
favorite button is equal to a style of touchable opacity.

78
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.810
And we're going to give a very particular styles, we're going to position it in a very particular way.

79
00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.990
So here are the styles that I've kind of come up with.

80
00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.430
We're going to give it background, color, transparent.

81
00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:04.990
We don't need a border radius.

82
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.460
We're going to give it a background color.

83
00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.480
We're going to position it absolutely and we're going to play around with the Top End right position,

84
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.690
but for now I've kind of given them free rein.

85
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.430
We don't need to the final with right now.

86
00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.450
But what we need to define is a set index to make sure that it pops up to the top.

87
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.820
And we're going to put in the favorite button right in here.

88
00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:34.180
And what we're going to do with this is inside of it, we're going to put an ant design in that ant

89
00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:42.900
design is going to be a component that is going to take in an icon of the heart shape.

90
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:49.930
So what we're going to do is we're going to say name is equal to heart for now and we're going to say

91
00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.000
that the size is twenty four.

92
00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:03.100
And with that, we're going to also define the color as red just so that we can make sure that visually

93
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.490
we're seeing what we need to see.

94
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:10.360
And so right now, we can see that it is rendering in the top right corner.

95
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:15.850
So in the next video, let's look at improving the placement and actually hooking up the functionality.
