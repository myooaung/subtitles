1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,850
All right, so it's time for the solution.

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,450
OK, so I kind of gave you some tips as we went along.

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:16,270
I told you about safe area of you, and I also told you about the potential of this needing padding

4
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,370
for it to breathe.

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:23,800
So if we go look at our solution here, what we're seeing in the code is the ability for.

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:31,940
Safe area of you to wrap the views that contain both the search and the list.

7
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,320
Now, why use safe area of you?

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,700
Well, let's go look at the docks.

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,000
Right.

10
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:44,910
So if we look at the docks and we look at Sieff, area of you will safe area of you is the purpose of

11
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,240
it is to render content within the safe area boundaries of the device.

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,400
It is currently only applicable to iOS devices with iOS version 11 or Leeta.

13
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:59,400
So safe area of you Nest's the content and renders the proportion that is not covered by navigation

14
00:00:59,400 --> 00:00:59,670
bars.

15
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,830
The tab bars, the tool bars and all that good stuff.

16
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:09,450
Now we saw that right because we see over here in iOS at the bottom here and at the top here.

17
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,350
Right.

18
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,200
It's not interfering with the top in the bottom, so it's rendering the content in the safe area.

19
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,820
So this is what we would consider the safe area from here to here.

20
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,170
Amazing.

21
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:23,090
Amazing.

22
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:27,390
OK, so then we go look at what actually needs to happen within it.

23
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,560
So we put a view here and we said the padding needed to be 16.

24
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,060
Why did the padding need to be 16?

25
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,260
Because if we set it to zero, all the search bar doesn't have any breathing room.

26
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,100
Oh, that's so intense.

27
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,030
So we'll set it to 16.

28
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:42,960
Right.

29
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,790
And now it feels better.

30
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,810
Now it feels like it has adequate space to fill content in.

31
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,990
And so I don't like to give things fixed heights because I like to see how things grow before I go and

32
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,440
say, hey, you need this height or you need this height.

33
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:03,930
I like to see things dynamically grow and I like to use flex to kind of position things and see how

34
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,500
things fit on the screen first.

35
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,460
OK, we said that the safe area of view.

36
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,310
Was going to give us, well, the safe area, right, safe area here, safe area here.

37
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,520
Why did we need to give it Fleck's one?

38
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,260
What was the purpose of that?

39
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,920
Well, like we said, if we have a root container.

40
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:28,340
And we don't give it a flex property by default, it's just going to grow with the content that's inside

41
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,760
it, it's not going to assume any type of height.

42
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,530
But when we give it flex one, what we're saying is, hey, Phil, your parent in this case, the parent

43
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,300
is the app.

44
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:43,310
So we're saying, hey, if any of you make sure you always fill the parent and then we're saying, OK,

45
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:50,060
this view, we're not really going to give it a flex property because we don't really care about it's

46
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,200
Flexner's.

47
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,560
We're just going to say, hey, whatever goes in here is going to grow dynamically.

48
00:02:54,740 --> 00:03:00,200
What are we decide to put five searches or we decide to put one search.

49
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,640
It's just going to grow based on on the demand.

50
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:07,810
And so with that list, we'll get smaller on its own.

51
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,800
It's not going to overflow.

52
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,670
We're telling it to fill the parent.

53
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:16,850
And OK, so it's filling the parent, but it's not overflowing in any way, shape or form.

54
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:21,920
It's saying, well, I have this thing above me, so I'll basically taken the rest of the space.

55
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,110
Well, that looks good.

56
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:28,810
We gave it a padding of 16 pixels and we gave it a background color of blue.

57
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,820
Now, you could have done this in a very different way.

58
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:36,130
You could have said, well, hey, you know, the height here is going to be one hundred percent and

59
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,180
all that good stuff.

60
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,490
And that would have worked just as well.

61
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,600
But now, look, it's overflowing.

62
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,050
It's not really constraining itself to the boundaries.

63
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,610
It kind of flows over.

64
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:45,950
Right.

65
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,040
So Flex one is basically telling it, hey, stick to the constraints of the screen.

66
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,520
That's why we use it.

67
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,620
Now, you could have done something more flexible and said, like, I'm going to give it a fixed height,

68
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:01,540
I'm going to give it a height of three hundred or I'm going to give it five hundred and I'm going to

69
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,760
I'm going to keep going until it gets to the right spot.

70
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,260
But this isn't really dynamic.

71
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,800
It's not really going to fill with the phone.

72
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:14,080
So you can see how Flex is super powerful here and why we use it.

73
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,410
So we put the status bar over here at the bottom.

74
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:20,709
And as you can see, we wrapped it with these two fragment columns.

75
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:26,920
And so for those of you who are not familiar with fragments, they allow us to render two elements side

76
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,960
by side without having to wrap it in a specific other container.

77
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:36,460
For instance, if we said, well, let's put a view around this, well, now everything's broken because

78
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:42,430
this view does not have style flecks, one to tell it to fill the parent container.

79
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,030
And then this one needs to fill the parent of the parent.

80
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:52,780
Because if we remove this here, well, now suddenly this is just going to take in the space of this

81
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,010
one.

82
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:59,140
So it's important to determine, hey, what is our container and what is it trying to fill?

83
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,710
Is it trying to fill the space of the parent of itself?

84
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:07,420
And so I like to give background colors to the things that are trying to fill certain areas.

85
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:08,430
Right.

86
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,900
Like you could have gone and said, well, let's give this a height of one hundred percent, but now

87
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,520
you don't really see it.

88
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:22,090
But once you give it a background color of orange, you're going to see it do some odd things right.

89
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:25,150
It's going to overflow in the safe area boundaries.

90
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,310
It's overflowing in the safe area boundary.

91
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,810
So we don't want to do that either.

92
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:34,990
So Fleck's one respects the proportionality of the application.

93
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,520
Important to note here.

94
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,190
Now let's look at what that looks like on Android.

95
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,230
Oh, no, oh, no.

96
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:48,160
Look at this here, it's not respecting it's not respecting the safe area.

97
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,420
Why is that?

98
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,220
Well, like we said, the safe area of you only supports AOS.

99
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,930
So how do we go about solving this?

100
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,130
Well, that's a good question.

101
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,930
Let's look at that in the next video.
