00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:07.870
The designer comes back over and they say, hey, mom, the setting screen looks a bit sad like this,

2
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:14.590
could we add the same background that we currently have on the login and register screens?

3
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.880
Because those look pretty good and you say, sure, we can.

4
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:25.340
So you log in quickly and then what you do is you go look at the code and you say to yourself, huh?

5
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.050
In the setting screen, all I need to do is mimic what we had on the login screen.

6
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.190
That's pretty easy.

7
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:41.710
So what you do is you say contact settings background is equal to a style dot image background.

8
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.940
Same that we had.

9
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.690
And then you say attributes because we're going to set the attributes ahead of time and we'll take in

10
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.580
the source.

11
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:57.010
And we say that is a require of dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, slash.

12
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:08.370
Dot org slash assets slash and then we'll say that it is home underscore background check and by having

13
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.240
that now what we need to do is we'll say set the position.

14
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.000
To absolute.

15
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.490
Let's remove this right here so that the position to absolute set the height to 100 percent, set the

16
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:29.930
width to one hundred percent, and then once we have that, what we can do is we can go and put the

17
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.100
settings background around the safe area of you.

18
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.020
So we'll do this.

19
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:44.860
And what we can do here is just quickly wrap this and boom, if we go look at our settings screen.

20
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.720
Oh.

21
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.290
That doesn't seem to be working, does it?

22
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.050
Something must be going wrong here.

23
00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.810
Well, let's quickly reload this and double check what's happening.

24
00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:03.990
So if we go over here for some reason, the safe area must be overriding what's happening here.

25
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.539
But what happens if we put settings background right inside of here and not around the safe area?

26
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:21.800
Huh, well, then it loads, but it's not taking up the actual full height of everything, so what what

27
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.770
happens if we kind of do it like this where we wrap the safe area?

28
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.610
Like that, and we put the settings background on the top.

29
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.370
Well, that still isn't working.

30
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.300
So what if we put it at the bottom?

31
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.510
Oh, well, now it's running over top of everything that's not really what we want now, is it?

32
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:49.330
So what we need to do is we need to put our safe area back around everything and we'll put our settings

33
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.920
background like this.

34
00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.070
We'll wrap everything once more.

35
00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:03.670
But instead of using a traditional safe area, what we're going to do is we're going to create something

36
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.360
called a transparent, safe area.

37
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.430
And so what that's going to be is it's going to be.

38
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.760
A new concept, right, transparency, an area where we take a styled safe area.

39
00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.620
And we adjusted a bit.

40
00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.040
So how are we going to adjust this?

41
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.070
Well, we're going to say background color.

42
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:31.540
Transparent.

43
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:42.870
All right, and once we do that, what happens here is we actually load our settings view with the proper

44
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.860
background right over here.

45
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.840
Now, does this look amazing?

46
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.710
Well, I think it does.

47
00:03:52.380 --> 00:04:00.250
Maybe it could use a little bit of extra definition to separate out the icons.

48
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.930
What do you think?

49
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.290
So what we do is we say, well, maybe our settings item needs a background color.

50
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:16.230
So we say background color and then we say R.G. be a two five five two five, five to five five and

51
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.089
then we'll add zero point four.

52
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:19.769
And by doing this.

53
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.890
OK, now there's a bit of definition between them.

54
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.440
And what we can say here is that between the settings, items will add a spacer.

55
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.280
And by adding a spacer now, there's a bit of space between them.

56
00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:43.100
Now, this looks like a legitimate view that has a bit of definition, there's a bit of contrast between

57
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.620
the background and the items, but then the designer comes in and they say, well, I really like,

58
00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.820
aren't we building the payment and the past order soon?

59
00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.770
Aren't those coming pretty soon?

60
00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.540
And you say, yeah, yeah, those are coming pretty soon.

61
00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:04.610
What could we put the items in the list just so that we know and you say, sure, we can do it.

62
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:05.540
We definitely can.

63
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:11.720
And so what we do is we go ahead and we add some more items with spacers between them.

64
00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:20.300
And instead of them calling on logout, we temporarily make them call no and by calling no.

65
00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:29.180
Now they are able to kind of be on the screen, add some more real estate, but we need to change them

66
00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.450
up.

67
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.750
So what we see here is that.

68
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:41.140
For this one, we're going to call it past orders or let's call this one payment, and then when we

69
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:46.150
call it payment, what we're going to give it is the icon of the card.

70
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:53.540
And so here's where you'll be able to manage your payment down the line and then here will say past

71
00:05:53.540 --> 00:06:02.570
orders and when we do pass orders, what we'll do is we'll implement a ikon called history.

72
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.910
And by implementing history now we can see our past orders and our payment.

73
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:14.080
All right, so now we know that when we go to this screen.

74
00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:22.050
That we have all of these menu items to click on now, these two don't do anything right now, of course,

75
00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.720
logout is going to log me out to accidentally click that.

76
00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:32.310
And so the last thing the designer asks you to do on the screen is they find that the colors are a bit

77
00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:32.850
stark.

78
00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.450
The black is a bit stark here.

79
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:41.700
So they want the favorites to be colors, dot ui, dot error so that it's a nice red.

80
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.880
And then they ask, hey, for the blacks, could we use the UI secondary color?

81
00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.670
And you say, yeah, sure, sure we can.

82
00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:54.590
So we go ahead and remove the color and we say colors dot ui dot secondary.

83
00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:01.110
And this allows us a much nicer, much more toned down look and feel.
