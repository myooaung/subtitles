1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,570
All right, so looking at this example, it seems like there's two things we need to do, right?

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,110
First of all, we need to pick our icons and second of all, we need to copy paste what's here.

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,250
So we'll copy paste this entire thing in between here.

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,110
And it's going to be the easiest way for us to figure out how this is going to work.

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,670
So if we copy paste all of that and we go to the top navigator and we open it up, we can basically

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,140
piece that in between there.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,280
And then if we save, we're going to be set up for success here.

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:35,840
OK, so we can see when we copy paste, first of all, that the icons aren't really matching.

9
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,800
So the settings icon is already broken.

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:44,690
That isn't really working, but what we want to do here is we want to focus on, OK, what do we need

11
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:45,050
to do?

12
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:54,840
What's going on here is on the tab navigator, we're setting the prop screen options and screen options

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,740
is returning a function that is returning an object.

14
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,530
This is a shorthand notation for returning an object.

15
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,940
This is basically the same as saying, for instance, we did this in a function, right.

16
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,670
Const screen options.

17
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:16,170
We could do it like this and we could say, well, it's a function that contains the root and it opened

18
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,240
the body of the function.

19
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,510
It returns an object.

20
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:28,070
This returning of the object can be done in shorthand by doing this, by returning parentheses object,

21
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,780
it's a shorthand for just immediately returning an object.

22
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,100
So.

23
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:41,040
It has a route and it's returning an object, and that object has a Tabbaa icon, and so that Tabbaa

24
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:50,050
icon is also a function and that is eventually going to return a component, an icon component.

25
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,360
So that's what's going on here.

26
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:58,770
OK, so knowing that we now know whether or not its focus, the color and the size and the route available

27
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,760
now, first of all, we don't need to know whether it's focused or not.

28
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,070
We're not going to be changing the icon based on the focus information.

29
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,350
Now, if you did do that, that's completely fine.

30
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,360
But for my solution, I didn't go ahead and I didn't do that.

31
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,310
And so, first of all, we don't have a route named home.

32
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,190
We have a route named restaurants.

33
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:23,400
So if it's restaurants, what we want to do here is you can go to the Expo Vector Icon directory and

34
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,690
you can choose an icon.

35
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,590
Now, I chose MDE Dash Restaurant.

36
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,240
That's the one that I was focusing on, and then if the route was settings, I had something called

37
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,370
MDE dash settings, OK?

38
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:43,880
And so if we look at that real quick, what we can see now is that we already have two icons set up

39
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:49,670
here, one for the settings and one for the restaurants, and they're changing colors as they are selected.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,760
Now, what was the focus then for?

41
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:56,470
Well, the focus was for whether or not we wanted to change the actual icon when it was focused.

42
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,470
We don't want to change the icon.

43
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,140
We want to keep the same icon, but we want to fill it in.

44
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,500
OK, but we have one more tab.

45
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:09,650
So else if route dot name is equal to and then map.

46
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,380
And so what did I choose for this one?

47
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:19,910
Well, what I chose for this one is I chose icon name is equal to m the dash map and that's the one

48
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:24,980
that I picked and I left the of 10 color and the inactive color the same.

49
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,620
But you could really go and pick any color you want here.

50
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:33,050
You could for instance do this and, and have like a blue color when it's selected.

51
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,610
You can really play around with that.

52
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,050
I liked the tomato color.

53
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,460
I like the way it looked.

54
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,270
But you can customize this honestly any way you please.

55
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:49,670
And so now what we have in that simple fashion with that little code, we have TAB icons, we have TAB

56
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,410
icons available for every tab.

57
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,550
And that's absolutely amazing.

58
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:58,040
Now, let's look at a way to optimize this code potentially.
