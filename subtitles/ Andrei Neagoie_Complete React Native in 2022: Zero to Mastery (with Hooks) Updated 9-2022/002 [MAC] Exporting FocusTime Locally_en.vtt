00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.790
It's about that time.

2
00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:07.040
So far, we've built the entire focus time app.

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:16.750
But now it's time for us to go and actually look at how to take focus time outside of the snack environment

4
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.350
and run it locally on our computer.

5
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.290
Now, don't be afraid.

6
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.710
This is a complicated process, but we're going to break it down step by step.

7
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:33.790
And by the end of this, you'll be running the expo app locally on your computer.

8
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.710
And that is what we're trying to accomplish here, being able to run focus time locally.

9
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.680
OK, so first off, here we are in XPO on the snack interface, and what we want to do is we want to

10
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.730
go and open up our focus time snack that we've been building so far.

11
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:57.450
And once we've opened that up, if we go over here to the project section, the first thing we need

12
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.590
to do is we need to say export project.

13
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.200
And when we export project, it's going to say, hey, do you want to allow downloading from snack that

14
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.060
at least it does this in Safari, in other browsers that may just automatically download.

15
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.520
We're going to say allow.

16
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.870
And so with that, where we're going to get is the focus time folder.

17
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:28.380
Now, this contains all of the files that you require to run focus time locally.

18
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.170
OK, so what have we done so far, we've gone our snack, we've exported it, and we now have all of

19
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.230
the files of the code that we made.

20
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.220
We built it locally, right?

21
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.960
We exported it.

22
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.190
And we have it locally now.

23
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.260
OK, so what do we do from here?

24
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.880
Well, let's get into that step by step.
