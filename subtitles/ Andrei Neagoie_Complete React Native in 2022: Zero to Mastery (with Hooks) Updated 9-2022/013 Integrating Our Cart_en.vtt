WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:06.180
All right, let's try to visualize our cart on the screen, and so what we're going to do in the checkout

2
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.960
screen is we're going to add our cart card like our restaurant card and then our cart information in

3
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:13.760
a raw form.

4
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.120
We're going to try to do that.

5
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.570
Now, the first thing we need to do is we need to go over to our App Navigator because in our app,

6
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.220
the Navigator is where the majority of our contacts live.

7
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:31.260
So what we're going to do is we're going to add cart context provider and the cart context provider

8
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.040
is going to come from services cart cart the complex.

9
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.020
Right.

10
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:44.940
And by doing this by wrapping this down here, what we can do now is enable subsequently all of the

11
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.890
components beneath it to get the cart information now in order to do that.

12
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.310
Now, what we're going to say here is use context and then we're going to import.

13
00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.920
If we go back over here.

14
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.390
Well, actually, that's just important in a proper way.

15
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.660
Let's do import.

16
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.940
And then we'll do kaat context.

17
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:14.930
And we'll say from dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, slash and C services cart and they'll say

18
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.000
Calthorpe context.

19
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.960
And by doing this, we can now say over here, return.

20
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.180
Turn and so say Consed.

21
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.870
Cart is equal to the U.S. context of Kaat context.

22
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:41.580
All right, and what we can then do is, for instance, import text from Riak native.

23
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.040
Right.

24
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.510
Quickly get a text box going.

25
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.610
And put it down here or maybe up here, let's put text, text.

26
00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:03.660
And let's do a Jason thought string ify this whole string of the information, so transform it into

27
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.340
text of khat.

28
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.520
And if we do that and we go over here to khat, undefined is not an object using khat context.

29
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.200
So is this actually the value that I need to be importing?

30
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.280
Let's go look over here.

31
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.040
We can see export cost, khat context.

32
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.370
So I'm importing khat context.

33
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.490
Undefined is not a value.

34
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.330
So let's go take a look here in the values.

35
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.670
I am exposing khat.

36
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.190
So what exactly is going on here?

37
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.970
And so if we if we quickly go look over here in our terminal.

38
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.820
And we.

39
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.050
What will be able to see is.

40
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.210
Context is not so let's console that log cart context.

41
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.840
And see if that gives us anything.

42
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.020
So by doing that.

43
00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:03.350
Let's Consolo all get outside here that way we at least get it so kaat context does have a value, right?

44
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:12.130
And context is allowing us access, so let's do let's just quickly do context here.

45
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.280
And instead of doing this, let's just put a string here for now and let's cancel that log the context

46
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.550
here.

47
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.170
And let's see what we get.

48
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:29.920
So if we reload here and then we go over to our checkout screen, what we'll be able to see if we scroll

49
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.860
up here is undefined.

50
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:40.330
And if we go ahead and take a look at our car context, we can see that we made a minor typo right here.

51
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.100
This is supposed to be value.

52
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:48.590
And so if we fix that up and then we go to our checkout screen, where we're going to see here is that

53
00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:56.600
if we reload and we scroll to the bottom cart now has all of the values, small, minor typo caused

54
00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.730
a lot of grief, though.

55
00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:07.070
And so over here now we can take the card off of the context and we can put the cart inside of JSON

56
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:13.970
that string Afie and over here, then we'll see an empty array and we'll see the array populate as we

57
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.710
implement our feature set.

58
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.570
And so if we head on over to the restaurant detail screen inside of the restaurant detail screen is

59
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:28.900
where we will be implementing our button and will be doing it outside of the scroll view of the coffee,

60
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.400
the coke and like the menu.

61
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.670
Right.

62
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.050
Basically outside of there.

63
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.890
What we're going to be doing is we're going to be putting a spacer and that spacer is going to create

64
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.540
some space between the menu and our order button.

65
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:49.420
So we're going to say position well, actually, between the bottom and our button, rather, we already

66
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.920
have sufficient space between the menu.

67
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:58.570
So if we put bottom and then we put size equal to large, what we're going to put inside here is something

68
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.340
called a order button.

69
00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.690
And that order button is going to be a component that we're going to get.

70
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.460
So first of all, we need our space here in here.

71
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.590
So let's go ahead and get our spacer.

72
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:21.210
Let's rather let's just do import spacer and let's do that from and say, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot,

73
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.740
dot, slash component spacer and then spacer that component.

74
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:32.390
And then once we have our Spizer, our order button is going to come from, well, you guessed it.

75
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.710
It's going to come from a style styles file.

76
00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:46.880
So in order for us to do that, what we're going to need to build is a new file over here right inside

77
00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:47.630
of components.

78
00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.090
And we're going to call that well inside of restaurant lists, files, rather.

79
00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.690
And so what we're going to do is we're going to export CONSED and we're going to say order button here

80
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.200
in that order button is going to be of type.

81
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.420
Styled button.

82
00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:09.880
And that button is going to come from react need of paper, so we're going to import the button component

83
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.650
from react native paper.

84
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:19.730
And so now that we have that button component, we can put it over here and then we can say that it

85
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:20.670
works like this.

86
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.990
Now, one more thing we need to do to this button component is we need to give it colors.

87
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:31.010
So we're going to say attributes like we've done in the past, and we're going to say that the color

88
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.430
is colors, dot brand, thought primary.

89
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.220
That's one more thing we want to do inside of here.

90
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.260
Now, Colors is an imported here.

91
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:47.570
So we're going to say import colors from Volvox, thoughts about infrastructure, and then we're going

92
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:51.320
to see theme and we're going to take the colors.

93
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:58.550
And with that, we now have all of our colors, then what we need to do is we need to set a padding

94
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:59.090
on this.

95
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.090
So we're going to say padding and we're going to do props.

96
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.380
And there's always props, thought theme dot space.

97
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:10.190
We're going to select the second spacing on this because that's what we need.

98
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:17.380
Then we're going to say that this button only has a width of 80 percent and we're going to align it

99
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:23.740
self to the center, and by putting all of these properties ahead of time, what we can do now is in

100
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.030
the restaurant detail screen.

101
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.830
Well, we're going to go ahead and we're going to import order button.

102
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:39.280
From thoughts, component's restaurant lists, styles, and by having this order button here.

103
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:45.100
What we need to do now is we need to give it some.

104
00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:54.220
So we'll say order button and we'll say order special, only twelve ninety nine.

105
00:07:55.290 --> 00:08:00.090
OK, so by doing this now, if we go inside of into any of these.

106
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:09.700
Well, now we're seeing the actual button pop up, right, we're seeing it happen right before our eyes,

107
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:14.160
but it's not really coming along the way that we would expect it to look.

108
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:17.630
So we're going to say mode is equal to contained.

109
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:24.520
And by doing that, now, it's all filled in, that's the button we want to see, this is what it's

110
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.400
supposed to look like.

111
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:33.600
OK, well, we'll also give it an icon and we'll say that the icon is equal to cash dash USD.

112
00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:38.179
And by doing that, now, there's a little icon here that's looking a lot better.

113
00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:46.350
And one more thing we need to do on press, and this is going to be a function that's going to actually

114
00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:50.030
implement what's going to happen when you add the cart.

115
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:53.760
OK, so we have our button, right?

116
00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.160
We have our cart visualized here.

117
00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:03.020
And we have our we have everything set up to go, but we don't have our cart inside of you.

118
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:09.690
So one more thing we're going to need here is we're going to need to import Kaat context.

119
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:18.060
We're going to import that from our thoughts, our thoughts about slash services, cart cart context.

120
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:26.760
Right, and so by doing that now, what we can do is we can say use context.

121
00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:30.160
And we can say const.

122
00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:40.190
Or rather, add to cart is equal to the U.S. context of cart counting.

123
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:42.800
And now that we have add to cart.

124
00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:49.880
We can basically add the cart over and that's exactly what we want to do, right?

125
00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:56.020
We want to add to CART and we want to say that our item is special.

126
00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:02.800
And then what we want to see right, is that the price is twelve, ninety nine.

127
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:09.410
And the reason we're going to put the price like this is because the expectation is that the rounding

128
00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:10.910
happens at the last two numbers.

129
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.360
So if we have twelve dollars it would be like this.

130
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:15.200
In this case this is twelve ninety nine.

131
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.880
So the rounding happens at the last two numbers, this would be one hundred twenty dollars and 99 cents.

132
00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:21.860
This would be one hundred twenty dollars.

133
00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:26.180
So that's the way that Strib is expecting the price to come in.

134
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:33.200
OK, so knowing that we can now add the cart and if we hit this button, what we're going to see here

135
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.430
items special.

136
00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:35.590
Twelve ninety nine.

137
00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:36.950
Amazing.

138
00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.220
But there's one issue here, right?

139
00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.690
There's one small issue.

140
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:44.500
We didn't add the restaurant.

141
00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:46.980
So what is the restaurant right now?

142
00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:53.340
Well, let's go take a look at the checkout screen if we pull in the current restaurant.

143
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:58.210
And we said, hey, show me the current restaurant.

144
00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:01.570
Well, that's not going to have a value at all.

145
00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.760
So if we said restaurant.

146
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:07.930
That doesn't have a value.

147
00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:12.540
So there's one more thing we need to actually do in our.

148
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:23.150
Restaurant details screen that we've forgotten to do, right, and that is we need to pass in the current

149
00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:26.870
restaurant, that was the second parameter.

150
00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:32.930
So if we take the current restaurant and we say, add the cart, this item to this restaurant.

151
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:41.150
Now, if we go over here and we hit this again, now we see the full restaurant and we see that our

152
00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:42.890
cart has two specials.
