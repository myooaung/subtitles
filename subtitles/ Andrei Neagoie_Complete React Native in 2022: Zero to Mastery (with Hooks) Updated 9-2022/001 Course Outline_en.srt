1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:07,200
Helloooo, I'm super excited to start this course with you, but as always, we need to see where we're

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,240
starting and where we're ending up.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,560
So we have a clear path to becoming a react native developer.

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,810
So let's see what this course looks like for you.

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:23,220
Now, keep in mind that the goal of this course is for you to be able to build any mobile apps, both

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,430
on iOS and Android that you want.

7
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:32,070
There's a reason that companies like Microsoft, Facebook, Wal-Mart are heavily using react native and

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,690
we're going to learn all about it.

9
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:34,860
So how do we start?

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,170
Well, obviously, the first thing we're going to do is learn about the react native foundations.

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,210
How does it work?

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,110
What is actually happening?

13
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,370
How do we write code and then have that code work on our phones?

14
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,480
Everything to do with mobile development?

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,040
We're going to learn in this section.

16
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,630
But here's the thing.

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,210
In order for you to learn react native, you also need to learn.

18
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:57,890
React.

19
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:04,019
Now, for some of you taking this course, you already have experience with react, but for those who

20
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,670
don't, we actually offer a second path where you can do an introductory React section.

21
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,340
So you get familiar with the concept. For those that already know React, you can skip that section.

22
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,130
Now, from there, we're going to go right into building things.

23
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:23,190
Our first app that we're going to build is FocusTime, and this is a real app that you're going to

24
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,730
have on your phone that will actually make you more productive.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,410
Using the Pomodoro technique, you're going to be able to have better studying habits.

26
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:37,500
So we actually build a useful app that hopefully you can use throughout the course. In here, you'll learn

27
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,770
all the basics about react native and how to go from zero to having something on your phone.

28
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,330
Now, one of the hardest things of being a mobile developer is the environment setup.

29
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:54,450
So we're going to make sure that we accommodate everybody, whether you are a Windows, Mac or Linux

30
00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:02,610
user or you have an Android and iOS phone or no phone, we're going to use tools like Expo, Xcode,

31
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:09,120
Android Studio, iPhone simulator, Android simulators and other tools so that you can follow along

32
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,920
this course no matter what tools you have and you get to pick the developer environment that you want.

33
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,790
All right.

34
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,010
So that was just the beginning of the course.

35
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,750
We've built an app.

36
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:26,190
We have some understandings of react native, but nothing solid yet because to really learn a technology,

37
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,460
you have to build things with it.

38
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:35,130
You have to build big applications, big apps to truly understand the power and go off on your own and

39
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,410
build something great.

40
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,020
So we dive into our master project.

41
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:40,760
That's right.

42
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,450
This course is all about learning by doing.

43
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:49,260
Once we have the basics, we're going to start building our restaurant recommendation app called Meals

44
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:49,640
to Go.

45
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,580
Now, you've already seen in the promo video what the app looks like.

46
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,720
It looks really, really good.

47
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,240
And we have a lot of features that we're going to add.

48
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:03,750
So as we learn about react native, we're going to build up this massive app that you'll be able to show

49
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,020
off.

50
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:09,840
We're going to use things like react navigation, which allows us to have multiple pages and navigation

51
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,410
on our app.

52
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:16,770
We're going to learn about users and how to use things like Firebase to have user sign in, sign out

53
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,150
authentication, a very important thing for almost any app.

54
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:27,240
We're going to learn about styling our apps using tools like styled-components and other tools around

55
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,620
the web to build really pretty apps that look good.

56
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,220
Now, I know people get excited about this.

57
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:38,520
So later on in the course, we're also going to implement Stripe payments so you can actually take payments

58
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,600
from your app because, hey, if you're building an app, might as well make money out of it.

59
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:48,960
But before we get into Stripe or all these payments, we're also going to build a map feature on our

60
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,010
app so that we can search for restaurants in different locations.

61
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,960
And we're going to use what most app use in this case, which is the Google Maps API.

62
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,270
So you're going to learn to work with APIs as well.

63
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,720
Finally, you also get to learn about animations.

64
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,580
Mobile apps are interactive.

65
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,890
You need to have good user experience.

66
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:14,460
And in here we're going to use a very popular library by Airbnb called Lote to learn about animations

67
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,950
and how we can add animations to our app.

68
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,620
It's going to be a lot of fun. At the end of it all.

69
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:25,170
Once we've build up the code, once we've learned how to build apps using react native, how to build

70
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:31,800
large apps using react native, that's when we get to have fun a bit and add a bit more styling to our

71
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,100
app.

72
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:38,160
Different colors, different patterns, so that by the end of it, all of our apps are going to look

73
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,930
unique so that it's not just a generic app that looks the same for everybody.

74
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,890
We want you to be able to put this project on your portfolio and stand out.

75
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:52,920
Oh, and I almost forgot at the end of it all, we're going to teach you how to actually deploy these

76
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:58,020
apps to the App Store and Google Play store, because why else will we build an app?

77
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,700
We are building an app so that we can.

78
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,010
Distribute it to others around the world.

79
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:07,170
So we're going to learn all about that, both on iOS and Android, about device permissions, about

80
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,640
styling and layout.

81
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:15,720
And by the way, if I didn't mention this already, this course uses the latest version of React Native,

82
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,680
which means.

83
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:17,520
Yep, that's right.

84
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,370
We're going to be using react hooks to build our app.

85
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,560
And then finally, we're going to also learn about how to debug our apps, how to improve them constantly,

86
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:31,050
so that when we put them on the App Store or the Google Play store and people will report bugs, we

87
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,220
know how to fix those.

88
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,960
As you can see, we have a lot to cover, but it's going to be a lot of fun, I promise.

89
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,670
You will make it fun along the way.

90
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:43,500
And as long as you give us your attention and focus, you'll come out of the other end.

91
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,040
A strong react native developer.

92
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,870
We're going to take you from zero to mastery.

93
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:56,180
But here's the thing, the best part of this whole course is our online private community of over two

94
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,530
hundred thousand programmers.

95
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:03,380
We have people chatting every day, helping each other out, solving problems, doing coding challenges

96
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:08,330
together, and just talking about the latest news, the greatest tools in programming.

97
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,510
This is an optional resource for you to use so you can have a back and forth conversation with other

98
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:20,660
students and feel like you're part of a classroom. As instructors, were also on there every day chatting

99
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,290
with students.

100
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,280
All right.

101
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,060
You know what?

102
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,410
That's a lot of talking for me.

103
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,230
I want to start building apps.

104
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,630
I'm sure you want to start building apps, too.

105
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,960
So let's dive in.

106
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:30,920
Let's learn.

107
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,670
React Native.
