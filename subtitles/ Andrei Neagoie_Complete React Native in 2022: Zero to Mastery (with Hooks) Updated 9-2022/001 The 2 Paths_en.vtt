00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:08.560
It's time for the two parts, this is going to be dependent on you and which path you take from this

2
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:15.550
point forward, you either, know, react or you don't know, react.

3
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.290
And we've structured this course in a way that is accommodating to everybody.

4
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.000
So let's say you've worked with react before on the Web, you know, react you've learned about components,

5
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.540
about state and props and you know what those things are, then you can proceed with the course and

6
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.220
just move on to the next lecture.

7
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.700
And we're going to start assuming that, you know, basic react and we're going to teach you react native.

8
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.920
However, if you've never worked with react before, you're still not sure what it is or you just want

9
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.300
to refresh the fundamentals of why react is and why react is used for building you eyes.

10
00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.300
Then we've created an appendix section so you can jump to the bottom of the course in the appendix where

11
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.630
says learning react and start doing those lessons.

12
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.240
Once you finish those and you have the fundamentals of react, you're able to build things with react,

13
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.900
then you can come back to this lesson and continue with the course.

14
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.040
All right.

15
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.240
I'll see you in the next one.

16
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.780
Bye bye.
