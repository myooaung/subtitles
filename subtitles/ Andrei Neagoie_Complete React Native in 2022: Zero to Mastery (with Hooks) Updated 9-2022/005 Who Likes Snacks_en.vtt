00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:08.870
Now that we've created our own focus time snack, there are a couple of things in this particular UI

2
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.090
or user interface that you need to get used to.

3
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.079
On the left hand side, you'll see that we can see the files that are currently open.

4
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.710
And the project files themselves and these files are important because this is where we're going to

5
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.410
do most of the creation of our components.

6
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.110
So on the left side, we can do stuff like creating folders, creating files.

7
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.850
We can import files if we need it to things like that.

8
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:44.320
Then in the center, we have the currently open file so we can see things like, for example, code

9
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.890
or the actual app code.

10
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.690
And then here on the right hand side, we can see how we can run our code.

11
00:00:52.720 --> 00:01:02.380
Now, Expo by default implements both iOS, Android and Web capabilities.

12
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.730
Now, for the intents and purposes of this course, we are focusing on Expo with iOS and Android.

13
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.460
So whatever we do may not be completely portable to a Web application.

14
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.920
But just keep in mind that when using Expo you do get some of those capabilities.

15
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.030
But we're focusing mainly on creating mobile applications.

16
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.920
So we're focusing on iOS and Android.

17
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.790
And you can also see here the my device tab.

18
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.040
So you're able to run this on your own device.

19
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.080
Now, we already saw in the previous video that if you tap to play, you can launch a simulator that

20
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.570
is running your app locally.

21
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:53.800
And you can see over here that we're able to see our code as it changes and shifts inside of the simulator.

22
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.160
And we can do it both on iOS and Android.

23
00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.780
If we tap here to play, we can see it happen on Android.

24
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:09.850
Now, the one drawback to using this mechanism over here is that there are limited spots available when

25
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:10.509
running here.

26
00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:11.620
Now, what do I mean by that?

27
00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.720
Now, Expo is giving you all of these capabilities just in the browser.

28
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.950
Right.

29
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.600
But it's actually running on a real device.

30
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.300
You're running on a real Android device in a real device.

31
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.890
That means that there is the possibility that you may have to queue up at a certain point.

32
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.070
There are maybe a lot of people running snacks and trying it out on iOS and Android.

33
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.730
And that's why we can look here at the my device tap.

34
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.600
If you download the client on your phone and you scan this QR code, you can run the code that's right

35
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.060
here directly on your phone.

36
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.990
So let's see how to do that before we get into the weeds of coding.
