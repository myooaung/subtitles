00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.830
life of a component begins,

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:02.430
men react.

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.180
Instance shirts that class corresponding to the component an inch,

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:06.700
then the U.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:06.810
N.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.270
No longer it was the component.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.320
During this life cycle,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.290
react executes various functions of the component.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.500
In this lecture,

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.950
you're gonna learn all about them.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.060
Please know that this applies only to a state Full compliment.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.910
Since the stateless component is just a function,

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.300
the lifecycle functions can be understood very well.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.170
With this dagger,

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.630
life of a component is divided into three different stages mounting stage updating states

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.510
and unknown ting stage in the mountain state,

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.670
the component is instance created and the component is rendered onto the really dumb and

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.990
there are few functions executed as part of the life cycle.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.980
The first is the constructor,

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:48.410
of course,

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.890
because every class,

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.260
when it is instead ensuring the constructive is called.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.620
After that reacted calls s static function called get it out of state from rocks.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.250
Dysfunction will have access to the crops that are coming from the parent as well as the

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.870
default state of the component.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.390
And we have to return either an updated state based on the props are No.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.280
If there is no change in the state.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.390
Once this is done,

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.590
react then calls.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.540
They render function,

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.660
which is responsible for building the word shell dung tree based on their data available in

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.110
the state and drops once they render function is complete.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:30.580
Yet now is gonna compare the world chill down with real down and then any changes are there

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.580
.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.670
It will update the real dumb using the Watcher country once the real dumb is ready and the

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.180
component dickman function will be executed.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.840
First,

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.760
let us understand the mounting stage by an example for this.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.940
I already have created a project that is going to display a hitch,

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.340
one on a nature.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.380
So let's go have a look at that individual studio core.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.940
As you can see that the SRC has indexed,

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:56.790
or Js,

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.520
which defines an app as a component,

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.250
and they render function has a single deal with H one and H R.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.150
As to child element,

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:12.280
we also have another file here in next RCs is we just add some right margin to a button and

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.650
let's not clear a new component under the SRC folder by creating a new file called Counter

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:28.120
at dot GS and since this is going to be a state full every type I am RC to import reactive

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.920
component and then type your C C s toe a component class to begin with.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:42.040
Let's just have a do which contains a probably hit three with some kind of title netted

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.970
potato is called counter at Save this.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.260
Let's go back to the index.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:57.010
Terje s import the same by anything you put comfortable at from dot slash Contra and we

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:06.730
will try toe include the same over here by JP counter at slash Say this And if I go back to

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.420
the closer,

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.030
we should now see a history here that this counter No,

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.160
To understand the lifecycle functions,

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.990
we should be able to dynamically load this component whenever we want.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.980
For this,

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:26.950
we will rate apart in here class named because toe video and video in cash primary and we

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:34.880
will have a caption saying that show our hide found a compliment on Click off this button.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.210
We would like to either display this counter are we would like to remove that and this can

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.950
be done by having a boolean variable as part of the state like this.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:51.580
That scared available called ST equals Toe in current Like let's call it as a show content

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.580
.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.420
We'll initialize this so far,

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.320
indicating in the beginning it should not be displayed.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.810
We cannot do that Live record,

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.570
expression toe include an if condition.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:06.090
So that has to be done before the written statements or what we will do Is your clear

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.920
available called Collect All four equals toe No,

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.450
on this is gonna be the awkward non somebody who was a foot like this.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.880
But if this starts stated show counter up equals to truth,

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:28.230
then they offered equals toe counter at like this and obviously no,

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.150
because it is initially force.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.010
This condition is fate.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:38.500
So the whole good remains now and nothing is or pull over here or on click of the button.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.810
I would like toa change the value off this toe,

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:42.360
Drew.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.250
And then,

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.000
in that case,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.690
because the state gets changed,

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.400
render is called again and then this condition becomes true.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.490
Allport is a new component card counteract component and that is gonna be all good old here

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.490
.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.920
So we're not associating any even Dentler for this button that I'm an event handler.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.420
Car on click equals two now generally v rate a function,

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.560
and then we ascend that function over here.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.510
This time we really use and another miss function like this.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.260
So the anonymous function gets executive on Click off the button,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.420
and all I do here is to talk about the value off show contact,

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.280
and this is that we lose.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.870
This starts Sex State,

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.820
and the name of the reliable is show counter.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.340
But we want to reverse that.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:36.160
So we'll say not off this start State art show contra.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.560
So when I was a value off that is there currently were the struggling by using this,

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.410
not save this.

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:43.840
Go back to the closer.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.410
Now we have a button and there is no component.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:48.520
When I took on this,

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.130
the component comes when I click on this again,

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.280
the component is removed to understand the lifecycle functions.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.830
In the mounting stage,

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.490
we have a constructor.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:03.150
Let us are a function called get direct straight from props We already have rendered and

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.080
will also add a function for component did mount and we'll just do some console logs in

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.870
each one off them.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.820
So let's go back to the condom.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.660
We'll add a constructor first.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:21.210
That's American so long saying Counter Don't constructed.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:30.150
We'll also have a consulate here in the red that function by typing similar or court under

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.950
Abd art.

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.260
Linda called.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.580
Believe your one more function called static.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.360
Get divided state from props,

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.050
and this receives two parameters,

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.000
robs and state.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.510
And don't think this is a static function,

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.840
which means there is no access toe.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:50.980
This keyword here,

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:57.360
all we have to do is to eight the value from the props required a state object and then

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.160
written the same.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.630
And you don't have to do this if there is no changes in the prompts,

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.190
so we can simply say return.

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:03.750
No,

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.710
and we'll also include a console log.

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:15.600
Seeing that counter at DOT get direct state from France is called that are one more

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.100
function called component did mount,

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:29.440
and then they consider long indicating governor at dot Component did Mount Corn.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:36.370
I almost forgot that instructor must call the super class constrictor in case off

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:37.250
inheritance.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:40.170
Let's call it as super and say this.

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:45.300
Go back to the browser and click on this button to lower the counter at Component.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:50.160
It's click on that and you will see now that there are a few logs and if you carefully

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.160
observed the first logs,

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.960
his contract constructor card,

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.000
that's what I tell you.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:54.490
It stays here.

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:56.410
The constructor is going to be called first.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:57.670
After that,

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:01.530
it is going toe get Dillard State from props function.

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:06.730
So we're getting the old guard from counteract art Get the road state from prompts And then

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:13.110
the counteract dot render got called and then counter after component did amount.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:15.100
So that's what Actually the lexical stays here.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:18.060
Constructor get their state from props,

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:21.470
render and then component did amount came up.

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:24.890
This happens during the mounting stage off a component.

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:27.450
So if you click on this button now,

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:32.750
the component is going to be removed from the and hence the component is no longer required

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:32.750
.

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:36.010
This is called as the UN mounting stage,

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:37.810
and during the on mounting stage,

00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:40.630
the only function that is called is component will.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:41.320
On March,

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.980
let's go and add that function toe our counter up.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:52.580
So I'm gonna add over here component ville unmarked and then just a console log seeing

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:57.350
counter dark component ville on Mt.

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:58.510
Corner.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:00.920
Save this,

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.650
Go back to the browser,

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:04.200
click on this button.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:09.350
Once you'll see that it's executing those mounting stage life cycles.

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:11.570
And if I click on this once,

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:18.860
you'll see that contact at dot component villain mulch called No Other Mountain Stage

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:20.130
lifecycle functions,

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:23.670
followed by a mounting lifecycle functions.

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:24.920
Each time it is done,

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:29.550
you can see that it's a new object that gets constructed and all the life cycle functions

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:30.330
are executed.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.340
And then the one mounting happens.

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:33.130
Component will.

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:34.950
Unmoored is being called.

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:38.830
One of the component is loaded on and stays back on the you are.

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:44.640
It is possible that the state off the component may change Are the new properties may come

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:51.050
from the apparent are probably you might call a force update function to really end at the

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:51.740
component.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.290
In all these cases,

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:56.390
these are the lifecycle functions that are executed.

00:09:56.390 --> 00:10:02.390
Imagine in the counter I I have a number to display an important toe increment the number

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:05.750
and each time I increment the number the state gets changed.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:09.650
During that time it goes through all these functionalities.

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:13.050
So the first thing that happens is get the record straight from trumps.

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:17.500
It was you that there might be changes in the props that is coming from the parents,

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:20.590
or do you want to really update the state based on the promise,

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:22.770
then this function can be useful.

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:25.740
Then there is another function can surely component.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:26.390
Update.

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:28.770
Dysfunction is a boolean function,

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:33.710
which means you have to return to our phones if you have returned the Drew from this

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:34.310
function,

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:36.670
then it goes through the rest of the life cycle.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:37.500
Function settles,

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:42.250
render get snap shirt before updated and then component deducted.

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:45.220
But if the function returns falls for some reason,

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.770
in spite of the state when you're getting changed,

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:51.140
the Rendall will not happen because the render doesn't happen.

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.370
The rest of the lifecycle functions are also skipped.

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:55.010
Then there is the force of debt.

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:56.790
If you call the Force update,

00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:00.000
then again get the Red State from props is called,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.850
followed by the render and then followed by the rest of the lifecycle functions.

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.270
So do the monster.

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:07.120
The same thing.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.650
Let's go on on a couple of things in our content.

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:12.850
Number one.

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:15.690
Let's into the state here for count.

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:20.540
Initially it is one and this way we wanted this letter on our render,

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:23.130
so probably right below this I wanted to say something,

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:25.500
and I hear a rough value.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.490
Off count is this start.

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:31.950
State Star Count will also provide a button.

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:37.760
Do increment the seem So we'll take your partner class name.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.270
It was toe VT in pity and their secondary.

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:44.870
Will they implement count?

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:50.290
And we also want toe instrument the value off this particular stayed.

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:55.560
So let's add an anonymous even handler for this 7% a year.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:59.730
Type on glee equals toe income bracket.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:02.050
Let's add a anonymous function,

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.450
which is to start set state.

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:06.770
The value is count.

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:16.340
Distort state are found plus one this Go back to the Rosa now We should have a new button

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:17.100
over here,

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.030
and each time I click on this,

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:22.410
you can see that there is a increment that is going on.

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:27.360
Let's ignore this section for a while because we're not it on the lifecycle functions yet,

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:31.350
But we're able toe rear end of the component when the state has changed.

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:32.090
That said,

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:38.630
the remaining lexical functions that are important number one should confirm it off it.

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:41.510
I should say it is true for now,

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:53.650
the next function is get snap shirt before up did and we should return something so that

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:54.160
certain?

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:54.590
No,

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:58.360
for the time be and then compliment it off.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:03.260
This nothing here in all the three of them were,

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:03.690
you know,

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:04.130
right,

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:05.430
a concern Launch under.

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:09.850
Copy this and based in each one off them make the necessary changes.

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:14.350
So I changed the function names here.

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:20.320
All right,

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.310
save this.

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:23.280
Go back to the browser.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:28.950
Click on this and the mounting stage lifecycle functions have in the car.

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:30.490
Let me clear this.

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:31.210
Now,

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:33.350
when I click on this increment count,

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:40.810
you'll see that the count gets incriminated mainly because that is gonna call first to get

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:42.190
the record straight from trumps.

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:48.160
There is no court insect that and then it's actually calling the should component update,

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.320
which returns true.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.650
Which means it's gonna call.

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:51.640
They render function.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:57.300
And the render function displays this number once again on click on this.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:03.840
You will see that after that it has gone to a function called get statured before it

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.060
returns None.

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:09.550
And this is where the difference between the watch Ildem and the real down,

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:15.690
which means the incriminating the V C on the browser happens here after that busy component

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:17.040
did update function called.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:20.500
So you can see that it's calling the good Dillard State from promise.

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:21.090
Sure,

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:26.490
the confident update This car followed by Rendall followed by get statured before update

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:28.570
followed by component deducted.

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:33.080
But if I go and return falls from this sugar competent upped it.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.170
Yeah,

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:38.680
and we'll also print the value off the state.

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.390
That is the count in the same Lancelot here.

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:44.620
I'm gonna say this starts ST dot count,

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:47.040
so see whether it is incriminated or not.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:52.790
So let's go back to the browser and take on this toe Make this visible that make clear this

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:57.730
I click on this increment count and know that there are lexical functions going on,

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:59.880
but it is not incriminating,

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:04.850
but you can see on the other side in the country log were able to see this.

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:08.910
This is where force update can also be used.

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:09.620
For example,

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:10.900
the state is changing,

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.290
but it's not a real rendering over here.

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:15.330
So if I call the force of date,

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:18.940
then the render function would be caught as indicated in here.

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:22.690
So calling the force of date will call the render function unconditionally,

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:25.550
followed by all other life cycle functions.

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:33.680
It's come back to this and written to over here save this to understand the use of force of

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.960
did let's go and add one more variable,

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.330
but not in the form off the state,

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.770
but just a variable called numb.

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:42.950
It quotes to one.

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:46.760
So I'm just adding a member variable called Numb Here.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.930
I'm also going to have one more button just like this.

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:52.260
Which is that in government?

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.520
The value off the number seven.

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:57.670
Copy this and based here once more.

00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:01.790
And when say you're this starts,

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:02.590
said state,

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:04.030
this is not a state here.

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:05.160
So instead of this,

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:09.450
I'm gonna call this DOT know plus plus.

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:11.750
And since we're incriminating the number,

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:14.470
let's call this caption as increment numb.

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:17.200
Let's also have another ballot off here.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:22.390
They will display value off Bumpy's on its implement.

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:23.370
This starts now.

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:25.050
Save this.

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:31.220
Go back to the browser and now we should be able to see value of content value off some

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:34.730
water them no clicking on the increment count.

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:39.370
You'll see that it's changing lifecycle functions executed.

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:40.380
Let me clear this.

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.560
If I click on increment numb,

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.300
it is incriminating,

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.000
but I'm not able to see that Over here.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.380
You can actually put a console log here if you want,

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:50.500
but that's not necessary.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:56.970
The reason why it is not reflected on the browser is because we're not changing the state

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:57.330
here.

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:01.080
We're just implementing the value off numb which is not a state variable,

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.100
but a member variable.

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:08.850
This occasion there is no life cycle functions in world because react is not aware off this

00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:08.850
.

00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:10.470
So all we do is we,

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.950
you know,

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:16.120
expand this function instrument This year after implementing,

00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:22.150
I can now say this start for subbed age and because we're doing a force update Now,

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:27.550
we are actually asking the lifecycle function called Render to be a real walked.

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:33.080
And the render now gets the latest value from the start now and displays the same on the U

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:33.080
.

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:33.180
S.

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:38.020
After the render there is a gets captured before update and then company deducted.

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:39.450
Its functions will be called.

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:41.810
It's going save this.

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:43.780
Come back to the browser,

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:46.600
show the component.

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:50.050
So both of them are showing it as one on one.

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:52.800
I increment the count and it just incriminating.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:53.150
Also,

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:55.880
lifecycle functions card and clear the screen.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:18:00.620
Now I click on increment numb and you'll see that it is implemented,

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:06.170
but also the life cycle functions being called so force of date because that get Dillard

00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:11.490
State from Trump's followed by render followed by the rest of the life cycle functions as

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:12.980
you can see over here as well.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:18.410
So changes in the state are called to the force of dead executors.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:20.390
All the lexical function that b a c.

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:22.400
According to this picture,

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:26.710
whenever there is a new properties that are coming from the period component,

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:31.190
these lifecycle functions are triggered once more to understand the same,

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:38.630
let's goto our counter at and change this caption toe this start Rob start later.

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:39.970
Of course,

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:45.570
we don't have crop subtitle which means whenever the counter rap is being used,

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:46.950
we should be supplying that.

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:49.880
So we're gonna supply the same thing from here.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:54.040
This is where the counter up is being instance created so I can stay here.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:19:00.030
Title equals to something like counter at B 1.0.

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:01.020
Saved this.

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:02.690
Go back to the browser,

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:03.790
click on this.

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:06.050
You can see that the caption is coming from there.

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:11.330
We'll also provide a partner over here to change the caption toe something else and to do

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:16.470
that we will now have this title coming from the state we're gonna have here.

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:19.280
Idol is Counter,

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:28.940
and this will change toe a curly bracket distort ST dot title with outside a button over

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:29.510
here.

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:31.450
I'm gonna copy the centerpieced.

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:42.800
Let's call this as PDM second and then on click off this.

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.180
I want to do some conditional stuff.

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:52.860
If they start state our title equals toe counter at then let's change this to something

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:57.980
else by taking distort sex Cage off titled to let her,

00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:58.870
for example,

00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:59.910
it pronto.

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:04.260
Yes,

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:06.290
we will put this back toe counter,

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:09.740
But I think this start said State off.

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:11.670
I do Teoh.

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:20.560
So it's just basically going toe toggle the actual item from either counter up to a click

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:21.060
on that.

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:23.620
So this is also to change.

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:28.770
So we're gonna change this store dog in the fight to save this,

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:30.980
I go back to the browser.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:34.840
You're gonna show this first it is counter app.

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:35.270
Here,

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:37.740
let me clear the control.

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:41.090
Notice that this button is not part of the counter up here.

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:42.940
If I click on this now,

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:47.480
we're sending a change to prop car title that Idol villages received.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.410
We say new plants have been received from parent,

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:56.520
and it goes through that get derailed state from props should a competent update on If the

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:57.670
answer is no,

00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:01.340
then nothing happens in the US But because we have already said,

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:01.850
too,

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:06.880
it's not going to call the rental function again by showing you the modified title.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:11.100
And then the rest of the lifecycle functions are followed.

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.070
So let's go here and click on this.

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:18.840
Wants to see if that is okay and you can see that it is click on the at and it now has

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:19.410
called.

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:24.390
Get the record straight from abroad Should component update called Render called gets

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:28.160
natural before update call component did update gone.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.810
So each time I click on this,

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:32.530
not only the title changes,

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:34.160
but also all these things happen.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.320
Once again,

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.230
if I go and change this function,

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:39.700
should component update toe false?

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.970
You'll see that clicking on this will not have any effect over there.

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:47.040
But when I click on the increment numb because we're calling the force update,

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:49.040
everything will be updated once again.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.260
So just reject that.

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:56.760
Let's go back to the contact tab on change should competent update to false.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.360
Save this.

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.270
Go back to the browser,

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:04.280
show the component ones and not that it is counter act.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:05.930
You're clicking on this.

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:08.410
You will see that it went toe,

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:12.400
get to deter state from props and then should complement update.

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:17.490
But it did not render So we're still seeing the old counter up itself.

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:24.980
But I was calling the increment Numb is now going toe call the force update which gets the

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:26.710
modified Trump's once again.

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:27.890
But importantly,

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:32.880
it's gonna call the render function which renders the modified title here.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:37.930
So I click on this and you should see now it changed this as a less the value off now.

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:40.010
So to summarize,

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:45.290
your life cycle off state full component can be divided into three stages mounting states

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:51.010
updating state and amounting state Mounting stage is the stage where the component is

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:53.520
prepared on the render to the user.

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:59.460
Updating happens whenever new properties received from the parents are the state of a

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:03.580
component changes and hence for a stateless component,

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:07.320
none of these are applicable are for some reason,

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:08.790
If you're using the force of date,

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:15.060
then the lifecycle function that trigger you can also stop the rendering off the component

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:18.260
based on the return value of should component update here.

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:22.340
So in the mounting says there's only one function component will a note.

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:24.660
This is a function that reacted triggers,

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:26.890
and if we have some cleanup activities,

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:28.170
we can do that over there.
