00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.210
Let's have a look at what's called as spread and rest operators,

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.980
so we're going to create a new file E X 07 Dark cheers.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.100
First,

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.940
it create an ari off some numbers.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.400
Left number equals to an area of some numbers to be random on something like this.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.020
Support,

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.530
if you're appear another array with some numbers and numbers from this area as well.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.230
So how do we do that?

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.760
This is where the spread operator comes into picture so I can say,

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.530
Here's left another numbs equals toe.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.700
Let's assume that I have a 102 100 as my initial values,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.260
and I want all the values off the numbs,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.330
and it's so simple.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.470
Now I can just take people,

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.800
start and then type your numbs.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.480
So save this.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.460
And if I take your console dot love numbs and they're concerned that love another numbs,

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:04.450
you should see that this would not consist of 102 100 followed by 10 23 45 or the number

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.160
that are there.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:13.340
So let's go back to the man front and then typing Northey 07 and you'll see that I have the

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.010
exact same thing over here.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.180
now this can be used in many occasions.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.540
Toe.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.510
Make a copy off this particular,

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.010
adding support if I cleared another variable for comes to equals toe thumbs,

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.040
which is this?

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.460
Adding what were created here is two different references to a single object safe.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.250
Take your non studio are pushed triple nine on,

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:42.200
then check out the values off knows on some stupid you will see the boat will have Triple

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.390
nine as their last member,

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.540
so I could go back and try this one small.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.950
You'll see that triple line is this.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.550
So if I wanted a copy off these numbers and not a reference to the same object,

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:55.760
it's very simple.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.610
Surround us with a square records.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.240
So not that square bracket.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.060
Always clear January and then say that Hey,

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.100
give me the values from dumbs instead of that.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.640
So straight record here means it's always than you are just like this being Anouar.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.590
This being in your life,

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.360
you won hero that the new era with the values come from the old numbs itself,

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.320
so they go back and try this.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.880
This time you'll see that numb stew has the people line,

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.450
but not the nuns itself.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.520
The spread operators can also be used along with objects.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.170
For example,

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.220
if I have here,

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.050
let me one equals toe name.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.750
We know email that say,

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.720
you know that you know,

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.350
not cool.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:44.250
And if I wanted another object which is there alone off this object are probably with more

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.020
properties.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:51.740
I can always type your let B two equals toe a new object were probably I have your city

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:58.210
bangle up And then I can also say that I want the value off the one So which means the key

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.350
values off people are going to be placed over here.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:08.600
And then I can add more if I want something like country equals toe India that's printed

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.670
out so long.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.820
P one Consider love P two.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.940
Save this.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.940
Go back to the command front here,

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.020
the stream on around the program once more and you will see that this is P one which

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.380
contains only name and email.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.310
But as the P two campaigns additional values.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.750
But the values off people are also included in that,

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.970
just like the baby did it with a wrist for take your lead.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.730
P three equals toe people PT and people are two references to the theme object.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.150
But if you wanted a different ones,

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:49.580
you can always stay here to pulled out fee one just to make a copy off this so I can say

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.080
console log beat three people equals to be one.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.300
It is a false saved.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.840
This go back The command front run the same and UT notes is false because they are

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.440
different.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.040
But as if I simply said the one they'll contain the same values because they both point to

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.520
the same object.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:15.020
So this time it said true because they're pointing to the same object it that's close this

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:21.970
and clear a new fight on a call it us eg 08 dot Js that create a function called hello,

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:31.790
which takes parameters like name one name to name three and we're gonna just say hello.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.540
Do those three names so I can type your console log.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:36.110
Hello,

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.780
Andi,

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.520
Followed by name One name to name three.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.570
So in order Collins,

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.580
I may have to supply like hello videoed Andi say,

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:54.330
for example Sham and let it John and see if this go back to the command front around the

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.120
theme by typing more year 08 Andi,

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.770
I should see.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:59.250
Hello.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.520
You know,

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.450
sharp Jon,

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.980
etcetera.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.320
So now what if I have only two names,

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.830
so obviously name.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:06.040
See,

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.850
this is undefined on that's undefined over here.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.970
So save this and go back on a run this and considers undefined here.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.810
So obviously this man our work,

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.740
as expected over here,

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:20.840
Soto alive.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:21.270
This what?

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.810
I can do it.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:28.420
I can declare your variable that's supposed to represent and honey off all the values that

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.130
I supply.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:34.220
So just like how we did in the previous case we in and I was used to construct another way

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.260
using the tripled our I can distinctly here tripled our names.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.650
And then I simply say your names inside off the street.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.780
Save this and go back and on the thing.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.860
And you can see this time it is hello with these two welders.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:54.660
So which means whatever the number of values that I supply your will be received as this

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.120
Now this is called as a rest operator.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.440
Now,

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.400
the reason why it's called that the rest operator is because I can declare a variable year

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:08.250
for the name way we know will be posed to this variable card name on Sham.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.590
For example,

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.090
the parish on say,

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.710
Ramesh will now be passed as an r a to this one.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.600
So save this.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.080
I can't just say hello names I can say from name.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:30.640
So I'm gonna say hello All these three people from we know because this one is faster.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:35.870
And with this the rest off them are assumed by this hinted called the rest operator.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.450
So I go back to the man front and on the sea.

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:39.690
It's a hollow sham,

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:45.140
Horatio image from we know you can also declare money people variables before you start

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.180
using the rest operator.
