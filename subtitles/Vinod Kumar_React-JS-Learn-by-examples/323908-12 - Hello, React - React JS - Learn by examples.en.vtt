X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.620
to create a new react chase application.

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:03.220
First,

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:08.240
let me open a terminals and then Gettinto test on.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.460
We'll have a fuller called the edges.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.450
Examples.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:20.770
The command to create a new project is cleared yet followed by the name of the project.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.210
You won't create my case.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.480
I want to give it as reactive chairs.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.990
Demo Dash one.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.050
This will take a couple of minutes.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:41.910
It took nearly three minutes,

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:42.750
in my case,

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.810
so carelessly,

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.580
and if you check now,

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.690
the current directory has another folder called The Edges Demo Dash one,

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.570
and I'll get into the directory by typing CD REAC Chase Demo Dash one.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.530
And they envy and start to start a denser wood,

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.270
which opens.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.860
Local Whose?

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.550
3000 on a browser.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.460
If you're seeing this page on your browser,

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.860
that means your application is working properly.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.960
Let me switch to resorts to your court.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.210
Andi,

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.960
since I already had opened that,

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.600
we had just examples,

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.670
which is on my desktop.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:20.990
In this visual studio core,

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.410
I see my blogs,

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.190
Dima one Also over here.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.290
If you expand this,

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.280
you'll see two important folders.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.890
Public SRC.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.970
The public contains one file here called index start.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.000
Html which contains lots of commenced,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.400
litigated up the commenced,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.650
their self explanatory for your reference.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:46.560
And if you see there's only one single element called Do whose ideas route,

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.240
which is what?

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.140
Actually we are going to be referencing toe some say this file.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.130
So if we actually check the browser,

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.380
this is nothing but the deal that you are seeing or here just to verify.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.850
If I rightly care and then go to inspect,

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:08.650
I should see here that there is a do whose ideas route and inside that there is a dude

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.170
who's class name is apt.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.880
And then there's the other than I am G paragraph and so on.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:21.410
So we want to know how this particular deal class app is injected inside this deal Idea

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.460
wrote to check the same.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.300
Let's go back to the visual studio core.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.610
Get up This indexed,

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:28.410
ravaged Yemen.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.100
A couple of other files like favorite Kandahar I see war and manifest our Jason.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.120
If you come to the SRC folder,

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.210
there are a couple of CS is javascript.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.450
SVG are available.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.150
The only find that is important here is the indexed or chase.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.960
So except that I'm gonna delete all other files by selecting one by one and then right,

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.250
click and say Delete them now.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.630
If you go back to the browser,

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.120
you should see some others.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.350
That's because somewhere it is referencing toe abductees.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.550
If you go toe indexed RJ's,

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.310
you'll see that there is a reference to something called Abdel.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.610
Jace is made here.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.820
Since we don't have this anymore,

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.330
that's where we're getting another for the timing.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.410
I'm gonna get it up all this content,

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.390
effectively deleting everything that the project created for me.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.070
I'm just gonna put some concern law just to check that this is working on a savior.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.250
It's working.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.520
Save it.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.950
And if I come back here,

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.260
there is no error.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.140
But if I goto view developer,

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.230
developer tools and look at the console,

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.710
it says here it's working,

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:46.420
which means the continent off this indexer chase is now included in the index start HTML

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.250
over here.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.840
So if you go to the elements here,

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.360
you'll see that after the dew slash do whose ideas route that a bunch of scripts that are

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.110
injected on one of the strip consist off my file over here.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.600
Of course,

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.730
we don't want this.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.240
We want to see how reactors works for this.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.970
Let me get it off This and dive import,

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:10.880
react.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:11.670
Come on,

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.050
Component from the act.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.010
So there are two imports that I'm doing.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:24.180
This is not inside the bracket because this one is the default export from here.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.860
And this is a named export from the model called React here,

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.340
As we have seen in the previous listen area component is nothing,

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.940
but they're a simple plaster inherit from a class called component.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.440
So that's cleared one class at extends component.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.550
As we discussed in the previous lesson,

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:53.850
every component must have a function called render which returns the actual components body

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.850
.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.860
So this part is going to be a XML.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:04.570
So you can take a do slash do And inside that I can take here something like which one I

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.050
can take Hello world,

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.130
And then I can put a semicolon will say that this is the end of this written statement

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.350
though there is optional.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.790
Save this.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.360
We do have a component here,

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.240
but it is not rendered onto over closer.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.700
We have to tell the objects that there is an element whose idea is the root.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:31.490
Are any other element for that matter and then find that element on rendered this component

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:32.160
over there.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.110
So they're the object called Reacted on,

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.740
which has a function called Render.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.840
We can use the same thing for this I'm gonna be important.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.890
React down from react,

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:44.410
Don,

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:53.400
This is an object which has a function called ender and that takes two parameters.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.040
The 1st 1 happens to be the element that you want toe render,

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.690
which is a custom element,

00:05:58.690 --> 00:05:59.850
were created over here.

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:03.410
This is called like this.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:09.420
The second perimeter is where we want to render the AB and that is documented.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.450
Get element by ivy off route.

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.940
As soon as I saved this and go back to the browser,

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.780
you should see that the hello world is now injected inside.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:29.280
This deal was ID's route so effectively A component is a simple class which has a function

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:34.190
called vendor and the render function is automatically called and the return value,

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:40.040
which is an actual example content will be now rendered on toe the location that we want to

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.260
render Now,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.670
If you're coming from traditional jobless get background,

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.040
you might be wondering,

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.180
what kind of syntax is this technically speaking,

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:52.780
even though I have given the file extension off dot Js this is not a job loss.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:53.460
Could fight.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.000
This is actually a J s ex.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.580
Fine.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.480
So you can name that as JSX if you feel like.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.860
But at this point in time,

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:01.540
we will name it.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.450
Us Index torches itself.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:04.900
However,

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.560
this Intacs is an XML syntax.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:13.560
Since javascript has an example in check that it's called JSX are Java script examines

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.150
Intacs.

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.930
No,

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:19.890
no days that this particular member has never been used anywhere here.

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:21.260
But if I remove this,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.750
it will give an editor.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:29.080
Because if you have any j six like this all like this in your entire file,

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.580
you have to have the react in that particular file.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:33.310
Important.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.090
Of course,

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.560
the competent has been used over here.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.220
React down has been used over here.

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:45.750
The XML part of the J six can also make use off the variables and functions that are

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.540
defined as part of this class.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:48.570
For example,

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:51.520
if I have a variable here for const,

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.510
energy equals toe hello world like this.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:08:01.350
And if I want the article off this to be included over here instead of the actual example

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:07.780
consisting off that I can remove this and then use a single curly bracket and the

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.550
expression which is available here,

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:13.550
which means any variable R function calls.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:14.340
If we have,

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:18.050
we can make use of the same thing inside the XML part of that here,

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.700
save it.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.550
And if I go back to the browser,

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:23.250
I still see the same thing.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:26.590
So just to make sure that whatever that we are getting,

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:27.630
the output is from here.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:30.670
Let's also declare one more variable constant name,

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:32.110
equal stroke we know,

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:37.430
and then I can say hello world from And then I can say your name,

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:38.630
which is this variable.

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:43.240
So now we have multiple expressions used inside the same pitch one here.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.610
So if you go back to the browser,

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:45.550
we can say hello.

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:48.950
World combi note has been displayed over here generally,

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:51.810
what record here is an HTML content,

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:55.270
but we strictly follow the XML rule over here.

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:56.040
For example,

00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:01.800
if you want the horizontal line or who we have to use the HR time in HTML,

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.190
this would have been okay like this,

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:05.900
but you can see we're getting another,

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.820
because in XML,

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.950
you cannot simply have an open time.

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:11.250
It has to be closed.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.550
You can close it in this fashion as well.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:19.910
Let's have some paragraph and I'm gonna die pure over by react Chairs,

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:20.910
save this.

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:24.290
Go back and you'll see that we got this him as well.

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:29.890
Here as in when this particular HTML start growing bigger and bigger and becomes more

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:30.590
complex,

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:34.640
we would like to divide this component into smaller component.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.700
For example,

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.650
I can create a new file called App.

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:43.980
Don't cheese and I can not take your import,

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:49.490
react conformity from the act.

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:53.980
And then I can say you're export default.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.370
Come on,

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:59.850
your extends confident.

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:04.780
So what we're basically doing is we're creating a class here and that is being exported

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:05.500
from here,

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.090
which we can import in this part.

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:09.370
And then you use the same thing.

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:10.600
So first,

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.430
let's complete this app header,

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:17.380
which is gonna have a mental function which returns J six.

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:18.590
So here I am.

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:24.710
You just copied R J six from this section here H one and h r.

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:26.620
I cut this from here,

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.310
and I'm gonna baste it over here now,

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:31.190
since we're looking at an example,

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:35.720
an example must have a single root element where we have two elements here.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:39.640
We have to surround this with some parents tag.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.300
Generally we can work with do here,

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:48.870
but in some cases we will not be able to use our wrap these elements with you because they

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:50.630
might actually affect the presentation.

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:51.520
For example,

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.190
if you're using an HTML table,

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:56.580
this is supposed to be a bunch of td slash CDs.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:02.280
You cannot surround that with the deal because beauties are surrounded by they are engaged

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:02.280
.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:06.090
If you don't want to use any HTML element over here,

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:12.000
we can also import another building component for fragment from the at,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.670
which is actually a dummy element.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:18.050
So I can use that as if it is apparent element like this.

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:20.300
But in the HTML,

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.310
this will not be included at all.

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:26.120
And since these two variables don't exist over here,

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:30.500
it's just type in a message Hello world from,

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:30.920
you know,

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.310
save this.

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:35.170
Now we have a component called capital.

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:38.210
It stayed in a separate file and in index Chase,

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:40.700
I would like to use it to use the same.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:46.130
I first have to import and say import after from dot,

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:53.110
slash appetite and then I don't need these two variables and then I can come here and then

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:57.750
say after the slash Now,

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:59.060
if I go back to the closer,

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:03.500
you can see we got the message from the operator and this is coming from here.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:10.580
It's and similarly I can also have a AP Photo Salmon creating a new file called App Footer

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:10.580
.

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:11.690
Dr.

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:12.310
Zaius,

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:15.210
I think we have a new component,

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:20.530
but for this I would be interested to use a different mechanism instead of creating a class

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:22.040
that extends component,

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:24.820
we want to use a regular function here.

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:30.570
Someone take your export default and then it type your function.

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:34.610
The name of the function is supposed to start with Capital Little.

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:36.890
So I'm gonna use after footer as the name.

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:47.770
And then I say you're done and J six years type dude slash do paragraph as a percent copy

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:57.950
because in 19 on a reserved by caving can save this.

00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:03.690
And the reason we're seeing that better here is because the moment you have a JSX

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:04.680
expression,

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:13.180
you must import react here So they are important react from the act savage there is gone.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:20.730
So if I come back to the indexed RJ's I can now say here in fourth ab footer from dark

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:30.270
slash after and then I can see your after slash notice The difference within the APP header

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:30.270
,

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:33.030
which is a class that inherit from component,

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:37.750
has a function called Render and that Britain's a XML fragment.

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:43.630
But as act Footer is just a function that returns an example fragment here.

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:45.840
So if I go back to the index chairs,

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:46.860
everything is fine,

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.030
there are no errors and come down here.

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.330
You can see that output has come nicely.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:57.770
You can also add some styling to your application and obviously this is a JavaScript XML

00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:58.580
combination.

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:01.160
There is no place for styling over here.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:05.590
You have cleared styles separately in some CSS five.

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:08.900
It's a convention that whenever you have a component,

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:13.270
you clear the CSS in a component specific CSS file.

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:14.210
For example,

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:15.850
for up footer,

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:23.280
I can create a file called app Foot or not CSS like this and then you can define some

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:23.820
process.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:24.390
For example,

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:27.530
I can say ab dash footer with a class.

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:33.720
So I started a dot I can stay here text align to sender bacon say it formed,

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:41.510
started toe say phallic and then probably foreign states toe probably 80% off its original

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:44.160
sense by giving 800.80 m.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.020
Now I have this app footer,

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.300
but that's not being used.

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:49.650
So we don't see that style in effect over here.

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:50.530
So now,

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:52.090
in order to apply this style,

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:56.630
let's go to the APP footer and we're gonna go to this paragraph and then we'll stay here.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:59.610
Class equals toe after footed.

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:00.850
Saved this.

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:02.280
If you go back to the browser,

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.820
you'll see that there is an editor.

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:06.490
It is invalid down property class.

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:07.740
Did you mean class name?

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:12.020
So that's mainly because class is a key word in javascript.

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.110
So you cannot use this class were to say,

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:16.350
class name saved this.

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:16.760
Now,

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:17.490
if you go back,

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:18.970
you will see that there is no better.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:20.850
But still we don't see this effect.

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:24.570
This is because the CSS corresponding to this were not imported.

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:26.660
It's going through that import.

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:31.990
Don't slash food or dot CSS Save this.

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:33.460
And if you go back to the browser,

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:38.950
you should now see that it is a little bit smaller in front size at its centre line under

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:39.250
days,

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:43.280
italicized instead.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.770
Off this over here,

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:45.760
I can have something,

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:51.350
like at content slash content.

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:52.790
Let's do it up.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:53.560
Don't approach.

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.200
So since we don't have this next,

00:15:55.200 --> 00:16:02.150
really important this file a content from and non existing at conference fight,

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:08.060
obviously that's an editor that's going to clear a file called at content dot Js memorable

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:10.070
creator and up content.

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:13.680
Dirty s inside that.

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.850
I'm gonna create a new component.

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:19.490
And this time I want to show you some sharp code snippets.

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:20.450
First,

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:21.010
I will type.

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:27.250
I am our CNN presidenta and you can see that we got import react component from the act.

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:29.640
The 2nd 1 I'm gonna take your A C.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:29.940
C.

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:33.600
S in person and you can see that Autumn articulate God,

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:38.380
Then that class definition for us plus at content extends component.

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:40.280
There's something called state that came up.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:41.520
I don't need that right now.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:44.410
Then there is a render with a return on here.

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:50.180
I can take a deal for example slash Do I'll take your Maybe,

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:50.930
Actually,

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:56.520
this is the content area off our application Now,

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:56.860
of course,

00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:01.170
we have the class and it's being exported over here in index Chase.

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:02.870
We already have imported it,

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:04.290
and we have used over here.

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:06.070
So if I go back to the closer,

00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:09.910
you can see it says this is a content area off our application now.

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:10.460
Likewise.

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:12.480
If you want a styling for this,

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.590
that's first import and non existing files,

00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:17.470
like at Convent.

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:18.820
Darcy assessed.

00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:20.040
We don't have this file.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.260
We need to create one.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:25.440
Copy this and I cleared a new fight called Half contender.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:30.400
CS is Let's type your something called Abd Ash content on.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:38.020
Let's give a mean height off around 400 pixel and we will use the same thing over here by

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:44.350
giving this class name so I can say your last name equals two abd ash content.

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:49.960
See if this go back to the browser and you can see that there is a minimum of 400 pixel

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:50.950
capital in this,

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:54.400
we can also give some styling as far as the in their app,

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.430
it serviced answer.

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:57.190
So we have your index.

00:17:57.190 --> 00:18:00.040
Georgie s indexed or chase has a do.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:03.350
I can define that class name for this card,

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:10.650
for example at and that's import from dog slashed indexed,

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:11.560
or CSS,

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:12.800
which is not there.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.370
I'm gonna create a new file call in extorts DSS.

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:18.450
And then I think you're about app,

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:20.780
Max.

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:25.250
With off maybe around 1100 pixel,

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:32.940
I can also specify margin zero arto to make sure that the internal 1100 pixel is gonna be

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.000
center align.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.050
I saved index stocks here says and the index dot Js And if I come back,

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:43.090
we can see that very their margin on the left side as well as on the right say,
