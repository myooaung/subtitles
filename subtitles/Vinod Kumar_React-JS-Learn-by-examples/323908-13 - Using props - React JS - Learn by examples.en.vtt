X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.570
now that being created at the end.

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:06.470
Js Project created a couple of components using either eggplants are a function.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.450
It's going to understand what's going props.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.760
First,

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.350
let's go to our index torches between under SRC.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.550
This is the one here.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:23.120
You can say that AB is a component which is considered as a bidding toe app header

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.380
apartment footer.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.350
So if I go to the appetite component,

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.120
there is a hitch.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.450
One are some kind of it ideal here.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:39.110
Let's assume that the idol off this header it's supposed to come from this indexed or chase

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.100
so I can supply additional attributes over here.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.930
Just like how an HTML element has attributes so I can pay pure something like title equals

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.850
toe address book.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.110
Uh,

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.030
be 1.0.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.590
I cannot to give some subheading something like subheading equals toe created by,

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.240
you know,

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:12.250
save it in orderto received these two values title and subheading in the avocado allergies

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.250
.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:20.050
We have a building mechanism for C so I can come down here and do a console Log off this.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.390
Save this.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.730
Go back to the browser.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:23.300
Off course.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.730
I have to see the developer console.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.300
I go to the developer tools.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.560
And if you look at the console here,

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.610
it is displaying after do and the AP.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.810
Twitter has something called context props.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.460
Refs stayed,

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.150
etcetera,

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.790
the most important one here you can see at this time it's Trump's,

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.510
which contains title and subheading.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.320
If expanded,

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.890
you'll see that there is a property called subheading,

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:49.480
created by,

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.970
you know,

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.650
title at this book at Washington 10.0.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:59.400
So we've been Did all this this start drops start submitting this start lobster title

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.800
brings those values,

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.690
which means whatever the values that were supplying from here as a tribute,

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.510
the figures are accessible here in the form off this start crops And whatever the name you

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.000
have given,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.590
we also saw that there was an error here,

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.300
invalid down property class.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.970
Did you mean last name?

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.720
And it's also telling me that it's in the index start Js line number 20.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.290
So if I go to the index start chairs somewhere,

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.690
I must have used a class as you can t have used a class here.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.270
This is supposed to be class name.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.250
Save this and the editor is gone.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.400
So now that I'm supplying title and some pretty I can come down here.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.870
This is going to be my idol.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.000
Ondo access the same.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.740
We have a special notation.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.000
The curly bracket.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.700
I can say this start crops dot stated Andi,

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.340
after the rich are probably can have therapy.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:03:03.060
And then again I can say this door cops dog subheading save it And if I go back now,

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.580
you'll see that it is address book at Washington 0.0.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.010
After the horizontal rule,

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.540
it is created by me not.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.180
And of course,

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.050
there is the content coming from AB content component.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.220
This is of course,

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.260
no longer required.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.530
I can get it off this console law.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.320
I can also scrapped the hatch are and the people using the art down arrow save it.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.730
Now we can see that the horizontal rule is after the created by.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.800
So let's go back toe indexed or two years.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.610
And let's say the APP footer has some content that has like the year,

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.050
probably the company name and I also want to give a hyperlink to this company name.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.450
I can also kid three or four variables over here,

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:54.490
but instead I will cleared an object here called const Footer drops equals to an object

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.240
where the keys are like website https.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.360
We know dot co from there.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.650
It's a company.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.100
Is Kevin off in?

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.950
And then I can probably get one more.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:14.740
Which is the year I'll say 2019 in order to have your footer props consisting off all these

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:15.490
values.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.050
And I would like to supply that my APP footer.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:19.930
This can be done in two ways.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:20.610
Number one.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:26.140
I can say website equals two and then use that Calibrate it to say,

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.650
food crops,

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.850
dark website like this.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:30.680
And then again,

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.430
I can't say company equals two footer props,

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.420
start company and,

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.910
of course,

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.230
your equals toe.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.560
Same way for the crops dot Yeah,

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.950
let me get it up the state about as you can see,

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.350
that this is little India,

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.550
but it still works.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.390
But we have one problem because if I go to the app footer dot Js,

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.460
we do not have a class based component.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.550
It is a function based component.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.290
Now the keyword this year does not signify anything.

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.540
If I come down here and say consoler laws,

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.140
they start Trump's.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.420
If I say this and go back to the closer,

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:16.800
you'll see that there is an EDL indicating cannot real property props off undefined Because

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.910
keyword this year is undefined because it is not an object it sister function.

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:27.770
So we will not be able to access this door props like we did in the case off header.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:35.830
But whatever that be supplying over here as website company year etcetera they all are

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.390
combined into an object and that object is passed as an argument with this.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:45.590
Now you can call this argument as anything else if you want for general rule of thumb is

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:51.670
your holidays props And now I can come down and drink here Consoled are log troughs.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.830
Save this and go back to the browser.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.810
It should not see that all the perimeters that the supply are accessible in the form off

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.810
the object called props When the game the name props can be anything different.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.760
But general convention is that you use props.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.790
So now that I have this props here,

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:13.060
I can actually say this is prob start year.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.730
Andi,

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:19.650
this is supposed to be a prop start company and of course,

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.440
the prop stir company is surrounded using a hedge.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.520
Now here is another important thing that you can understand generally retake you're a

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.020
hitter,

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.330
equals toe double for a text and then the base.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.800
This value the head chef here is supposed to contain the props.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.240
Start websites.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.210
If I use a complete record and take profits,

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:40.470
start that site.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.360
You might think that it will work,

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.690
but you can see that it is not going to work.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.500
It has a hyperlink here,

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.560
but if you like,

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.270
we can do an inspect.

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:55.050
You'll see that it actually has a value off props start website,

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.930
which is an incorrect representation.

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:01.650
So it has to be the actual value off the website variable.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:05.460
So this is because whenever you're using an expression,

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.320
it should not be in courts.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.640
Someone remove the course based.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.540
It saved this animal.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:17.680
T know This time it is no longer the actual curly bracket prop start that site,

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:23.110
but instead the value off props dot website has come in the indexed RJ's.

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:27.590
We can simplify this further by using the Year six spread operator.

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:35.340
I can remove this and I can say that triple dot footer props like this and it would still

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.650
work just like that.

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:43.800
So I come back here and even in ab Footer we can use the year six object de structuring toe

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:51.050
extract the unusual properties off this object like year website and company like this by

00:07:51.050 --> 00:08:00.740
using year website and company instead of all the props coming as a single object we know

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:05.420
refuse three unusual variables called year website and company.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:09.720
And this props is no longer required in all these places.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:15.230
So now we have the ear received from the branch that is substituted over here and likewise

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:16.860
website and company also,

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.250
I saved this.

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:21.150
Go back to the browser and works just fine.
