00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.090
in general,

00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.990
we either work with a single object are an aerial object.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.440
In this demonstration,

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.220
I want to show you how to work with that.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:15.080
It's in the objects Applications for this hour recreated one basically actress application

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.080
,

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.470
which displays heading,

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.900
Working with a raise.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.950
She goes to the Visual Studio Court and have a look.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.790
It there is nothing other than Indexed or Jason that sassy and indexes just difference.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.360
One component called app,

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.030
which is being rendered on the deal whose idea is route.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.330
Let's go to the render matter can create a variable called contact,

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:42.570
which is equals to an object on pasting this from my clipboard,

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.650
which would look something with this.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.560
The contact object has an I.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.830
D.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.790
Named gender email,

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.150
phone and picture.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.680
So what if you under this bed is under you?

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.810
I we can directly do the J six part.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:02.650
Over here are we can create a component and then passed this contact object as a prop.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.170
So let's follow the second approach.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.640
I'm gonna be assuming that there is a component car for intact cover,

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.540
which is not there yet,

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.010
and I'm supplying this contact equals to the valuable contact like this.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.340
Of course,

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.470
this is a rather because we don't have this contact car that's also tried toe.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:30.900
Assume that the file exists and we will in portage inboard Conduct card from dark slash

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.220
contact card,

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.980
which is not dead.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:41.890
Let's say this and create a class Korda's contact card under the 37 appear a new flight

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.550
contact car dot Js.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.700
I am modern ender,

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.950
and this time it only imports react because we're gonna work with stateless component

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.950
That's create const for Detective Carter.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.040
He quotes toe in curly bracket.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.450
I'm gonna say contact so we're using an object restructuring method.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:12.250
And then this is the return value off the components render function That's just added,

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.450
Do here for no on,

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.740
then Probably type in here something like on that start mean So I'm gonna just make sure

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.520
that this is gonna be friending the name of the contact person that's just export here.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.050
So they export diferent,

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.470
then save contact card saved this.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.320
Now we have our stateless component ready which displace the name of the person.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.370
Let's go to the index years.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.920
Everything looks fine to go to the closer.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.150
You can see that the name of the person is to spread here.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.520
Let's go back to the contact color dodges and employs this.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.150
Now we're gonna use some CSS from Bootstrap.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.140
1st 1 is I'm gonna make this as a class name.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.210
Off card and then I give and I m g SRC equals toe contract.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.210
Dark pictures Class equals two can say here,

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.660
car by energy.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.900
Didn't we have here another live Whose class name he's supposed to be Card body.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.400
They didn't have fighting.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.350
Last name equals two called Title.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.180
This is a district.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.950
The name of the contact person.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.390
It is contact dark name.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.510
Then we'll say do on paragraph.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.050
Last name equals too far Text.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:42.230
Let's add that he made and phone number when a copy.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.040
This that basted changes to form.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.400
Here we are getting a warning message because according to react,

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.020
Jace,

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.600
I m g elements must have an island.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.200
A prop.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.730
So we're gonna just add another point equals to once again on display the name of the

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.050
person as the ultimate text.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.980
Another mistake I've done here is it's not class.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.490
It's supposed to be classed me.

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:06.490
Let's fix that.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:07.560
Save it.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.560
And if I go back to the browser.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.930
You'll see that we put the picture on the name,

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.820
though this is a little bigger.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:23.940
So we can make this small by adding additional styling property for this now to give the

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:24.970
style property,

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.250
we will just use a style attribute.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.760
But this is gonna be an expression.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.190
So we use a curly black it.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:38.930
And the expression is nothing but an object with key value pairs representing the CSS

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:39.640
properties.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.120
Now,

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.540
since it is an object,

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.510
I have to use a curly bracket again.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.140
So it looks like it is a double curly bracket,

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.050
but it is not.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.540
The older curly bracket is just like the one that we have used over here.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.840
But the American live bracket is representing an object which is the CSS properties.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.760
Now I want to specify the with the property,

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.570
maybe 100 pixels.

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.260
And then I can say your height property,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.150
which is also going to be 100 picks up,

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.320
save this.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.030
And if you go back to the browser,

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.120
you can see No,

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.500
it looks something like this.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.790
Now,

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.650
if you want these two toe,

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.090
come one next to each other,

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.970
then you may have to do a little bit different here.

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:29.080
So the way I should be doing is I will introduce a what's called a roll summary with a deal

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.120
class name off the road,

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.050
which has two columns in it.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.780
Do class name equals to call,

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.670
but on a medium device,

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.190
it's gonna occupy four graves.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.790
This is according to the bootstrap CSS stream.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:45.080
Look,

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.280
I'll make another copy and make this as eight.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:48.790
Now,

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:54.290
just to mention that some off this numbers should become 12 for a given room.

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:58.240
If it is less than 12 there is not going to be a problem.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.150
But if it's more than 12 than the alignment will not be proper.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:08.890
So the first column is gonna contain an image some low cut this from here and then based

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:09.650
over here,

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.050
The 2nd 1 is gonna continue this entire body.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.200
So I cut.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.820
That is over here.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.320
You can rest all shift F on windows.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.460
Option shift F on Mac for formatting vacancy.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.980
Now the contact car looks nice.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.300
I say this Go back to the closer an urgency.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.580
It shows something like this.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:31.500
If you want.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:37.420
You can also put the restriction on the worked off this particular contact are so I can do

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:38.750
that right here.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.160
Let her staying here.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.610
So styling calls to first I want to give a rip off.

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.710
Maybe around 400 pixels.

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:52.130
I'll also give a fighting off in pixel Onda.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.970
Margin also off.

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:54.580
10 fixes.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.040
Save this.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.650
And if I go back and see it looks nice.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:06.550
Let's go to index Start Js And instead of displaying a single contact what if I have an

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.030
area off such contact objects to the monster?

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:17.260
The same that's going to get a day off contact objects that could available car contacts,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.480
which is going to be an array off contacts.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.160
I'm gonna based four different contact objects.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.230
So with Eylea name,

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:26.180
gender email,

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.970
Phone picture for each one off them.

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:32.110
So let me minimize this by collapsing this over here.

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.430
Now we have one contact object over here.

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:35.720
Now,

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:42.760
if I want the 2nd 1 I can make a copy off this and I can say contacts off zero that will

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.730
give you the first contract from this Ari Onda song.

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.750
I can make this as contracts off two and so on.

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:54.120
And you should see now that we have to rt different objects.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.040
But of course,

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.700
if our thousands off them,

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.490
then I will not be able to do this way.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:05.380
This is where we have to transform and a day off JavaScript object into an array off

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.660
contact cards.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:07.460
Luckily,

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.940
we have a function or map in jobless.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:10.860
Good for the scene.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.120
It's going out of the baby with you.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.940
In effect,

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.670
cards equals two contacts,

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:19.440
which is a JavaScript ari,

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.600
which has a function called map.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:25.480
The map function takes a callback function as an argument,

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.740
which receives a single contact object from this ari,

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.480
and in turn,

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.680
it has to return a modified variant off the same.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:34.560
For example,

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.980
let's write a arrow function here,

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:42.880
which receives contact object on being stood off contact object under turning See Dark name

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:42.880
,

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.730
which is a name off the person.

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:46.550
This is a barometer of the callback,

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:49.550
and this is the return value from the callback.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:50.830
And now,

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:51.540
if I just do it,

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:57.510
comes a lot off contact colors and then go back to the browser.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:01.970
And if you go to the devil apart tools by pressing after on groom,

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:06.710
you will see that it's an a day off four different names here.

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:07.750
So instead,

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:09.640
if you say seed or email,

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.250
save this and go back.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:14.190
You should see an array off four emails here.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:20.960
So what we want to do is we take a contact object and then Britain a contact car,

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:27.990
and it's so simple that we disturb it was a contact of car contact equals toe incoming

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:28.530
rockets.

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:31.150
See which is the actual contact object.

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:37.580
So we are just like hope you're supplying a contact object as a rob over here the same way

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:38.400
we're supplying.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.680
See as a prop here.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:46.510
Now the return value off this map function would be an array comprising off four different

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:47.660
contact cards.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:49.580
And that's what is their over here.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.760
If you print this on the console,

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.580
it may look a little different,

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.460
so there's still a four object.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.060
If I expand delicacy,

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:01.830
it's basically the actress object that represents the U.

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:01.960
N.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.820
Element that has something like,

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:07.320
What is the name of the class and so on Now off course,

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:11.310
we don't want to really print on the console so I can get off this from here.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:18.990
But instead I can just use this calibrated expression toe open the contact parts like this

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:18.990
.

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:20.150
Save this.

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:21.910
Come back to the browser.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:24.680
Now I should see five different context.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:30.480
This is the one that is despaired because off this and here we have an array off contact

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:35.530
parts which is displaying these four subsequent US components.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:41.380
You may also notice that there is an editor here that says each child in a list should have

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:42.970
a unique key prop.

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:48.970
And that's because whenever we are having an array off JSX elements like this,

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:52.340
each of those elements which is this contact car,

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:55.390
must define a property called key,

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:57.350
which is supposed to be a unique value.

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:02.290
How do I get the unique value now see is a contact object.

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:08.120
I can borrow its I d and then make that itself as a key so I can take your key equals toe.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.070
See that?

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:10.820
I ve I say this.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.030
Go back to the browser.

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:14.380
You see that the other is gone now
