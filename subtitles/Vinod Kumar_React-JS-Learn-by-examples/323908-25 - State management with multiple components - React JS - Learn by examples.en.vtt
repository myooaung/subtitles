00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.970
have a look at this application.

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:06.700
This has a our new contact form on a contact list.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.170
The contact list is made up off contact cards.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.330
We have a billet option.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.970
Hear clicking on this should delete the record,

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:14.610
but at this point in time,

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.650
the functional is not implemented yet.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.130
Also,

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.690
if you click on this active list,

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.270
it does the basic allegations.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.310
But it does not Acto over list of contacts.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.020
Let's take a look at the same in the visual studio call.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.200
So there is an indexed RJ's in our SRC,

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.150
which defines a component called up.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.150
It renders two components contact form and contact list.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.580
The conduct form is the same one that we abused in our state full component demonstration.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.510
It has a state with these four variables.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.250
There's a form errors,

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.430
and they're the experts handler,

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.580
which actually does the validation and also does the dynamic.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:58.720
Waving off the form element with the leader and the submit handler is currently just doing

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.390
the validation and not adding it to our list.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.250
That is what we want to do over here,

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.680
and this is the strange team will form with button at the end and other messages in get off

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.940
valuation enters the contact list is a state full component.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:14.550
Currently,

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.370
it maintains an array of four contact objects over here.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.850
It collapsed.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.950
This you'll see that the render function is very simple.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.800
It is just mapping each off those contact objects in the context into a contact called

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.650
supplying the Contact Object.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.900
And then we're actually displaying a header on the list of contacts on the U.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.190
N.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.660
The contact card is a role with three columns.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.240
The first column is going to display the image of the person.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.730
The second column is going to display the name female full,

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.390
and the last column is having a bottle,

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.250
which displays an X month.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.910
So we see that here.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.290
So this is the first column.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.970
The images.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.830
The second column is about name,

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.060
email and phone number.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.730
That third column here is the button that looks like a link here with X.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:07.530
As the caption.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.330
The hierarchy of the components can be explained using a dagger.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.450
So we have this at Component,

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.940
which leads to child confidence,

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.850
contact form and contact list,

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.300
and the contact list has the contact car.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.300
The Audi off contact is present in the contact list component,

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.950
and each of the contact object is passed on to the conduct car,

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.770
so the delete option is provided in the contract card.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.310
But calling the billet contact should actually delete the contact from the context Array

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.880
doesn't in the contact list.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:40.870
Similarly,

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.550
the contact form should probably a contact function.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.790
On the other contact function should add a new contact to the contacts are a present in the

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:50.650
contact list.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:57.910
The question is how to do this because the contact form has access toe only its data and

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.050
not anything else.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.930
Likewise,

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.240
the contract car can only perform operations on the state maintained by the contact card

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.320
and not on the state made it by another component.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.750
We can also think of having contacts object past as a prop to the contact car.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.680
But then props are read only,

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.820
and they don't affect the parent component state.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.170
To solve this problem,

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.820
we have to move the contacts.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:24.290
Harry,

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.070
as well as the functionality for adding a contract are debating the contact to the common

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.800
component.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.800
Are the top of the hierarchy.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.850
Something like this,

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.750
and each of these functions are tightly born with the AB component.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.210
So even if they're called from contact form or contract car,

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.910
they will still be called from the context off app component.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.380
And in order for the contact form and contact called toe work with these functions were to

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.020
pass the functions are contact on delete contact as props to the subsequent child

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.750
components.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.860
To understand the same,

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.260
let's go and make this Jane disc in our application.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.630
So the first thing we want to do is tow remove the state from contact list and shifted toe

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.000
are indexed arches where the company in APP is declared.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.150
So I'm gonna cut this part.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.570
Notice that there are four contacts here which collapsed.

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:23.410
So could this and then go to the index torches make it part off AB as the state.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:24.750
So once again,

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.660
I have stayed with contact studying.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:33.140
I'm gonna collapse the scene and I can pass this toe the contact list as a prob.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.290
I can type your contacts because toe in college,

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.850
like it distorts state out contacts.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:45.360
So we're supplying in Addy in the name of contacts now in the contact list,

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.390
it is going to be received as props.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:53.190
Now we can veer contact card from each contact present in this start.

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.600
Rob,

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.650
start contacts.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.790
I saved this on.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.030
I want to say that Index,

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.020
start Js and go back to the brother to see if it is displaying or not.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.850
And you can see it is still displaying the later because the data is now coming from the

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.210
crops and the same thing is present with the card one by one.

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.800
Now let's go to the index dot Js and read a couple of functions.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.970
The number one function that I want to write here is I have a convict which this is a

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:27.360
contract object and it's supposed to add it to our ari off context which is there here.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.960
Notice that I did not use an arrow function here,

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.690
which means if this function is called from contact,

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.180
form the context off the other contact will switch toe contact,

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.420
form toe,

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:45.180
aware that you can always say I'm contact equals toe contact is the perimeter and then they

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.150
can add a function.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.470
Ultimately,

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.640
we can also bind our contact toe the keyword This in the constructor.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.710
I would like to follow this average similarly,

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.640
I can no stay here delete contact,

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.780
which is an adult function again,

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.350
which takes an idea of the person to relate it.

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.430
Onda.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.750
Then it's supposed to believe the contact from this particular array searching for the i d

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:08.750
.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.010
In both cases,

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:18.300
I'm gonna make a console log saying I think a contact and probably another one called

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.310
deleting a contact by idee on.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.490
Then I will play the I d.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:31.270
Now the other contact is required by contact form So I can supply that as a problem over

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.750
here.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:39.440
And I can do that by supplying like add contact equals toe incoming record this start our

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.050
contact.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.250
Similarly,

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.350
contact list does not record this village contact,

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:50.330
but the only way we can reach to the contract card is by supplying delete contact through

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:51.380
the contact list.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:59.390
Several also after over here believe contact equals two this dot delete contact and in the

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:04.000
contact list will come here and then we were supplying the contact object.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.060
We will also supply another property here called village Contact equals toe.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.990
This start brought Start delete contact.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:20.890
Save this and in the contact car were receiving only contact object at this point in time

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.590
selects also received the build contact,

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:27.800
which is a function I know here is the daily Britain.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:33.180
We can add the handlers on click he calls to encourage bracket.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.200
Let's add an anonymous function Onda.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.230
We want to call their belief contact for the I.

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:39.690
D.

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:41.830
That is available in this contact objects,

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.110
I say contractor,

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.150
I d save this.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:47.080
And if you go back to the browser,

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.680
go to the developer consoled by person,

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:50.300
after all,

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.870
select a particular contact and effect upon this village.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.770
We get this deleting a contact by anyone.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:02.050
And if I select the 3rd 1 it says you're deleting a contract by the three.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:03.260
Similarly,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:08.180
it's also associate our contact function toe this particular Burton.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.050
Let's goto our index charges.

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:14.850
So we're supplying the other contractors That problem.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:18.800
So let's go to the contact form where we have the submit handler,

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:23.780
submit Hander after doing the validation is currently displaying an alert message will get

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:29.270
it off this on just to verify if the function can be called from here will simply say they

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:30.710
start prob start.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:31.580
I've gone.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:34.260
I'm not passing any value at this temple.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:34.590
Ideally,

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:41.010
should pass the contact object here that saved this go back to the browser on check if

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:41.610
they're watch.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:44.040
Clicking on this does the valuation.

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.890
But if I take something like name,

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:46.890
we don't email,

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:50.560
you know that you know are full for number.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.620
And of course,

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.590
I don't need to simply the picture it knows of it.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.090
Click on this active list.

00:08:56.090 --> 00:09:02.060
We should not see that adding a contact now that's fastest values from the contact forms

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:10.240
state toe dysfunction that supply that in the form off a variable called contact on the

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.470
contact of the new.

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:11.890
Really well,

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:14.620
that's supposed reputed like this,

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.720
which contains need email,

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:22.420
phone on and pictures on these are supposed to be extracted from the state.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:33.640
That's a name email for On a Picture equals toe this start state also after adding it.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:38.810
I don't need this state to have the values so I can reset that back to this particular

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:39.590
object.

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:41.660
And I copied this comeback toe.

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:45.400
The seven handle and I'll figure this start,

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.200
said ST on.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:53.580
I passed it in their object as perimeter resetting each and every member of the state.

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:54.930
Let's go to the indexed R.

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:58.390
J s and we print what is received as the object,

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:12.140
So that's just a pure contact on Go back to the Broza I had similar DJs don't need to add

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:13.360
the picture at this time.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.060
When I click on active list,

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:21.160
you can see that I'm in contact and we still the name email phone as the last picture being

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.350
an empty string here.

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:24.350
But we received all those values.

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:29.930
Now all I have to do is tow ensure that these values are added on.

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:30.230
Also,

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:31.160
when I click on this,

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:35.180
I'm getting the actual idee formulation using this I d.

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.870
I should be able tow believe that object also.

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:39.440
So let's do the same thing.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.650
Go to the index charges.

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:43.330
First,

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:44.700
let's do the delete option.

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:50.250
We received the I d and we want to search for the only in the this start state our contacts

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:52.160
and then delete that.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:52.740
First,

00:10:52.740 --> 00:11:01.260
let us extract the contact from the state by taking left contacts equals toe start skate.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:05.850
So we're blocking out this property from the state and making it a local valuable.

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:08.640
And then you're gonna find that in days by typing,

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:17.940
let index equals two contacts dot finding index and the Finding decks takes a callback.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.670
The callback loses one conduct off at a time.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:23.080
But we have to return True or false.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.850
Based on cedar,

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:26.870
Heidi equals toe I d.

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:30.320
So whenever this condition matches the index off,

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.680
this object is returned.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.920
And if that is not satisfied for all the elements here than a minus one will be written.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:41.850
So it's also check if index not equals toe minus one.

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:46.910
Then everyone toe delete that element in this particular index from this.

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:47.390
Sorry,

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:49.280
they will say contacts.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.830
Dark supplies index,

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:52.400
come off.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.150
One elements of the splits takes two parameters.

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.490
The index Very wonderful.

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:00.380
Start deleting and how many limits you want to delete.

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.850
And we want to leave one single element here.

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:04.440
But this is a local copy.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:09.860
We have to update the state and the way you up did the status by typing this start Sex

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.800
state on then supply contracts,

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.390
which is gonna be a name value being.

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:14.710
Now,

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.000
let's say this.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.350
Go back to the browser,

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:18.260
Onda.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:19.290
Let's strike.

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:21.450
Deleting a record on you can see.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:21.950
No,

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:24.330
the selected record is getting deleted.

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:24.910
Of course,

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:26.550
the data is coming from an area.

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:27.280
See if I refresh,

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.660
I'll get all the data back,

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.750
but the leading a particular element is working.

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:32.450
Now.

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:35.870
All we have to do is to see if we can add this to this.

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:36.410
Harry.

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:36.840
Now,

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:37.930
that's very simple.

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:42.820
I have toe take this contact object and push that into my Harry.

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:48.440
So I'll just once again extract the contacts from the state as a local variable.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.260
And then there's a conflict.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.160
Start push if you want.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:53.540
Oh,

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:55.320
I lived in the beginning instead of push,

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:55.820
which adds,

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:56.420
at the end,

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:59.410
you can use something called unsheathed on.

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:01.240
Did you say your contact?

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:07.110
And then we have to update the state and we can copy this line and paste over here.

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:08.310
Save this.

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:09.860
Go back to the browser.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.840
We have four elements right now.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.920
I want our one here.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:21.550
We know we know I've been ordered Co some phone number on a picture.

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:25.000
So I'm going toe activist.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.310
When I active list,

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:29.760
you'll see now that contact is added as a new one.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:35.610
So this is how you do the state management when an application has many components and each

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:37.820
component have toe work with each other.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:38.930
So just to summarize,

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:44.910
if you have a look at this picture we haven't a component that made is the state as well as

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:45.390
functional.

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:47.120
It is for that on the trail.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:52.390
Components received one or more off these as prompts and over a 1,000,000,000 time.

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:54.290
If the application is too complex,

00:13:54.290 --> 00:14:00.840
it becomes very difficult to manage which component request what kind of property and also

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:05.570
note is that we need to know the hierarchy are part to a particular component because the

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:08.450
village contact WAAS not needed by this contact list.

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:12.410
But we still had to pass this because it was required by contract car.

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:13.640
So all these little,

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:18.770
very big complexity and to solve this that are a couple of approaches that are followed and

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:21.250
the most popular one is the readers.
