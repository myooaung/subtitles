00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080
Whenever you have an HTML form,

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.080
it's important for us to validate the input fields.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.100
For example,

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.220
the fields name,

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.650
email,

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:08.540
phone number,

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.350
maybe mandatory field.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.090
The name must be minimum T letters.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:14.630
Maximum 20 letters.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:15.090
Email.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.050
It just must follow a particular pattern like moderate and art must be there for number

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.450
must be ended 12 digits only.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.580
In this demonstration we will have a look at how we can do these kind of allegations in a

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.230
react application for this demonstration I wanted,

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.340
he created a react project,

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.160
which displays a header,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.630
and an HTML form current state maintained by the component is displayed over here because I

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:41.970
have something over here,

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.770
you can see the real instantly reflector over here as a less anything on the email.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.190
It's all getting updated directly.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.570
Let's have a look at the cold in the SRC.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.310
I have indexed urges,

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.050
which defines a component called up.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.420
It just renders it do with each one formulation,

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.990
the mood of state heading the user.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.550
And then there is a contact form which displays the rest of the content.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.490
If you go to the contact form,

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.990
it maintains estate with name email,

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.800
phone picture as properties.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.870
There is a Kiev handler,

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.150
which is assigned with each other Experts is where we get the event object.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.800
We're updating the state whose name Mattis the experts name with the value off the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.550
textbooks.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.310
Our dual inventor scream in tow two columns here.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.130
So there's a role on the column.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.080
And if you see that there were two columns over here,

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.040
the first column defines the entire form.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.090
The 2nd 1 displays the current state,

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.080
which is Jason dot string.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.610
Defy this dark state and three spaces have been used for indentation.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:50.470
As you can see,

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.550
it is nicely displayed over here,

00:01:52.550 --> 00:02:00.080
and the STM inform itself consists off a label and it extracts and for the exports were

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.750
getting the value from the state.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.070
And we also have the on change event handler to which we have ascend the start here.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.440
Handler function now attacks and validations for some off.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.050
These feels like merely model sidebar.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.190
Now,

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.150
this is where we are receiving the actual experts values as and when we type and we have to

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.820
do the validation as and when the user make some changes and they represent any validation

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:25.380
errors,

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.090
let us are few members to the state.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.960
So I'm gonna go at another property car off errors,

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.910
which is an object that this is basically going to represent the error messages related to

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.380
a particular state.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.500
I'll say your name,

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.660
since the value for name is currently empty so we can see here that name is required.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.520
Life was a lot to say.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:56.820
Email is required and then form is also required.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:05.050
Field let's come down to the DF handler were receiving that even topped it.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:12.030
Let's extract the name and value using the object restructuring method and they let name

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.560
come off.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.650
Value equals toe irritate our target.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:22.400
We can use this name when you over here so evaded Our target is no off the record And now

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.150
here is maybe want to check If the name of the X box is name,

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.340
then we have some validation related to the name.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.650
If the name of the textbooks is email,

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:41.050
then we have to do The validation related to email will also extract the form errors from

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:53.870
the current state and then they switch the field name Wait may do something Similarly,

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.080
if it is female,

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:03.480
do something case for do some basic well orations related to the phone and which case must

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.650
have a default.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:05.160
Otherwise,

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.940
you'll get that warning message and we are doing anything or they will just at this break

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:10.630
statement.

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.450
So based on the validation off a field and its value,

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.890
we will update the corresponding form errors intact the switch case,

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:19.690
for example,

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.550
if name is missing,

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.300
I can check here,

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.670
if not value,

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.890
which means if the value is an empty string or not,

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:34.340
are undefined are if value dot lend happens to be zero,

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.780
then we're gonna update the editor for seeing that name is required.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.690
So it's a form others dark name,

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.170
which is this property we're tryingto design here.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.090
Name is required.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:05:01.560
But if the value entered by the user for the name text box is less than fi characters or I

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.430
can say value Shortland is greater than 20 characters.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.940
The negative form errors thought need equals two.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.640
I can say name must be between Streeto.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.150
20 letters.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.150
If there is no problem,

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.050
then I can say form terror start name equals to an industry.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.420
Now the same thing that I can do for email also similar.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.450
Copy this if block over from here?

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:33.560
Yes,

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.110
your and then we have a check.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:44.220
If it is an email extra box and the value for the email is missing 10 and say here that

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.940
form errors start female will say email is required or email address.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.530
One of the messages want you and for email.

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:52.890
We're not gonna do this.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.260
Lent validation.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.570
So we're going to say if the value off the email is not matching a particular regular

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:00.300
expression,

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.450
then we'll give a better message.

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.980
So this based a basic email validation over here using regular expression,

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:15.300
which actually compares the value with a specific pattern like there has to be some text

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.920
before the ad rates symbol.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:23.450
There has to be some text before the dot and the dark must be followed by minimum two

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.870
characters on that signal kiss and I can take here now.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.430
Not a value email.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.730
Of course,

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:34.150
this is supposed to be email,

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:35.230
and also,

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.400
if there are no validation errors,

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.120
we're resetting the email errors toe an empty string.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.750
The same thing I can also copy and paste toe the next switch keys.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:47.280
Well,

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.470
we see that if the value for the phone text box is missing.

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.050
Then I say here,

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.890
this is of course,

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:56.310
for that's it.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:57.410
For this request,

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:02.920
our phone number is required and four number must be 10 to 12 digits.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:07.570
So all I have to do is remove this particular validation from here.

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:13.840
And I'll say it has to be a digit or end toe 12 is the limit now,

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:14.700
character ***,

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.280
that it has to begin with the number and it has to end with this pattern.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.700
And there is no slash I required because these are numbers and here to give us slash.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:28.280
So if they say that the value is not matching this expression,

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:33.390
then with a formula start for we say not a valued for numbers.

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:36.830
And if there are no valuation parents for mirrors,

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:39.740
Dart four is an empty string.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:46.130
Now we also have to do one last thing we're currently updating or mutating the state only

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.190
with their exports,

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.350
name and value.

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.470
We also have changed the form errors.

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.280
But that is not gonna be reflected until you say so.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:54.820
So,

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.660
along with this key value pair,

00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:01.050
we also want the form errors to be updated into the state.

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:04.000
So I for my this and save it.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.770
Go back to the browser Now you can see that the initial state also includes the form errors

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:10.770
.

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:12.800
It's his name is required.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:18.940
If I take your one letter now we can see name must be 3 to 20 letters I take I.

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:24.490
And because I entered the letters the name validation is satisfied on 1,000,000,000

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:25.090
validation.

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:33.150
Error is empty stream Whatever type your something like a lengthy need you can t notice

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:36.300
Name must be between 2 to 20 letters.

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:42.800
So I'm just leave the less we know email is required because not entered anything.

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.690
I take your b I involved,

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:45.950
you know,

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:49.420
it's just not a valid email was lent to satisfy,

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.610
But it's not about a demon.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:56.970
I think you're you know dot c who and now you see the other is gone.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:01.390
But if I start getting you can see that it is not a valid email.

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:04.130
But if I completely lyricist,

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:05.850
it says email is required.

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:10.700
And now I have the phone number.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:11.140
Of course,

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.900
if I take anything over here,

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.960
it's always is not a valid full.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.150
But if I started taping a phone number,

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:19.550
it is not a value for.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:23.750
But once they have all the numbers,

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.130
you can see that the message is gone off course.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:27.850
It'll also a low country core,

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:28.400
for example,

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.580
and find one.

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:30.700
It is okay,

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.780
but if I take one more additional character or number,

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:37.070
you'll see that it is not a valid form because we said 10 to 12.

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:41.650
So now we're able to go do the valuation and capture the editors.

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:45.040
He just But when we click on the same data,

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.440
if it is invalid,

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.090
we should display a list off other procedures.

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:51.780
Whatever the error messages that are accumulated over here,

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:54.290
we're gonna displayed it in this part.

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:55.060
To do that,

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.750
we have toe write a function 200 this submit event.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:01.090
Let's go back dollar application.

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:08.470
That's really function here called Submit Handler equals toe.

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:11.090
Get the event object on.

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:15.040
This is the body of the function and here is where we want Oh,

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.580
check if everything is valid And if the answer is yes,

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:24.230
we would like to probably pursued with adding this contact with our database are so if

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:25.660
there are any validation,

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:26.650
errors exist,

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:32.350
I should cancel the submission and then we should also display error messages and from the

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:33.670
previous examples,

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:37.940
I had this on Submit people's toe distort at new contact.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.910
We don't have this new contacts anymore,

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:42.400
So I'm gonna right here submit.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:48.720
And because there is ending this function to the on submit whenever the form is submitted,

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.080
it is going toe.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.860
Refresh the form because it'll trade this up into the form action.

00:10:53.860 --> 00:11:01.050
And so cancel the before behavior will take your give it ee dot revenge default.

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:05.050
Now we have to check if there are any validation errors.

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:08.950
Let's have a helper function here called validate form,

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:15.390
which takes the form errors as parameters and supposed to return.

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:19.910
True art falls based on the abundant off form errors.

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:23.950
So I appear a variable left valid people's to prove.

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:29.970
And then I'm gonna go through each of the values off this form Errors object.

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:30.650
Remember,

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:34.400
the form errors is an object consisting off name,

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:34.860
email,

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:35.790
phone property.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:36.770
That's not inari,

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:40.050
but I can get the day off all these values,

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:47.930
which is either another message or an empty string using object or values off form letters

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:48.750
with Britain's.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:53.160
Another three strings and then we're gonna say for each because it's an other.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.200
We have a forage function which takes a callback.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:00.050
The callback receives the IRA's value and index.

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:05.880
We're only interested in the actual other message on if the other messages empty,

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.170
that means it is valid.

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:15.250
So we would like to say valid equals toe the current value off Valley as well as editor

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:18.720
length to follow equals 20 to the way you can read.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.630
This is initial value off.

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:21.720
This value is true.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.210
So we're gonna say true.

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:27.250
And is it a valued for the first message?

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:27.800
For example,

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.660
if name is a valid field,

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:30.730
then name,

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.680
error message daughter length is zero.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:33.310
So it is,

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:33.510
Well,

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:36.000
it's true and true becomes true.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.860
And when the operation goes further,

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:40.490
it's going to take the second error message that it's for the email.

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:43.010
Now we're have their true initially here,

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:44.160
and then it's gonna check.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.720
Is the even feel valued.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.430
If the answer is no,

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:50.060
then true and false becomes false.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:53.740
So this becomes falls and then the for the 3rd 1 phone.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.970
It is anyway going to be falls on,

00:12:55.970 --> 00:13:00.030
and it doesn't matter because it's gonna be like a short circuit now,

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:02.700
now that we have the value for value that's true.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:03.460
Or phones.

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:04.900
Let's return the same.

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:11.160
And now we can come to the Summit hander and make you that this validate form function

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.160
something like this.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.830
They say if they start rounded,

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:19.150
form off this starts ST dot form errors.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:23.150
Then we're gonna say alert.

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:24.960
Everything is okay.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.190
So all is well,

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.360
Andi,

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:34.220
if there is not okay and probably want to display that lets stuff at us that took place and

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:36.180
the way we can do is we can display alert.

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:36.620
Of course,

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:42.510
part only wanted to display right below this button may be in the form of a u l l a

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:43.200
combination.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:43.990
To do that,

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:48.020
we may have to store the actual letter messages in the U.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:48.280
L.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.820
A former in the state,

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:56.250
because from here you cannot render anything to the um the rendering can be done only using

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:57.480
the render function.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.740
So in that case,

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:03.160
what we do is we cleared another member variable in the state that's colored,

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.250
asked messages,

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:07.150
and initially,

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:07.880
let's make it doesn't.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.250
I'll save this.

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:12.780
Come back to our validation court here,

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:13.850
and then again,

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:18.770
we'll check that for every error message in this form others.

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:21.690
We would like to convert them into a l A.

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:22.520
So,

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:23.290
for example,

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:25.650
if there is a better message over here,

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:27.040
this is a string right now,

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.410
but it's gonna be converted here.

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:28.990
Your life.

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:31.390
This is also going to be converting to a light,

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:33.470
and this is also going to be converted their life.

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:34.380
What do you get it?

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:37.950
This is an interesting I don't want them empty ls slash light.

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:39.300
So let's do that here.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:46.310
So we come down and since the start ST dot form else's requiring multiple places that first

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:52.470
extracted it's a let form errors equals toe start stage,

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:56.020
meaning we're working out the form letter from this date,

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:59.350
and now I can rescue it here like this.

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:01.310
And I say You're object,

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:04.110
er loose off for mirrors.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:08.000
So we're once again getting the area off three strings because of dysfunction.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.950
And then I say you have brought from AP,

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:12.550
which takes a callback.

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:13.580
The callback.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:20.970
He receives an error message as a less the index and we know are supposed to return an ally

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:27.360
slash ally based on the fact if this is an interesting or not so it's a if you're off Lent

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.620
is because toe zero,

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:31.240
then it is a no.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.980
So we don't have anything or other ways we can return an l.

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:44.260
I slash life consisting off the error message as well as the key is that in days and this

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.380
is gonna be my other messages,

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:47.160
let's call it us.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:53.890
Let ever messages equals on this is supposed to be updated to the state.

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:56.080
So as soon as you update the state,

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.100
the Rendon will be called again.

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.570
And then we will display those other messages.

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:02.080
So things start,

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:02.800
said State,

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:08.270
and then I just use a career bracket and say error messages is the property value that we

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:09.600
want to update.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.240
One last thing that we have to do is tow.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.370
Come down right below the button,

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:15.810
are below the form.

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:16.260
And,

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:16.550
Emily,

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:20.900
are you yell whose value is coming from this start?

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:23.150
State our error messages.

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:25.750
Save this.

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:29.720
Come back to the browser and check if renovation works.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.490
I'm gonna just click on the same later.

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:33.500
It displaced all these other messages.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:37.260
But I take your something like V I and then we know.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.090
And then I take here some a SDF.

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:41.630
If you see save later.

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:43.340
The other messages have been changed,

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:43.880
you know.

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:45.650
But I take be note,

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:47.060
Do you consider it up?

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:51.010
And that message is related with the name is gone and then I don't hear You know,

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:58.050
I've been ordered cool on a phone number and taken save later Because alert is immortal.

00:16:58.050 --> 00:16:58.890
It comes first,

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:00.480
and then that s it is also gone.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:01.920
As you have seen,

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.110
reactions itself doesn't have any ability,

00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:06.210
mechanism for form validation.

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:11.650
We will be making use of the state and the fact that the changes to the state updates that

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:13.500
you are using our logic.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.270
We're tryingto to the validation.
