00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.230
now that we have understood how to past data from one component toe another component using

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.950
Trump's Let's work on some Evans.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.640
But just before that,

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.550
we can also use some third party CSS remote like bootstrap for that first,

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.070
for the command prompt.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.710
Maybe you can stop the server,

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:18.510
which is running,

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.900
and then take your NPM I for install.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.460
Bootstrap the sender.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.700
This was big.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.950
Few seconds.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:32.420
Once that would stop is installed.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:38.970
Let's start that there was a road by typing in B M Start and go back to visual studio

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:39.680
safety.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:47.050
Come toe the note model folder and stroll toe Boonstra and there is a dist folder CSS.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.950
And we have this bootstrap CSS or Bush up Min Darcy s is So this is the one that we have,

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.340
the important our file,

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.000
and we can go to the index,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.930
start chase and imported once,

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.700
and it'll be available for all our components.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:11.370
So I go to the indexed R J s and include your import and they bootstrap slash dest slash

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.310
CSS.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.950
And then I think food stopped about CSS.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.730
Save this and now let's open the app content,

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.750
and that's a couple of buttons over here,

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:29.750
so I left 1st 1 button I can take part in last name equals stupid Bt.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.470
And this is a bootstrap CSS class name BT and deaf family.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.580
And then I take your but on one saved this.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.850
Go back to the browser and we should see a blue collar button here.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.930
Now I want to capture the click event off this particular Burton and I want to love

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.150
something on the console.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.890
So I pressed F 12 to go to the browser concern.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.330
So whenever right click on this button,

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.050
I want some or pull over here.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.440
To do that,

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.290
we have to first capture the event off this button,

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.650
which is the click you went.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.350
And you have to assign a function to that.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.310
We can have a function return over here against a median handler,

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.250
and then I can probably say something like gun so long,

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.250
but one clear,

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.820
you know,

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.600
in the walk this you just heard assigned the name of dysfunction to the button.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.350
Over here,

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:33.410
the way you ascend this button handler to the actual button is by capturing the on click

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.410
event Saturday.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:41.370
Fear on click equals toe in curly bracket we assigned the function which is part of the

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.930
objects.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.610
Are there this start?

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.070
BT and handler Save this.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.840
Go back to the browser and when I click on the button,

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.650
you will see that it is part in one click.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.350
But this has a small problem.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.300
For example,

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:05.340
if I type your come on this I want to know what exactly the keyword this correspond do So

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.890
if I go back and click on this button one now you can see this is undefined but as we

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.350
wanted to get this is an object of the at content component.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.260
Now what is happening right now is that when we gave the name of the function to the water

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.260
,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.920
the function became part of the button itself and hence it loses the context of the

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.650
component.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.270
So if you want to access any member variable or any member function of the app content

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.000
class,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.750
I will not be able to do that.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.120
So there are a couple of ways to overcome this Number one you can find.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.720
The key word is while ascending this particular bt and handler.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.740
In this way,

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:53.300
this dog begin handler dark buying and said this So when I say this,

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.800
go back to the browser.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.960
Wait for the brother.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.720
The refreshing click on this button.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.650
Now we can see button one click on the second perimeter.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.750
Here is the app content component with all the props and context and everything else.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.080
Now,

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.020
sometimes this might be a little emptier to do so.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.510
You may also want to do it in multiple places.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.390
The second way to do that is by using this in the constructor.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.230
So I may have to read a constructive and the constructor.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.940
First thing is your call the super class constructors.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.390
And then we can say this dark median handler equals two.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.940
This dark median handler don't find this.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:32.550
Basically,

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.400
what we're saying is that when this class is instance created,

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.130
we are assigning this start median handler toe this door.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.170
Obedient handler.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:43.010
Don't bind that.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.510
This which means this function,

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.670
if you're a Zen toe,

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:47.480
any button,

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.250
are any other object.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.390
It will still be called from the context of the up content itself,

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.560
so it will not lose the context.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.740
So I saved this.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:03.400
Go back to the browser and click on this button and you can still see that the keyword is

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.950
correspond to an object off at content.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.470
The third method is instead of doing all these things over here,

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.640
we can simply use an adult function over here.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:19.790
So baby and handler becomes the property and you can see it here equals to a function.

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.550
But it's an adult function now.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.810
Adam functions read in the context off the origin,

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.420
which means that the BT and Handler Waas part of the up,

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.000
content this function.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.600
Whenever you supplied toe any other component or any other object,

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.660
it will still made in the context of the AB content itself.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.210
So I see this.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:43.240
Go back to the browser and click on the button one and I still see the key work this

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.150
corresponded are up content.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.050
So,

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.080
in my opinion,

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.960
this is a better on the easiest way toe work with but just a disclaimer that if you are

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.300
referencing to some books or documentation,

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.830
people might have used this method,

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.200
are the first matter that I should also.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.170
So you just have to be aware of this.

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:03.920
But when you want to use it,

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.100
I suggest get used to this particular function,

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.650
which is out of functions
