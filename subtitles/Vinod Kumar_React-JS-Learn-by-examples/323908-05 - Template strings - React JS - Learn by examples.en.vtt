X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.460
Yes.

00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.360
Six introduced a new paper string chord of the employees extreme.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.180
Andi,

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.210
it's very useful in many occasions.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.100
Let's go and have a look at that by using another example.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:16.730
So I'm gonna create a new final cardiac zero treat orgs Here is an example of a string.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:17.810
So I say,

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.750
Let s one e puts toe.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.220
My name is we don't not that I've used a single course here.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:35.120
I can also cleared a string using double courts saying I live in Bangor so you cannot

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.070
combine the single courts and double courts for a given street.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.740
Which means you cannot open with a single ports an end with the double course,

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.380
But you can combine them.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.950
For example,

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.630
I consider let s three equals two in double courts and typing.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.610
This is a react Js and northern Riyadh.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:02.890
Jesse's in single course training are I can also say let s four equals toe in single course

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.890
.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:09.280
Second say that the training is available on in double courts and failure.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.860
Your enemy black fall so you can combine single coats and double courts in this way.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.440
But you cannot open with the single course and end with the temple courts.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.870
But these around years,

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.030
five are higher standards,

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.730
but the new one is called Implicating.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:31.980
On the way you do it is by using something like this the character you have to use is the

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:32.750
tactic.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.920
And then you can type your whatever that you want.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:36.720
For example,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:45.670
I can say this is a new feature in CS six looks no different than the previous.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.140
Once they all work in the same style.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.210
But this is very powerful at this time.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.950
There's no specialty off this particular,

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.010
despite let me die Pure console long Yes,

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.470
one.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.610
And then copy paste This few times.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.740
Make them as two s tree as far as fight.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.830
So save it and go back to the command brunch.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.580
Here is my new fine eg zero tree.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.380
I can simply more eggs.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.640
It'll cheap as ender on.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.230
It's giving me the output as expected.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.550
So the single courts here,

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.310
which is rendered using a double correct stream,

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.340
the double guards here which is introducing a scene important age.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.560
And here is the new one,

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.510
which is actually a little different than the previous one.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.820
How is it different?

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:32.790
So first,

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.670
this almost multi line takes,

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:35.230
for example,

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:43.180
I can have here let at six equals two and I can have your something like this is a monkey

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.630
life.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.540
Next also,

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.780
and then I could consider lock at six Savage,

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.250
Go back to the command front,

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.390
running one smooth and you will see that I'm able to get Muddy Lane the text.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.420
Now if you tried to do the same thing for any off these,

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.940
for example,

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.090
if I simply press enter over here,

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.960
save it not that visual studio itself is indicating that there is another.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.960
But nonetheless let's go entitled over here by typing your usual t and you see that it is

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:20.010
that invalid are unexpected token because we have not completed the Siegel course that we

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.140
are open now.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.590
That way we would have done is by using a court and then a plus and then again coming back

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.250
here opening one more courts.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.850
So we have to take it off,

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.060
bringing it in the next line and so on.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.070
But as with implicating,

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.060
it is automatically taken care off.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.560
Another employed strings are called so because they can be used as a template for

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.440
substitution off variables,

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.350
For example,

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:51.920
I can have here few variables that they let name for stupid old let email because toe not

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:52.240
after,

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.040
not that cool.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:01.300
And now I can combine them in a single string by typing left a seven equals to using a bag

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.670
big.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.930
I'm gonna take your he made addressed off dollars.

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.650
Name is Dollar in May.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.060
So this is the template,

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.690
and we're substituting the value of an expression here which happens to be a variable.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.380
And that's actually we know.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.800
So that's going to say email it yourself be no peace.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:27.530
And then it's gonna get the value off this particular expression or value of this variable

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.530
.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.160
So let's just try sending this at seven and go back.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.070
You have the screen and try once more and you can see that it is email on yourself you know

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.460
is not had we not are cool now.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.920
Other mentioned that this is an expression here not just a variable.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.590
You can literally give any expressions if you want.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:48.490
For example,

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.850
I'm not.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.640
I fear that age equals true 45.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.900
I can die.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:05:01.010
Let s eight equals two using back taken on savior dollars Name is and then I want to print

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:07.570
your is an adult or me the minor based on the age so I can do the dollar and actually black

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.360
an expression and I can take a judge.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.910
Less than 18 fishing mark now liken you,

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:14.850
then all could stream,

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:21.380
which is either in single courts are double course I can say a minor colon on alert.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:22.110
Okay,

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:29.400
Save this and print this and you should see exist We know is an adult,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.330
so that's taken.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.980
Get off.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:33.660
But indeed,

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.040
if I give some age off,

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.280
say,

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.930
for example,

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:37.530
12.

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:44.180
And if I tried to run the same things it says that you know is a minor implications can

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.400
also be parsed using some user defined functions for this.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.960
Let's take another example.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.350
So I'm gonna select this folder.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:58.360
Cleared a new file e x 04 dot Js Absolutely a couple of variables.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.270
Let name equals two.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:10.750
We note let age equals toe for a fine and then they let s One equals to Emilio's back dick

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:10.750
.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.790
And then I take your dollar name.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:19.150
He's dollar age years poured.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:20.950
So of course,

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.230
if I put this by using a control log s one,

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:29.910
we should know check by typing North TX 04 and it says,

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.350
you know there's 45 years old.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:37.370
But what if I want to print some other string based on the age off the person Something

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.190
like we know is a young person,

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:40.850
we don't either.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:44.120
Middle aged person we know is an old person,

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:44.920
etcetera.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:50.760
So obviously using internally expression here would be very difficult because we have

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:51.910
multiple conditions.

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.990
What I can do that can supply than does string,

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:03.440
toe some other function and then pass that these are our AG implications on toe Use it that

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.740
first define a function so,

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:12.110
like this that's got it as my back on the Ben Emily was your return.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.410
This is a sample or put.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:16.930
Of course,

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:18.250
we would like to change that.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:23.080
And then I'm gonna copy this line basted over here,

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.300
make it as s two.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.780
But just before the starting off this pact IQ,

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.890
I'm gonna type your my lifetime.

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:33.230
Not that I'm supplying the name of the function,

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:34.760
followed by a temptation.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:39.680
And if I use tensile love as to now,

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.800
we are not gonna get we know is 45 years old,

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.480
but instead we will be getting the return value of dysfunction.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.200
So which is this one?

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.420
This is a sample output.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:55.070
So I'm gonna go and just the same thing and you can see it is this is a sample output.

00:07:55.070 --> 00:08:03.070
But what happens is that this entire string here is not broken into smaller pieces and

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:05.470
we'll be past as arguments to this function.

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:08.980
So the first argument here is called strings,

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:13.300
which is an array off strings that is made up off pieces,

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:14.260
off strings like this.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.080
So this is the first part of the string,

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.350
and then this is the second part of the stream.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:24.250
So if you declare a variable here are streams or anything else and then let's just do it

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:27.700
for so long here by typing strengths.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:28.780
Come on strings.

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:34.850
So we would be seeing that it's an area of two strings consisting off this as the first

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:37.060
part on this at the second part.

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:42.320
So let's go does the same thing and you can see that there is an empty string before that.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.490
That is something that starts from here till here itself,

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:49.680
that them testing first far second part and then the third part.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:50.330
So in case.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.590
If something is there before this dollar me,

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:55.350
that would have been the first part over here.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:09:01.930
So whatever this dollar name and dollar each so this dollar name will be positive.

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:05.550
The second argument dollar age will be passed as the third argument.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.580
So if you want to receive that,

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:08.810
you have two options.

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:09.190
Number one,

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:10.380
you're declare a variable here.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.100
Called us the one and then be too.

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.800
So be one will receive the value off this.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.200
And he too will see the value off this.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.080
So if you want to confront the same thing,

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.460
you can say console long can safety one.

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:23.790
Come on,

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.230
you two save this.

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:28.310
And from the same you can see the one is.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:30.070
We know Peter is 45.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:30.590
If you want,

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:34.770
you can type your The one is the one,

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:42.520
and I can see your Peter is Do you do so you get the Opel S.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.670
B one is we know P two is 45.

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:48.990
Now that I have this we know than 45 based on the value off Pito,

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:51.580
I cannot actually generate a different output.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:54.250
A John State function also defines a key work.

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:57.550
Our arguments and we can use that Also,

00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:58.350
For example,

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:03.070
it's coming these two lines and have your console law arguments.

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:07.440
Arguments is an object representing all the perimeter that you're supplied.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.150
Since the function resumes three parts here,

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:16.580
one is the array of strings and then the values off each off these dollar expressions,

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.140
so arguments will now display the same thing.

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.460
So if I go back to the command from and print the same,

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:27.000
you'll see the first argument is an area off the stream parts,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.290
and the 2nd 1 is the first expression that the second expressions value axle.

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:34.650
So you can actually say argument.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:41.310
Zero Arguments off one arguments off to the third picnic for receiving all these dollar

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:47.490
named dollar H etcetera is by using a triple dot and then say values.

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:51.570
We will be learning about this triple dot in the subsequent lessons.

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:52.750
Solder for that.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:58.920
What happens is their values now represents an array off on other pedometers that are soft

00:10:58.920 --> 00:10:59.250
light.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:03.580
So I cannot I feel consoled or lock values.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.480
Save this and go back.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:09.490
I should see an area off to a news be not and 45.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:12.690
So this is all you can use,

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:14.860
something called active complex strings.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:15.980
In year six
