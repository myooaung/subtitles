00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
Let's make a copy off this particular fight by clicking under in the exploder Command C

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.520
Command V or Control C Control be on windows.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:17.630
Let's call it s Get customers by city and I don't need this all and then say OK and open

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.290
the same by double clicking that.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.860
And this time we want to get the list of all customers from a particular city.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.920
Let's declare a variable called city equals toe.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.660
Whatever the name we want,

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.950
let's give it us Pangle.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:31.200
Oh,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.510
and then instead of saying,

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.160
get all customers we want to say,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:43.590
Get customers by city and the city is the variable that we have created over here.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:51.420
And then I can change the output statement here saying there are so many customers from the

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.570
city off one of the variable that this represents.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.090
And since we are only getting from a particular city,

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.290
we don't want to really print all these details because it's all going to be from the same

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.770
city.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.250
We simply print the customer itself.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.060
So let's go and run this one and see how it's gonna look like I have given bang glow and

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.780
you can see it,

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.590
says that there are three customers from Bangor and these the three customers from Bangla.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.460
Let's give it a try for Let's say,

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.200
Dallas.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.410
There's one customer from Dallas,

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.170
and if I type,

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.920
you're a city that doesn't exist.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.200
Letter,

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.000
for example.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.600
I give your my soul save this and run the program on.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.300
This time it is.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.080
There are zero customers from my soul.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.090
And since this is a list off zero side and not that it's not no,

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.680
it's returning a list,

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.890
but the list is empty.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.510
The loop doesn't even go forward.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.120
So that's the reason we're not getting any better as well.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:53.960
So this is how you can get the data from the database table in the form off list off

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.690
objects on notice.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.350
We didn't have to write a single line of jelly.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.100
Busy cold.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.330
All the hard work is done by my batteries.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.350
We simply have to write an interface.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.400
Onda appropriately map it with an SQL Select statement
