00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200
My bet is,

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:06.850
is a Jell O persistent framework that dynamically implements all the complex J D B C chord

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.770
that otherwise would have been returned by a developer by mapping methods often interface

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.950
toe appropriate SQL statements.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.180
For example,

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.650
the metal get all customers,

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.390
which is expected to return.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.850
A list of customers may be mapped on a scale command Select Star from customers,

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.580
and my brothers will handle all the infrastructure code required for executing the given

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.530
SQL Command on gun words.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.730
The data in the results that in tow a list off customer objects.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.100
Let's understand the working off my bed is using this illustration.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.170
Consider an entity class card customer that has the feels idee name,

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.800
Citi email and phone.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.970
Also considered an interface called Customer Deal,

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.820
which provides crowd and quality operations.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.330
The perimeters Andi are written types off.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.850
The methods in this interface may include our into the glass.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.630
We have to map each of these methods to appropriate SQL statements using appropriate

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.450
annotations,

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.790
and these and additions are perverted by my betters.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.410
You can also map these methods to SQL statements using XML,

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.640
for example,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.740
Add customer maker must be map to toe on a skill insert command Using the Advocate.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.940
Insert an addition on get customer by only method must be mapped toe an SQL Select

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.950
statement using at the Red Select an addition.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:38.070
So Allah Gel application users are depends on this map are interface customer deal on toe.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.460
Obtain an instance off this mapper interface.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.320
We use my betters as a factory,

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.100
my brightest reach the information about BB connectivity and the mapper interfaces from an

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.880
XML conflict.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.200
Fine,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.880
but this can be done from dramatically as well.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.990
Now my betters will create a class on the flight during the runtime that implements are

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.950
mapper into face,

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.800
and then our application can get an instance off this class,

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.270
the implementation class created by my buddies uses J BBC toe connect to the underlying

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.610
database on light boredom or object relation.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.820
Mapper like hibernate or GPS.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.650
My betters does not need you toe map the entity classes to the table or column names.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.720
It automatically detects the column names and transforms the record into an entity object.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.920
My baddest lets you use all your database functionalities like stored procedures,

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.040
views quiet.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.660
Ease off any complexity on rendered appropriately features.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:41.150
It is often a good choice for legacy or de normalize databases are to obtain full control

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.570
off a skill execution in a tower application.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.960
My better supports declare ity data cache e a statement can be Margus catchable,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.670
so any data retrieved from the database will be stolen at cash on future executions.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.750
Off that statement will tell the cast a data instead of hitting the database.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.800
My bed is probably said Default Cash implementation based on Java hash map on default

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.850
connectors for integrating with us cash.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:09.880
He hits cash.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.250
Has it'll cast on men Cashed.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.040
It provides an A p a tow plug,

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.350
other cache implementations as well.
