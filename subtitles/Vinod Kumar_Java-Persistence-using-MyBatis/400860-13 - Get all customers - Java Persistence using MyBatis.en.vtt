00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.470
There are two more functions that we can test.

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:05.770
Number one is the get all customers,

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.850
and the 2nd 1 is get customers by city.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.630
We have to supply a city value.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.720
And then we get list off customers in both the cases.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.570
To do that,

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.790
let's right click on programs package new job class and let's call it us.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.620
Get all customers other public static.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.400
Y mean,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.030
get it off the artery,

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.130
gender that to do.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:39.860
And then I copied this and based over here this time we want toe retrieve all the customers

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:40.870
so I can say here,

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.650
dear would not get all customers the return value.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.520
I will assign that to a variable called list.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.050
And since I have not declared that I have to press command one and then press enter,

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.600
I got a list of customers and note that the list is automatically imported from Java Util

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.800
because that's the return data,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.800
Dave off dysfunction.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.580
And now we can check how many people are there so we can say sits out.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:15.610
There are listed outsize customers and then we can start displaying one by one.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.600
Let's use a for loop for this,

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.700
and I can say for C in list once against is not declared,

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.620
it's an edl.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.760
I go there and then press command one.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.660
It has created Luke very well,

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.220
See?

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.970
And it's done now and then.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.400
I can come down here and then print a message.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.920
Si dot get name.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.740
Let's say,

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:36.650
for example,

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.480
is from seed out.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.350
Get city.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.040
Let's try to run this and see how the output looks like And you can see it is there are

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.070
four customers.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.620
We know this from Bangladesh Army from Bangla and so on and so forth.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:58.650
So this is how easy it is to get the list off all customers without having toe write a

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.630
single line off Jerry bicycle.
