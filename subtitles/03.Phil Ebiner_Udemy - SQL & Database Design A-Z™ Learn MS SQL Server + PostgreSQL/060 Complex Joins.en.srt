00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,930
Hello and welcome back to the course on databases.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,480
So far we've learned so much already.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:05,820
Right.

4
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,630
We've talked about left joins.

5
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,530
We've talked about tips and tricks.

6
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:11,330
Totally right.

7
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:15,240
Joines inner joins full outer joins joining on multiple fields.

8
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:20,250
Plus you have all this back with the theory of the joins that we discussed earlier.

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:27,360
So this is you're getting quite knowledgeable in the subject of Joines in databases and that is very

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:33,530
exciting and today I've got another exciting step for you today we're going to look at a complex joint

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:41,410
zone example where we don't have just one joint where we have two joins in a row in one statement.

12
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,650
It's going to be quite challenging So hopefully you're ready for it because in terms of preparedness

13
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,390
you're definitely prepared for it.

14
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:55,540
With all this knowledge in your arsenal in your backpack you're ready to tackle a complex.

15
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,270
So let's get the ball rolling.

16
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,160
We're going to create a new part.

17
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:08,760
We're going to call it complex joint and we're going to start.

18
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:12,080
We going just start actually by discussing what we want to achieve.

19
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,350
Right.

20
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,520
So that's always very important to understand.

21
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:21,620
Well we've already seen that we can connect our pets table to the procedure history table to find out

22
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:26,060
which of the pets in our clinic have had procedures done.

23
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,890
And that's we were you know how that works.

24
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,400
We used what type of joint did we use for that.

25
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,680
We use an inner join for that.

26
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:33,160
Right.

27
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:41,630
And then we've also seen how to connect the procedure history table to the procedure Details table to

28
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:50,150
find out more specifically what each of the procedures means and you know even the price for the procedures

29
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:50,920
as we see here.

30
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,690
So now we're going to combine the two.

31
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,960
What we want to achieve is we want we don't want a huge table like this.

32
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,110
For details of all the procedures that ever happened.

33
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:06,200
All we want is the pets in our clinic or find out of them which ones actually had procedure detail up

34
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,550
actually had procedures.

35
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:07,980
Right.

36
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:14,090
So which ones had procedures and then find the descriptions of those procedures and actual costs.

37
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,390
So that's going to be exciting so let's get started by doing this step by step and that's how you approach

38
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:27,140
these types of problems these challenges you do them step by step you first build one table you can

39
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,330
to the next table then you look at the results you make some notes then you connect to the next table

40
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,980
and so on sometimes you might have lots and lots of tables.

41
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,100
But we'll talk about that later.

42
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,470
So let's get started.

43
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,510
We'll say select star from pets right.

44
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,150
So that's your first step.

45
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,140
Just say that and run that have a look.

46
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,950
So we've got 100 rows 100 pets in here.

47
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:50,950
Fantastic.

48
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:57,170
Right now what we want to do is want to connect to the procedure history table to find out which of

49
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,970
these pets actually had procedures done.

50
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:04,340
And as we discussed previously if you are left join then we will indeed get the procedure details.

51
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:09,070
But we'll keep all the other pets in the table that never had procedures and that's not what we're after.

52
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,770
We just want only the pets that have had procedures and that's why we're going to do an inner join.

53
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:22,400
So say Star from pets inner join procedure history

54
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,260
and then you need to specify how you joining them.

55
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,690
You say you're going to say pets.

56
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,220
Well we could say PED's Daut pet idea.

57
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:37,870
But in this case we're going to create an alias as a as B by the way.

58
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:44,950
They don't have to be in a and b you could you could say X you could say I said you could say my table

59
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,650
one could say whatever you like and be just short and easy.

60
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,220
And that's why we use them.

61
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:57,480
A dot PED's IDs so we know that in this table we've got pet ID as the primary key.

62
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,720
And then if we go to if we look at the other table.

63
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:07,180
So procedure history is have a look at that table you'll see that here we've got parady as well.

64
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:12,610
So that's the name of the call Notice here that it's not the primary key so there could be several pairs

65
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,840
with the same ID.

66
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:21,460
This table actually is not identified by parody but still that's how we're going to join to this table

67
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:27,080
so we can say on a dog pet a equals b dot pet Id call on.

68
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,200
And let's go ahead and run this.

69
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:33,140
So if I click 5 and I have a look.

70
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:43,500
Voila 41 rows or pay attention here 41 rows and you can see that we've got the up over up until here

71
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,840
so this is our first table this part and this second table.

72
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:54,130
So we've got 41 rows meaning that's not necessarily 41 pets in our database have had procedures because

73
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:57,720
some of the pets as you call here have had several procedures.

74
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,390
There were so this dog has had two procedures.

75
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:05,880
So but at the same time we know that out of our pets there's a total of on procedures.

76
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:10,930
Now what we want to know is we want to find out more details on these procedures so we want to add more

77
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,640
information here on the right.

78
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,500
We want to find out the description of this procedure and the cost or the price of the procedure.

79
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:24,010
Maybe you know maybe this is an audit or something like that and we need to find out how much money

80
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:31,600
this the paths or how much money was generated from procedures associated with the pets in this specific

81
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,580
facility.

82
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,840
So let's go ahead and do that.

83
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,800
We're going to add on the right so there's nothing scary about it.

84
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:38,760
We're just going to continue.

85
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:44,620
So we're going to treat this part you know like this part from pets as we're going to just think of

86
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,450
it as if this was just one table.

87
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:47,620
Right.

88
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:51,160
So if this was just one letter right what would we do next.

89
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:59,930
We say we'd go here left to join if this is one table would say it would say woo left join right.

90
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:06,920
Because remember we we used a live joint between the procedure history and procedure details tables

91
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:07,390
right.

92
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:13,460
Because we want to keep all of this information and then we just add something onto the right.

93
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:13,730
Right.

94
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:17,540
And if something doesn't add on that means there there's some some problem but we need to know about

95
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,440
it if we don't find a match.

96
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,330
So we wanted to join and so that's what we're going to do.

97
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,360
So we're going to just return all of that.

98
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:34,070
And here we going to type in left joins to just keep typing as if nothing happened as if we don't really

99
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,420
have a joint here.

100
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:41,340
I know it might look a bit complex but in reality you'll see that it all makes sense just in a second

101
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,250
so left join procedure details.

102
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,630
Details we're going to call it as see.

103
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,610
And so maybe get rid of the call for now.

104
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,720
And now how did we perform this joint.

105
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:59,750
Well here we're used on procedure type equals procedure type and procedure subcortical procedures.

106
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:06,440
So now we not only have a complex joint because of the three tables we actually also going to have a

107
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,010
joint in multiple fields.

108
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,990
So we're going to just type that up and say on.

109
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:18,500
So it's important here to understand which table we're taking for the this part which take table we're

110
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,990
taking this information from so now we've got this table is Table A.

111
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,950
Up to here right.

112
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,190
This is Table B where we're here.

113
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:34,110
So now we're taking from table B we're taking procedure type procedure sub code and we're joining that

114
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:42,470
table see the say they have the same name there so we're going to be that procedure type calls see Daut

115
00:07:43,280 --> 00:08:00,370
procedure type and the DOT procedure sub code he calls C Daut procedure sub called and colon.

116
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:10,120
So now if I were on this voice I was still we have 41 Roseberry important so we didn't add did we duplicate

117
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,160
anything and that's going back to what we discussed in the previous tutorial.

118
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,310
But now you can see that we actually have three tables here combined.

119
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:23,490
We've got Pead ID all the way up to here so up to owner ID then we've got this part where the procedure

120
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,620
is right so up to here.

121
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,410
That's these four column from Table 2.

122
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:32,400
And then we've got table three we've got the actual information.

123
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,650
So we've got the procedure.

124
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:39,180
What is this the procedure type.

125
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:42,120
So this is your procedure type in your procedure subgoal.

126
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:48,810
And here we've got our table 3 with all of the information here.

127
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,390
So very exactly.

128
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,180
Very interesting and exactly what we wanted.

129
00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:05,110
So we've got our final result and we now know which pets in our database in our tables actually had

130
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:12,310
procedures and we have details of those procedures so we can actually get to the information on what

131
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,330
they had done and what the price will be.

132
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,610
So there we go that's how we perform a complex joint.

133
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:20,430
CONAN gratulations on that.

134
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:25,900
That was quite a task quite a difficult thing to do.

135
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,920
And and you have accomplished that.

136
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:35,980
So now that is something as you put into your backpack of knowledge about databases and sure enough

137
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:44,630
there are plenty of situations where complex joins like this will be able to assist you in your work

138
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:48,510
and I hope you enjoy this or Tauriel and I look forward to seeing you next time.

139
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,070
Until then happy analyzing.
