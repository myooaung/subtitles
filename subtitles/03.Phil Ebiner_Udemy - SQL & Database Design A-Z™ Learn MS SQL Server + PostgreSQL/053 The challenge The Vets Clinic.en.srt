Hello and welcome back to the course on databases.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,820
Today we got a very interesting challenge.

3
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:08,750
We're helping a vet's clinic with their data analytics.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,530
Let's have a look inside.

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:10,870
All right.

6
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:17,910
So you're a data analyst assisting every training clinic to make sense of their data their data is dispersed

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:24,240
across multiple source files and they need you to support all of them to a database and then perform

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,650
the following analytics.

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,170
First of all extract information on pets names and owner names side by side.

10
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:37,620
Then find out which parts from this clinic had procedures performed then match up all procedures performed

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,930
across all pets to their descriptions to descriptions of the procedures.

12
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:48,750
Same as above but only for the pets of the clinic in question so you'll see that the data sets are a

13
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:54,780
bit different some data sets are not nationwide some data sets are just for this specific clinic so

14
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,630
you're going to need to in those two different challenges or two questions you're going to need to perform

15
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,000
a bit different tasks.

16
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:07,650
And number five extract a table of individual costs which are procedure prices incurred by owners of

17
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,330
PEDs from the clinic in question.

18
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,270
So this table should only show two columns the owner and the procedure price side by side.

19
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,730
So I know this might be a bit overwhelming right now but let's have a look at the data set to understand

20
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:21,530
what we're dealing with.

21
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,380
So to get the data set we're going to need a browser.

22
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:32,470
And in your browser you will need to go to WDW that super data signs dot com slash as you will.

23
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:41,250
So if you scroll down here to section number 7 joining tables and Asgill you'll see the challenge and

24
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,470
then you'll see four files.

25
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:48,720
So so the pedofile has information on the pets of this clinic owners are the owners of the pets from

26
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:55,930
this clinic procedures histories and nationwide list of procedures performed Of course all pets and

27
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:56,920
you'll find out why.

28
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,860
For the down in the section and procedure details contains additional information on the procedures

29
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,470
in the procedures history table.

30
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,630
So there we go there's four files or we'll be working with quite an exciting section ahead of us.

31
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:15,660
We'll have a look at the data set inside the next tutorials.

32
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,240
So just go ahead and download that and I'll see you next time.

33
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,960
Until then happy analyzing.
