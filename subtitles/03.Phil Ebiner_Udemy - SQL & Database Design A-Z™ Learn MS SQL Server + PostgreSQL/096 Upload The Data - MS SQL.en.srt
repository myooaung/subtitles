00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:00,720
Hello.

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,940
Welcome back so of course on database's in today's Tauriel we will upload the data set for the section

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,290
into Microsoft skills server.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,000
So let's go ahead and get started.

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:16,080
First thing we'll need is a browser and in the browser and you go to WWE does superdad assigns that

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,950
com slash as well.

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:27,060
And here if you scroll down to Section 9 database design you will see this file over here which is called

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,900
MESKEL upload code.

9
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,040
So go ahead and download that file.

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:39,470
We will need it further down in this tutorial in order to finalize the upload process.

11
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:46,100
But for now what we're going to do is we're going to first upload the raw data into Microsoft escarole

12
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:46,920
server.

13
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:54,310
So let's go ahead and get started if that were going to create a new database in your database.

14
00:00:54,310 --> 00:01:00,360
And here you'll call it OLTP which has four online transaction processing that's a type of database

15
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:07,830
structure we're going to be working with in this tutorial in this whole section actually and go ahead

16
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:08,820
click OK.

17
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,450
So there we go databases ready.

18
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:17,220
And now we're going to just upload some data here so you can see that it's completely empty.

19
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,650
So if you're right click the database and go to tasks and click Import data.

20
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,010
We've got our import wizard here.

21
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,750
Go ahead click next for data source.

22
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,580
Select flat file source.

23
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:40,080
Find where you have placed your file for this section and just search for CACP here on the right and

24
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,200
select your CACP file.

25
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:51,150
Make sure to specify just one quotation mark so it's a it's a quotation marks it has two of those little

26
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:57,730
elements in it but it's one symbol that is as your text qualifier.

27
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,020
So a quotation mark is a text qualifier.

28
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,220
This should be checked.

29
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,290
Call them names and first they add a row.

30
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,240
Go to columns just have a quick click here that looks ok.

31
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:15,570
Go to advanced change all of this to 5000 so it gets imported so there's enough space where importing

32
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,670
all of it as strings to start with in the real file.

33
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,380
Then go to preview.

34
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,700
Have a look in the preview that everything is OK in these first couple of rows.

35
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,730
Everything works fine.

36
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:37,010
Click next in your destination select Microsoft only DBI provider for us gils server.

37
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,700
Everything is fine here.

38
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:46,130
Click next here let's rename this to this whole file is going to be or this table is going to be called

39
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:52,940
the roll underscore transactions on transactions beautiful.

40
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,140
Click next run immediately next and finish.

41
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,250
And quite a few rows.

42
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,060
There we go.

43
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,280
Everything is done.

44
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,540
Close the refresh.

45
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:09,220
You will see the table here so you can select 2000 rows.

46
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:15,740
This is a good start but at the moment this table is completely just strings strings strings so it's

47
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,710
just text so it doesn't recognize numbers.

48
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,030
Berkeley doesn't recognize dates and so on.

49
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,660
So we're going to fix that.

50
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,200
That's where that file that we just downloaded will come in handy.

51
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:37,020
So if you open the file see it looks like this has got this code which will allow us to convert our

52
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,310
role data.

53
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:46,750
So from we take taken from the raw table into formatted or into columns of the correct data type so

54
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,140
this can select everything from here.

55
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:54,120
It's like new query pasted in here and execute this query.

56
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:58,900
You can see 300 2255 rows have been affected.

57
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,140
Refresh.

58
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:04,090
Now we can see that the transactions table is ready here so we can close this.

59
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,370
We don't need any more than we can check.

60
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:15,340
This table looks very similar but now the table has correct the correct data types for each column.

61
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:23,040
So voila everything is ready we are prepared for this very challenging and very interesting section.

62
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,520
These tutorials are going to be a lot of fun as we're going to learn a lot and I can't wait to see you

63
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,170
next time.

64
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,800
Until then happy analyzing.
