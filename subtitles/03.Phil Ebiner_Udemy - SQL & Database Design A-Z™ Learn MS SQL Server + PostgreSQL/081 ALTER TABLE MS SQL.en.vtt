00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.060
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.190
Today we'll be working with altering tables in our case.

3
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:12.050
We'll be working with altering tables and Microsoft Eskew all server as you can see I have Microsoft

4
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.800
skills or Amanda Smith Studia open up my database loaded up inside of which I have our newly created

5
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.130
movies stable.

6
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.480
The first thing I want to do is run an inquiry in which all say select all from movies.

7
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.070
So now we execute it.

8
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.720
I will see exactly what we have on site.

9
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:35.110
We have nice and if you're looking for before a table with four columns and four rows all filled with

10
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.750
data.

11
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.620
Now I forgot to put in one column I want to add a new column called the rectors throw in case on a binge

12
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.630
watch all the movies by Christopher Nolan.

13
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.070
I can do that.

14
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.330
This is where the issue comes in.

15
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:52.240
It's all about adding this column isn't about the code behind it it's about just the amount of work

16
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.510
I'll have to do all over again and you'll understand what I'm talking about in a second.

17
00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:03.200
So when working with table design we need to write this command ALTER TABLE.

18
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.810
We already work with it.

19
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:11.650
But basically when we're editing dropping creating a new one editing the existing column we want to

20
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.870
work with alter alter table.

21
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:21.310
Then we write and table name and then we say alter again but this time or rather in our case we say

22
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.690
add and we just type in our company.

23
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.490
In my case it's going to be director.

24
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.690
And in my case it's going to be of a data type or.

25
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.080
And it's going to be a maximum of 100 characters.

26
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.990
It's if we exit get us everything works perfectly fine and if we stay like this again we can see a new

27
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.070
column that's filled in with Nalls by default and if we just update this.

28
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.080
Sorry if we just refresh the movies and open up the columns we can see the fifth one created here.

29
00:01:52.270 --> 00:02:00.100
So the problem of this is that if I want to edit this data here and I want to put it specific for each

30
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.230
row unique for each row I'll have to go ahead and write a new piece of code in which I will have to

31
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.210
say update.

32
00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:16.000
So when we're working with the table design we want to go ahead and say ALTER TABLE here because we're

33
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.820
working with the data inside of it.

34
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:33.350
I want to say update movies and I don't want to say set director to be equal to but to be equal to Christopher

35
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.450
Nolan and only in the movie where movie name

36
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.640
equals interstellar.

37
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.950
So now if you run this you can see that one or only one was affected.

38
00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.240
And if we just rerun this like all statement we can see that now it's changed and a director is built

39
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.840
here now.

40
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.790
But you can understand that only with four rows of data already we'll have to write this query four

41
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.310
different times and fill it before even eight instances of data.

42
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.100
And that just gets very tiring after a while if you do hungry too hungry trodes it will take you a whole

43
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.990
day of mindless just typing and typing and typing again.

44
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.210
And if you make a typo during that time you will have to spend even more time looking for a typo.

45
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.150
So again I cannot stress this enough.

46
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:37.740
It's very very important to create your database with a good design that you will not work on later

47
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:46.710
on and filled that with good data and then you can use all of Great microcell fescue function tools

48
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:54.170
to help you analyze it extracted and just do very insanely good and efficient stuff.

49
00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:00.350
But inserting the correct data is your biggest struggle as a starting that is scientists.

50
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.040
At least I would say that is the biggest struggle.

51
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.260
So now that I've done this I've decided that it's too much work to create this director field.

52
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.040
Plus I remember all the director's by name anyway so I will not drop it.

53
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.810
All we have to do is go to this alter table statement again because we're not working with data.

54
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.790
We're working with table design.

55
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:26.330
I'm going to go to alter table movies and here I'm just going to say drop and I'm going to type in the

56
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.200
record.

57
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:33.390
Now if you run this we can see a message error because the director basically since for nothing.

58
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:38.320
So what I want to say is drop column director.

59
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.460
So now we execute this it will execute properly.

60
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:49.010
Because when you altering a table and you adding something you can only add a column and when you were

61
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:54.560
altering it table you dropped something you can drop a lot of different things and scale gets confused.

62
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.430
So don't forget drop column.

63
00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.620
So if we select all we can see that nothing is in here so the Fifth Column disappeared we again back

64
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.760
or need a nice form for table.

65
00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.140
I hope you enjoyed this lecture.

66
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.000
Also let's just quickly go ahead and refresh this.

67
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:16.820
Oh and there is another way of working with columns and tables and Microsoft scale server management

68
00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:17.690
studio.

69
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:23.780
All they have to do is right click here for example go ahead to properties and here you can go ahead

70
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.860
and see all of your different names schemas.

71
00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:34.310
All of that you can change permissions for the table itself the storage and security.

72
00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:35.520
For now we don't need that.

73
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.510
And if you want to work with columns you can just go ahead.

74
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.030
Right click on the columns.

75
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.750
Create a new column created like that data type.

76
00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.350
Allen nulls are not change all the different properties and save it.

77
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.350
Or you can delete the existing ones just by right clicking here you can see go ahead.

78
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:57.530
Deleted are inserted in here in this space so it certainly oversee a wider range of tools and it's easier

79
00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:58.730
to do it that way.

80
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:06.170
But again always remember it's good to start working with a great dataset properly started and it's

81
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:11.230
good to finish working with Gray Davis say it still properly insert it.

82
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.520
I hope you enjoyed this lecture and I'll see you in next one.
