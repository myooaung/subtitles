00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.470
Hello and welcome back to the course on database's tutorial we're going to continue normalizing our

2
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:07.300
database.

3
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:13.120
So far we've redesigned the database to make sure that it's in second normal form.

4
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:19.430
And as you can remember we've got two tables now instead of one we've got the Customers table and the

5
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:26.000
transactions team and today we're going to check if these tables are if this database is now in a third

6
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.210
normal form.

7
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.650
And if we're going to adjust it to make it conform to the third normal form.

8
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.970
So let's have a look at the definition on the third normal form to start off with the third normal form

9
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:45.690
as we discussed in the theoretical Torrey's is defined as the table has to be in second second normal

10
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.230
form which we've already checked and also every non-prime attribute is non transitively dependent on

11
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.380
every candidate.

12
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.850
So if we remember that mnemonic it's ever every non-prime and we must provide a fact about the key the

13
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.730
whole key and nothing but the key.

14
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:07.610
So in this case we're talking about the part which is nothing but the key meaning that any non-prime

15
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.610
Ashmit cannot be dependent on the key.

16
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:21.810
Transitively through another non-prime attribute or another just another attribute not in that candidate.

17
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.150
And here one thing we do need to remember about the mnemonic is that and nothing but the key here we're

18
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.060
talking about one key but really we have to talk about every candidate.

19
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.180
So let's go ahead and see how this works in practice.

20
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:41.560
So now we have to remember that we have two tables so to check that the database conforms a third normal

21
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.470
form you'd have to check both tables.

22
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.640
And that's exactly what we're going to do.

23
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:58.220
So here I'm going to add a comment here check three N.F. and we're going to check the customers table

24
00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.280
first because it's easier.

25
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:09.520
Solex Starr from customers let's run that and they would go so there's our customers table.

26
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:20.730
Let's see if all of the non-prime attributes are non-trans to be dependent on all on the candidate keys.

27
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.150
All right so as we discussed we only have one candidate key here which is the customer ID and we already

28
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.740
know that this table is second.

29
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.480
Norm is in the second normal form.

30
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.200
This is our only candidate key and we therefore this is our only prime attribute.

31
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.870
And these are our non-prime attributes.

32
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:50.130
So now we need to check that each of these non-prime attributes indeed depends on the customer ID field

33
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.570
or the candidate.

34
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.550
Here we followed a transitive dependencies across other fields.

35
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.790
Right.

36
00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.370
So let's get started.

37
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.890
First name does the first name depend on the customer ID directly or maybe through some other field.

38
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.440
So it depends on the customer ID direct.

39
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.690
Right.

40
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:13.100
So first name is not dependent on surname isn't dependent on state does not dependent on surname the

41
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.500
surname depend directly on the customer.

42
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:22.380
Correct so surname is independent of first name first name and certain amount not tied up so a person

43
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:29.620
can have any surname with any first name surname is not dependent on the state on the oil.

44
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.390
Discount So that's independent shipping shipping shipping state is shipping state dependent on first

45
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:45.060
name and the way to think about it is if if the first name can the first name change and the shipping

46
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.720
state will the shipping said have to change as well.

47
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.260
So basically does the shipping change.

48
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.230
Is there some sort of relationship between the two.

49
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.340
No there actually isn't a person of a name can be in any state.

50
00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.180
Same thing for surname and same thing.

51
00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.050
The shipping state does not depend on the oil to discount.

52
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.410
Basically it just depends on the customer ID.

53
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.040
Finally a little to discount.

54
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.500
Does it depend on the first name.

55
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.360
No.

56
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:16.000
A person with any name could have and your loyalty discount surname same thing with shipping state.

57
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:22.260
It's a bit interesting because the answer is again no it doesn't depend because the loyalty discount

58
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:29.400
is accumulated by a customer through their purchases through their history through a transaction through

59
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.610
how long they've been purchasing through this online store and so on.

60
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.470
So that's how they get the loyalty discount.

61
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:41.400
But let's say in a different scenario if you instead of loyalty discount you had a state wide discount.

62
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.200
So for every different state there would be a different state the different discount that would be applied

63
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.010
to all the purchases made by customers from that state.

64
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:58.470
For example the reason could be that states have different taxing schemes and therefore the store can

65
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.800
offer customers different discounts because they have to pay they themselves have to pay different taxes

66
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.910
different levels of taxes in different states something like that so there could be a reason for that.

67
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:17.990
And if you had a situation like that where this was a statewide discount in that case the city the logic

68
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.600
would be different.

69
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.870
Right.

70
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.670
In that case you would say yes the state wide discount doesn't depend on a first name doesn't depend

71
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.780
on surname but it does depend on state.

72
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:32.250
So even though it's the state wide discount is a characteristic of the customer.

73
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.520
Right.

74
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:39.810
So it's it's assigned to the customer it's knowing you can for every customer I.D. You have a certain

75
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:47.520
statewide discount but really it is trans. it would have been transitively dependent through the shipping

76
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.540
State field because then you would you wouldn't be able to say that.

77
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:57.870
OK so if Colorado has 8 percent statewide discount and can we if we change the state.

78
00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.050
Will the discounts change and normally we expect the answer to be.

79
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.020
No that's it these are independent and therefore one of them changes this one doesn't have to change.

80
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:14.330
But in that case if you change the state and you get a statewide discount then indeed the statewide

81
00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.540
discount would change as well and that would mean that's an example of the transit of dependency.

82
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.300
And so in that case you would have to split out this column into a separate table and make sense right.

83
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.440
So if you have a state wide discount you should have a table where you have all the 50 states of the

84
00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.460
US and the discounts applicable to those states.

85
00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:37.990
You shouldn't be replicating the statewide discount 942 times for every single customer.

86
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:42.020
That's kind of the essence of the third normal form why we're doing it.

87
00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.420
But in this case it's a bit it's all a much more trivial.

88
00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:49.860
We've got the customer ID and as we discussed because this is not a state wide This comes just the loyalty

89
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:58.590
discount on each one of these fields is dependent on the candidate the non transitively.

90
00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:07.250
So therefore this table is in third normal form so we can say three NF confirmed.

91
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.720
OK so that's good.

92
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.950
We don't have to adjust this table.

93
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:19.850
Now let's have a look at the other table that we have which is so Nexstar from transactions.

94
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.880
All right let's check this table.

95
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.750
This is the fun stuff OK.

96
00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.940
We're going to make some space.

97
00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:40.990
And by the way we've just had a very heated discussion about a heated monologue by Carol about the customers

98
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:41.590
table.

99
00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:49.510
So if if you feel comfortable now after this theoretical tutorials and after what we how we analysed

100
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:55.060
the customers table if you feel comfortable giving this a go on your own then I highly encourage you

101
00:07:55.060 --> 00:08:04.750
to pause this video right now and check if the transactions table if this table is does conform to the

102
00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.350
third normal form check.

103
00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:11.440
If it does or not and make your conclusion on that and then just play the video again or you continue

104
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:17.710
playing the video and see how I would see how I'm going to go about that logic and that there'll be

105
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:19.980
some very good practice.

106
00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.420
So if you want to do that then post the video now.

107
00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:25.920
Otherwise we're going to continue analyzing this table.

108
00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:26.340
All right.

109
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:32.110
So let's go we've got transaction ID which we know is the candidate key in the stable.

110
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:38.110
We also know that we have got timestamp in seconds and customer id they are also candidate keys in this

111
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:38.780
table.

112
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:50.880
And then we've got item which is the item ID which basically is the code for the item that was purchased.

113
00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:56.310
The description of the item and the retail price of that item.

114
00:08:56.570 --> 00:09:01.580
And so the customer we've already modified this table we remove the customer fields and now if we want

115
00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:07.520
to get information about the customer we just join join this table to the customers table based on this

116
00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:08.800
customer id field.

117
00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:14.150
So now the question is is are there any transitive dependencies in this table.

118
00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:19.340
And the way to think about it is first of all we have to find the non-prime attributes.

119
00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:24.600
Right so we know that these are our primary views because they are parts of at least one candidate key.

120
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:32.380
And these are are known non-prime attributes because they are not parts of they're not part of any candidate.

121
00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:38.210
And the question we have to ask is for every single one of these non-prime attributes what we need to

122
00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:46.330
check is is it non transitively dependent on every candidate key.

123
00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:46.770
Right.

124
00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:50.420
So let's go ahead and start start figuring this out.

125
00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:50.880
All right.

126
00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:53.530
So the Sarraf item is swordfights him.

127
00:09:53.560 --> 00:10:05.540
And let's start with transaction ID so item the person somebody's purchase an item with this code is

128
00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:13.130
it directly dependent on the transaction ID or is it dependent on the transaction ID through through

129
00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:19.760
some other field so it doesn't have to be just the non prime attributes it could be.

130
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.410
Is it somehow dependent through these fields as well.

131
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:28.200
Right so basically what we want to check is it directly dependent on this specific candidate.

132
00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:31.350
So item item code.

133
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:35.440
So basically for this item if could it could.

134
00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.330
Let's start with timestamp in seconds.

135
00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:42.410
Could the timestamp and seconds change if the Times happened check the seconds changes.

136
00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.610
Does this item have to change.

137
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:47.330
No it doesn't because this item could have been bought at any point in time.

138
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.670
What if the customer changes.

139
00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.260
Does this item have to change this item number.

140
00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:57.800
No it doesn't because any customer ID could have bought any item if the description changes.

141
00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:01.060
Does the item have to change.

142
00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:08.030
This is a this is a tricky one because indeed if the description changes right then the item probably

143
00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:10.400
will change because items have the description.

144
00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.620
But the question is here is like the chicken and egg question.

145
00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:14.040
Who who came first.

146
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:19.790
Well we're going to assume that item as is beef out of these two.

147
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:20.060
Right.

148
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:27.420
So item we're going to take item as the main column or the more important column right.

149
00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:32.080
So basically we're not going to say that item is dependent on description we're going to say descriptions

150
00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:37.230
appendant items so for us items just dependent on the transaction ID in the case of these two.

151
00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:38.720
And for retail price same thing.

152
00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:43.670
So we're not going to say that item is depend on the retail price items the transaction or the retail

153
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:49.400
prices depend on the item and it's just the way you think about it like it is logical right.

154
00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:58.020
That price is dependent on item so item dictates the price and item the item code dictates the description.

155
00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:01.730
So that's that's the approach we're going to take here.

156
00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:07.790
There are sometimes like you could come across a situation where it's a bit vague like say you could

157
00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:10.790
use description as the main out of these three.

158
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:11.800
And you know stick with that.

159
00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:18.820
But in this case it's quite obvious that that item is the main one because it's a number it's a code

160
00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:24.100
and it's much easier to deal with codes as the foreign key in our case.

161
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:24.620
Right.

162
00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.680
Wolf what we're trying to achieve.

163
00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:32.450
So we're going to say that item is non transitively dependent on the transaction ID.

164
00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:38.810
It's so transaction id identifies item directly rather than through description or through each retail

165
00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:40.390
price which makes sense.

166
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.630
Then we'll move on to description.

167
00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:42.970
Right.

168
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:49.040
Or basically we have to check item we have to check the same thing for item but with with this foreign

169
00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:49.220
key.

170
00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:49.450
Right.

171
00:12:49.490 --> 00:13:00.070
So timestamp seconds on customer ID is that is item dependent on this forum on this candidate key is

172
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:02.450
item depend on this kind of key direct.

173
00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.310
Right so or is it transitively dependent through transaction ID.

174
00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:12.380
Well actually no because once you know the timestamp of seconds and customer ID you don't really need

175
00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:16.820
to know the transaction ID to understand what items purchased at that point in time by that customer

176
00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:19.520
because it is this is a candidate key.

177
00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:22.080
Then is item dependent on this candidate.

178
00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:27.940
Q Through description same thing same discussion as we just had with the transaction ID situation so

179
00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:36.080
we are going to take item as the out of these three being the one that is independent or that is directly

180
00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.890
dependent on the candidate.

181
00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:40.980
Next we move onto the description.

182
00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.380
Right so here we've got a description.

183
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:48.410
Question is is description directly dependent on this candidate.

184
00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:49.800
Q transaction ID.

185
00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:56.360
Well the answer is no because description actually depends on item which depends on transaction ID.

186
00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:56.950
Right.

187
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:04.380
So what that means is basically if we have pillowcase here what if the item number changes we'll pillowcase

188
00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:05.150
have to change.

189
00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:05.940
Yes indeed.

190
00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:10.720
Pillow case will have to change because they are linked.

191
00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:18.240
There's a link between this item dictates what the description is and therefore description.

192
00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:25.040
Even though the transaction ID indeed is associated or there's a certain description associated with

193
00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:29.930
the transaction ID or with this combination of these two calls because something was purchased.

194
00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:37.850
It has a description but in reality that description is transitive the dependent on this kind of ticket

195
00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:41.840
on is transmitted to depend on this candidate key as well through the item.

196
00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.100
Same thing for retail price.

197
00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:49.910
So retail price even though yes indeed this transaction has a retail price associated with it.

198
00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:52.700
This transaction defended by the central election.

199
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.630
But if you look at it through this candidate key.

200
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:58.210
Yes indeed it has a retail price associated with it.

201
00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:05.060
But this retail price is not directly doesn't directly come from this candid keyboard.

202
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:10.180
And as a matter of the matter as a matter of fact is income very good for this candidate either.

203
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:15.470
It comes from the item and that's exactly what the third normal form is looking for it's looking for

204
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:20.060
situations where you've got part of the table that needs to be separated out.

205
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:26.490
So basically we see here that we need to take these three columns and put them into a separate table

206
00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:34.610
and then also just keep item in the stable and that will be our way that we will look up information

207
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:36.080
about the item if we need to.

208
00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:43.220
So basically if you just take your hand and you cover off this part these last two columns This is the

209
00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:48.750
final table that you should have and third normal form of transaction id timestamp seconds.

210
00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:56.810
Customer ID and item number are the item ID and that this information shouldn't be in this table because

211
00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:58.120
we're actually duplicating it right.

212
00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:06.110
So we're actually there's no point in us saving the item id the description and the retail price when

213
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:08.730
we can have these in a separate lookup table.

214
00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:13.160
And then when we ever need that information we'll just join to it.

215
00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:21.410
So there we go that's how we think about the third normal form and how we check or investigate if a

216
00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:23.090
table is in in third normal.

217
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:28.250
For me it is a real investigation like it's I think it's valid to use the word investigation because

218
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:34.580
it does take some time and does take some thinking but that is why there is a whole separate professional

219
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:39.060
database architects or database engineers database designers.

220
00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:46.970
There's these professions exist for a reason because it requires a lot of mental power to cause a lot

221
00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:52.260
of time it requires a lot of expertise and experience to design a good database.

222
00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:58.430
And what we're doing here is we're actually understanding the thinking process that goes into it and

223
00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:02.890
that will really help us when we are working with these databases.

224
00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:06.500
We'll know what thinking went into it.

225
00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:14.720
So that's how we investigate in the next tutorial we'll learn how to modify this database to change

226
00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:18.420
the design to conform to the third normal form.

227
00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.240
And I look forward See you then.

228
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.040
Until next I'm happy analyzing.
