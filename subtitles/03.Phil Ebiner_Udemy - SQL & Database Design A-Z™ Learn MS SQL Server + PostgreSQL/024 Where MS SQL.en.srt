00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,120
Hello and welcome back as you can see I'm working in Microsoft as kill Server Management Studio.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,510
I have my database consumer complaints loaded up inside of it.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,030
We have consumer complaints table which has a lot of different columns ready to go.

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:19,240
So first things first let's try on a new query in which will say select all.

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,820
So select all from consumer complaints.

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:30,720
Again just use the down arrow enter and exit it as you can see we get sixty five thousand five hundred

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,840
rows of data.

8
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,600
That's an absurd amount of data to be working with as a data analyst.

9
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:44,730
As a scientist you will not be able to get any insight even from just one column consisting of sixty

10
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:50,430
five thousand rows of data just insane just the amount of time you'll have to spend going for it without

11
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,330
remembering it.

12
00:00:51,330 --> 00:01:00,040
Make sure you've put in every row of data correctly memorized it and then hopefully get some insight.

13
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,440
It's just insane.

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,140
You will not get anything from it.

15
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:09,120
What do you need to do in order to get any inside's any good results from working with data is you need

16
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,740
to narrow it down to only the data that you need to work with.

17
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:19,700
That will be of a small amount and that will actually be necessary for you.

18
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,460
So of course select statement by itself does nothing in order to achieve that.

19
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:33,270
This is why and as you well we have a where so the shindigs behind us is as follows.

20
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:40,170
We have select all from consumer complaints and then we say where also where it can go in any other

21
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,040
statements.

22
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,710
For example if you don't want to display anything and you will not have select here still where just

23
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,840
goes after something is performed because first you need to state what you need to perform.

24
00:01:51,840 --> 00:02:01,170
Is it a data manipulation getting read of data or showing it to the user and but only after you state

25
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,850
what you are doing with this data.

26
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:06,300
You need to put a rule in it and that's where does exactly that.

27
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:14,250
It puts a rule on this data so only the data that succeeds this rule that satisfies this rule can go

28
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,790
through and be worth them.

29
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,880
In our case let's start with something simple and take a look at all of this columns and I think the

30
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,160
easiest one is stating because we're working with data from America.

31
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,070
This all came from American real world data as you know.

32
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:36,360
There are a lot of different states and they are represented in this table by unique identifier of combination

33
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,640
of two capital letters.

34
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,530
In our case let's say what you want to do is I want to select everything.

35
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,000
Or rather not a Rifi.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:54,690
I just want to select the product name and I want to select the issue that the product has from this

37
00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:01,700
table from consumer complaints where the state that they came from there was state that the product

38
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,270
came from.

39
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:09,530
Is New York so in here we put in state name because we need to put constraint we need to put a rule

40
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:16,960
on the state name and then we need to say equals because it has to be exactly New York.

41
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:23,660
It cannot be NJ because that will be New Jersey a completely different state it has to be exactly and

42
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:24,350
why.

43
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,810
So as you can see right here.

44
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:35,710
So because it's the type of state name is Wotcher it's not integer it's not that it's text.

45
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:41,270
Basically text type what do we need to do is we need to put it in apostrophes and then just type it

46
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:41,990
in like this.

47
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:49,120
As you can see it's highlighted in a different color red means text blue means functions and black.

48
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,860
This means nothing basically.

49
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:56,960
Most of the time it will be your columns your tables your databases.

50
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,840
So now let's execute it and see what that gives us.

51
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:09,500
As you can see it returned tells only 4400 rows which is way better than working with sixty five thousand

52
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,150
rows.

53
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,150
But what happened behind the scenes.

54
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:15,420
If we want to see that and I'm sure we want to see that.

55
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:21,770
Just make sure that you put in stage name into select statement and here you can see that all of this

56
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,380
products all of these issues come from the New York State.

57
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,850
So that was pretty interesting wasn't it.

58
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:33,310
Now let's just quickly change ahead and just change this to New Jersey.

59
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:40,490
Run it now we only have two thousand five hundred DROs of data and now all of them come from the state

60
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,770
of New Jersey.

61
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:47,710
As you can see where is another pretty much not a fundamental function of a skew.

62
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:55,040
Because on one hand you do want to be displaying all of the data and then you need to always specify

63
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,150
where you're working with the data from where it comes from.

64
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:05,000
But most of the time if not all the time what you want to be doing is you want to be narrowing it down

65
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,070
or showing only the specific data.

66
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,370
So in our case let's practice again.

67
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,500
Let's go ahead and change this.

68
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:22,140
Let's actually create a query which will say select all from consumer complaints press Enter execute

69
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,330
it and in our case here let's think about this as a Pasch from your employer.

70
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:36,770
So what they want to know is they want to know what complaints war received by the companies on the

71
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,720
same day that they were sent.

72
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:45,890
So in our case what you need to do right is first you need to identify key elements of this query that

73
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,000
you'll be running.

74
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,360
Obviously the first one will be complaint.

75
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,380
So let's go ahead through this.

76
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,580
Results like this table and look for complaints.

77
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,530
You can also do it in the column menu.

78
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:02,200
So inside of here we can see that there is complaints right here.

79
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:08,340
Consumer complaint Meredith and then we also have a deal.

80
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,260
So we will be working with one of them or maybe both.

81
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,150
What else do we have to be working with.

82
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,040
Well we have to be working with.

83
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:19,090
They sent and they received.

84
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,520
So here is they received.

85
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,810
And here as they sent.

86
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,660
So let's go ahead instead of a star.

87
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,200
Start putting them all in here.

88
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:41,100
So when they receive one they send I want an plain a D and that one consumer complaint narrative.

89
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,210
So it's right here.

90
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,680
So now if it's like this we can get a bit better understanding of the task.

91
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,450
As you can see consumer complaint narrative is almost always empty it's almost always now.

92
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:59,190
And just it doesn't work for us.

93
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,050
For this task we don't need it.

94
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,910
So we can immediately go ahead delete it.

95
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,980
Make sure you delete the comma as well.

96
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:12,820
Now we have free of these key elements to work with and which ones or other what do we do now.

97
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:18,450
As you can see we still have sixty five and a half thousand rows of data.

98
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,950
What do we do now since we have to narrow it down.

99
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,520
We need to use a WHERE function.

100
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,090
In our case what the employer wants to see is all the complaints that they were sent on the same day

101
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,440
they were received.

102
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:41,600
So what we have to do is we just have to copy this into here put an equal sign and just copy this into

103
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,020
here.

104
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,150
As easy as that.

105
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:49,230
So basically what we're saying here and if we run it you can understand it a bit better.

106
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:56,960
We're saying that like these free columns from consumer complaints table where they've received equals.

107
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:03,750
They sent so they've received has to be exactly the same as they sent in our case it works.

108
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:07,430
As you can see we have only 28000 rows of data left.

109
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:11,850
Still a very big amount of data but way way better.

110
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:18,740
Now another thing that I just want to show you right now is instead of doing all of this what you would

111
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:25,310
present to your employee select count complaint 80 pro-consumer complaints were data received equals

112
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:33,200
they sent a very nice consigns query that it gives you it gives you the number of complaints that were

113
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,470
sent on the same date they were received.

114
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:41,810
Of course as you saw previously we can see that number right here and it is the same number that we're

115
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:47,450
seeing now but calland function just basically count the number of rows that the query would initially

116
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:52,130
display do and displays that number instead of older rows of data.

117
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,950
So don't worry about it for an hour too much.

118
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,320
We'll we'll learn about that later in the course.

119
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,600
It's a very interesting function and has a lot of other aggregate functions alongside it.

120
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:09,320
But for now just remember where function is extremely powerful and that's one of the most fundamental

121
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,550
functions in the school.

122
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:20,690
So where data received equals data sent or where state name equals New York or where they send is less

123
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,590
than 2012.

124
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:30,090
There are just countless ways of using where function and most of the time in as well.

125
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:37,310
Working with SECU all working with this key elements identifying what the put in the where function

126
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,520
will determine your success.

127
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:45,140
I hope you learned a lot in this lecture and slowly start to get familiar with different functions and

128
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:50,360
feel good about them and I hope you enjoy this lecture and I'll see you in the next one.
