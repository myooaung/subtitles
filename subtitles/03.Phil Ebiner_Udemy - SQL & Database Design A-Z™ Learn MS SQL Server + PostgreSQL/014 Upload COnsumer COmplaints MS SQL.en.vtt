00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.010
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:03.480
Day we'll be working with Microsoft.

3
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.180
Ask your server and we're going to be uploading our first dataset into the room management studio.

4
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.180
So in order to do this first of all I need to download the ask your server upload code.

5
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.170
It's a bit different.

6
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.360
So as you can see I have a super day the signs start to go such as call open up and just scroll down

7
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.920
here to Section free.

8
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.840
We have here to challenge it already looked at Bosco's you all upload code and M-S as you all upload.

9
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.010
So I had to know that also going to lower consumer complaints to be vile.

10
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.170
Just in case you haven't done that already I'm going to drag and drop these files to my desktop.

11
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.230
Just wait for his definition of loading.

12
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.830
And now I'm going to open a skills for a Management Studio and continue work from there.

13
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.670
So first I'm going to drag and drop this here.

14
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.320
We can close the browser right now.

15
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.200
We're going to open our skills for management studio.

16
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.660
So

17
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.470
we're just loading up a whole new instance just to make sure we have everything the same.

18
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.040
We're on the new page so here as you can see.

19
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:13.790
You just need to it's like we serve on the connect so select a new server for me it's this Mac Asgill

20
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:14.630
Express.

21
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.130
Don't worry about this weird symbol.

22
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.260
Just my system doesn't recognize slashes.

23
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.470
For some reason so.

24
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.420
Go ahead click connect.

25
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.910
Now this window pops up.

26
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.590
So Microsoft the SQL Server Management Studio is open up.

27
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.600
The first thing you want to do is check if you have any databases.

28
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.150
So if it's a clean version of Microsoft Asgill surmisal studio you should not have anything here and

29
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.560
this is the case with me.

30
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:44.690
So what I want to do is right click right here and select new database so this window now opens up in

31
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.720
which all I'm going to do is just change the database name for our first dataset.

32
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:58.610
It will be called consumer complaints so this is exactly what I'm going to call my database so you can

33
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.320
put underscores here you can write them as one word you can write them and all small letters or all

34
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.070
caps letters.

35
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.190
It's up to you for databases.

36
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.440
I just prefer to put them as separate words beginning with capital letters.

37
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.700
So here we'll just going to leave everything by default click OK as you can see it's executing and now

38
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.120
it's done.

39
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.880
So now we have consumer complaints database here we have zero tables so it has no data in it and that's

40
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.640
again absolutely fine.

41
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:25.730
So go ahead.

42
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:33.290
Open our consumer complaints the CCV file but instead of opening up through Excel we're just going to

43
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.040
open it up right here and ask kills her management to do it.

44
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.820
We're going to load it up into this out of ACE as a table and work it from there.

45
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.370
So all I need to do right here is I can right click on consumer complaints so I get this right click

46
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.810
here.

47
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.970
Go to tasks and go to the very bottom of the dropdown menu and select import data.

48
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.410
And you wonder will pop up just basically say next here and now for the data source.

49
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:05.620
This is important because we're working with not Microsoft Excel but see CSFB file.

50
00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.980
I'm going to select flat file source.

51
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.220
Now give it a second this window now loads up in here.

52
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.800
Just go browse for me.

53
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.250
The file is on my desktop.

54
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.120
I just need to change this to a city.

55
00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.740
Here it is.

56
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.550
Consumer complaints that Asadi.

57
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.220
Then they click Open AALA kill.

58
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.480
Just leave it in English code page live in Adelaide and it's a good form of limited now decs qualify

59
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:36.800
it's very important because SCV stands for a comma separated meaning that right now Microsoft will get

60
00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:43.440
all the values from the table that Sivi they will and it will make sure that every columns and that

61
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.130
when it sees a comma.

62
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.960
But what happens if inside the text we have a comma.

63
00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.700
For example we have green Colma rad grome come up blue.

64
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.350
This is why I would put Tex qualify.

65
00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:01.120
It means that everything inside everything inside the text symbol is text.

66
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.950
So just remember it is pretty important especially for this file.

67
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.270
We're going to be working with today.

68
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.850
Hetero.

69
00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.090
Just leave it like this.

70
00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.080
Column names in the first data row.

71
00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.900
Make sure to click an ad because in our database right here we're just exported from Excel.

72
00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.350
You can see that the columns will be automatically picked up the names for and everything looks correctly.

73
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.030
So here you can just scroll down.

74
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.230
Make sure that all the data looks pretty good.

75
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.950
Everything looks good to me.

76
00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.700
We have all the columns name properly all of them organized neatly clicked advanced.

77
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:36.080
This is a pretty important step in here we can individually click on every one of them and change the

78
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.800
data type and call delimit and take the fight and so forth.

79
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.740
We're just going to shift select all of them and change the output column to fight.

80
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:52.580
So we're just putting it to 5000 just in case we have an insanely large column and then send the large

81
00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.690
cell in one of these columns.

82
00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:55.790
We don't need to do anything.

83
00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.290
It's already set so we just can check out all of them are set up to 5000.

84
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.140
So now we can preview it again.

85
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.750
Everything makes sense everything looks beautiful.

86
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.690
Well go ahead click next.

87
00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:12.650
In here the destination because are working with Microsoft server.

88
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.170
Ask your server when you dislike this one Microsoft.

89
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:20.110
Only the provider for rescue and server like this one server name.

90
00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.110
I make sure to keep it the one that's opened right here an object Explorer the one that you loaded that

91
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.860
your Microsoft skills sort of management studio into.

92
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.810
Then you can use it as Jolter and a patient.

93
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.180
Or if it's your personal computer you can use your Windows affiliation.

94
00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:36.390
Fellows go ahead.

95
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:37.440
Click next.

96
00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.400
It will just take a tiny bit of time in here.

97
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.740
Just double click this destination where you can say roll.

98
00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.730
And the reason we call this a raw consumer complaints table.

99
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.040
I will explain in a second.

100
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.220
So let's click next run immediately next.

101
00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.020
Finish.

102
00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.310
Wait for it exited.

103
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.050
As you can see it exit kids in a matter of seconds.

104
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:04.060
It takes very little time to process this whole large sixty five thousand rows of data a thing and turn

105
00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.530
them into a table inside the Eskew all.

106
00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:14.280
So Microsoft Asgill server is definitely a very quick software and it's very nice to have that if somebody

107
00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:20.790
worked with gray in the squares you can already see the difference because there it took a very long

108
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:28.200
time to import the data and just to work with data in general so as you can see now it took a little

109
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.710
while.

110
00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:29.550
Everything is finished.

111
00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.510
Sixty five thousand four hundred ninety nine rows transferred.

112
00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:33.950
Let's click close.

113
00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.880
You won't see anything here just because you need to click refresh right click anywhere click refresh

114
00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.430
now we see a new table here.

115
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.090
Let's go ahead.

116
00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:42.030
Right click on it.

117
00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:46.440
Select tough and Rose and you see that data inside of there is correct.

118
00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.110
So don't worry about the code now you'll learn it a bit later.

119
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.540
Just make sure you see old table nice and neatly.

120
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.870
It looks right and at this point we can already work with it.

121
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.250
But I like to take a step more and prep the data a bit better.

122
00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:06.440
So in order to do this now we need to pull up that upload code word document.

123
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.970
So let's open it up and see what's inside.

124
00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.580
So make sure we have the preview enabled.

125
00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:15.550
Or rather editing and able.

126
00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.930
And inside of here you see this nice neat little piece of code.

127
00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:24.040
So make sure to copy Control-C then we can close this file inside of here.

128
00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:27.680
Put new Querrey or you can just substitute this text.

129
00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:32.250
So copy this text into here let's make sure everything's correct.

130
00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.610
So what it does.

131
00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:36.240
Basically we're using this database.

132
00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.520
Consumer complaints looks good so far.

133
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:44.440
We're creating a new table this called consumer complaints not raw consumer complaints and that we're

134
00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.370
saying that we're inserting into consumer complaints.

135
00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:53.960
So the biggest problem you might have right here in upload code is that if you named your table anything

136
00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:58.360
different to what I've named that you you will have an issue.

137
00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:59.300
So what you need to do.

138
00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.830
Delete this and just drag and drop this here.

139
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:08.010
So just drag and drop your role table that we've just created for Microsoft skills or a management studio

140
00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.690
and right just click execute.

141
00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:12.630
Let's see what it tells us.

142
00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.510
Just merge us a bit.

143
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:18.390
As you can see all the sixty five thousand rows affected everything is on right.

144
00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.420
And if we just refresh this we can see two tables.

145
00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:28.830
Now what is the benefit of doing this is because as you can see we narrowed down a lot of different

146
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:38.150
columns to a certain width so that they will take less space and they will run even more efficient.

147
00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:43.500
So now that we have this it's your choice what do you want to delete this raw table or not.

148
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:48.210
It's a good idea to keep a backup to keep it up there in case something happens to the database to the

149
00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:49.740
table you're working with.

150
00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.300
In my case I wanted to show you how it's done.

151
00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.950
All you need to do right click on it.

152
00:08:54.030 --> 00:09:00.430
Delete this new window will pop up in which all you have to do is say OK don't delete it.

153
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:02.640
As you can see it immediately refreshes itself.

154
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.710
So everything is nice here.

155
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:06.790
We're ready to work with this table now.

156
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:08.550
And I'm very excited about it.

157
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.790
I'm hope you're excited about it too.

158
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:14.630
I hope you enjoy today's lecture and I'll see you in the next one.
