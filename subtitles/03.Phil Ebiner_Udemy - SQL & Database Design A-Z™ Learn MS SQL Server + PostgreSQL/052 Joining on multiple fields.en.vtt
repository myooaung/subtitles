Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.700
Today we'll be talking about joining on multiple fields to start off of this tutorial.

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.580
I will show you an example when it is necessary to join on multiple fields and I will show you what

4
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.400
happens when you accidentally forget about joining on multiple fields.

5
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.900
And finally we will look at how we can rectify this situation and actually in fact join on several fields

6
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.110
to get the right result.

7
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.580
So let's get straight into it.

8
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.400
Here we've got two tables table and table B Table A lists the orders that were conducted in our two

9
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.850
stores which are north and south as you can see we had two orders in the north store order number one

10
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.390
and Order Number two.

11
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.720
And in the south store we had only order number one.

12
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.890
And also it lists the customers Mike Jack and Susan.

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.310
Table B lists the itemized description of those orders.

14
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.160
So we've also got the store location we've got the order number and we've got the item within that order

15
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.230
and the sale made on that item.

16
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.560
So here you can see right away that order number one in the Norton store had two items sold a laptop

17
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.120
and a month's order number two had one item which was the monitor and Order Number one in the south

18
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.840
and store had only one item which was a camera.

19
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.800
So now we want to connect the two tables.

20
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:28.110
And basically what we're after is we want to see how the sales that were made for each of the customers

21
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.940
the total sales for each of the customers.

22
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.210
So visually you can see right away how that works.

23
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.520
But let's see how we can do it through joint.

24
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.020
So if we were to go ahead and do a left join.

25
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.160
So basically we wanted to attach the table in the right to the table the left and if we were to just

26
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.020
do a normal left join using one field we would try to join on order number.

27
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.570
So here if we want to match order number in the lift table to the right table it all looks like this

28
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.880
order number one will be matched to order number one in the first draw of the right table in the second

29
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.700
row and in the fourth row.

30
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.710
And as we can see that's already incorrect because we're matching order number one from the northern

31
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.320
store to order number one from the south and store.

32
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.400
By this third match.

33
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.530
But let's let's see what happens further down.

34
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.770
So now if now Order Number two from the northern store will be matched toward Number two that's because

35
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.560
there's only one order number two in both of those tables.

36
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.210
And then order number one from the south and will actually be matched to three rows in the second table

37
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.560
which are Order Number one Ordon from the northern store.

38
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.370
Then the second item from Order Number one unknown store.

39
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.170
And finally the only item from or number one in the southern store.

40
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.670
So in total the resultant table will look like this.

41
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:58.780
We will have three rows for North or one one row for North order number two and three rows for south.

42
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.300
Order number one.

43
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.600
And as you can see this is a mistake there's an error because this highly inflates our sales.

44
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.660
It looks like we've sold two laptops it looks like we're sold to mice and two cameras whereas in fact

45
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:13.860
that's not true.

46
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.900
So joining on a single field here can lead to incorrect results.

47
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.580
So let's see how we can fix that what we need to do.

48
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:29.340
And this you can see naturally from these tables is we have to include information about the store in

49
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.440
our joint so we know that the order numbers are unique for each store.

50
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.800
And so therefore if we include the store now join then we will avoid this whole problem.

51
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.200
So let's see how that works.

52
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.490
At the on the top left here in circled in red you can see that we're joining on order number from Table

53
00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.790
A equals order number from table beat and store from Table 8 equals store from table B.

54
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.840
Let's see how this works.

55
00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:05.350
In fact here we've got the North order number one being matched to two rows in the second table.

56
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.650
So North order number one which is the laptop and north or to number 1 which is the mass and that's

57
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:17.880
correct next door to number two from the northern store is matched to only one row in the second table

58
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.040
which is the monitor for the north and Order Number two which is also correct.

59
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:29.620
And finally the solid number one order is matched to only one row in the second table because there's

60
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.790
only one row that contains both the words South and the number one for the order.

61
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.640
And that is the camera for that Susan.

62
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:44.490
So now if we perform that join then the final resulting table will look like this.

63
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:52.230
And as you can see here the one row in the table on the left was duplicated to match the quantity of

64
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.690
items which was two items bought by Mike.

65
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.890
And so in total you can see that this time we've got the correct result.

66
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.360
We can also assess how much each customer has bought.

67
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.190
And there are no mistakes because of an incorrect turn.

68
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.740
So that was a good example of how to use joins in multiple fields.

69
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.190
And more importantly why you need to do that in certain cases to avoid errors.

70
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.600
I hope you enjoyed today's tutorial and I look forward to seeing you next time.
