00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,010
Hello and welcome to the course on databases and today Sterle are going to upload our data sets into

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,900
Microsoft Eskil server.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,350
So the first thing we need is a browser and browser.

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:19,410
Let's go to WW does super size dot com slash S Q L and here if you scroll down to Section 7 you will

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,960
see a link called Section 7 MSU all upload code.

6
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,630
So go ahead and download that.

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:32,710
And once you download it what it looks like is this so this is a Word document with some code in it

8
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,480
and we will use this file for the trial.

9
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:42,510
We'll use this file to convert the raw data that will upload into Microsoft the SQL Server into actual

10
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,720
working tables.

11
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,410
But as a first step would we need to do is actually upload actual data.

12
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:49,890
So let's go ahead and do that.

13
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:56,000
We've already downloaded the CSP files previously and now we need to upload them into skills or management

14
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:56,770
studio.

15
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:04,540
So let's Right-Click databases create a new database we're going to call it pets and into pets we want

16
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:09,510
to see if we open it up here you'll see that it doesn't have any tables it's completely empty.

17
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:16,520
So what do we do and what we want to do is we want to right click the database select tasks and select

18
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:17,860
import data.

19
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:22,250
Now this will bring up the skills server import export wizard.

20
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,510
Click next.

21
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:30,050
Our data source is a flat file source browse to find the location of your downloaded CSFB files.

22
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:33,590
Select the drop down change to see S V and the start of.

23
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:38,150
This is golf pedicle least a start from the top owners table.

24
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:43,430
Now we don't need to change anything here the only thing we definitely need to change is the text qualifier.

25
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:51,710
This should be a colon so a quotation mark is not not a colon this is a quotation marks so not two separate

26
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:55,800
quotes but one symbol which is a quotation mark just one symbol.

27
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,050
Everything else should say the same.

28
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:02,450
Make sure this box is checked called names in the first row is checked.

29
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,700
Go to columns.

30
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,360
Have a look here that is.

31
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,830
There's no errors.

32
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:14,400
Go to advanced select everything change it from 50 to 5000 So everything fits and we're uploading it

33
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,300
all it's text.

34
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,070
That's the safest way to go.

35
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,070
Click preview.

36
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,820
Again check that everything is working nothing's cut off.

37
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,700
Nothing has changed now looks good and that's it.

38
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,910
So go ahead to click next so that's the import part.

39
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,790
Now the destination dropdown.

40
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,940
Change this to Microsoft.

41
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:43,340
All only DB provider for secure server use the same authentication as you had when you installed Microsoft

42
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:47,520
skills or management studio database that's good.

43
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,740
And here in oh in the on the right.

44
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,750
Make sure to change the name of the table.

45
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:58,690
Put an underscore put Rauh underscore before it so we know that this is just raw data.

46
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,460
This is not something we're going to performing our analysis on.

47
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:06,210
This is just a way for us to get the data into the studio in the first place.

48
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,770
So there we go.

49
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,070
Click next run immediately click next and click Finish.

50
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:13,610
There you go.

51
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,140
Everything worked fine.

52
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:22,250
Click close if you refresh tables now you'll see a real table if you select top thousand rows you'll

53
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,970
see exactly what we got from for this challenge.

54
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:34,340
And each one of these columns is can contain up to 5000 symbols so it has enough space it should have

55
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:41,210
enough space to contain our data set and later on we will change it into a working table so we can just

56
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,500
close the script for now.

57
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,610
And now we need to perform the same procedure for the remaining three tables so let's go ahead and do

58
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:47,220
that.

59
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:50,960
Right click paths go to tasks.

60
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:58,830
Import data Wizards next datasource flat file browse.

61
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:05,760
We're going alphabetically such as this V Pats quotation marks single quotation mark.

62
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:14,240
Columns advanced 5000 preview quickly check everything looks good.

63
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,840
Next destination Microsoft.

64
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:24,220
All the DBI for providing for a SQL Server don't need to change anything here.

65
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,910
Put a rule underscore here.

66
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,310
Next run immediately next.

67
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,840
Finish.

68
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,300
All done.

69
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:39,240
Refresh Sallon is fresh Allen.

70
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:43,040
Select two thousand rows looks good.

71
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,110
Close next pets tasks.

72
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,880
Import Hoopes pets.

73
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:49,400
Tasks.

74
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,340
Import data.

75
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,550
You can get good at this.

76
00:04:52,590 --> 00:05:02,680
A couple of practice runs CXXVI procedure is actually a good thing to talk yourself through it because

77
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,970
that way you minimize you reduce the chances of a mistake

78
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,880
otherwise it's easy to forget one of these steps.

79
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,000
Also good to have a checklist of what you need to do.

80
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:19,920
Microsoft all should be providing first class server.

81
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,160
Next is do wrong.

82
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,480
Wait for or underscore procedure details next.

83
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,680
Run immediately.

84
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:31,770
Next.

85
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,470
Finish.

86
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,500
Good.

87
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:40,060
Refresh and procedure details like to tell us.

88
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,280
OK.

89
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:46,810
You actually can select all of them because there is no there are not that many.

90
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:47,930
Oh yeah that's right.

91
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,080
This one this I was thinking of procedural history.

92
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,820
We can do that next one.

93
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,260
All right.

94
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,130
And now pets so do that tasks.

95
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:01,870
Import data wizard next data source.

96
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,900
Flat file source browse.

97
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:13,380
Change to V procedures history quotation mark columns.

98
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,910
Advanced Search.

99
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:20,810
All 5000 preview check everything.

100
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:26,530
Next all the DB provider for a scale server.

101
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:32,370
Good change this to wrong underscore.

102
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:47,380
Next thing good thing good and finish close and refresh procedures history if two thousand or she's

103
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,700
Kinslow more because there's more than Feldon here but not too many.

104
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:56,700
So these girls girls roll 2000 884 excuse crawling.

105
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,690
So looks good everything looks good and that's it.

106
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,670
So we've done the raw import.

107
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,740
Now we need to run that script that we got.

108
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,690
Let's a last step to create those tables.

109
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,020
So let's bring up that script.

110
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,140
There it is.

111
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,440
So just copy everything OK.

112
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,830
And you can run them one by one or you can run the whole thing.

113
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:28,180
I'm just going to run the whole thing execute because 100 rows in the Pets table while this parts of

114
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:33,160
it got created and the data types were specified so you can see like there are smaller N is an integer

115
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,690
than 100 rows were inserted owners.

116
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:41,860
Again the working table owners was created and 89 rows were inserted.

117
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:50,740
Then here we had 41 rows inserted procedure each other in procedure history 2000 84 rows inserted.

118
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,860
And if you refresh you'll see that we've got the row tables and the tables will be going to be working

119
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,470
with the working tables on here.

120
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,180
So there we go.

121
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,820
Import complete.

122
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:08,860
You cannot close this window don't need to save it and voila everything done ready to proceed with this

123
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,020
section.

124
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,430
And I can't wait to see on the next tutorial.

125
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,410
Until then happy analyzing.
