Walk into the database design section of the course we're super excited to share these tutorials with

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.010
you because these are these tutorials that actually make the difference between a great data scientist

3
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.750
and just the data scientists.

4
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.660
The reason is because data science is not only working with data but also understanding how the data

5
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.380
is structured where it's coming from.

6
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.940
How do you connect it how to join it.

7
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.720
When you first encounter a database it is often very confusing because you don't know the structure

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.070
Well if you know normalization then you will know why it is designed in a specific way.

9
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:37.070
And in this section of course we will cover three types of nominals actual talk about first of form

10
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.090
second normal for third or fourth.

11
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.070
So we'll cover all the theory behind them and we'll also talk about the practical application and it

12
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.890
will actually work with very interesting OLTP type of database which will be very exciting.

13
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:50.900
Can't wait to get started.

14
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.510
Let's jump into the first tutorial.
