1
00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.710
In this challenge you will be working as a government agent

2
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.990
in this challenge you will be working for a government agency as a data scientist.

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.580
You have supplied a data set with consumer complaints received by financial institutions in 2013 to

4
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:17.730
2015.

5
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.510
Your darkest uploader data into a database and perform some analysis you need to find how many complaints

6
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.540
were received and sent on the same day.

7
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.860
You need to find all the complaints that were received in states of New York and California.

8
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.300
You need to extract all the rules with the word credit in the product field and you need to extract

9
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.090
all rows with the word late in the issue field.

10
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.970
So as you can see this is a pretty straightforward challenge with a dataset upload it uploaded and then

11
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.220
we perform some basic fundamental queries on it.

12
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.440
So how do we load that dataset.

13
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.320
Well you need to open your web browser for me.

14
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.720
Again google chrome and then you need to input this address in super data science dot com slash ask

15
00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:58.940
you out.

16
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.390
So we followed this up.

17
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.300
This page is loading up.

18
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.570
And as you can see this is SDL and other based a lot practice data page.

19
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.680
So all you need to do you need to scroll down to Section 3.

20
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.170
Here we have the challenge which is a PTF of the PowerPoint that we just went through.

21
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.370
You need to select what rescue will upload code and then you need to like consumer complaints.

22
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.680
A lot of the file that you can load up a zip file and then just extract it on the machine.

23
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.660
So if we go to the data source we can see that all of this data that we will be working with was taking

24
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:38.540
from an official website of the United States government particularly from Consumer Financial Protection

25
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.440
Bureau.

26
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.430
So that's why crazy.

27
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.710
All of the data will be working with is from the real world and all of it exist in real life.

28
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.420
So what other downloads have finished.

29
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.190
Let's go ahead and show them and finder.

30
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.270
So just click here as you can see this is a SCV file and docs.

31
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.380
So just drag them onto the table.

32
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.470
That's what I like to do.

33
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.370
You're free to keep them wherever you want.

34
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.790
So if we open the docs file we will see a bunch of weird code.

35
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.920
So no worry about it right now.

36
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:17.600
And if we open the SUV file we will see database that will contain all the information we need.

37
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.120
So this will be a basic simple Excel spreadsheet that consist of a lot of water a lot of data.

38
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.570
And as you can see if we scroll down we can see that this is all correct that they that is not corrupted

39
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.590
which is very good for us and all the data seems to be in place.

40
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.280
So go ahead cause it for now.

41
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.340
And you have them all and everything and you're ready to upload that which we'll do in next lecture.
