00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,010
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:05,700
Today we will be working with workers.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:11,840
As you can see I have Microsoft skills or a management studio loaded up in a half console game database

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,710
and console games table ready to go as always.

5
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,430
Let's quickly go ahead.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,660
Run select all from console games

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:28,330
Querrey loves executed and so with we see that all of our data is safe and solid.

8
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,180
The table looks nice.

9
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,670
Everything looks neatly organized.

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:42,120
So now if we go ahead and actually before we go any further let's quickly order by game on again know

11
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,310
we don't have to go to Sunday because it goes by default.

12
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:48,470
And now it looks neat indeed.

13
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:54,580
So if we go ahead and take a look at our columns here just looks at this and right.

14
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:59,270
We can see that we have different columns here and they have different data types.

15
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:05,300
So game rank has integer game name as worm type or name as which her genre is worked for a game years

16
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,860
integer and cells are most refloat.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,290
Today we'll be working with March or data type.

18
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:18,230
As you remember with float we can do multiply or divide by or subtraction and adding different float

19
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:23,500
data types columns together before char everything is WAY simpler.

20
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:29,540
Which are basically as well as string data type consists of any number of characters or a specified

21
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,630
number of characters.

22
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:36,700
So it can include letters numbers symbols and is treated as text.

23
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,190
In our case in S Q Not lot of functions.

24
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,960
There's not a lot you can do with Tex.

25
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,460
Just logically thinking about it.

26
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:44,180
What can you do.

27
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:50,960
Maybe you can combine first name and last name to be full name to be.

28
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,300
And you call them called full name.

29
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,370
A still of data type works.

30
00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:00,590
But apart from that there's really not that much you can do and will just quickly go through several

31
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:06,620
functions that you can use with torture to broaden your function.

32
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,050
Pool a bit.

33
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,130
OK so let's get to actually writing this function.

34
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:17,030
Now let's delete order by delete this like all and just go.

35
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:22,370
Select game name is quickly around the Square-D make sure it works perfectly fine.

36
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,780
It gives those 16000 rows of data.

37
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,400
It all seems normal here.

38
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:34,760
Let's put a coma and let's say I just want to for some reason I want to only see the first five letters

39
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:39,350
of every game in which case I need the left.

40
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:44,370
So what we do is I need to write the left put brackets and in brackets.

41
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,890
I want to write what I want.

42
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:52,790
In our case I want to see again the first five letters so I need to specify that that's five letters

43
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,830
of every game.

44
00:02:54,020 --> 00:03:01,340
If we execute this we can see that we have not because you don't have to write this like game name in

45
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,860
here but we are just writing it down to understand how it works.

46
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:09,780
Basically left the operator is very simple.

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,040
What it does it gives Taus first five letters of every game name.

48
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,530
There's really nothing more to it.

49
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,300
And as you can see it includes space.

50
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:25,690
It includes any other symbol such as dash and it can be quite useful sometimes.

51
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:32,650
For example we can see maybe we can compare what letters game start with to them out of sale they have

52
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,860
in different countries.

53
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:41,380
But it's certainly a very specific field of use for this function.

54
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:49,730
It's very difficult to find a really good use of this function so I'll go ahead and run right.

55
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,110
As you already guessed right.

56
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,930
Function gives tours.

57
00:03:53,090 --> 00:04:00,090
The last letters of any column in either case let's increase it to 10 and see what happens.

58
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,910
It will just basically give us a bit more information about each column.

59
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,040
Finally let's go have some fun.

60
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,210
The reverse function in it.

61
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:13,680
We don't need the number input we just need to call them that who traverse.

62
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:21,530
And now you can see total mayhem going on in this new column because it really makes them pretty much

63
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:22,840
unreadable.

64
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:27,950
So these functions are fun not so useful.

65
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:34,300
They can be very useful in very specific cases and that's why it's important to remember that they exist.

66
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,200
So I hope you enjoyed this lecture and I'll see you in the next one.
