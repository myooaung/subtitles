00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:03,741
[MUSIC]
2

2

00:00:03,741  -->  00:00:06,463
Okay, next up we're creating
some user interface,
3

3

00:00:06,463  -->  00:00:10,570
we're creating a Canvas that will sit
over the top of our entire game here.
4

4

00:00:10,570  -->  00:00:15,110
We're adding text for our story, text for
our title and some images just to
5

5

00:00:15,110  -->  00:00:19,310
give our game a little bit of a shape and
to have some backgrounds to our text.
6

6

00:00:19,310  -->  00:00:21,730
So let's dive in and
create some user interface.
7

7

00:00:21,730  -->  00:00:25,390
Let's open up Unity Hub,
click on New to start a new project.
8

8

00:00:25,390  -->  00:00:29,361
I'm going to save mine in the same
location as our previous project we
9

9

00:00:29,361  -->  00:00:31,560
created under Unity 2D text 101.
10

10

00:00:31,560  -->  00:00:36,620
Select Project there,
project name will be Text101.
11

11

00:00:36,620  -->  00:00:39,385
And then under Unity version,
I've recently downloaded a new version, so
12

12

00:00:39,385  -->  00:00:41,773
we're on old version actually,
so I've got two options there.
13

13

00:00:41,773  -->  00:00:46,720
Just stick with my newest, click on 2D for
template and then Create Project.
14

14

00:00:46,720  -->  00:00:47,740
While that is loading,
15

15

00:00:47,740  -->  00:00:50,630
I'll take you through a little bit
about what we're up to in this video.
16

16

00:00:50,630  -->  00:00:54,260
We're talking about user interface,
otherwise known as UI.
17

17

00:00:54,260  -->  00:00:58,630
And specifically, that's referring
to the buttons, the texts, the menus
18

18

00:00:58,630  -->  00:01:04,160
that will appear in our game, usually
over the top of our gameplay itself.
19

19

00:01:04,160  -->  00:01:07,560
And in Unity, the UI,
user interface, lives on the Canvas,
20

20

00:01:07,560  -->  00:01:11,280
all of our UI has to be on the Canvas and
we'll be adding a Canvas in just a moment.
21

21

00:01:11,280  -->  00:01:14,110
The Canvas overlayed
over the top of anything
22

22

00:01:14,110  -->  00:01:18,100
else that's happening within our scene and
therefore within our game.
23

23

00:01:18,100  -->  00:01:22,638
Now back in Unity, now click on Default
just to make sure that our view here looks
24

24

00:01:22,638  -->  00:01:27,108
as the default view, we are going to jump
over into hierarchy and there is one or
25

25

00:01:27,108  -->  00:01:30,323
two ways for us to create
a game object in the hierarchy.
26

26

00:01:30,323  -->  00:01:33,640
We can right-click and click on
one of these options you see here.
27

27

00:01:33,640  -->  00:01:37,550
Or up at the top of our menus
we can click on Game Object,
28

28

00:01:37,550  -->  00:01:39,700
we find the same menu at the top here.
29

29

00:01:39,700  -->  00:01:44,810
So I will click on UI and
then add a Canvas.
30

30

00:01:44,810  -->  00:01:46,900
That brings in a Canvas into our scene.
31

31

00:01:46,900  -->  00:01:48,390
It also brings in an event system.
32

32

00:01:48,390  -->  00:01:51,620
Don't worry about that, that's just some
information to make sure that our Canvas
33

33

00:01:51,620  -->  00:01:53,510
is doing what our Canvas should.
34

34

00:01:53,510  -->  00:01:55,610
We're mostly focused on
our Canvas at the moment.
35

35

00:01:55,610  -->  00:01:58,190
If you double click on the Canvas,
we'll zoom out and
36

36

00:01:58,190  -->  00:02:00,280
we'll see the Canvas in its entirety.
37

37

00:02:00,280  -->  00:02:03,556
Now the main camera is a bit more zoomed
in, and the Canvas is zoomed out,
38

38

00:02:03,556  -->  00:02:04,653
that doesn't matter.
39

39

00:02:04,653  -->  00:02:09,330
What we see on the Canvas is what will
be presented over the top of our game.
40

40

00:02:09,330  -->  00:02:13,655
So it doesn't matter that the size of
the Canvas doesn't match the game,
41

41

00:02:13,655  -->  00:02:15,049
the size of our camera,
42

42

00:02:15,049  -->  00:02:19,190
the Canvas knows to present over
the top of whatever we see in our game.
43

43

00:02:19,190  -->  00:02:23,359
And speaking of which, we'll grab the game
window, drag it over next to our scene so
44

44

00:02:23,359  -->  00:02:25,810
that we can see what's happening here.
45

45

00:02:25,810  -->  00:02:28,850
One thing that we can see is happening,
as we drag our window,
46

46

00:02:28,850  -->  00:02:33,520
you can see the ratio, so
the size of our Canvas is changing.
47

47

00:02:33,520  -->  00:02:36,740
If I make it look very vertical,
then our Canvas is very vertical,
48

48

00:02:36,740  -->  00:02:39,170
matching what we've seen
in our game window here.
49

49

00:02:39,170  -->  00:02:40,830
For now,
I don't wanna play around with that.
50

50

00:02:40,830  -->  00:02:46,530
I don't wanna have that be an issue if we
accidentally got the wrong size layout for
51

51

00:02:46,530  -->  00:02:47,390
our window here.
52

52

00:02:47,390  -->  00:02:50,565
So instead of having free aspect,
and we have free aspect,
53

53

00:02:50,565  -->  00:02:53,231
that means that we can
change the window size, and
54

54

00:02:53,231  -->  00:02:56,301
our Canvas will match whatever
we see in our game window.
55

55

00:02:56,301  -->  00:02:59,923
Instead of that,
I'm going to click on the 1080,
56

56

00:02:59,923  -->  00:03:04,905
which gives a 16:9 ratio, and
that is the look that I want for our game.
57

57

00:03:04,905  -->  00:03:07,341
If you don't see that, you can click
the plus and type in the width and
58

58

00:03:07,341  -->  00:03:09,415
height yourself but for
now I'm gonna click on 1080.
59

59

00:03:09,415  -->  00:03:14,647
That means no matter what,
our game is expecting to be a 1920 by 1080
60

60

00:03:14,647  -->  00:03:20,037
game even if it's scaled down,
it will keep the same aspect ratio.
61

61

00:03:20,037  -->  00:03:23,570
Now, double-click on Canvas again
to get it fully within view,
62

62

00:03:23,570  -->  00:03:27,010
zoom in just a tiny bit,
we're gonna add ourselves some text.
63

63

00:03:27,010  -->  00:03:30,770
So again, over in our hierarchy,
right-click on Canvas or
64

64

00:03:30,770  -->  00:03:34,190
while clicked on Canvas,
come up to this top here to Game Object.
65

65

00:03:34,190  -->  00:03:40,100
I'm gonna right clicking from now on,
so right under UI, we will see text and
66

66

00:03:40,100  -->  00:03:42,810
in there it's pretty tiny at the start,
we'll scroll in a little bit.
67

67

00:03:42,810  -->  00:03:48,040
You can see over while clicked on text
over in our inspector, we scroll down
68

68

00:03:48,040  -->  00:03:52,755
you can see color, let's change that to
white so we can see it a bit more clearly.
69

69

00:03:52,755  -->  00:03:56,055
Also, we have some font options here.
70

70

00:03:56,055  -->  00:03:58,712
I'll change the font size up to 40 so
it's a bit bigger.
71

71

00:03:58,712  -->  00:04:01,755
Now that I've changed it to 40,
we can't see it at all.
72

72

00:04:01,755  -->  00:04:04,135
That's because it doesn't fit
within our text box here.
73

73

00:04:04,135  -->  00:04:07,515
So I need to drag the sides of
the text box to make it bigger,
74

74

00:04:07,515  -->  00:04:10,815
which also leads me to conclude
that I need to put the text box
75

75

00:04:10,815  -->  00:04:14,550
where I would like it to be in
relation to our game window.
76

76

00:04:14,550  -->  00:04:16,050
So I've got a question,
where should it be?
77

77

00:04:16,050  -->  00:04:19,270
I have a look at my game design
requirements that we talked
78

78

00:04:19,270  -->  00:04:20,790
about in the very first lecture.
79

79

00:04:20,790  -->  00:04:22,800
And you can see that we
have a title at the top,
80

80

00:04:22,800  -->  00:04:27,520
then we have all this section in here,
which is where our game text goes,
81

81

00:04:27,520  -->  00:04:31,466
our story text goes, so I need to make
sure that my text roughly matches that.
82

82

00:04:31,466  -->  00:04:35,850
I just got Title Text, Story Text, and
then the Story Area which is a colored
83

83

00:04:35,850  -->  00:04:38,910
image that's gonna sit
underneath our text.
84

84

00:04:38,910  -->  00:04:44,190
So back over into Unity, grabbing the blue
nodes on the sides the top left there and
85

85

00:04:44,190  -->  00:04:46,390
the bottom right,
I will move it roughly into place.
86

86

00:04:46,390  -->  00:04:48,228
It doesn't need to be perfect for now,
87

87

00:04:48,228  -->  00:04:50,730
we just need to get
the general layout of our text.
88

88

00:04:50,730  -->  00:04:52,440
Okay, so I've got my text there, and
89

89

00:04:52,440  -->  00:04:57,930
always we need to make sure we rename
our game objects, so it make sense.
90

90

00:04:57,930  -->  00:05:00,960
Scroll up to the top of my inspector,
and instead of just plain old text,
91

91

00:05:00,960  -->  00:05:03,830
I'll call it the Story Text, hit Enter,
92

92

00:05:03,830  -->  00:05:07,920
now we have a Story Text game object,
which has some text in it.
93

93

00:05:07,920  -->  00:05:08,940
And in upcoming lectures,
94

94

00:05:08,940  -->  00:05:13,970
we'll be dynamically feeding our story
into this text field that we see here.
95

95

00:05:13,970  -->  00:05:16,840
For now, we've just got
placeholder that says, New Text.
96

96

00:05:16,840  -->  00:05:21,660
Let's make a whole bunch of
placeholder story text just so
97

97

00:05:21,660  -->  00:05:23,840
we can see how it fits on the screen.
98

98

00:05:23,840  -->  00:05:28,190
I'm gonna copy that and then just paste,
paste, paste, paste, paste in here a bunch
99

99

00:05:28,190  -->  00:05:30,530
so that we can see, yeah,
that's where our story is going to be and
100

100

00:05:30,530  -->  00:05:34,550
that's roughly how large it would
when we have it on our game screen.
101

101

00:05:34,550  -->  00:05:37,280
If I make the game screen bigger,
yep, okay, that's great.
102

102

00:05:37,280  -->  00:05:42,040
Now the next thing I'm gonna do is create
a background image underneath my text, so
103

103

00:05:42,040  -->  00:05:45,470
that we can see our text more clearly and
we can see our text should be going.
104

104

00:05:45,470  -->  00:05:51,890
Again, on the Canvas, right-click UI &gt;
Image, and you see a small white square
105

105

00:05:51,890  -->  00:05:55,470
appear, not just similar to the sprite
we were looking at in previous videos.
106

106

00:05:55,470  -->  00:05:59,590
I will drag the side of that so it fits
a little bit bigger than where my text
107

107

00:05:59,590  -->  00:06:01,490
is at the moment, a little bit bigger.
108

108

00:06:01,490  -->  00:06:05,020
And it's completely consuming
the text because it's sitting over
109

109

00:06:05,020  -->  00:06:05,960
the top of the text.
110

110

00:06:05,960  -->  00:06:08,476
First of all, I'll change the color
of this so it's not white,
111

111

00:06:08,476  -->  00:06:09,512
cuz my text is also white.
112

112

00:06:09,512  -->  00:06:12,166
I'm gonna make mine
a browny kind of color,
113

113

00:06:12,166  -->  00:06:16,090
feel free to make yours whatever you like,
x out of that.
114

114

00:06:16,090  -->  00:06:20,230
And now the order that we see in
the Canvas makes a difference to what is
115

115

00:06:20,230  -->  00:06:24,470
rendered first and second, whatever is
sitting at the top is rendered first and
116

116

00:06:24,470  -->  00:06:25,920
at the bottom is rendered last.
117

117

00:06:25,920  -->  00:06:27,452
And because this is rendered last,
118

118

00:06:27,452  -->  00:06:30,228
it's sitting over the top of
the thing that was rendered first.
119

119

00:06:30,228  -->  00:06:35,830
So I'm gonna drag image up here and
sit it above my story text.
120

120

00:06:35,830  -->  00:06:38,740
And you can see that within Canvas we now
121

121

00:06:38,740  -->  00:06:42,150
have these two game objects that
are sitting underneath Canvas.
122

122

00:06:42,150  -->  00:06:44,900
They are referred to as
the children of Canvas.
123

123

00:06:44,900  -->  00:06:49,130
So image is a child and Canvas is
the parent, story text is the child and
124

124

00:06:49,130  -->  00:06:50,690
Canvas as the parent.
125

125

00:06:50,690  -->  00:06:54,702
And in the future we're gonna be doing
a lot more talking about the parent-child
126

126

00:06:54,702  -->  00:06:58,124
relationship, all we need to know at
this stage of our journey is that
127

127

00:06:58,124  -->  00:07:01,082
it's a way of grouping so
that we can open and close Canvas.
128

128

00:07:01,082  -->  00:07:04,144
We could move Canvas around
within our hierarchy here and
129

129

00:07:04,144  -->  00:07:08,036
those two elements that are sitting
underneath of those two game objects
130

130

00:07:08,036  -->  00:07:10,720
will go along with
Canvas wherever it goes.
131

131

00:07:10,720  -->  00:07:14,620
There's a checkbox up in the top
right here that switches on and
132

132

00:07:14,620  -->  00:07:15,470
off game objects.
133

133

00:07:15,470  -->  00:07:18,600
If we switch on and off Canvas,
it also switches on and
134

134

00:07:18,600  -->  00:07:21,730
off the game objects underneath
it cuz it's the parent.
135

135

00:07:21,730  -->  00:07:24,808
However, if you switch on and
off the child, it only switches on and
136

136

00:07:24,808  -->  00:07:28,541
off that particular child, it doesn't
switch off the other child or the parent.
137

137

00:07:28,541  -->  00:07:31,191
Okay, so
that's just the start of parent child,
138

138

00:07:31,191  -->  00:07:34,380
we'll be doing a lot more of
that later on in the course.
139

139

00:07:34,380  -->  00:07:38,330
Now I have a challenge for you, and
the challenge is to get your Canvas ready,
140

140

00:07:38,330  -->  00:07:41,740
create a text field for
our story like I have just done.
141

141

00:07:41,740  -->  00:07:44,400
Create a heading, and then as an optional,
142

142

00:07:44,400  -->  00:07:50,070
add some flair to match your theme in
terms of the images, the boxes underneath.
143

143

00:07:50,070  -->  00:07:53,410
So for me,
I've got a heading background up here.
144

144

00:07:53,410  -->  00:07:55,140
I've got couple of little heading,
145

145

00:07:55,140  -->  00:07:58,920
couple little one of these
rectangles underneath for flare.
146

146

00:07:58,920  -->  00:08:03,039
And then I've given my
story field a border here.
147

147

00:08:03,039  -->  00:08:06,369
That's a little bit of bonus points if you
can figure out how to do a border just by
148

148

00:08:06,369  -->  00:08:09,480
using the images that we have,
then that's a bonus challenge for you.
149

149

00:08:09,480  -->  00:08:11,850
Don't worry about creating
funky font just yet,
150

150

00:08:11,850  -->  00:08:15,690
we'll be doing that in an upcoming
video using TextMesh Pro.
151

151

00:08:15,690  -->  00:08:18,030
So for now go ahead and
take on that challenge and
152

152

00:08:18,030  -->  00:08:19,359
I'll see you back here in a moment.
153

153

00:08:20,580  -->  00:08:22,840
Rodeo, welcome back.
154

154

00:08:22,840  -->  00:08:26,820
What I need to do first is
create another piece of text.
155

155

00:08:26,820  -->  00:08:31,429
I'm going to duplicate the text that
I have already by holding Ctrl+D or
156

156

00:08:31,429  -->  00:08:33,260
hitting Ctrl+D or Cmd+D.
157

157

00:08:33,260  -->  00:08:38,399
I'll change the name straight away
from story text to title text,
158

158

00:08:38,399  -->  00:08:43,284
and then clicking on my theme object
I will drag it up to the top.
159

159

00:08:43,284  -->  00:08:45,946
I don't need all of these place holder,
160

160

00:08:45,946  -->  00:08:51,070
I'm just gonna type in My Game Name
at the top, very exciting, it is.
161

161

00:08:51,070  -->  00:08:54,150
If you have any idea what I should
call my sting pong game and
162

162

00:08:54,150  -->  00:08:55,740
please let me know in the Q&amp;A.
163

163

00:08:55,740  -->  00:08:59,340
For now I'll just call it My Game Name,
I'll increase the font size to 80 so
164

164

00:08:59,340  -->  00:09:00,560
that it's bigger.
165

165

00:09:00,560  -->  00:09:04,590
I'll rearrange my layout a little bit,
drag it down a bit.
166

166

00:09:04,590  -->  00:09:07,480
You can see a really
handy snapping mechanism,
167

167

00:09:07,480  -->  00:09:12,560
the middle of my game object here,
the middle of my text field is matching
168

168

00:09:12,560  -->  00:09:17,590
up with the middle of our Canvas,
so we see that blue line there.
169

169

00:09:17,590  -->  00:09:18,170
It's snapping.
170

170

00:09:18,170  -->  00:09:20,280
Likewise, if I drag the side,
171

171

00:09:20,280  -->  00:09:24,310
it will snap whenever I reach any
other indicators in my Canvas.
172

172

00:09:24,310  -->  00:09:28,190
So it'll snap when I hit the end
of my background here, and
173

173

00:09:28,190  -->  00:09:31,480
also on the left when I hit
the end of the left background.
174

174

00:09:31,480  -->  00:09:34,590
Now, next I'm going to change
the alignment of my title so
175

175

00:09:34,590  -->  00:09:35,600
it sits in the middle.
176

176

00:09:35,600  -->  00:09:38,970
We've got an alignment buttoned down
here under characters and paragraph.
177

177

00:09:38,970  -->  00:09:41,810
So in paragraph,
click on the middle alignment and
178

178

00:09:41,810  -->  00:09:43,628
then I can also change the alignment.
179

179

00:09:43,628  -->  00:09:46,880
So as a horizontal alignment,
I can also change the vertical alignment
180

180

00:09:46,880  -->  00:09:49,020
by clicking on the middle
button just there as well.
181

181

00:09:49,020  -->  00:09:50,860
So now I've got My Game Name.
182

182

00:09:50,860  -->  00:09:54,343
Next, I'll give a little bit of
a background underneath my title by,
183

183

00:09:54,343  -->  00:09:56,893
I'll duplicate my image
here that I have already.
184

184

00:09:56,893  -->  00:10:00,308
I'll just call,
I didn't rename this, naughty me,
185

185

00:10:00,308  -->  00:10:03,580
this should be called Story Background.
186

186

00:10:03,580  -->  00:10:09,170
Bad form, and then I will duplicate
that again, Ctrl+D or Cmd+D like this,
187

187

00:10:09,170  -->  00:10:13,420
change the name of this straight
away to Title Background.
188

188

00:10:14,740  -->  00:10:19,420
Title Background, moves it up a little
bit, rearrange the size of it,
189

189

00:10:19,420  -->  00:10:23,008
stick it underneath or
the movements on top of my text,
190

190

00:10:23,008  -->  00:10:26,080
I need to drag this up
above my title text.
191

191

00:10:26,080  -->  00:10:28,892
Now we can see it above,
move it to the sides,
192

192

00:10:28,892  -->  00:10:33,050
change the color so it's a slightly
different color just for fun.
193

193

00:10:33,050  -->  00:10:37,203
We'll give it more of a dark blue
kinda thing, like I say, just for
194

194

00:10:37,203  -->  00:10:39,210
fun, and there we have it.
195

195

00:10:39,210  -->  00:10:42,906
And the final, final step I mentioned
to you about creating a border, so
196

196

00:10:42,906  -->  00:10:45,815
if you click on your story background,
duplicate that,
197

197

00:10:45,815  -->  00:10:49,537
drag it all the way up to the top so
it's gonna be the bottom most element.
198

198

00:10:49,537  -->  00:10:53,752
I'm gonna change this to story
background border as its name,
199

199

00:10:53,752  -->  00:10:55,990
up here in the Inspector.
200

200

00:10:55,990  -->  00:11:00,280
I'll change the color to a, all right,
probably just a straight up black, so
201

201

00:11:00,280  -->  00:11:01,220
we can see it.
202

202

00:11:01,220  -->  00:11:06,820
And then when I move the outside borders,
203

203

00:11:06,820  -->  00:11:09,700
so basically what I'm doing,
let me just drag this game object.
204

204

00:11:09,700  -->  00:11:12,550
Even though you can see
I've just another box, but
205

205

00:11:12,550  -->  00:11:15,990
because it's a little a bit larger
than the box that it's underneath,
206

206

00:11:15,990  -->  00:11:19,920
it looks like it's creating some
borders around that out of the box.
207

207

00:11:19,920  -->  00:11:23,400
And so there's other tools to be doing
some of the things we're doing now, but
208

208

00:11:23,400  -->  00:11:24,270
we're in the early days.
209

209

00:11:24,270  -->  00:11:28,860
We use the tools that we have, and
we make the most of what we can do now,
210

210

00:11:28,860  -->  00:11:31,550
cuz there's plenty we can
do with our current tools.
211

211

00:11:31,550  -->  00:11:32,150
So there we have it.
212

212

00:11:32,150  -->  00:11:36,970
There's a not super sexy just yet, but
it's at least the structure of our game.
213

213

00:11:36,970  -->  00:11:39,460
We know where we can put out text,
which we'll be doing very soon,
214

214

00:11:39,460  -->  00:11:41,770
and in the next video or two,
215

215

00:11:41,770  -->  00:11:45,500
we'll be having a look at how we can make
our title a little bit more interesting.
216

216

00:11:45,500  -->  00:11:46,750
But our game is coming along.
217

217

00:11:46,750  -->  00:11:49,770
Great work in this video, and
I'll see you in the upcoming lecture.
