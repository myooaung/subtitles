[MUSIC]

2

00:00:04,390  -->  00:00:08,010
In this video we're creating sprites
in Unity, we're using just a square and
3

3

00:00:08,010  -->  00:00:10,920
a circle to create a simple
little platformer scene.
4

4

00:00:10,920  -->  00:00:13,520
You can see my amazing work of art, here,
5

5

00:00:13,520  -->  00:00:18,730
inspired by Pitfall, my guy is jumping
to grab a rope across a water trap.
6

6

00:00:18,730  -->  00:00:21,900
Let's jump in and
make some sprites in Unity.
7

7

00:00:21,900  -->  00:00:25,560
Let's open up Unity hub and
start ourselves a new project,
8

8

00:00:25,560  -->  00:00:28,340
click on New, choose the location.
9

9

00:00:28,340  -->  00:00:31,510
We're going to put it, well I'm gonna
put mine in Repo's Unity 2D and
10

10

00:00:31,510  -->  00:00:34,660
then I have a text 101
folder that I've created.
11

11

00:00:34,660  -->  00:00:39,889
Double click on that, select project,
the name of the project, the project
12

12

00:00:39,889  -->  00:00:45,370
name here I am going to call Playing With
Sprites, okay, Playing With Sprites.
13

13

00:00:45,370  -->  00:00:48,770
And Template, we'll select 2D,
and Create project.
14

14

00:00:48,770  -->  00:00:52,780
Now while Unity is loading up,
that'll probably take around about 20 or
15

15

00:00:52,780  -->  00:00:55,460
30 seconds, let me show you
a quick slide on What Is A Sprite?
16

16

00:00:55,460  -->  00:00:58,630
So a Sprite according to
the Unity documents is a 2D
17

17

00:00:58,630  -->  00:01:01,800
graphic object obtained
from a bitmap image.
18

18

00:01:01,800  -->  00:01:06,560
So here is our bitmap image, it's 8 by 8,
8 pixels by 8 pixels, so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
19

19

00:01:06,560  -->  00:01:10,960
7, 8, let me put on my pointer so
it's nice and clear, bouncy red.
20

20

00:01:10,960  -->  00:01:16,470
These pixels, or this bitmap here,
this mapping of these individual bits,
21

21

00:01:16,470  -->  00:01:19,460
is when we put it in our scene,
it's gonna look like this.
22

22

00:01:19,460  -->  00:01:21,470
We won't the lines and
the other lines, they're just there so
23

23

00:01:21,470  -->  00:01:24,870
I can show you where each of the bits is,
we'll acquire that in the scene.
24

24

00:01:24,870  -->  00:01:26,220
Now this is only 8 by 8, so
25

25

00:01:26,220  -->  00:01:29,520
it looks very pixelated,
that's why we talk about pixel art.
26

26

00:01:29,520  -->  00:01:33,747
It looks like you can see every little
pixel, but instead of being 8 by 8,
27

27

00:01:33,747  -->  00:01:36,845
if this image was I don't
know maybe 512 by 512.
28

28

00:01:36,845  -->  00:01:41,241
Then you wouldn't see those individual
pixels and it would look more smooth,
29

29

00:01:41,241  -->  00:01:42,780
more of a realistic image.
30

30

00:01:42,780  -->  00:01:47,080
So Sprites aren't necessarily pixelated,
it's just I've zoomed in a long way,
31

31

00:01:47,080  -->  00:01:52,100
that's why it's pixelated I thinks
what I'm looking for there.
32

32

00:01:52,100  -->  00:01:56,020
And we can move, scale, rotate and
many other things with our Sprite.
33

33

00:01:56,020  -->  00:01:59,340
So, a Sprite is an element
of a game aspect,
34

34

00:01:59,340  -->  00:02:03,180
it's a game graphic that we can push
around on our screen, jump, and bounce,
35

35

00:02:03,180  -->  00:02:05,390
and shoot, and explode, and
all those kind of good things.
36

36

00:02:05,390  -->  00:02:09,750
So that is the core of a Sprite, and the
Sprites are really the building block for
37

37

00:02:09,750  -->  00:02:14,060
our 2D games we're gonna be working on,
okie dokie, we're in Unity here now.
38

38

00:02:14,060  -->  00:02:17,940
If your Unity doesn't look like this, then
again you can go to the top right layout,
39

39

00:02:17,940  -->  00:02:21,600
click on Default, and
it should have the default layout for you.
40

40

00:02:21,600  -->  00:02:24,720
What we'll do to start off with is take
a look at the relationship between
41

41

00:02:24,720  -->  00:02:31,610
the hierarchy window the scene window,
the game window and the project
42

42

00:02:31,610  -->  00:02:36,520
window with the assets directory in it
as well as the all important inspector.
43

43

00:02:36,520  -->  00:02:38,610
So they're the main windows we're
gonna be looking at in here.
44

44

00:02:38,610  -->  00:02:42,510
And we're gonna do that by adding
a couple of sprites into our scene.
45

45

00:02:42,510  -->  00:02:44,490
First of all, within this scene here,
46

46

00:02:44,490  -->  00:02:48,980
I can scroll outwards with my mouse wheel
to move backwards, or I can can forward.
47

47

00:02:48,980  -->  00:02:53,700
So, I can also hold down Alt and
right mouse and move left and right,
48

48

00:02:53,700  -->  00:02:56,360
the will move in and out within my scene.
49

49

00:02:56,360  -->  00:03:00,880
The only thing in my scene is
the place that we built our world,
50

50

00:03:00,880  -->  00:03:03,150
where we build all the things
that the player can see.
51

51

00:03:03,150  -->  00:03:05,410
The only thing that we have in
there at the moment is this camera.
52

52

00:03:05,410  -->  00:03:07,460
If I click on the little
camera icon there,
53

53

00:03:07,460  -->  00:03:11,630
then you can see over in the hierarchy,
we have main camera selected.
54

54

00:03:11,630  -->  00:03:15,020
If your camera is hidden,
maybe it's underneath the twiddle here.
55

55

00:03:15,020  -->  00:03:17,890
This is our, the name of scene
is Sample Scene at the moment,
56

56

00:03:17,890  -->  00:03:19,260
it's just the default name for it.
57

57

00:03:19,260  -->  00:03:22,860
We have one Game Object,
and that's the main camera.
58

58

00:03:22,860  -->  00:03:26,710
Everything within the hierarchy
is a Game Object.
59

59

00:03:26,710  -->  00:03:29,050
So again,
have our camera as a game object.
60

60

00:03:29,050  -->  00:03:32,880
We can have light, have the player,
have environment, have exploding barrels,
61

61

00:03:32,880  -->  00:03:34,900
all of these things are game objects.
62

62

00:03:34,900  -->  00:03:39,610
If we click on main camera, just click
on it once, over here in the inspector,
63

63

00:03:39,610  -->  00:03:42,620
we get all of the information
about the main camera.
64

64

00:03:42,620  -->  00:03:45,460
For now, we're not going to do very much,
we will just do one little thing,
65

65

00:03:45,460  -->  00:03:47,880
which is, you can see our background.
66

66

00:03:47,880  -->  00:03:51,280
If there's nothing else the camera
can see, as you can see down here,
67

67

00:03:51,280  -->  00:03:52,540
this is the camera preview.
68

68

00:03:52,540  -->  00:03:54,700
This is what we actually
see through the camera,
69

69

00:03:54,700  -->  00:03:57,835
if we were to play the game now the way to
see what you can see through the camera if
70

70

00:03:57,835  -->  00:04:01,385
you play the game is to click on game,
this is the default.
71

71

00:04:01,385  -->  00:04:04,175
Then when we hit the play button,
as we did a lot in the last section,
72

72

00:04:04,175  -->  00:04:07,695
we will run any of our code, and we won't
be able to actually play our game, but for
73

73

00:04:07,695  -->  00:04:10,595
now this is the starting state of game.
74

74

00:04:10,595  -->  00:04:13,335
Jump back over into scene here,
with our camera preview.
75

75

00:04:13,335  -->  00:04:16,525
If I was to click on the color,
select it here, maybe change this color,
76

76

00:04:16,525  -->  00:04:21,520
make it a bit brighter, maybe I'll make it
darker color, actually, make it brighter.
77

77

00:04:21,520  -->  00:04:22,720
Okay let's make it darker.
78

78

00:04:22,720  -->  00:04:25,730
That doesn't make sense, Rick,
but let's make it a green.
79

79

00:04:25,730  -->  00:04:28,650
There we go, and
then x out of that window.
80

80

00:04:28,650  -->  00:04:30,690
Now our camera preview is green.
81

81

00:04:30,690  -->  00:04:34,710
It I was to click Click on the game tab,
and our background is all green.
82

82

00:04:34,710  -->  00:04:37,630
Such is one little change we
made within the inspector here.
83

83

00:04:37,630  -->  00:04:42,470
So now we have changed the properties of
the camera, these are all properties for
84

84

00:04:42,470  -->  00:04:44,100
our main camera here.
85

85

00:04:44,100  -->  00:04:46,400
Now, let's add ourselves
a couple of Sprites.
86

86

00:04:46,400  -->  00:04:48,895
If we come down into the assets directory,
87

87

00:04:48,895  -->  00:04:54,640
right-click anywhere in the space
in here under assets Right-click.
88

88

00:04:54,640  -->  00:04:55,650
Scroll up to the top.
89

89

00:04:55,650  -->  00:05:01,050
Under Create you'll see, over on
the right of Create, you'll see Sprites.
90

90

00:05:01,050  -->  00:05:04,790
Within Sprites there's Square, Triangle,
Diamond, Hexagon, Circle and Polygon.
91

91

00:05:04,790  -->  00:05:05,650
We'll start with Square.
92

92

00:05:05,650  -->  00:05:08,540
So left-click on Square and
hit Enter on your keyboard.
93

93

00:05:08,540  -->  00:05:11,640
That will create the square
in our assets directory.
94

94

00:05:11,640  -->  00:05:14,240
Now this doesn't currently
live within our game.
95

95

00:05:14,240  -->  00:05:17,500
It's not anywhere in our scene and
it's not anywhere in our hierarchy.
96

96

00:05:17,500  -->  00:05:20,030
We can rectify that by grabbing this, and
97

97

00:05:20,030  -->  00:05:23,560
dragging it either into our hierarchy,
or into our scene.
98

98

00:05:23,560  -->  00:05:27,250
It will do the same thing,
in terms of creating it as a game object.
99

99

00:05:27,250  -->  00:05:30,090
Let's drag it over into our hierarchy for
now.
100

100

00:05:30,090  -->  00:05:33,380
Blink, and you'll see that
it has now appeared square.
101

101

00:05:33,380  -->  00:05:37,040
Is now over here as a instantiated.
102

102

00:05:37,040  -->  00:05:38,850
We've created an instance.
103

103

00:05:38,850  -->  00:05:44,680
We've created one copy of square
over here in our hierarchy.
104

104

00:05:44,680  -->  00:05:45,480
We can do that again.
105

105

00:05:45,480  -->  00:05:48,610
We can drag it again and
create another copy and do it again and
106

106

00:05:48,610  -->  00:05:49,890
create another copy.
107

107

00:05:49,890  -->  00:05:53,670
These are all copying the exact thing
we have in our assets directory here.
108

108

00:05:53,670  -->  00:05:57,110
And it puts it into our scene and
puts it into our hierarchy so
109

109

00:05:57,110  -->  00:05:59,330
we can see a list of all
of our game objects.
110

110

00:05:59,330  -->  00:06:02,060
Now you might not see it over here, cuz
they're all right on top of each other.
111

111

00:06:02,060  -->  00:06:04,650
But if we were to click on
the second of these squares,
112

112

00:06:04,650  -->  00:06:08,620
square one here, and
we have a mechanism for
113

113

00:06:08,620  -->  00:06:12,480
moving our sprites around,
moving any game object in our scene.
114

114

00:06:12,480  -->  00:06:17,230
Up at the top here we have a Sand tool,
a Move tool, Rotate tool,
115

115

00:06:17,230  -->  00:06:22,400
Scale tool, Rect tool and a tool that has
more of a broad name that's not a such and
116

116

00:06:22,400  -->  00:06:26,300
such tool, but move, rotate or
scale selected objects tool.
117

117

00:06:26,300  -->  00:06:27,015
We'll call it a tool.
118

118

00:06:27,015  -->  00:06:33,360
You can also use the keyboard
shortcuts of Q, W, E, R and T.
119

119

00:06:33,360  -->  00:06:36,830
I'm going to use W, and
you can see we have our handles here.
120

120

00:06:36,830  -->  00:06:38,260
We have our x handle.
121

121

00:06:38,260  -->  00:06:41,760
Red is x in this instance and green is y.
122

122

00:06:41,760  -->  00:06:47,370
If I was to grab, so mouse over the red
handle, left-click, and move to the right.
123

123

00:06:47,370  -->  00:06:50,730
That will move our sprite that
we'd selected on square one,
124

124

00:06:50,730  -->  00:06:51,620
move it to the right.
125

125

00:06:51,620  -->  00:06:53,830
I'm going to click on square two.
126

126

00:06:53,830  -->  00:06:55,190
And move that to the left.
127

127

00:06:55,190  -->  00:06:58,040
We now have three squares
within our scene.
128

128

00:06:58,040  -->  00:07:01,370
As we did with the camera, we can
click on one of these game objects and
129

129

00:07:01,370  -->  00:07:02,360
change the color.
130

130

00:07:02,360  -->  00:07:04,740
So let's change the color of
the first one to something else.
131

131

00:07:04,740  -->  00:07:07,230
Maybe make it a yellow, whatever you like.
132

132

00:07:07,230  -->  00:07:08,050
The color doesn't matter.
133

133

00:07:08,050  -->  00:07:10,440
We're just playing around
with it here at the moment.
134

134

00:07:10,440  -->  00:07:13,020
We don't just have to click on
it through the hierarchy though,
135

135

00:07:13,020  -->  00:07:14,440
we can also click on it within the scene.
136

136

00:07:14,440  -->  00:07:16,520
So if I click on this gameobject,
137

137

00:07:16,520  -->  00:07:22,270
we can now see that it is selected,
change the color to dark red, why not?
138

138

00:07:22,270  -->  00:07:26,640
X out of that, and then if I was to click
either in the hierarchy, or in the scene
139

139

00:07:26,640  -->  00:07:32,490
on our third square, and change the color
of that to a bright blue maybe.
140

140

00:07:32,490  -->  00:07:34,280
Now we have three squares,
141

141

00:07:34,280  -->  00:07:39,860
three square boxes that are within our
scene that are also within our hierarchy.
142

142

00:07:39,860  -->  00:07:44,480
So hopefully that's becoming really clear,
the relationship between the Game Objects,
143

143

00:07:44,480  -->  00:07:50,120
these are game objects, are listed in our
hierarchy and are seen within the scene.
144

144

00:07:50,120  -->  00:07:52,940
And pat of the reason we need
to have them listed here
145

145

00:07:52,940  -->  00:07:57,150
is if we scroll the camera way over
here to some other part of our game,
146

146

00:07:57,150  -->  00:07:59,860
and we're like hang on wait
a minute where was that square?
147

147

00:07:59,860  -->  00:08:02,800
Then we can find it within
our list of gameobjects here.
148

148

00:08:02,800  -->  00:08:06,438
And a little tip, if you double
click on one of your game objects.
149

149

00:08:06,438  -->  00:08:10,890
It will zoom scene right
in focus on that object.
150

150

00:08:10,890  -->  00:08:14,375
We can scroll back out again a little
bit with the mouse wheel, or
151

151

00:08:14,375  -->  00:08:19,180
Alt+right click, and moving the mouse
left and right as we did a moment ago.
152

152

00:08:19,180  -->  00:08:24,680
I'm gonna create one more of these
default sprites for our assets directory.
153

153

00:08:24,680  -->  00:08:28,820
So right click from our Assets area.
154

154

00:08:28,820  -->  00:08:35,110
Find create, onto sprites,
and I will put in a circle.
155

155

00:08:35,110  -->  00:08:38,220
Now, it's waiting for us to name it,
just hit enter, that's fine,
156

156

00:08:38,220  -->  00:08:39,690
now we have a circle.
157

157

00:08:39,690  -->  00:08:43,960
Again, we can drag that into our scene,
and hey presto we have a circle.
158

158

00:08:43,960  -->  00:08:48,210
One other main thing I'd like to show you,
in terms of manipulating our sprites here,
159

159

00:08:48,210  -->  00:08:51,880
is when you click on any of your game
objects, we're having the same, we'll take
160

160

00:08:51,880  -->  00:08:59,470
circle, you can change the position as
we did or the rotation or the scale.
161

161

00:08:59,470  -->  00:09:01,930
We've already been playing around with
changing the position when we grabbed
162

162

00:09:01,930  -->  00:09:04,990
the handle, so that's W on the keyboard,
and move left and right.
163

163

00:09:04,990  -->  00:09:08,640
If you ever look at this number over here,
next to X on the X axes, you can see if we
164

164

00:09:08,640  -->  00:09:12,220
move left It's getting lower,
as we move right, it's getting higher.
165

165

00:09:12,220  -->  00:09:17,110
So it's showing us in the inspector here,
under Transform,
166

166

00:09:17,110  -->  00:09:20,970
the transform position of our circle is
167

167

00:09:20,970  -->  00:09:26,780
currently at 8.45x and 2.5 etc on the y.
168

168

00:09:26,780  -->  00:09:28,940
We can move it up and down and
the y on that will change.
169

169

00:09:28,940  -->  00:09:31,410
The z is going in and out of the screen.
170

170

00:09:31,410  -->  00:09:32,400
Now I'm gonna show you something here.
171

171

00:09:32,400  -->  00:09:35,390
We're not gonna play around
a lot with 3D in this course.
172

172

00:09:35,390  -->  00:09:36,820
That's in our other course.
173

173

00:09:36,820  -->  00:09:40,540
We're focusing on the challenges and
the benefits of 2D.
174

174

00:09:40,540  -->  00:09:44,210
2D.
But if you were to jump up here to the top
175

175

00:09:44,210  -->  00:09:47,560
just underneath where our game tab is,
the moment you'll see a button of 2D.
176

176

00:09:47,560  -->  00:09:52,150
If we click on that 2D that toggles
between 2D and 3D, toggle it.
177

177

00:09:52,150  -->  00:09:56,140
So if it's not highlighted
we're currently 3D,
178

178

00:09:56,140  -->  00:09:59,210
that allows us to see what's
going on in 3D space.
179

179

00:09:59,210  -->  00:10:04,020
If I hold down Alt And use my right
mouse button and move the mouse around.
180

180

00:10:04,020  -->  00:10:06,630
I can rotate around in the world and
see what's going on.
181

181

00:10:06,630  -->  00:10:09,300
Similarly, I could just hold
down the right mouse button, and
182

182

00:10:09,300  -->  00:10:11,900
just look around from
the position that I'm in.
183

183

00:10:11,900  -->  00:10:16,540
And I can move my position in
the world by just holding down my
184

184

00:10:16,540  -->  00:10:18,040
middle mouse button and
just moving around.
185

185

00:10:18,040  -->  00:10:19,960
So there's a little bit of
control we can have and
186

186

00:10:19,960  -->  00:10:24,750
I wanted to show you that these
are all currently on the zero z-axis.
187

187

00:10:24,750  -->  00:10:26,580
So on the z-axis they're
at the zero level.
188

188

00:10:26,580  -->  00:10:29,240
If I was to move my circle,
here's my circle here.
189

189

00:10:29,240  -->  00:10:33,890
If I was to move it in and out,
you can see the z-axis changing.
190

190

00:10:33,890  -->  00:10:40,310
If I move it in and out,
it's not gonna change how I view it in 2D.
191

191

00:10:40,310  -->  00:10:44,540
If I click over here on Game, you can see
there's my where my dot is in the scene.
192

192

00:10:44,540  -->  00:10:47,010
You know what we'll do is
we'll grab our window.
193

193

00:10:47,010  -->  00:10:49,550
So I'm bouncing around a little bit,
but we'll grab our window here and
194

194

00:10:49,550  -->  00:10:51,170
move it next to our scene.
195

195

00:10:51,170  -->  00:10:53,520
So we can see our scene and
our game side by side.
196

196

00:10:53,520  -->  00:10:56,292
And I'm gonna click out the top
here on Free Aspect and
197

197

00:10:56,292  -->  00:10:59,995
change the camera's aspect ratio
to one of these, 1024x768.
198

198

00:10:59,995  -->  00:11:02,780
Just so it's locked in an aspect ratio.
199

199

00:11:02,780  -->  00:11:07,560
And also move our circle back
onto the screen so we can see it.
200

200

00:11:07,560  -->  00:11:11,160
This is where our camera is looking from
and you can see it's an orthographic
201

201

00:11:11,160  -->  00:11:15,220
camera means it's looking at everything
straight, it's not showing any perspective
202

202

00:11:15,220  -->  00:11:18,830
where things are on this plane
is where it's going to see it.
203

203

00:11:18,830  -->  00:11:22,890
So, as we move our circle around left and
right and up and down.
204

204

00:11:22,890  -->  00:11:25,810
We can see it positioned
within our world there.
205

205

00:11:25,810  -->  00:11:29,140
If I do move it forward and
back, it doesn't change.
206

206

00:11:29,140  -->  00:11:33,770
Because it's still being perceived by
our 2D camera, our orthographic camera,
207

207

00:11:33,770  -->  00:11:38,190
in the same position on our x and
y coordinates.
208

208

00:11:38,190  -->  00:11:39,630
So this is where it's on the x and y.
209

209

00:11:39,630  -->  00:11:40,900
If I move the x and y up and down,
210

210

00:11:40,900  -->  00:11:43,100
you can see over here in
the game it's moving up and down.
211

211

00:11:43,100  -->  00:11:47,360
But if I move my z axis here in and
out, it doesn't change.
212

212

00:11:47,360  -->  00:11:49,770
Okay, so I just wanted to show
you that briefly, just so
213

213

00:11:49,770  -->  00:11:52,710
we've had a little bit of a look
at the The 2D versus 3D camera,
214

214

00:11:52,710  -->  00:11:56,760
we gonna spend most of the time
clicked on a 2D button just here.
215

215

00:11:56,760  -->  00:11:58,350
So, click on that to get back into 2D.
216

216

00:11:58,350  -->  00:12:01,630
The last thing before I give a challenge,
and there is a challenge coming,
217

217

00:12:01,630  -->  00:12:03,180
is we can scale up our objects.
218

218

00:12:03,180  -->  00:12:04,950
I can scale in the x axes,
219

219

00:12:04,950  -->  00:12:08,450
I can scale in the y axes to
make it bigger on the screen.
220

220

00:12:08,450  -->  00:12:12,710
And the other way to scale
is by clicking on Rect tool.
221

221

00:12:12,710  -->  00:12:15,000
We have that selected by
default at the moment.
222

222

00:12:15,000  -->  00:12:19,310
You can grab the arms on the side or
even grab the nodes on the end
223

223

00:12:19,310  -->  00:12:23,080
just to scale the object how you would
like to scale it, like that for example.
224

224

00:12:24,350  -->  00:12:25,020
So that's us.
225

225

00:12:25,020  -->  00:12:27,570
And then while we're in this
tour we can move it around and
226

226

00:12:27,570  -->  00:12:30,050
you can see once we're
outside of this line here
227

227

00:12:30,050  -->  00:12:33,490
we'll be outside of where our game
camera is rendering that object.
228

228

00:12:33,490  -->  00:12:36,750
So if I move it over here it's off screen
and then in it comes and off it goes.
229

229

00:12:36,750  -->  00:12:40,150
So the foundations of
animation right there as well.
230

230

00:12:40,150  -->  00:12:42,390
Now here's where I have a challenge for
you.
231

231

00:12:42,390  -->  00:12:46,030
Create a platformer level, just like the
little one you saw at the very very start
232

232

00:12:46,030  -->  00:12:49,000
of this video where I was showing you
the example of what I've created.
233

233

00:12:49,000  -->  00:12:53,230
Create your own platformer level,
just use the basic sprites and
234

234

00:12:53,230  -->  00:12:55,370
it's a pretend level, so
make a little platform,
235

235

00:12:55,370  -->  00:12:57,650
maybe make a little character if you want,
that would be cool.
236

236

00:12:57,650  -->  00:13:00,450
Nothing's gonna move,
it's just a snapshot.
237

237

00:13:00,450  -->  00:13:02,100
And note, this is just for fun.
238

238

00:13:02,100  -->  00:13:03,570
We won't be using this in our game.
239

239

00:13:03,570  -->  00:13:05,700
We won't be using it beyond this lecture.
240

240

00:13:05,700  -->  00:13:10,280
It's just for you to get used to Unity and
share what you have with the community.
241

241

00:13:10,280  -->  00:13:13,720
Once you've created something, create a
screenshot of that, take a screenshot and
242

242

00:13:13,720  -->  00:13:17,370
we'll see what interesting and wacky and
cool things everyone can come up with.
243

243

00:13:17,370  -->  00:13:18,530
So that's a challenge.
244

244

00:13:18,530  -->  00:13:21,150
Pause the video and jump in and
give that your best shot now.
245

245

00:13:21,150  -->  00:13:21,820
See you in a moment.
246

246

00:13:23,000  -->  00:13:24,920
This is my sped recording at my work.
247

247

00:13:24,920  -->  00:13:26,450
I'm duplicating my squares.
248

248

00:13:26,450  -->  00:13:31,352
They're now rectangles, just moving
them around, creating a by a rectangle
249

249

00:13:31,352  -->  00:13:35,489
that's rotated, working on a little guy
to be jumping over my water trap here.
250

250

00:13:36,780  -->  00:13:41,970
Pitfall, an old, old game, making the
different elements of my character here.
251

251

00:13:41,970  -->  00:13:44,540
And then highlighting them all,
selecting them all, and
252

252

00:13:44,540  -->  00:13:48,410
rotating all of them in one go, that can
rotate the whole character in one hit.
253

253

00:13:48,410  -->  00:13:52,520
Making a sun, changing the color of the
rope and the background of the camera, and
254

254

00:13:52,520  -->  00:13:53,630
that is it.
255

255

00:13:53,630  -->  00:13:54,330
And final note,
256

256

00:13:54,330  -->  00:13:57,260
you can see that our hierarchy has
become a real big mess over here.
257

257

00:13:57,260  -->  00:13:59,770
Things aren't named properly,
not organized very well.
258

258

00:13:59,770  -->  00:14:02,790
That's something that in the future we'll
certainly spend a lot of time focusing on
259

259

00:14:02,790  -->  00:14:05,080
but for now we just playing around
having a little bit of fun and
260

260

00:14:05,080  -->  00:14:06,530
getting our hands dirty with Unity.
261

261

00:14:06,530  -->  00:14:10,180
So great work in this video, I look
forward to your shares of what you've come
262

262

00:14:10,180  -->  00:14:12,290
up with and
I will see you in the next video.
