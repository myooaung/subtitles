00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:04.769
[SOUND] Hello again.
2

2

00:00:04.769  -->  00:00:08.176
In this video we are going to
make our player shoot, [SOUND] so
3

3

00:00:08.176  -->  00:00:12.074
that we can start looking like
an actual proper grown up space ship.
4

4

00:00:12.074  -->  00:00:15.236
Okay, let's make our player shoot!
5

5

00:00:15.236  -->  00:00:19.060
The first thing for us to do in this
process is to build ourselves a projectile
6

6

00:00:19.060  -->  00:00:22.013
and that will be your challenge,
set up your projectile.
7

7

00:00:22.013  -->  00:00:27.097
Create a laser prefab, so
you'll need a sprite to use as the laser.
8

8

00:00:27.097  -->  00:00:32.447
And then to create a prefab,
you'll need to create a new variable
9

9

00:00:32.447  -->  00:00:37.907
in the Player.cs script to store
a reference to the laser prefab.
10

10

00:00:37.907  -->  00:00:40.754
And then to connect the Laser prefab,
I just noticed for
11

11

00:00:40.754  -->  00:00:44.887
those of you out there who are sticklers
for capital letters as I am, there we go.
12

12

00:00:44.887  -->  00:00:47.687
[LAUGH] Just make that change,
so it's not driving you crazy.
13

13

00:00:47.687  -->  00:00:49.883
Okay, Laser, with a capital L prefab.
14

14

00:00:49.883  -->  00:00:52.812
Connect the Laser prefab
to the Player prefab.
15

15

00:00:52.812  -->  00:00:55.048
So we've done this a few times,
it should be straightforward.
16

16

00:00:55.048  -->  00:00:58.109
If my description's a little bit
confusing, then take your time,
17

17

00:00:58.109  -->  00:01:00.752
have a look at it, read through it,
have a think about it.
18

18

00:01:00.752  -->  00:01:02.303
But you'll need to create a prefab.
19

19

00:01:02.303  -->  00:01:06.691
You need to put a little bit of code,
just a variable in the Player.cs, and
20

20

00:01:06.691  -->  00:01:08.720
then to connect the two together.
21

21

00:01:08.720  -->  00:01:12.664
So pause the video and
take on that challenge now, if you will.
22

22

00:01:15.069  -->  00:01:17.936
Okay, so
we're gonna find our Laser prefab,
23

23

00:01:17.936  -->  00:01:20.886
our Laser Sprite from in
the Kenney Asset pack.
24

24

00:01:20.886  -->  00:01:21.992
And you know what I'll do?
25

25

00:01:21.992  -->  00:01:24.444
It bugs me that this is right
in the middle of my assets here,
26

26

00:01:24.444  -->  00:01:26.173
it's a little bit small over on the side.
27

27

00:01:26.173  -->  00:01:27.854
I'm going to rename this.
28

28

00:01:27.854  -->  00:01:30.617
This is a little bit clumsy,
you don't have to follow this but
29

29

00:01:30.617  -->  00:01:32.968
I'm just gonna call it z,
so it's definitely end.
30

30

00:01:32.968  -->  00:01:36.618
And I'm gonna call it Kenney Assets,
call it what it is.
31

31

00:01:36.618  -->  00:01:38.338
Call a thing a thing, I say.
32

32

00:01:38.338  -->  00:01:41.184
And now that's just gonna be sitting down
there and as I fill out my assets folder,
33

33

00:01:41.184  -->  00:01:42.392
I know that's gonna be at the end.
34

34

00:01:42.392  -->  00:01:46.085
I'm not referring to it, I'm just grabbing
things from it whenever I need it.
35

35

00:01:46.085  -->  00:01:50.376
And what I'm going to grab at this moment
is to go into PNG's find in my PNGs in
36

36

00:01:50.376  -->  00:01:53.481
here, a little bit more
screen real estate, please.
37

37

00:01:53.481  -->  00:01:58.063
Find the Lasers, I'm gonna go for
[SOUND] laserBlue03,
38

38

00:01:58.063  -->  00:02:03.029
drag that into my Sprites,
cuz that will say, I am using this.
39

39

00:02:03.029  -->  00:02:05.188
Close up the Kenney assets,
we're good there.
40

40

00:02:05.188  -->  00:02:10.536
And you can see in my Sprites,
I have a new fancy laserBlue03, excellent.
41

41

00:02:10.536  -->  00:02:11.999
I will drag that.
42

42

00:02:11.999  -->  00:02:15.948
I'll first drag my window a little bit so
get a bit more scene space.
43

43

00:02:15.948  -->  00:02:18.786
Drag that into my hierarchy,
it's called Laser blue.
44

44

00:02:18.786  -->  00:02:25.664
I'll rename that to Player laser,
Player laser, cool.
45

45

00:02:25.664  -->  00:02:27.075
And that is now a Player laser.
46

46

00:02:27.075  -->  00:02:29.725
If I look at where that is at in my scene,
I'll click on W.
47

47

00:02:29.725  -->  00:02:34.031
You can see it's right in the middle,
and excellent.
48

48

00:02:34.031  -->  00:02:37.381
Now that I've created a game
object that's Player laser,
49

49

00:02:37.381  -->  00:02:41.074
I can drag that into my assets,
I don't have a prefab folder yet.
50

50

00:02:41.074  -->  00:02:44.004
Okay, let's deliberative naming and
foldering and
51

51

00:02:44.004  -->  00:02:45.702
tidying upping at the moment.
52

52

00:02:45.702  -->  00:02:49.347
So folder, we'll call this Prefabs,
that's where our prefabs will go.
53

53

00:02:49.347  -->  00:02:53.458
While I'm here,
I'm going to drag my player, open that up,
54

54

00:02:53.458  -->  00:02:55.446
drag my player Laser prefab.
55

55

00:02:55.446  -->  00:02:56.673
Now, we have a prefab.
56

56

00:02:56.673  -->  00:02:59.722
Also, while I'm here,
drag the player down, make that a prefab.
57

57

00:02:59.722  -->  00:03:02.317
Should always make everything
a prefab if you can.
58

58

00:03:02.317  -->  00:03:05.712
Drag the enemy down and
drag the canvas down.
59

59

00:03:05.712  -->  00:03:07.874
The event system we won't worry about.
60

60

00:03:07.874  -->  00:03:10.457
And the space background tall,
that's not the greatest name.
61

61

00:03:10.457  -->  00:03:14.759
I'll call this Blue
background just to rename it.
62

62

00:03:14.759  -->  00:03:18.668
Blackground [LAUGH] background,
Rick, okay.
63

63

00:03:18.668  -->  00:03:22.787
Blue background, drag that over in
as well and also the main camera.
64

64

00:03:22.787  -->  00:03:25.035
And I can see where it's
still called sample scene.
65

65

00:03:25.035  -->  00:03:26.755
Right click on Sample scene.
66

66

00:03:26.755  -->  00:03:31.942
Now you have to find it our assets,
in scenes, right click on Sample scene,
67

67

00:03:31.942  -->  00:03:36.495
rename and we will call this just Game,
I think for now it's cool.
68

68

00:03:36.495  -->  00:03:38.200
Okay, and then save.
69

69

00:03:38.200  -->  00:03:41.045
So I've created some Prefabs,
we have our prefab folder.
70

70

00:03:41.045  -->  00:03:44.750
We've got our laserbeam here,
we're calling Player laser for the moment,
71

71

00:03:44.750  -->  00:03:45.783
everything is good.
72

72

00:03:45.783  -->  00:03:49.271
Now, on to our player,
we find our Player script.
73

73

00:03:49.271  -->  00:03:52.707
Open up that Player script anything,
I have Visual Studio open at the moment.
74

74

00:03:52.707  -->  00:03:56.103
So take a moment to open that up.
75

75

00:03:56.103  -->  00:04:01.085
At the top of our script
where we have our parameters,
76

76

00:04:01.085  -->  00:04:07.525
I'll just pop this in here,
this is our configuration parameters.
77

77

00:04:07.525  -->  00:04:10.188
Okay, you don't have to put
that heading in there, but
78

78

00:04:10.188  -->  00:04:12.406
I find it helps us keep
things nicely grouped.
79

79

00:04:12.406  -->  00:04:15.961
We'll create a variable,
we'll SerializeField,
80

80

00:04:15.961  -->  00:04:18.652
not serializable, Serlializefield.
81

81

00:04:18.652  -->  00:04:23.179
Excellent, and this will be of type,
now let's see, what type is a prefab?
82

82

00:04:23.179  -->  00:04:27.001
A prefab is a GameObject,
so GameObject, and
83

83

00:04:27.001  -->  00:04:33.078
I'll call it laserPrefab, just to be
very clear it's our laser prefab.
84

84

00:04:33.078  -->  00:04:34.814
Save as we do.
85

85

00:04:34.814  -->  00:04:36.456
Excellent, so we've got our laserPrefab.
86

86

00:04:36.456  -->  00:04:41.870
The last step in the challenge I gave
to you is to find the Prefabs and
87

87

00:04:41.870  -->  00:04:44.392
connect our Prefab to Prefab.
88

88

00:04:44.392  -->  00:04:47.991
So I don't need this player laser
that's hanging out in my scene now.
89

89

00:04:47.991  -->  00:04:50.095
I can delete that cuz
I've got a Prefab and
90

90

00:04:50.095  -->  00:04:53.601
I can very easily drop a new Prefab
back into my scene whenever I like.
91

91

00:04:53.601  -->  00:04:55.968
I will find the Player.
92

92

00:04:55.968  -->  00:04:59.502
The Player should now have
a laser prefab which is empty,
93

93

00:04:59.502  -->  00:05:04.230
click on the selector, find our player
laser and now we've hooked that up.
94

94

00:05:04.230  -->  00:05:05.465
We're not going to do anything just yet.
95

95

00:05:05.465  -->  00:05:09.339
But we've successfully given our
Player a Laser that we can spawn.
96

96

00:05:09.339  -->  00:05:10.612
Right, so how do we spawn it?
97

97

00:05:10.612  -->  00:05:12.875
How do we instantiate our Laser?
98

98

00:05:12.875  -->  00:05:20.469
Well, first of all we need to, in our
update method, to create a fire method.
99

99

00:05:20.469  -->  00:05:26.059
Fire(); while I'm here as well,
I don't like this flow.
100

100

00:05:26.059  -->  00:05:28.067
I like to be able to
see my start method and
101

101

00:05:28.067  -->  00:05:30.263
then my update method
one after each other.
102

102

00:05:30.263  -->  00:05:34.001
And we're not gonna be touching
the SetUpMoveBoundaries really anymore.
103

103

00:05:34.001  -->  00:05:36.635
So I'm gonna highlight all of this,
cut, drag,
104

104

00:05:36.635  -->  00:05:38.975
go all the way down
the bottom of my scripts.
105

105

00:05:38.975  -->  00:05:40.187
Give a bit of space.
106

106

00:05:40.187  -->  00:05:42.809
Pace setting and
setup move boundaries is down there,
107

107

00:05:42.809  -->  00:05:44.348
happily hanging out on its own.
108

108

00:05:44.348  -->  00:05:47.973
I can also click on the little
selector thing here to close up so
109

109

00:05:47.973  -->  00:05:49.377
I'm not looking at it.
110

110

00:05:49.377  -->  00:05:52.872
If you mouse over the three dots,
give you a little bit of a thumbnail of
111

111

00:05:52.872  -->  00:05:56.741
what is within this method or what's
within the thing that we've closed up.
112

112

00:05:56.741  -->  00:05:58.838
Okay, just tidying things
up a little bit here.
113

113

00:05:58.838  -->  00:06:00.433
It's kinda the theme of this video,
isn't it?
114

114

00:06:00.433  -->  00:06:01.416
Tidying things up.
115

115

00:06:01.416  -->  00:06:05.391
So we have our Fire method,
right click on that to Quick actions
116

116

00:06:05.391  -->  00:06:09.374
to Generate the method,
right underneath, we'll see Fire.
117

117

00:06:09.374  -->  00:06:12.290
Delete the placeholder throw exception,
and
118

118

00:06:12.290  -->  00:06:15.885
now we can say what happens when we fire,
and how do fire?
119

119

00:06:15.885  -->  00:06:18.280
How do we fire in the first place?
120

120

00:06:18.280  -->  00:06:21.253
Well, this is gonna be
an input from the Player.
121

121

00:06:21.253  -->  00:06:24.758
And when we do the input, something will
happen, so this sounds like a conditional,
122

122

00:06:24.758  -->  00:06:25.500
an if condition.
123

123

00:06:25.500  -->  00:06:29.677
If statement, so if (Input.,
124

124

00:06:29.677  -->  00:06:34.312
we're gonna use GetButtonDown).
125

125

00:06:34.312  -->  00:06:38.906
GetButtonDown, what's the button
that will be using if I
126

126

00:06:38.906  -->  00:06:41.541
get back to Unity up the top edit.
127

127

00:06:41.541  -->  00:06:42.672
Project settings and
128

128

00:06:42.672  -->  00:06:46.768
input as we do before without axis when
we are doing horizontal and vertical.
129

129

00:06:46.768  -->  00:06:49.720
You see there is a Fire1 option in here.
130

130

00:06:49.720  -->  00:06:52.966
Basically, saying we can
Fire option number one,
131

131

00:06:52.966  -->  00:06:56.067
there is also a Fire option number two and
three.
132

132

00:06:56.067  -->  00:06:58.692
We use Fire1, at the moment the button,
133

133

00:06:58.692  -->  00:07:03.117
we've got a positive button which
means do the thing, left control.
134

134

00:07:03.117  -->  00:07:06.531
While I'm here, I'm gonna change this to
space cuz I wanna shoot with my space bar.
135

135

00:07:06.531  -->  00:07:11.402
We can also have an alternate
positive button.
136

136

00:07:11.402  -->  00:07:16.641
Here we have a mouse, so at the moment, so
you can use the keyboard and the mouse.
137

137

00:07:16.641  -->  00:07:23.367
We look for our other Fire1 down here,
It's set up to use the joystick button 0.
138

138

00:07:23.367  -->  00:07:26.015
So at the moment,
we have it set up for keyboard,
139

139

00:07:26.015  -->  00:07:28.024
mouse and joystick, which is cool.
140

140

00:07:28.024  -->  00:07:31.547
And I just want to change from Ctrl
to Space for the button that I use.
141

141

00:07:31.547  -->  00:07:39.215
I like Fire1, this is the name of our
axis copy back over into our script and
142

142

00:07:39.215  -->  00:07:45.437
within GetButtonDown quotations and
then paste in Fire1.
143

143

00:07:45.437  -->  00:07:48.982
So what happens when we're
pushing down Fire1, in our case
144

144

00:07:48.982  -->  00:07:53.930
Fire1 is the space bar or the left mouse
button, well, give ourselves extra line.
145

145

00:07:53.930  -->  00:07:57.412
Open our curly braces,
we want to instantiate.
146

146

00:07:57.412  -->  00:07:59.066
So we want to create something.
147

147

00:07:59.066  -->  00:08:02.991
We're going to create or instantiate our
Prefab, our laser that we just created.
148

148

00:08:02.991  -->  00:08:05.245
So we'll say instantiate, and
149

149

00:08:05.245  -->  00:08:10.099
then we can see that there's a ton
of options for how we instantiate.
150

150

00:08:10.099  -->  00:08:13.279
What we'll do is say,
what's the thing we're instantiating?
151

151

00:08:13.279  -->  00:08:18.577
The laserPrefab, and
then where do we want it to be?
152

152

00:08:18.577  -->  00:08:25.881
We want it to be currently where
the player is, so transform.position.
153

153

00:08:25.881  -->  00:08:27.832
We might need to offset it a little bit.
154

154

00:08:27.832  -->  00:08:29.089
If were zoomed in closer,
155

155

00:08:29.089  -->  00:08:32.187
you might see that it's shooting
from the middle of the player.
156

156

00:08:32.187  -->  00:08:33.263
But for now, we'll see how it goes.
157

157

00:08:33.263  -->  00:08:35.258
It's probably moving pretty quickly and
we won't notice that.
158

158

00:08:35.258  -->  00:08:37.855
So we don't have to add
an offset just at the moment.
159

159

00:08:37.855  -->  00:08:41.128
And then comma, and this is where
we need to put in the rotation.
160

160

00:08:41.128  -->  00:08:46.416
Now we're putting in Quaternion,
Quaternion.identity,
161

161

00:08:46.416  -->  00:08:52.020
which basically is saying,
just use the rotation that you have.
162

162

00:08:52.020  -->  00:08:54.928
We don't need to apply any
rotation over the top of that.
163

163

00:08:54.928  -->  00:08:57.951
That's how we say, just no rotation,
164

164

00:08:57.951  -->  00:09:02.910
thanks very much,
Quaternion.identity and then semicolon.
165

165

00:09:02.910  -->  00:09:06.795
Let's save, jump over into Unity,
and see what that's gonna do for us.
166

166

00:09:06.795  -->  00:09:07.968
Click on Play.
167

167

00:09:12.861  -->  00:09:17.032
Okay, give a bit more space scene over
here, as I move around when I tap down,
168

168

00:09:17.032  -->  00:09:18.648
if I hold, nothing happens.
169

169

00:09:18.648  -->  00:09:22.011
If I tap,
it instantiates these laser beams, cool!
170

170

00:09:22.011  -->  00:09:23.591
Now, we haven't told it to do anything.
171

171

00:09:23.591  -->  00:09:26.448
We haven't said, go flying up,
[SOUND] into the screen.
172

172

00:09:26.448  -->  00:09:29.233
We also haven't told it to make
a [SOUND] noise just yet so
173

173

00:09:29.233  -->  00:09:31.608
that won't be happening just for
the moment.
174

174

00:09:31.608  -->  00:09:35.616
If we click on our Laser, the first
thing we need to do is to give ourselves
175

175

00:09:35.616  -->  00:09:38.532
a mechanism with which to
push it around the screen.
176

176

00:09:38.532  -->  00:09:40.721
That mechanism is a rigid body.
177

177

00:09:40.721  -->  00:09:44.912
Rigid bodies are important if we
want to move something around,
178

178

00:09:44.912  -->  00:09:49.739
so it's a rigid body, I already have
typed a rigid body 2D that we apply.
179

179

00:09:49.739  -->  00:09:52.750
Okay, and
then back over into our Player.cs,
180

180

00:09:52.750  -->  00:09:57.515
underneath our Instantiate, we need
to do something with our laserBeam.
181

181

00:09:57.515  -->  00:09:59.699
Well, at the moment
when it's instantiated,
182

182

00:09:59.699  -->  00:10:01.288
it's instantiated as an object.
183

183

00:10:01.288  -->  00:10:05.722
We want it to be a game object so
that we then have a handle or reference or
184

184

00:10:05.722  -->  00:10:09.942
way to do something more with
the thing we've just instantiated.
185

185

00:10:09.942  -->  00:10:15.302
So we're going to create our handle
by saying creating a new local
186

186

00:10:15.302  -->  00:10:21.449
variable of type GameObject which we
will call Laser= this instantiate.
187

187

00:10:21.449  -->  00:10:26.786
And at the end we want to say as
a GameObject, to make it very clear that
188

188

00:10:26.786  -->  00:10:31.771
we're creating this way,
constructing this as a GameObject.
189

189

00:10:31.771  -->  00:10:33.000
Now, this is a big old lines.
190

190

00:10:33.000  -->  00:10:37.377
What am I gonna do is put each of
this parameters on its own line.
191

191

00:10:37.377  -->  00:10:40.094
You can do it however you want,
we've talked about this before.
192

192

00:10:40.094  -->  00:10:43.202
Unity doesn't mind,
doesn't mind about the white space.
193

193

00:10:43.202  -->  00:10:46.954
But this I think, as on that other one,
nah we'll put it here.
194

194

00:10:46.954  -->  00:10:48.285
That's fine, yep, okay.
195

195

00:10:48.285  -->  00:10:50.732
So we just don't wanna go all the way
over to this side of the thing,
196

196

00:10:50.732  -->  00:10:51.841
it gets a little bit too long.
197

197

00:10:51.841  -->  00:10:55.107
And if I was to zoom in a bit, you guys,
wouldn't be able to see it at all.
198

198

00:10:55.107  -->  00:10:55.941
Save that up.
199

199

00:10:55.941  -->  00:11:00.884
So we now have, we changed this so that it
is a game object that we're instantiating.
200

200

00:11:00.884  -->  00:11:04.520
We also need to then say let's
move this GameObject, and
201

201

00:11:04.520  -->  00:11:07.642
the GameObject is laser,
but we won't do that.
202

202

00:11:07.642  -->  00:11:11.566
Well, first,
will have to get the component, and
203

203

00:11:11.566  -->  00:11:16.603
the component our interested in
is the Rigidbody2D, correct.
204

204

00:11:16.603  -->  00:11:18.487
What do we need to do
with the Rigidbody2D?
205

205

00:11:18.487  -->  00:11:21.822
We've done this before,
we need to give it some velocity.
206

206

00:11:21.822  -->  00:11:23.246
Velocity is gonna be what?
207

207

00:11:23.246  -->  00:11:28.179
Well, it's gonna be a new Vector2 And
208

208

00:11:28.179  -->  00:11:32.482
then the Vector2 is going to
be looking for an X and a Y.
209

209

00:11:32.482  -->  00:11:33.726
The X is the left-right.
210

210

00:11:33.726  -->  00:11:35.904
We don't need to do anything there so 0.
211

211

00:11:35.904  -->  00:11:39.614
And then the Y, we want to give it
some sort of speed that we can tune.
212

212

00:11:39.614  -->  00:11:44.365
So we'll call this a new variable
that will be called projectileSpeed?
213

213

00:11:44.365  -->  00:11:47.382
Yeah, projectileSpeed I think is good.
214

214

00:11:47.382  -->  00:11:50.886
We haven´t created that yet
so I'm going to copy this.
215

215

00:11:50.886  -->  00:11:55.591
Jump up to the top where we have our
configuration parameters serialized,
216

216

00:11:55.591  -->  00:11:56.645
not serialize.
217

217

00:11:56.645  -->  00:11:59.242
Why do I do that every time, apologies.
218

218

00:11:59.242  -->  00:12:03.654
SerializeField, this
will be of type float and
219

219

00:12:03.654  -->  00:12:07.085
paste into the projectileSpeed;.
220

220

00:12:07.085  -->  00:12:11.156
So this is our projectile speed,
I'm gonna initialize this at something so
221

221

00:12:11.156  -->  00:12:13.077
it´s not just sitting there at 0.
222

222

00:12:13.077  -->  00:12:14.451
I will initialize this at 10f.
223

223

00:12:14.451  -->  00:12:17.084
No idea, just having a guess.
224

224

00:12:17.084  -->  00:12:19.945
Put the f on there cuz it's a float case.
225

225

00:12:19.945  -->  00:12:23.749
Save this all up, just have a look
to make sure this looks cool.
226

226

00:12:23.749  -->  00:12:27.418
We're instantiating and then we're
telling it to have some velocity.
227

227

00:12:27.418  -->  00:12:31.130
Save, back over into Unity,
228

228

00:12:31.130  -->  00:12:35.439
click on Play and whatever we got.
229

229

00:12:35.439  -->  00:12:39.399
Okay, as I shoot on pushing my space bar,
we can see of course these kind of I'm
230

230

00:12:39.399  -->  00:12:42.049
lobbing some granites not
exactly what I want to do.
231

231

00:12:42.049  -->  00:12:44.740
So let's have a look at
the projectiles rigid body,
232

232

00:12:44.740  -->  00:12:46.583
there are two ways to resolve this.
233

233

00:12:46.583  -->  00:12:49.166
If we wanted to leave
the body type as dynamic, so
234

234

00:12:49.166  -->  00:12:52.551
that we could have some physics
applied to our laser beams.
235

235

00:12:52.551  -->  00:12:54.973
You might want to do that,
then let's have a look.
236

236

00:12:54.973  -->  00:12:57.014
We've got some linear drag,
we'll put that to 0.
237

237

00:12:57.014  -->  00:13:00.377
We don't want any drag, and
also we dont want any gravity.
238

238

00:13:00.377  -->  00:13:03.722
So this is where I'm gonna
override the global gravity and
239

239

00:13:03.722  -->  00:13:06.532
say no gravity on our lasers,
thanks very much.
240

240

00:13:06.532  -->  00:13:11.261
And arguably the better way to do this
would be just to change the body type to
241

241

00:13:11.261  -->  00:13:12.098
kinematic.
242

242

00:13:12.098  -->  00:13:15.911
That way we won't have any gravity
apply to our rigid body at all.
243

243

00:13:15.911  -->  00:13:18.848
Say, you just changed your
body type to kinematic,
244

244

00:13:18.848  -->  00:13:20.928
now click on Play it should go [SOUND].
245

245

00:13:20.928  -->  00:13:24.579
Nice and well I say we're not
doing a sound effect just yet.
246

246

00:13:24.579  -->  00:13:27.598
So it might go [SOUND] or
just go silently off in the distance.
247

247

00:13:27.598  -->  00:13:30.886
That looks very good, one last tip
I'll do, click on my player and
248

248

00:13:30.886  -->  00:13:32.312
find the projectile speed.
249

249

00:13:32.312  -->  00:13:34.111
Increase that to 20 for now.
250

250

00:13:34.111  -->  00:13:37.420
You can see that it's bold,
that means it's not applied to the prefab.
251

251

00:13:37.420  -->  00:13:41.032
We'll apply that back to the prefab,
click on Play,
252

252

00:13:41.032  -->  00:13:43.613
this should go flying off the screen.
253

253

00:13:43.613  -->  00:13:46.340
Nice, I think that's a good speed for
our laser at the moment.
254

254

00:13:46.340  -->  00:13:51.542
Now you notice if you hold down space,
or whatever you've told you want
255

255

00:13:51.542  -->  00:13:56.499
the fire to be, It fires just once,
cuz it's on key down just once.
256

256

00:13:56.499  -->  00:13:59.623
Now, if we want it to shoot
lots we have tap, tap, tap.
257

257

00:13:59.623  -->  00:14:01.734
Back in the day,
back when I was a youngster,
258

258

00:14:01.734  -->  00:14:03.521
this is how we had to play video games.
259

259

00:14:03.521  -->  00:14:06.636
Tap, tap, tap, tap,
cuz someone thought would be fun to do.
260

260

00:14:06.636  -->  00:14:11.058
It's not fun anymore to do that,
we want the player to be hold down and
261

261

00:14:11.058  -->  00:14:13.820
have our lasers fire as if we're tapping.
262

262

00:14:13.820  -->  00:14:15.790
And that will be the topic
of the next video.
263

263

00:14:15.790  -->  00:14:17.983
So great work in this video and
264

264

00:14:17.983  -->  00:14:23.167
I will see you when we're talking
about coroutines in the next video.
