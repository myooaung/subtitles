2

00:00:03.852  -->  00:00:07.235
In this lecture we're going to be
talking about animation transitions,
3

3

00:00:07.235  -->  00:00:08.770
to transition from jump to walk.
4

4

00:00:08.770  -->  00:00:12.100
So, our lizard jumps onto the screen,
and then starts walking.
5

5

00:00:12.100  -->  00:00:16.140
Excellent, let's jump in,
pardon the pun and get started.
6

6

00:00:16.140  -->  00:00:19.020
Okay, first thing I want to show you,
a bit of a neat trick.
7

7

00:00:19.020  -->  00:00:22.070
If you click on the game object
that has the animation on it,
8

8

00:00:22.070  -->  00:00:26.510
go to your animation window and
then see where we have lizard sprite.
9

9

00:00:26.510  -->  00:00:30.520
If you click on the little selector
thing next to that, you can see a mini,
10

10

00:00:30.520  -->  00:00:33.400
mini preview of what is
happening in that frame.
11

11

00:00:33.400  -->  00:00:36.080
And that will allow you to scrub
through your animations so
12

12

00:00:36.080  -->  00:00:39.170
you can see how that looks without
having to click the Play button.
13

13

00:00:39.170  -->  00:00:43.010
So that's a way to see the animation, if
I was to select and highlight a bunch of
14

14

00:00:43.010  -->  00:00:46.990
frames in here, I could drag all
of those frames down to the right.
15

15

00:00:46.990  -->  00:00:49.720
And then what would happen is
we'd do an animation, and then he
16

16

00:00:49.720  -->  00:00:53.220
would pause on that frame for a long time
and then go into the next animation.
17

17

00:00:53.220  -->  00:00:57.510
So you can play around with it and do a
little bit of finessing of different parts
18

18

00:00:57.510  -->  00:01:00.320
of the animation to stretch
out some periods of it.
19

19

00:01:00.320  -->  00:01:02.590
If you grab the end bar down the end here,
20

20

00:01:02.590  -->  00:01:05.560
see how there's a little handle at the
right and a little handle at the left when
21

21

00:01:05.560  -->  00:01:08.660
you've got these selected,
then it will stretch that part of it.
22

22

00:01:08.660  -->  00:01:11.990
So we could have it playing, playing,
and then a little bit slow, and
23

23

00:01:11.990  -->  00:01:12.880
then speed up again.
24

24

00:01:12.880  -->  00:01:15.390
So there's plenty of things you can do,
manually go and
25

25

00:01:15.390  -->  00:01:19.520
mess around with the speed and
the timing of the animation.
26

26

00:01:19.520  -->  00:01:23.860
Okay, next up what we're gonna do is,
import a new Sprite Sheet and
27

27

00:01:23.860  -->  00:01:27.370
slice it up, and I'd like for
you to do that as a challenge.
28

28

00:01:27.370  -->  00:01:31.420
But first of all, let's together go and
find all of the assets
29

29

00:01:31.420  -->  00:01:36.290
of the Sprite Sheet And while we're at it,
we'll do the audio as well.
30

30

00:01:36.290  -->  00:01:40.690
From the asset pack that I gave you in
the last lecture, the downloadable, so
31

31

00:01:40.690  -->  00:01:42.020
go and find this sprite sheet.
32

32

00:01:42.020  -->  00:01:45.040
Let's grab all those, so I don't have to
tell you each time I'm bringing in a new
33

33

00:01:45.040  -->  00:01:46.940
thing hey, I'm going to go and
bring in a new thing.
34

34

00:01:46.940  -->  00:01:48.060
Let's go bring it all in.
35

35

00:01:48.060  -->  00:01:49.800
So I'll highlight all
of the sprite sheets.
36

36

00:01:49.800  -->  00:01:52.710
I'll drag that into Sprites.
37

37

00:01:52.710  -->  00:01:55.766
Boink there they all are in there,
taking all of it made it,
38

38

00:01:55.766  -->  00:01:57.615
great I was just thinking about it.
39

39

00:01:57.615  -->  00:02:02.762
I will find my sounds and then,
while I'm here just go and
40

40

00:02:02.762  -->  00:02:07.490
drag whatever sounds of
music I've got into there.
41

41

00:02:09.030  -->  00:02:11.267
Okay, that might take awhile for
you as it imports it all,
42

42

00:02:11.267  -->  00:02:14.180
but I've gone and
imported all of my sounds in the Sprite.
43

43

00:02:14.180  -->  00:02:16.023
Let's get a look at the Sprite sheet,
44

44

00:02:16.023  -->  00:02:20.388
the one thing that I'm interested in for
this video is Lizard Jump.
45

45

00:02:20.388  -->  00:02:23.223
I've look at Lizard Jump,
there it is, just there.
46

46

00:02:23.223  -->  00:02:25.926
Okay, Lizard Jump and
it is one, two, three,
47

47

00:02:25.926  -->  00:02:30.400
by, one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 3 by 9.
48

48

00:02:30.400  -->  00:02:33.850
Okay, so that's the one I want you to
go and find that and import it and
49

49

00:02:33.850  -->  00:02:34.470
slice it up.
50

50

00:02:34.470  -->  00:02:35.770
Here's your challenge.
51

51

00:02:35.770  -->  00:02:37.080
Import a second sprite sheet, well,
52

52

00:02:37.080  -->  00:02:40.600
I just imported them all, made it
a little bit easier for myself there.
53

53

00:02:40.600  -->  00:02:44.970
Slice sprite sheet, so
slice the lizard jump sprite sheet,
54

54

00:02:44.970  -->  00:02:47.730
that's the one that I just pointed out,
lizard jump.
55

55

00:02:47.730  -->  00:02:52.203
By using a grid by cell size, so
last team we used automatic so
56

56

00:02:52.203  -->  00:02:55.537
I want you to find within
this bright editor,
57

57

00:02:55.537  -->  00:02:59.342
the grid by cell size and
make the cells equal size.
58

58

00:02:59.342  -->  00:03:03.638
And what I mean by that is find
the total width of our sprite sheet and
59

59

00:03:03.638  -->  00:03:07.055
divide that by the number
of columns that we want.
60

60

00:03:07.055  -->  00:03:11.125
So what's the total width of this, and
then we have how many columns, 1, 2, 3.
61

61

00:03:11.125  -->  00:03:13.340
Okay, so I hinted there might be 3.
62

62

00:03:13.340  -->  00:03:17.920
And then to figure out the total
height and divide by number of rows.
63

63

00:03:17.920  -->  00:03:20.990
And so that will give you the information
you need when you're looking at the grid
64

64

00:03:20.990  -->  00:03:21.880
by cell size.
65

65

00:03:21.880  -->  00:03:24.910
If that doesn't make sense, never fear,
we'll do that together, but
66

66

00:03:24.910  -->  00:03:26.730
I want you to go ahead and
give that your best shot.
67

67

00:03:26.730  -->  00:03:33.260
And also, create a new animation
from the individual sprites
68

68

00:03:33.260  -->  00:03:38.510
that you get when you slice it up, and to
make sure you can preview it and see it.
69

69

00:03:38.510  -->  00:03:40.791
So there is your mission,
if you choose to accept it and
70

70

00:03:40.791  -->  00:03:42.186
I will see you back here shortly.
71

71

00:03:44.467  -->  00:03:47.881
Okay, so as I said I've already found
lizard jump, I'm going to go ahead and
72

72

00:03:47.881  -->  00:03:50.890
drag, no I'm going to leave it there,
that's a fine place for it.
73

73

00:03:50.890  -->  00:03:55.060
This folder might get a little bit busy,
so you know what I will do, I will create
74

74

00:03:55.060  -->  00:03:59.130
a new folder in here, just right click,
create folder, and I'll call this lizard.
75

75

00:04:00.200  -->  00:04:04.040
And I will go and create another folder,
create folder, and
76

76

00:04:04.040  -->  00:04:09.070
I will call this, not in use.
77

77

00:04:09.070  -->  00:04:12.510
So, my logic here is any of the stuff
that I'm not currently using,
78

78

00:04:12.510  -->  00:04:18.240
I'll just drag it in, minus, I'm holding
on control or command, the Lizard Jump.
79

79

00:04:18.240  -->  00:04:22.000
I'll do the both bits of the Lizard Jump,
dragging that into the not in use.
80

80

00:04:23.690  -->  00:04:26.820
Okay and that's my little system,
I'll drag lizard jump into lizard.
81

81

00:04:26.820  -->  00:04:29.760
That's my little system so I know there's
something in the game, where is it?
82

82

00:04:29.760  -->  00:04:32.660
If it's in one of these folders
I'm using it in the game,
83

83

00:04:32.660  -->  00:04:35.300
if it's in this one then
I'm not using it yet.
84

84

00:04:35.300  -->  00:04:38.040
You can lay out however you want but
that's how it works for me.
85

85

00:04:38.040  -->  00:04:42.060
So we have lizard jump and you know what,
we also need, where's my other one,
86

86

00:04:42.060  -->  00:04:43.320
where's my other lizard in here?
87

87

00:04:43.320  -->  00:04:47.824
My Lizard Walk that we've already
sliced up, so drag that into lizard.
88

88

00:04:47.824  -->  00:04:53.150
Okay, there's walk and lizard jump,
let's click on lizard jump,
89

89

00:04:53.150  -->  00:05:00.070
and drag back down my preview, find our
sprite mode, change that to multiple.
90

90

00:05:00.070  -->  00:05:05.110
Click Apply, jump over into sprite editor
by clicking on the Sprite Editor button
91

91

00:05:05.110  -->  00:05:09.490
up to slice and
we want to slice grid by cell size, okay?
92

92

00:05:09.490  -->  00:05:12.855
I'm sure you found this in
the challenge but we're looking for
93

93

00:05:12.855  -->  00:05:16.475
the pixel size x by x, so when we
slice it up we want to slice up every,
94

94

00:05:16.475  -->  00:05:18.654
in this instance it would be every 64.
95

95

00:05:18.654  -->  00:05:21.571
So I'll just click slice, see what happens
here, there's no harm in doing that.
96

96

00:05:21.571  -->  00:05:26.466
Every 64 pixels it puts in a slice,
64 puts in a slice and same with the,
97

97

00:05:26.466  -->  00:05:31.049
from top to bottom, and bring my thing
back up, on the Y axis we slice,
98

98

00:05:31.049  -->  00:05:32.860
slice, slice every 64.
99

99

00:05:32.860  -->  00:05:35.710
Okay so you can see that's slicing
right in the middle of our character,
100

100

00:05:35.710  -->  00:05:37.740
that's no good, how do we figure this out?
101

101

00:05:37.740  -->  00:05:42.880
Well we go and find our sprite sheet
that we clicked on here, the lizard jump
102

102

00:05:42.880  -->  00:05:48.080
sprite sheet, and you can see down on
the bottom it says it's 753 by 1674.
103

103

00:05:48.080  -->  00:05:49.640
So we fire up the calculator.
104

104

00:05:51.000  -->  00:05:54.090
Calculator and 753, 753 divided by,
105

105

00:05:55.910  -->  00:05:59.580
well how many columns do we have?
106

106

00:05:59.580  -->  00:06:06.880
We have three, and that equals 251,
so each of these needs to be 251.
107

107

00:06:06.880  -->  00:06:09.310
Assuming that our artist,
whoever created this, and
108

108

00:06:09.310  -->  00:06:12.500
we don't know who made it,
laid them out in equal position.
109

109

00:06:12.500  -->  00:06:16.450
If this is just a big hodge-podge
of things just everywhere,
110

110

00:06:16.450  -->  00:06:19.170
then it won't work so well, but we can
see it's been laid out nice and neatly.
111

111

00:06:19.170  -->  00:06:21.980
You can see the little,
the portal thing the lizard's jumping out
112

112

00:06:21.980  -->  00:06:25.150
of is in the same spot in
each of these columns.
113

113

00:06:25.150  -->  00:06:30.090
Okay, so 251, we'll write that down,
and then height, here is 1674.
114

114

00:06:30.090  -->  00:06:34.336
You can see down in the bottom right, so
115

115

00:06:34.336  -->  00:06:39.180
1674, divided by, and we have nine,
116

116

00:06:39.180  -->  00:06:43.860
I counted those up before, equals 186,
so write that down as well.
117

117

00:06:44.880  -->  00:06:50.310
Excellent, op and up in my slice up here,
we want to have 251 by 186,
118

118

00:06:50.310  -->  00:06:54.790
I'm gonna click on the Slice.
119

119

00:06:54.790  -->  00:07:00.420
Now when I click on any of these you
can see it looks pretty darn good.
120

120

00:07:00.420  -->  00:07:05.600
Okay so let's click on Apply,
close that down, jump back over into here.
121

121

00:07:05.600  -->  00:07:09.924
We've got our jump highlight all
of the jump frames, right-click,
122

122

00:07:09.924  -->  00:07:12.225
create animation.
123

123

00:07:12.225  -->  00:07:15.820
Boink, 1 to 4,
I'll call this animation Lizard Jump.
124

124

00:07:17.310  -->  00:07:20.480
Drag Lizard Jump animation
into my animations folder.
125

125

00:07:21.800  -->  00:07:24.800
Now we have Lizard Jump and
Lizard Walk, excellent.
126

126

00:07:24.800  -->  00:07:27.100
Now, if I click on Lizard Jump,
you can see the little,
127

127

00:07:27.100  -->  00:07:31.770
little preview that I showed you before,
it's looking nice and tidy.
128

128

00:07:31.770  -->  00:07:34.610
And then, how do we preview this,
well, we grab our lizard game object,
129

129

00:07:34.610  -->  00:07:36.780
drag it over into our preview window,
130

130

00:07:36.780  -->  00:07:39.720
and then when we click on play,
whoops, zoom out a little bit.
131

131

00:07:39.720  -->  00:07:42.880
The lizard jumps and
then lands, excellent.
132

132

00:07:42.880  -->  00:07:45.188
It's all nicely positioned,
I think it looks good.
133

133

00:07:45.188  -->  00:07:49.030
Okay, next that we want to add, so
134

134

00:07:49.030  -->  00:07:54.230
that was the challenge, next that we wanna
add this to our animator controller.
135

135

00:07:54.230  -->  00:07:58.490
So our lizard has an animator controller,
we view that within the animator window
136

136

00:07:58.490  -->  00:08:02.210
here, and you can see at the moment
we just have our lizard walk.
137

137

00:08:02.210  -->  00:08:06.610
I'll give myself a little bit of space,
excellent, now we wanna put in the jump.
138

138

00:08:06.610  -->  00:08:10.910
So what we wanna do is the lizard jumps
from probably off screen here, or not off
139

139

00:08:10.910  -->  00:08:15.350
screen but from the right, and jumps
into this frame and then starts walking.
140

140

00:08:15.350  -->  00:08:19.010
So we need to have a transition, we need
to say, start with the jump animation and
141

141

00:08:19.010  -->  00:08:22.150
then transition into the walk animation.
142

142

00:08:22.150  -->  00:08:26.550
This line here is a transition from
entries going straight into walk.
143

143

00:08:26.550  -->  00:08:30.230
So basically it's starting in walk
the first thing that happens, and
144

144

00:08:30.230  -->  00:08:32.560
we wanna change that,
we wanna go straight into jump.
145

145

00:08:32.560  -->  00:08:36.260
I'm gonna click on lizard walk,
delete that and start this afresh.
146

146

00:08:36.260  -->  00:08:40.160
Drag in lizard jump, and now
automatically it says going from entry,
147

147

00:08:40.160  -->  00:08:43.680
the very first thing I do is
the lizard jump, which is good.
148

148

00:08:43.680  -->  00:08:45.700
Let's just click play to
see if that's working.
149

149

00:08:48.820  -->  00:08:52.340
Was it does, it jump, boink, and
there it is, perfect, excellent.
150

150

00:08:52.340  -->  00:08:55.145
Now we want to go to lizard
jump to lizard walk.
151

151

00:08:55.145  -->  00:08:58.210
Mini challenge for you if you can
figure this out how to do that.
152

152

00:08:59.740  -->  00:09:02.312
Okay, that was me pausing if you
wanted to take this on as a challenge.
153

153

00:09:02.312  -->  00:09:05.574
What I'll do is drag in lizard walk,
you can put it anywhere in here,
154

154

00:09:05.574  -->  00:09:06.600
it doesn't matter.
155

155

00:09:06.600  -->  00:09:10.730
I can move things out of the way, it's all
about the connected line relationship as
156

156

00:09:10.730  -->  00:09:12.020
opposed to where they're positioned.
157

157

00:09:12.020  -->  00:09:17.500
If you're wondering what any state means,
that's if you want to have an animation
158

158

00:09:17.500  -->  00:09:23.130
where you say for example from any state
at all, if the character gets shot.
159

159

00:09:23.130  -->  00:09:27.310
We want that character to change animation
to do like a recoil or like a death or
160

160

00:09:27.310  -->  00:09:32.910
something, then you can have the any
state transition into these other states.
161

161

00:09:32.910  -->  00:09:35.716
So that's why any state is there,
just as a handy way to say,
162

162

00:09:35.716  -->  00:09:39.080
anything can go into state or
any state can go into anything else.
163

163

00:09:39.080  -->  00:09:41.830
So we're not gonna use that at
the moment so just ignore that for now.
164

164

00:09:41.830  -->  00:09:44.463
What we'll do is right click on
lizard jump, make transition,
165

165

00:09:44.463  -->  00:09:47.071
drag it to lizard walk as simple as that,
do that one more time.
166

166

00:09:47.071  -->  00:09:50.742
So right click and
the animation you want to go from,
167

167

00:09:50.742  -->  00:09:55.430
click on Make Transition and
them move your arrow around.
168

168

00:09:55.430  -->  00:09:58.020
So I'm not holding my mouse
button down just yet,
169

169

00:09:58.020  -->  00:09:59.940
I'm now hovering around over to go.
170

170

00:09:59.940  -->  00:10:02.030
It will snap and
then I click my mouse button,
171

171

00:10:02.030  -->  00:10:06.180
and now it's making a transition
from Lizard Jump into Lizard Walk.
172

172

00:10:06.180  -->  00:10:09.220
Lizard Jump,
let's just have a look at that animation.
173

173

00:10:09.220  -->  00:10:12.010
Okay, it's not looping,
that's important, we're gonna say,
174

174

00:10:12.010  -->  00:10:15.880
whenever you finish lizard jump,
then just go straight to lizard walk.
175

175

00:10:15.880  -->  00:10:19.100
We'll get more complicated with
our transitions in the future,
176

176

00:10:19.100  -->  00:10:22.320
where we have a condition in the game
that will change the animation, but for
177

177

00:10:22.320  -->  00:10:24.880
now we're just saying finish the jump,
go into walk.
178

178

00:10:24.880  -->  00:10:28.000
Okay, back to clicking
on this transition here.
179

179

00:10:28.000  -->  00:10:30.560
Okay, when you click on the transition,
you get a whole bunch of information,
180

180

00:10:30.560  -->  00:10:32.530
a whole bunch of stuff going on.
181

181

00:10:32.530  -->  00:10:35.890
We can see up here, the lizard jump
to lizard walk is the transition.
182

182

00:10:35.890  -->  00:10:39.780
We can turn it off, we can delete it,
we can do a few other cool things up here.
183

183

00:10:39.780  -->  00:10:45.110
And then we have this little settings
selector that allows you to open it up.
184

184

00:10:45.110  -->  00:10:50.070
And then this window is showing us where
our transition is going to take place.
185

185

00:10:50.070  -->  00:10:53.210
This is a little bit more relevant
when you've got 3D animation, and
186

186

00:10:53.210  -->  00:10:55.200
you can blend from one state to the other.
187

187

00:10:55.200  -->  00:10:58.590
So if an arm is up in the air and
then an arm is down by the side, and
188

188

00:10:58.590  -->  00:11:01.726
then you want to blend the two together,
and it will blend it more neatly.
189

189

00:11:01.726  -->  00:11:04.960
But with our 2D sprites, it's a little
bit more that it just pops from one to
190

190

00:11:04.960  -->  00:11:08.390
another, so don't worry about
having this blended overlap here.
191

191

00:11:08.390  -->  00:11:11.680
So the transition duration,
I am going to turn that to 0 and
192

192

00:11:11.680  -->  00:11:15.630
the exit time I'll put to 1
saying after you get the whole
193

193

00:11:15.630  -->  00:11:20.900
way through doing a lizard jump
then go in and do lizard walk.
194

194

00:11:20.900  -->  00:11:26.060
So let's see if this works now just as is,
click on play.
195

195

00:11:26.060  -->  00:11:29.260
Jump and then, walk, walk, walk, okay, so
196

196

00:11:29.260  -->  00:11:33.960
one problem it snaps up to the top,
can you figure out why that is?
197

197

00:11:33.960  -->  00:11:38.550
Here's another challenge for you,
figure out why our lizard has
198

198

00:11:38.550  -->  00:11:42.510
snapped to a slightly different position
and then is playing its animation.
199

199

00:11:42.510  -->  00:11:46.020
So if you've been through animation before
you might already have a thought on this,
200

200

00:11:46.020  -->  00:11:48.580
so pause the video,
see if you can figure that out.
201

201

00:11:50.610  -->  00:11:54.450
Okay, hopefully you gave that a shot,
and let's have a look at it together.
202

202

00:11:54.450  -->  00:11:58.884
So if I have a look at my lizard walk
animation, specifically if I go and
203

203

00:11:58.884  -->  00:12:00.471
look at my sprite sheet.
204

204

00:12:00.471  -->  00:12:07.930
Go to Lizard and then look for
Lizard Walk, click on my sprite editor.
205

205

00:12:07.930  -->  00:12:11.360
If you remember,
we did a slice automatically.
206

206

00:12:11.360  -->  00:12:14.980
And, the reason we did automatic is well,
we only had this animation and
207

207

00:12:14.980  -->  00:12:17.970
we wanted to have it nice and
tightly framed around it.
208

208

00:12:17.970  -->  00:12:20.540
So this method worked when
it was just this lizard and
209

209

00:12:20.540  -->  00:12:24.600
we didn't have to go from animation A,
the jump, to animation B, the walk.
210

210

00:12:24.600  -->  00:12:28.080
So in this case we can't just do
automatic where we're tightly cropped
211

211

00:12:28.080  -->  00:12:28.810
around the lizard.
212

212

00:12:28.810  -->  00:12:30.550
That would be fine normally, but
213

213

00:12:30.550  -->  00:12:33.860
we need to have it consistent with
what the lizard jump is doing.
214

214

00:12:33.860  -->  00:12:38.458
So then we go back up to Slice,
Automatic, Grid by Cell Size.
215

215

00:12:38.458  -->  00:12:43.113
So let's just quickly click on our
lizard walk sprite sheet, open that up,
216

216

00:12:43.113  -->  00:12:45.233
see what the dimension there are.
217

217

00:12:45.233  -->  00:12:48.351
753, that was the same as before, so
218

218

00:12:48.351  -->  00:12:53.040
753 divided to by 3 going to
be 251 as we had last time.
219

219

00:12:53.040  -->  00:12:57.433
So slice 251, and
then let's just check up and
220

220

00:12:57.433  -->  00:13:01.833
down, it's 1116, where is my calculator?
221

221

00:13:01.833  -->  00:13:04.056
Get my calculator back.
222

222

00:13:04.056  -->  00:13:08.152
1116 divided by, and we've got one,
two, three, four, five,
223

223

00:13:08.152  -->  00:13:13.090
six underneath that, six, 186, okay,
it's exactly the same as it was before.
224

224

00:13:13.090  -->  00:13:15.035
That is perfect, I like to see that.
225

225

00:13:15.035  -->  00:13:21.003
By 186, click on slice, now you can
see it's a much bigger footprint but
226

226

00:13:21.003  -->  00:13:25.190
the lizard is in consistent
position each time.
227

227

00:13:25.190  -->  00:13:28.388
And not surprisingly if it was
to jump out of a hole here,
228

228

00:13:28.388  -->  00:13:29.962
[SOUND] it lands just there.
229

229

00:13:29.962  -->  00:13:34.294
Okay, click Apply, close that window,
I clicked Apply, but
230

230

00:13:34.294  -->  00:13:37.663
click Apply again a couple of times,
here we go.
231

231

00:13:37.663  -->  00:13:41.294
Okay, so we don't need to do anything
else, just slicing it up differently,
232

232

00:13:41.294  -->  00:13:43.670
the animation system knows that,
it's all cool.
233

233

00:13:43.670  -->  00:13:48.703
If we click on Play, now it should jump,
I only play that once and
234

234

00:13:48.703  -->  00:13:52.075
then [SOUND] click in
to looping on the walk.
235

235

00:13:52.075  -->  00:13:55.822
Excellent, the only last thing here,
it looks like the jump is coming
236

236

00:13:55.822  -->  00:13:58.825
up pretty slowly so
let's find the animation for jump.
237

237

00:13:58.825  -->  00:14:02.210
And you can see,
we can see when clicking on lizard,
238

238

00:14:02.210  -->  00:14:05.790
we've got the jump just here,
yep, that's the jump animation.
239

239

00:14:05.790  -->  00:14:08.780
I might make this 24 samples as well,
240

240

00:14:08.780  -->  00:14:12.530
I think we're just gonna do everything 24
cuz it looks like that's how the artist
241

241

00:14:12.530  -->  00:14:16.080
created all this animation with
the expectation of 24 per frame.
242

242

00:14:16.080  -->  00:14:20.740
Okay, cool so we've got our jump
transitioning into our walk, which means
243

243

00:14:20.740  -->  00:14:24.890
that we've got some great stuff for
our lizard emerging onto the screen.
244

244

00:14:24.890  -->  00:14:27.750
Excellent, well done,
that's introduction to transitions and
245

245

00:14:27.750  -->  00:14:28.810
I'll see you in the next video.
