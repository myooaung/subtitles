[MUSIC]
2

2

00:00:03,958  -->  00:00:06,176
Next up,
we're gonna be getting funky with Unity.
3

3

00:00:06,176  -->  00:00:09,500
We're gonna start off nice and gentle,
looking at the Unity layout, and
4

4

00:00:09,500  -->  00:00:13,316
the windows, and the different components
of Unity that are most important for us.
5

5

00:00:13,316  -->  00:00:17,147
And then we're going to be creating
something that is called a scriptable
6

6

00:00:17,147  -->  00:00:19,928
object, or
specifically many scriptable objects,
7

7

00:00:19,928  -->  00:00:23,716
in order to contain the data for
the game that we're gonna be working on.
8

8

00:00:23,716  -->  00:00:26,860
And that game is going to
be simple text adventure.
9

9

00:00:26,860  -->  00:00:30,710
And so by creating a text adventure,
we'll be understanding more about state
10

10

00:00:30,710  -->  00:00:33,920
machines, and how different
states can lead to other states.
11

11

00:00:33,920  -->  00:00:37,786
And how our state machine can only be in
this one state at a certain point in time.
12

12

00:00:37,786  -->  00:00:41,190
So we're gonna be looking
at Unity specifically, but
13

13

00:00:41,190  -->  00:00:45,926
also continuing to emphasize our coding,
and our scripting, and our C#.
14

14

00:00:45,926  -->  00:00:47,684
I wanna mention something at this point,
15

15

00:00:47,684  -->  00:00:50,246
just very briefly,
that as you'll go through this course,
16

16

00:00:50,246  -->  00:00:52,880
you might have different things
that you're interested in.
17

17

00:00:52,880  -->  00:00:55,470
You might be saying, well,
I really wanna become a programmer, so
18

18

00:00:55,470  -->  00:00:57,250
just show me the programming stuff.
19

19

00:00:57,250  -->  00:00:59,600
Or you might be the sort of person
who's saying, you know what?
20

20

00:00:59,600  -->  00:01:01,810
I'd like to know a little bit
more about game design and
21

21

00:01:01,810  -->  00:01:04,440
how I make a really cool game,
that's why I'm here.
22

22

00:01:04,440  -->  00:01:08,170
So the course has been broken
down into roughly 50% of
23

23

00:01:08,170  -->  00:01:12,970
the course is focusing on let's do
programming, let's talk C#, coding.
24

24

00:01:12,970  -->  00:01:16,820
So about 50%, and
only about 40% is focusing on Unity.
25

25

00:01:16,820  -->  00:01:20,050
How to use the Unity engine,
how to get the most out of it,
26

26

00:01:20,050  -->  00:01:23,310
how the different components work,
new aspects in Unity.
27

27

00:01:23,310  -->  00:01:25,320
And then you might be
sitting there saying, 50,
28

28

00:01:25,320  -->  00:01:27,920
40 hopefully there's another
10% floating around.
29

29

00:01:27,920  -->  00:01:31,520
There is, the other 10% is where
we'll talk about game design, and
30

30

00:01:31,520  -->  00:01:34,956
game production, and how to make
a compelling player experience.
31

31

00:01:34,956  -->  00:01:38,376
Cuz we assume that in addition to
wanting to be good at programming, and
32

32

00:01:38,376  -->  00:01:40,656
learn programming, and
to understand Unity,
33

33

00:01:40,656  -->  00:01:43,626
that you also have an interest
in learning about video games.
34

34

00:01:43,626  -->  00:01:47,244
And how to create interesting video games
that might just be for yourself, or
35

35

00:01:47,244  -->  00:01:49,469
might be something you
give to other people, or
36

36

00:01:49,469  -->  00:01:52,935
maybe one day you would like to make
a career out of making video games.
37

37

00:01:52,935  -->  00:01:54,008
We're not gonna go that big.
38

38

00:01:54,008  -->  00:01:57,760
For now, we're just looking at the
fundamentals, and we're starting to have
39

39

00:01:57,760  -->  00:02:00,885
that conversation about,
how do you something that's not just,
40

40

00:02:00,885  -->  00:02:04,780
yay, I did a thing, but doing something
that could be interesting to the player.
41

41

00:02:04,780  -->  00:02:07,460
So we'll be scattering through some
of those game design conversations
42

42

00:02:07,460  -->  00:02:10,310
throughout this section and
throughout the sections following this.
43

43

00:02:10,310  -->  00:02:11,103
Just wanted to give you a heads up.
44

44

00:02:11,103  -->  00:02:14,848
If it's not your cup of tea, if it's not
the sort of thing you're interested in,
45

45

00:02:14,848  -->  00:02:16,856
then go through a little
bit more quickly and
46

46

00:02:16,856  -->  00:02:19,120
don't put as much time
into the challenges.
47

47

00:02:19,120  -->  00:02:22,010
But if it's something you're excited about
and something maybe you haven't done a lot
48

48

00:02:22,010  -->  00:02:24,800
of before,
then it's really good to dig into it.
49

49

00:02:24,800  -->  00:02:28,710
And take the opportunity to really flex
your creative muscles when it comes to
50

50

00:02:28,710  -->  00:02:31,470
the game production,
game design aspects of the course.
51

51

00:02:31,470  -->  00:02:35,320
And of course continue working on
the challenges for the coding and for
52

52

00:02:35,320  -->  00:02:36,220
the programming.
53

53

00:02:36,220  -->  00:02:39,710
That's the way that you learn, that's how
you get better is by doing the challenges.
54

54

00:02:39,710  -->  00:02:43,420
So let's dive in and
make ourselves a text adventure game.
