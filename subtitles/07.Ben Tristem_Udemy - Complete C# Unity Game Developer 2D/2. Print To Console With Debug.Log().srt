00:00:03,940  -->  00:00:04,930
Hello and welcome.
2

2

00:00:04,930  -->  00:00:09,040
I'm really excited for us to start getting
our hands dirty with our C# coding.
3

3

00:00:09,040  -->  00:00:12,510
In this video we are going to
create four simple statements
4

4

00:00:12,510  -->  00:00:14,920
that print out to
the console using debug.log.
5

5

00:00:14,920  -->  00:00:17,220
Let's jump in and get started.
6

6

00:00:17,220  -->  00:00:19,500
Okay, let's start by creating
ourselves a new project.
7

7

00:00:19,500  -->  00:00:23,150
You can see from Unity Hub,
we click on the New button.
8

8

00:00:23,150  -->  00:00:28,392
As we did previously, and we will name
our project NumberWizard Console.
9

9

00:00:28,392  -->  00:00:33,100
NumberWizard Console,
Because we are creating
10

10

00:00:33,100  -->  00:00:36,550
a small little game called NumberWizard
and we're focusing just on the console.
11

11

00:00:36,550  -->  00:00:41,230
In terms of location, we'll find our
repo's Unity 2D as we did in our
12

12

00:00:41,230  -->  00:00:45,730
previous very quick project that
we set up in our intro setup.
13

13

00:00:45,730  -->  00:00:48,640
And I've already created a NumberWizard
Console, if you haven't done that
14

14

00:00:48,640  -->  00:00:51,960
create a new folder or
you can do right-click new folder.
15

15

00:00:51,960  -->  00:00:52,820
Create a new folder.
16

16

00:00:52,820  -->  00:00:56,040
Click on that once or double-click it,
either way works just fine.
17

17

00:00:56,040  -->  00:00:57,780
And then select project.
18

18

00:00:57,780  -->  00:01:02,437
Make sure the template is 2D and
then create project.
19

19

00:01:02,437  -->  00:01:04,090
Wait for Unity to load up.
20

20

00:01:04,090  -->  00:01:06,790
I might skip ahead of this so
you don't have to watch me loading Unity.
21

21

00:01:06,790  -->  00:01:07,868
I will see you in a moment.
22

22

00:01:10,850  -->  00:01:13,157
Okay, while Unity is still loading,
not a problem,
23

23

00:01:13,157  -->  00:01:16,300
I'm going to tell you a little bit
about what we're doing with our game.
24

24

00:01:16,300  -->  00:01:18,910
So here's the game flow for NumberWizard.
25

25

00:01:18,910  -->  00:01:23,200
It's a very basic game where we start
off with asking the player to think
26

26

00:01:23,200  -->  00:01:25,720
of a number between a minimum and
a maximum.
27

27

00:01:25,720  -->  00:01:28,090
So for example between one and 1000.
28

28

00:01:28,090  -->  00:01:31,820
We say think of a number and
then we give a guess to the player.
29

29

00:01:31,820  -->  00:01:35,882
We say we think your number is this and
the way we come up with our number.
30

30

00:01:35,882  -->  00:01:39,310
We're gonna program this together,
is taking the minimum and
31

31

00:01:39,310  -->  00:01:41,050
adding the maximum and dividing by 2.
32

32

00:01:41,050  -->  00:01:47,003
So if it's between 1 and 1,000 this will
give us 1,001 divided by 2 which is 500,
33

33

00:01:47,003  -->  00:01:49,880
and if we round it down
then it becomes 500.
34

34

00:01:49,880  -->  00:01:51,600
So that would be our guess.
35

35

00:01:51,600  -->  00:01:53,010
And we ask the player,
36

36

00:01:53,010  -->  00:01:56,410
Is your number higher the now
number lower the now number?
37

37

00:01:56,410  -->  00:01:59,990
Sorry I should say lower than higher
than the now number, or is it correct?
38

38

00:01:59,990  -->  00:02:02,350
And if the player says it's
correct then we start again.
39

39

00:02:02,350  -->  00:02:05,050
Okay, think of a new number between 1 and
1000.
40

40

00:02:05,050  -->  00:02:10,070
If the player inputs lower or higher,
then we have another guess and
41

41

00:02:10,070  -->  00:02:13,660
we repeat this loop in here
until we get the correct number.
42

42

00:02:13,660  -->  00:02:17,410
Let me show you that very briefly with
numbers in there, so Between 1 and 1000,
43

43

00:02:17,410  -->  00:02:18,230
I guess is 500.
44

44

00:02:18,230  -->  00:02:21,260
The player in this instance says,
no, it's lower.
45

45

00:02:21,260  -->  00:02:23,950
And then we take the lower
portion of that.
46

46

00:02:23,950  -->  00:02:27,830
So between 1 and 500, and
our guess becomes 250.
47

47

00:02:27,830  -->  00:02:30,440
It's a very simple little
binary search mechanism.
48

48

00:02:30,440  -->  00:02:32,990
But is pretty cool as outstanding project.
49

49

00:02:32,990  -->  00:02:37,380
And now actions in this video will also
form your challenge in this particular
50

50

00:02:37,380  -->  00:02:41,570
lecture is to print the following to
the console using your own words.
51

51

00:02:41,570  -->  00:02:42,890
We're going to welcome the player.
52

52

00:02:42,890  -->  00:02:44,070
We're gonna ask them to pick a number.
53

53

00:02:44,070  -->  00:02:47,070
We're gonna say the highest
number you can choose is this and
54

54

00:02:47,070  -->  00:02:48,720
the lowest you can choose is that.
55

55

00:02:48,720  -->  00:02:51,360
So that's what we're gonna take on and
that's what you're going to be doing.
56

56

00:02:51,360  -->  00:02:53,340
Pretty simple challenge
later on in this video.
57

57

00:02:53,340  -->  00:02:55,040
So let's jump back over into Unity.
58

58

00:02:55,040  -->  00:02:56,820
Hopefully it's loaded up for you now.
59

59

00:02:56,820  -->  00:02:59,580
And you can see it's our default
layout as I've mentioned in
60

60

00:02:59,580  -->  00:03:01,190
the intro section of the video.
61

61

00:03:01,190  -->  00:03:03,970
If you're not seeing what I'm seeing,
come up to the top right, right here and
62

62

00:03:03,970  -->  00:03:05,300
select default.
63

63

00:03:05,300  -->  00:03:08,710
After you've done that we're
going to gravity console window.
64

64

00:03:08,710  -->  00:03:11,160
Click on console and
have a look at it down there.
65

65

00:03:11,160  -->  00:03:12,790
We've got a few buttons down here.
66

66

00:03:12,790  -->  00:03:16,370
We don't need to worry about those at the
moment, we've got Clear, Collapse, etc.
67

67

00:03:16,370  -->  00:03:19,270
For now, we need to have a quick
look over in the right here.
68

68

00:03:19,270  -->  00:03:21,000
You can see there's three buttons here.
69

69

00:03:21,000  -->  00:03:25,790
The first one is showing us any sort of
log that's going to print to our screen.
70

70

00:03:25,790  -->  00:03:28,720
The next one is showing us the errors and
sorry, the warnings.
71

71

00:03:28,720  -->  00:03:31,800
And the next one is showing as error,
so if you've turned them off,
72

72

00:03:31,800  -->  00:03:34,590
you won't see anything
printed in the console.
73

73

00:03:34,590  -->  00:03:38,100
If you have them turned on then you
will see those respective things,
74

74

00:03:38,100  -->  00:03:41,990
so if you click it on and click all of
three of them on you'll see all of those.
75

75

00:03:41,990  -->  00:03:43,260
Just a bit of a little bit of a gotcha,
76

76

00:03:43,260  -->  00:03:46,120
if you find you're not seeing what
we are printing to the console,
77

77

00:03:46,120  -->  00:03:49,970
there is a good chance that this
particular button has been switched off.
78

78

00:03:49,970  -->  00:03:53,640
Now what I want you to do is
grab the console, left-click and
79

79

00:03:53,640  -->  00:03:55,810
drag it up over into the right-hand side.
80

80

00:03:55,810  -->  00:03:58,260
We'll put it up here so
that we've got more
81

81

00:03:58,260  -->  00:04:01,970
vertical real estate where we can see what
is being printed out into our console.
82

82

00:04:01,970  -->  00:04:03,440
We're mostly using it over here,
83

83

00:04:03,440  -->  00:04:06,190
we're not gonna be using this
side of our screen just yet.
84

84

00:04:06,190  -->  00:04:09,490
In the next section, we'll be digging into
Unity and looking at all the different
85

85

00:04:09,490  -->  00:04:12,840
Windows and buttons and mechanism and
all the awesome stuff of Unity.
86

86

00:04:12,840  -->  00:04:17,440
For now we are focusing just on the C#, so
we can get our hands dirty with coding.
87

87

00:04:17,440  -->  00:04:21,750
So the next step is for us to create
a script if you come down to assets area
88

88

00:04:21,750  -->  00:04:26,600
down here, right click,
create a C# script.
89

89

00:04:26,600  -->  00:04:27,990
And before doing anything else, and
90

90

00:04:27,990  -->  00:04:32,920
before clicking anywhere else, type in
NumberWizard, capital N, capital W,
91

91

00:04:32,920  -->  00:04:37,420
no spaces in between that, whenever
we create a script there's no spaces.
92

92

00:04:37,420  -->  00:04:40,023
Hit Enter,
then double click on your script,
93

93

00:04:40,023  -->  00:04:46,634
that will open up Visual Studio And
we see all of the standard information
94

94

00:04:46,634  -->  00:04:51,030
that Unity puts within a script as
a default when we first start a script.
95

95

00:04:51,030  -->  00:04:54,520
What we're going to focus on is jumping
straight into the start method and
96

96

00:04:54,520  -->  00:04:58,810
writing out content in here, we're
going to write some statements in here.
97

97

00:04:58,810  -->  00:05:02,020
And our first statement
is going to be Debug.Log.
98

98

00:05:02,020  -->  00:05:07,700
So follow along with me here,
capital D, Debug .Log, L-O-G, and
99

99

00:05:07,700  -->  00:05:13,150
then open brackets,
put in the quotation marks and then we're
100

100

00:05:13,150  -->  00:05:19,081
going to type something along the lines
of, ("Welcome to number wizard, yo").
101

101

00:05:19,081  -->  00:05:21,310
[LAUGH] Maybe not the yo.
102

102

00:05:21,310  -->  00:05:22,270
Yeah, we'll put the yo in there.
103

103

00:05:22,270  -->  00:05:26,080
We'll pretend we're gangsta, even though
I'm totally as ungagster as you can get.
104

104

00:05:26,080  -->  00:05:28,580
And then we need a semicolon down the end.
105

105

00:05:28,580  -->  00:05:30,720
So here's our first statement.
106

106

00:05:30,720  -->  00:05:32,230
We've written our statement here.
107

107

00:05:32,230  -->  00:05:35,990
Now you might say if you went through our
intro section, which hopefully you did,
108

108

00:05:35,990  -->  00:05:39,150
you might say well, didn't we do
exactly the same thing with print?
109

109

00:05:39,150  -->  00:05:42,531
So print and
debug work pretty much the same way.
110

110

00:05:42,531  -->  00:05:48,388
We could have written
print("Welcome to number wizard,
111

111

00:05:48,388  -->  00:05:53,550
etc, wizard..." and so
on and then semicolon.
112

112

00:05:53,550  -->  00:05:57,452
We could have done the same thing,
we're using Debug.log because
113

113

00:05:57,452  -->  00:06:02,180
it gives us a little bit more flexibility
and control Later on in the course.
114

114

00:06:02,180  -->  00:06:05,300
So for now, you don't need to understand
why we're using it instead of print.
115

115

00:06:05,300  -->  00:06:06,340
We can use both of them.
116

116

00:06:06,340  -->  00:06:08,460
If you jump around the Internet,
you'll see print a lot.
117

117

00:06:08,460  -->  00:06:09,750
It's totally valid.
118

118

00:06:09,750  -->  00:06:15,060
But for us, we're doing it the slightly
technically better more correct way so
119

119

00:06:15,060  -->  00:06:17,390
that in the future we've got good habits.
120

120

00:06:17,390  -->  00:06:19,520
And we know that debug.log
is going to work for
121

121

00:06:19,520  -->  00:06:22,810
us in all the different situations where
we need it to work and that's why we're
122

122

00:06:22,810  -->  00:06:27,340
using it now instead of print so type
in debug.log in the statement in here.
123

123

00:06:27,340  -->  00:06:30,750
Save that and
then go back over into Unity.
124

124

00:06:30,750  -->  00:06:35,420
The other step we need to do is
attach our script to a game object.
125

125

00:06:35,420  -->  00:06:40,890
If you see sample scene up here, if you
open that up, we've got a main camera and
126

126

00:06:40,890  -->  00:06:44,650
as we did in the intro, you can either
drag your script straight onto there or
127

127

00:06:44,650  -->  00:06:48,130
when you've clicked on main camera,
come back over here to inspector.
128

128

00:06:48,130  -->  00:06:51,810
So you've clicked on inspector and
drag your script over into the inspector,
129

129

00:06:51,810  -->  00:06:55,120
which is the same thing as
dragging it over onto main camera.
130

130

00:06:55,120  -->  00:06:58,550
You can see now that our sample scene
has a little asterisk next to it.
131

131

00:06:58,550  -->  00:07:01,560
And we can go off and
say file, save scene.
132

132

00:07:01,560  -->  00:07:04,740
We can also save scene as and
change the name of it.
133

133

00:07:04,740  -->  00:07:09,480
So we might wanna change the name of
the scene to be NumberWizard, for
134

134

00:07:09,480  -->  00:07:11,910
example, NumberWizard.
135

135

00:07:11,910  -->  00:07:13,480
So we're calling out scene, NumberWizard,
136

136

00:07:13,480  -->  00:07:16,840
you can see now that our whole scene
has been renamed NumberWizard.
137

137

00:07:16,840  -->  00:07:19,510
And at the top here it'll say,
numberwizard.unity.
138

138

00:07:19,510  -->  00:07:22,240
So not a big deal,
you can leave it as sample scene,
139

139

00:07:22,240  -->  00:07:25,560
but sample just doesn't seem
what we're up to at the moment.
140

140

00:07:25,560  -->  00:07:28,220
We're making a NumberWizard,
that's what we're doing.
141

141

00:07:28,220  -->  00:07:32,560
Okay, now that we've saved that and we've
added our script to the main camera just
142

142

00:07:32,560  -->  00:07:36,080
to have somewhere that we place it,
we can click on Play.
143

143

00:07:36,080  -->  00:07:38,784
And make sure that you've
selected the console.
144

144

00:07:38,784  -->  00:07:42,216
If you've still got the inspector
open you won't see this so
145

145

00:07:42,216  -->  00:07:46,680
click on the console, and we can see
welcome to NumberWizard yo, excellent.
146

146

00:07:46,680  -->  00:07:49,450
So now as I mentioned I've
got a challenge for you,
147

147

00:07:49,450  -->  00:07:53,590
we can unclick play mode there, jump back
over to our script to see what we've got,
148

148

00:07:53,590  -->  00:07:58,740
I've left a blinking cursor here because
what I'd like you to do is our challenge.
149

149

00:07:58,740  -->  00:08:01,730
So I've written out a welcome,
write it in your own words.
150

150

00:08:01,730  -->  00:08:06,560
Write another statement, which is about,
we would like you to pick a number.
151

151

00:08:06,560  -->  00:08:08,430
So we're saying to the player,
pick a number.
152

152

00:08:08,430  -->  00:08:13,080
And then another statement again which is
the highest number you can choose is, and
153

153

00:08:13,080  -->  00:08:14,130
we'll say 1,000 for now.
154

154

00:08:14,130  -->  00:08:16,980
And the lowest number is, and
we'll say one for the moment.
155

155

00:08:16,980  -->  00:08:22,140
And the syntax that we're
using is Debug.Log("Thing
156

156

00:08:22,140  -->  00:08:28,820
you want to say") and
make sure you put your ; on the end.
157

157

00:08:28,820  -->  00:08:31,910
So you should end out
with four lines in here.
158

158

00:08:31,910  -->  00:08:36,340
This first one and then another
three lines saying what we've,
159

159

00:08:36,340  -->  00:08:38,720
Got here in terms of our challenge.
160

160

00:08:38,720  -->  00:08:39,850
Okay, so that's the challenge.
161

161

00:08:39,850  -->  00:08:40,720
Give that your best shot.
162

162

00:08:40,720  -->  00:08:44,780
Pause the video now, and
I'll give you time to work on that.
163

163

00:08:44,780  -->  00:08:47,760
When you come back,
we'll go through the solution together.
164

164

00:08:47,760  -->  00:08:49,700
So this is a great time to pause.
165

165

00:08:49,700  -->  00:08:50,920
Great time to do the challenge.
166

166

00:08:50,920  -->  00:08:54,680
Great time to get your hands dirty and
I will see you in a moment.
167

167

00:08:57,680  -->  00:08:59,580
Welcome back,
hopefully you went well with that.
168

168

00:08:59,580  -->  00:09:02,920
Let me show you my approach
to working through this.
169

169

00:09:02,920  -->  00:09:08,396
Let's start by typing Debug.Log,
170

170

00:09:08,396  -->  00:09:12,810
what are we going to say next,
171

171

00:09:12,810  -->  00:09:17,930
Pick a number, don't tell me what
172

172

00:09:17,930  -->  00:09:23,771
it is...); and then Debug.Log.
173

173

00:09:23,771  -->  00:09:28,574
The highest number you
174

174

00:09:28,574  -->  00:09:33,383
can pick is 1000.
175

175

00:09:35,991  -->  00:09:41,950
And Debug.Log, open brackets and
then quotation marks.
176

176

00:09:41,950  -->  00:09:48,500
In here we are going to say the lowest
number you can pick is one.
177

177

00:09:49,730  -->  00:09:52,010
Okay, and then semi colon on the end.
178

178

00:09:52,010  -->  00:09:54,630
So we've now written four statements and
179

179

00:09:54,630  -->  00:09:58,310
these four statements are living
inside our start method.
180

180

00:09:58,310  -->  00:10:01,320
In the next few videos,
we're gonna talk a lot more about methods.
181

181

00:10:01,320  -->  00:10:03,460
But for now we just need to know
that these are the statements, so
182

182

00:10:03,460  -->  00:10:08,360
these are the individual directions
we're giving to the computer, to say,
183

183

00:10:08,360  -->  00:10:11,170
I want you to do this and
then do this and then do this.
184

184

00:10:11,170  -->  00:10:13,760
And the start method
here is like a recipe,
185

185

00:10:13,760  -->  00:10:18,290
where the start method is saying here
are the four individual steps within my
186

186

00:10:18,290  -->  00:10:22,740
recipe to make the thing happen
that we wanna have happen.
187

187

00:10:22,740  -->  00:10:26,360
Now it's saved that, back over into Unity.
188

188

00:10:26,360  -->  00:10:30,980
Click on play and you can see in
here welcome to number wizard.
189

189

00:10:30,980  -->  00:10:33,020
Pick a number, highest number and
lowest number.
190

190

00:10:33,020  -->  00:10:36,710
Excellent, so we've created the first
part, the structure for our game.
191

191

00:10:36,710  -->  00:10:39,937
So we're giving our player the context
of this is what we want you to do.
192

192

00:10:39,937  -->  00:10:44,240
And in our next video we'll be looking at
variables and how we can create a more for
193

193

00:10:44,240  -->  00:10:48,180
flexible structure using those variables
as a way to store information.
194

194

00:10:48,180  -->  00:10:50,060
So great work, you're doing really well,
195

195

00:10:50,060  -->  00:10:52,180
I look forward to seeing
you in the next video.
