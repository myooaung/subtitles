[MUSIC]

2

00:00:04.013  -->  00:00:07.582
Okay, in this video,
we're going to shift our own enemy path.
3

3

00:00:07.582  -->  00:00:11.327
So rather than having to enter
all our waypoints on our enemy,
4

4

00:00:11.327  -->  00:00:16.280
we're going to move it to our
scriptable object, our wave asset file.
5

5

00:00:16.280  -->  00:00:19.780
And also to make sure we don't have to
drag in each of these individual elements,
6

6

00:00:19.780  -->  00:00:21.690
we can just say, what is the path?
7

7

00:00:21.690  -->  00:00:25.770
Let's drag in the entire path as opposed
to having to drag in each individual
8

8

00:00:25.770  -->  00:00:26.750
waypoint.
9

9

00:00:26.750  -->  00:00:30.650
So the first step in this process,
let's go back over into our waveConfig.cs.
10

10

00:00:30.650  -->  00:00:35.010
And you can see where we
are returning our pathPreFab.
11

11

00:00:35.010  -->  00:00:39.020
So at the moment this is a little bit
unsophisticated cuz we're saying in our
12

12

00:00:39.020  -->  00:00:43.595
scriptable object here, we're saying in
our waveConfig, here's the PathPreFab,
13

13

00:00:43.595  -->  00:00:45.180
do whatever you want with it.
14

14

00:00:45.180  -->  00:00:48.510
So let's do the heavy lifting
in here where we actually say,
15

15

00:00:48.510  -->  00:00:51.590
here are the different
waypoints within the path.
16

16

00:00:51.590  -->  00:00:57.370
We wanna be returning waypoint, whatever
it is, 1, 2 and 3 or 0, 1, 2 that we have.
17

17

00:00:57.370  -->  00:01:01.220
So we return the waypoints,
not just the PreFab.
18

18

00:01:01.220  -->  00:01:03.609
So to do that, first of all,
19

19

00:01:03.609  -->  00:01:09.593
I'm gonna change my method name
from GetPathPrefab to GetWaypoints.
20

20

00:01:09.593  -->  00:01:15.051
And instead of this being a game object,
I'm going to create this as a list.
21

21

00:01:15.051  -->  00:01:21.443
So List, our angle braces and
then it's of type transform.
22

22

00:01:21.443  -->  00:01:26.313
So I'm making a list of type Transfom
called GetWaypoints and I will expand this
23

23

00:01:26.313  -->  00:01:31.410
one out now, rather than having this all
on the same line, just make that clearer.
24

24

00:01:31.410  -->  00:01:35.250
So I've got my curly braces at the top and
bottom of my code block.
25

25

00:01:35.250  -->  00:01:37.330
We're not returning
the path prefab anymore.
26

26

00:01:37.330  -->  00:01:40.450
We want to return the,
what are we returning?
27

27

00:01:40.450  -->  00:01:44.255
Well, we're returning the waveWaypoint.
28

28

00:01:45.710  -->  00:01:47.920
That is what we want to return.
29

29

00:01:47.920  -->  00:01:48.630
And how we're gonna do that?
30

30

00:01:48.630  -->  00:01:50.470
Cuz waveWaypoints don't exist yet.
31

31

00:01:50.470  -->  00:01:52.800
So let's give ourselves another line or
two.
32

32

00:01:52.800  -->  00:01:58.503
First of all, we'll create a variable,
which will be waveWaypoints.
33

33

00:01:58.503  -->  00:01:59.650
And what would that be?
34

34

00:01:59.650  -->  00:02:01.500
Well we need to tun this into a list.
35

35

00:02:01.500  -->  00:02:08.670
So it's a new List of type Transform and
that's no coincidence.
36

36

00:02:08.670  -->  00:02:11.850
And then open,
close parentheses and semicolon.
37

37

00:02:11.850  -->  00:02:15.970
No coincidence cuz we're
returning a List of Transforms, so
38

38

00:02:15.970  -->  00:02:20.110
we need to create this variable
which is a new List of Transforms.
39

39

00:02:20.110  -->  00:02:23.000
Now this is where we use for each loop.
40

40

00:02:23.000  -->  00:02:26.110
And I told you in the previous lecture,
when I was asking you to go through each
41

41

00:02:26.110  -->  00:02:31.670
of these and I've said for
each of these, create a public method.
42

42

00:02:31.670  -->  00:02:34.780
That's what we need to do when
we're looking at the particular
43

43

00:02:34.780  -->  00:02:37.760
waypoints in a pathPrefab.
44

44

00:02:37.760  -->  00:02:41.200
We say for each of these,
that one and that one, and
45

45

00:02:41.200  -->  00:02:43.470
that one, do a particular thing.
46

46

00:02:43.470  -->  00:02:45.890
That's what the for each loop is saying.
47

47

00:02:45.890  -->  00:02:49.080
So let's start this off by saying foreach.
48

48

00:02:49.080  -->  00:02:55.400
And then in open parenthesis, Transform,
this is how we create our foreach loop.
49

49

00:02:55.400  -->  00:02:59.373
We first of all say what the type is,
and then we give it a variable name or
50

50

00:02:59.373  -->  00:03:02.130
give it a name, and we'll call this child.
51

51

00:03:02.130  -->  00:03:03.020
Why is it child?
52

52

00:03:03.020  -->  00:03:07.560
Well, this is our parent,
path is parent that we've created already.
53

53

00:03:07.560  -->  00:03:10.990
And then underneath the parent we have
these children that are the waypoints.
54

54

00:03:10.990  -->  00:03:13.810
So path is parent and
children is waypoints.
55

55

00:03:13.810  -->  00:03:14.420
So therefore,
56

56

00:03:14.420  -->  00:03:18.750
we want to be accessing the child,
that's why we're gonna call it child.
57

57

00:03:18.750  -->  00:03:26.100
So for each child and the transform of
that child in, and what is this in?
58

58

00:03:26.100  -->  00:03:29.500
Well, it's in our pathPrefab.
59

59

00:03:29.500  -->  00:03:33.850
So we're still connecting the pathPrefab
to the scriptable object.
60

60

00:03:33.850  -->  00:03:36.160
So it's in pathPrefab.
61

61

00:03:37.260  -->  00:03:40.470
And we're particularly
interested in the transform.
62

62

00:03:40.470  -->  00:03:43.150
So we need to say .transform.
63

63

00:03:43.150  -->  00:03:45.650
And then so for each of these, and
64

64

00:03:45.650  -->  00:03:50.110
we'll do our open curly braces here,
what are we doing for each of these?
65

65

00:03:50.110  -->  00:03:53.470
For each child that's in our pathPreFab,
66

66

00:03:53.470  -->  00:03:56.980
particularly getting
the transform information.
67

67

00:03:56.980  -->  00:03:58.530
And just another super, and
68

68

00:03:58.530  -->  00:04:01.830
I do this all the time when I'm looking
to confirm what it is that I'm doing.
69

69

00:04:01.830  -->  00:04:03.410
If you mouse over pretty much anything,
70

70

00:04:03.410  -->  00:04:05.580
you'll get lots of information
about what's going on.
71

71

00:04:05.580  -->  00:04:09.850
So, it'll tell us the transform, that
it's a .transform, position, rotation and
72

72

00:04:09.850  -->  00:04:10.600
scale of an object.
73

73

00:04:10.600  -->  00:04:14.230
Well, we knew that, and
we know that this is the pathPreFab and
74

74

00:04:14.230  -->  00:04:17.570
this is within the waveConfig.pathPreFab,
great.
75

75

00:04:17.570  -->  00:04:22.690
And then the transform is getting the
transform attached to this game object,
76

76

00:04:22.690  -->  00:04:25.500
so this game object,
it's getting that transform.
77

77

00:04:25.500  -->  00:04:29.170
So, just a reminder there, sometimes
mousing over things is a really good help.
78

78

00:04:29.170  -->  00:04:32.810
Cuz my goal here is to teach you how to do
this on your own, so you can do more than
79

79

00:04:32.810  -->  00:04:36.770
just listen to my videos, you can go
off and create awesome things yourself.
80

80

00:04:36.770  -->  00:04:38.990
Okay so that's enough sidetrack.
81

81

00:04:38.990  -->  00:04:43.050
For each transform child in Prefab,
.transform,
82

82

00:04:43.050  -->  00:04:47.990
we want to say waveWaypoints.Add and
this is the cool thing
83

83

00:04:47.990  -->  00:04:53.060
about using the list is we can add each of
these into the list, what are we adding?
84

84

00:04:53.060  -->  00:04:56.640
So in open our parentheses,
we're adding child.
85

85

00:04:59.050  -->  00:05:02.430
So for each of the children,
the waveWaypoints.Add.
86

86

00:05:02.430  -->  00:05:04.270
So, add the child or
87

87

00:05:04.270  -->  00:05:10.640
add the transform of that child into
our waveWaypoints, which is our list.
88

88

00:05:10.640  -->  00:05:15.570
And we're using the .Add method
in here to add each child.
89

89

00:05:15.570  -->  00:05:17.095
Okay, so that's our foreach,
90

90

00:05:17.095  -->  00:05:20.710
hopefully, I know I've explained it
about eight different times now but
91

91

00:05:20.710  -->  00:05:23.600
hopefully that's nice and
clear what we're doing with the foreach.
92

92

00:05:23.600  -->  00:05:28.080
We'll save that up and
let me just get rid of my lines here.
93

93

00:05:28.080  -->  00:05:35.880
What we are returning when we are calling
this GetWaypoints as a public method,
94

94

00:05:35.880  -->  00:05:42.180
what we're returning is the waveWaypoints
within our path prefab.
95

95

00:05:42.180  -->  00:05:43.350
Okay, we'll save that up.
96

96

00:05:43.350  -->  00:05:45.790
Now what we need to do to test
that this is all working,
97

97

00:05:45.790  -->  00:05:48.390
is to jump over to our
EnemyPathing script.
98

98

00:05:48.390  -->  00:05:51.490
Within here, we're gonna make
a couple of slight tweaks.
99

99

00:05:51.490  -->  00:05:54.090
So what are these slight tweaks,
I hear you ask.
100

100

00:05:54.090  -->  00:05:58.180
First of all, we need to SerializeField.
101

101

00:05:58.180  -->  00:06:01.732
And we need to have a way of
connecting our wave configuration.
102

102

00:06:01.732  -->  00:06:07.370
So I'll say WaveConfig is the type and
that's our scriptable object, WaveConfig.
103

103

00:06:07.370  -->  00:06:12.150
And we'll call this waveConfig
as the variable, semicolon.
104

104

00:06:12.150  -->  00:06:16.730
We still need our list of waypoints but
we don't need to serialize this.
105

105

00:06:16.730  -->  00:06:21.380
We're no longer going to be dragging
in each of these various waypoints.
106

106

00:06:21.380  -->  00:06:24.106
These other parameters we can leave as is,
which is cool.
107

107

00:06:24.106  -->  00:06:26.816
Within our start, we need to do something,
108

108

00:06:26.816  -->  00:06:30.495
we're going to say waypoints
= what does this equal here?
109

109

00:06:30.495  -->  00:06:34.541
Well, it's gonna = waveConfig.
110

110

00:06:34.541  -->  00:06:36.092
Can you guess it?
111

111

00:06:36.092  -->  00:06:42.405
It's gonna be GetWaypoints.
112

112

00:06:42.405  -->  00:06:44.965
Open and closed parentheses, semicolon.
113

113

00:06:44.965  -->  00:06:47.955
Now, let's save this,
jump back over into Unity.
114

114

00:06:47.955  -->  00:06:49.655
I'll give you a challenge at this point,
actually,
115

115

00:06:49.655  -->  00:06:50.875
just to make sure all this works.
116

116

00:06:50.875  -->  00:06:52.215
Hopefully, it works.
117

117

00:06:52.215  -->  00:06:56.245
The challenge is to create a new path,
make a new path prefab with different
118

118

00:06:56.245  -->  00:07:00.455
waypoints, so that we can make sure
that the new one is working properly.
119

119

00:07:00.455  -->  00:07:04.910
To add a new Wave Config asset file,
so a second asset file.
120

120

00:07:04.910  -->  00:07:09.460
And then to assign the new config to
our enemy prefab, click on Play and
121

121

00:07:09.460  -->  00:07:12.420
to make sure our enemy is
following our new path.
122

122

00:07:12.420  -->  00:07:13.691
Okay, so jump into that challenge and
123

123

00:07:13.691  -->  00:07:15.404
I'll see you back here
when you've got that done.
124

124

00:07:18.151  -->  00:07:22.424
Righty-oh, so we've already got Path 0,
I'm gonna duplicate Path 0,
125

125

00:07:22.424  -->  00:07:25.650
it is now called Path 1,
this also has three waypoints.
126

126

00:07:25.650  -->  00:07:29.870
I'll be a little bit clever here and I'll
duplicate and we'll make four waypoints,
127

127

00:07:29.870  -->  00:07:33.010
just to be super clear that
our system is setup right,
128

128

00:07:33.010  -->  00:07:36.196
click on Waypoint 0,
put that all the way to the top.
129

129

00:07:36.196  -->  00:07:40.370
And just a reminder, if you lose your
points, then you can come up to the top
130

130

00:07:40.370  -->  00:07:44.899
right or up in your Inspector and select
the icon that you want for your waypoint.
131

131

00:07:44.899  -->  00:07:48.962
Sometimes I find they come and go, I'm not
sure why but minor there at the moment.
132

132

00:07:48.962  -->  00:07:54.869
So start at the top right into the middle
and then down closer to the player and
133

133

00:07:54.869  -->  00:07:58.488
perhaps then heading
towards the offscreen.
134

134

00:07:58.488  -->  00:08:03.478
We have this path, we need to make
this a prefab, so I'll drag path1 down
135

135

00:08:03.478  -->  00:08:08.237
into my Paths folder, that is now
a fully official prefab excelente.
136

136

00:08:08.237  -->  00:08:10.057
What do we need to do
next from our challenge?
137

137

00:08:10.057  -->  00:08:13.400
We need to add a new
wave configuration file.
138

138

00:08:13.400  -->  00:08:16.000
So within our waves,
again I'm gonna duplicate.
139

139

00:08:16.000  -->  00:08:19.220
We have a wave 2, click on wave 2,
you can see that its looking for
140

140

00:08:19.220  -->  00:08:21.350
path prefab path 0.
141

141

00:08:21.350  -->  00:08:25.252
I need to find my, so I click on
the selecter, next to path prefab,
142

142

00:08:25.252  -->  00:08:28.620
find path 1, excellent,
the enemy prefab is the same.
143

143

00:08:28.620  -->  00:08:32.348
And then the last step, assign the new
configuration to our enemy prefab.
144

144

00:08:32.348  -->  00:08:35.826
Okay, so Prefabs, Enemy,
this is a little bit manual,
145

145

00:08:35.826  -->  00:08:39.750
we'll be changing this up,
I will be iterating on this as we go.
146

146

00:08:39.750  -->  00:08:42.754
But for now,
we need to find the waveConfig and
147

147

00:08:42.754  -->  00:08:46.230
to say you are now wave 2 that
I want you to execute on.
148

148

00:08:46.230  -->  00:08:50.720
And then we'll click on Play, we'll
see if our enemy follows our new path.
149

149

00:08:50.720  -->  00:08:52.710
Up the top and then down or below.
150

150

00:08:52.710  -->  00:08:54.850
Great, so enemy is following the new path.
151

151

00:08:54.850  -->  00:08:57.330
We've sucessfully set up a second path.
152

152

00:08:57.330  -->  00:09:02.020
We've hooked it up, so that we don't
have to put in each individual waypoint,
153

153

00:09:02.020  -->  00:09:04.780
that our enemy is finding
its own waypoints.
154

154

00:09:04.780  -->  00:09:06.720
We just have to tell it
what path to look at.
155

155

00:09:06.720  -->  00:09:08.660
So, great work,
still plenty of work to do.
156

156

00:09:08.660  -->  00:09:10.200
But we're making awesome progress.
157

157

00:09:10.200  -->  00:09:11.010
See you in the next video.
