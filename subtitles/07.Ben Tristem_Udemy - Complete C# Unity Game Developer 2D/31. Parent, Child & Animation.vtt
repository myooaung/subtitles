[MUSIC]
2

2

00:00:04.029  -->  00:00:06.650
So far, we've been pretty
basic with our animation.
3

3

00:00:06.650  -->  00:00:10.630
A little bit fast and loose, if I might
admit, in terms of how we've set it up.
4

4

00:00:10.630  -->  00:00:13.890
We've been doing the quick and easy way,
but I wanna go deeper in this video,
5

5

00:00:13.890  -->  00:00:16.710
and show you more about animation, so
that you truly understand what's going on.
6

6

00:00:16.710  -->  00:00:21.315
And the first thing for us to look at and
remind ourselves of, is the relationship
7

7

00:00:21.315  -->  00:00:24.992
between parent and child, and
let me just be super duper clear.
8

8

00:00:24.992  -->  00:00:27.300
I'm gonna get one of my sprites.
9

9

00:00:27.300  -->  00:00:28.170
I'm not using it at the moment.
10

10

00:00:28.170  -->  00:00:28.940
You don't have to do this.
11

11

00:00:28.940  -->  00:00:30.760
This is all for
illustration at the moment.
12

12

00:00:30.760  -->  00:00:34.510
We have a star, and you can see
the star comes into our hierarchy.
13

13

00:00:34.510  -->  00:00:40.156
To make it really clear,
I'm gonna rename this, Star = Parent.
14

14

00:00:40.156  -->  00:00:43.893
This is at the parent level, and
I'm gonna change the color of it to red,
15

15

00:00:43.893  -->  00:00:46.030
so we know what's going on there.
16

16

00:00:46.030  -->  00:00:50.410
Now, I'm going to drag in another
star on top of the parent,
17

17

00:00:50.410  -->  00:00:51.920
and that becomes a child.
18

18

00:00:51.920  -->  00:00:53.070
We've done this a bunch of times, so
19

19

00:00:53.070  -->  00:00:58.170
it should be really clear what's
going on here, Star_Child, okay.
20

20

00:00:58.170  -->  00:01:00.870
And then, this one,
I will move a little bit.
21

21

00:01:00.870  -->  00:01:02.560
You can see it starts off over on there.
22

22

00:01:02.560  -->  00:01:05.060
If I reset the transform of the child,
then,
23

23

00:01:05.060  -->  00:01:06.880
it's gonna be sitting right
on top of the parent.
24

24

00:01:06.880  -->  00:01:10.188
But I move it a little bit to the side,
and we'll shrink it down a little bit,
25

25

00:01:10.188  -->  00:01:13.004
cuz children are often a little
bit smaller than their parents.
26

26

00:01:13.004  -->  00:01:15.760
Now, this is the parent,
and this is the child.
27

27

00:01:15.760  -->  00:01:17.970
Let me show a couple of slides
just to make this really,
28

28

00:01:17.970  -->  00:01:19.420
really clear what we're
talking about here.
29

29

00:01:19.420  -->  00:01:21.580
So we have the parent, we have the child.
30

30

00:01:21.580  -->  00:01:24.670
The parent,
its transform is relative to the world.
31

31

00:01:24.670  -->  00:01:28.520
So for example, if it's at 0,0,
then it's at the world origin.
32

32

00:01:28.520  -->  00:01:31.700
And the child,
the transform is relative to the parent.
33

33

00:01:31.700  -->  00:01:33.600
So if it's 0-0,
it's centered on the parent.
34

34

00:01:33.600  -->  00:01:34.750
We know this, we've done this before.
35

35

00:01:34.750  -->  00:01:37.640
But just to remind us, this is
building to something, I promise you.
36

36

00:01:37.640  -->  00:01:41.890
So if I put my transform here at zero and
zero,
37

37

00:01:41.890  -->  00:01:44.480
you can see it's right down in the origin.
38

38

00:01:44.480  -->  00:01:48.330
I'll just change my sprite renderer
to seven, so that it appears on top.
39

39

00:01:48.330  -->  00:01:51.090
For both of these guys, just to if
we're playing around a bit there.
40

40

00:01:51.090  -->  00:01:57.660
So it's right at the 0,0, whereas,
the child has a position of 0.04.
41

41

00:01:57.660  -->  00:01:59.030
So put that at 0,0, okay.
42

42

00:01:59.030  -->  00:02:01.330
It's at 0,0, they're both at 0,0.
43

43

00:02:01.330  -->  00:02:04.720
If I move the child to the left, then,
44

44

00:02:04.720  -->  00:02:07.670
it's going to be at the negative
2 away from the parents.
45

45

00:02:07.670  -->  00:02:15.200
So a negative 2 units, to the left on the
x-axis, is negative from the parent, okay.
46

46

00:02:15.200  -->  00:02:16.360
So that's what we're doing here,
47

47

00:02:16.360  -->  00:02:20.740
changes made to the transform, at the
parent level will be applied to the child.
48

48

00:02:20.740  -->  00:02:23.530
So you saw that I did
this with a transform.
49

49

00:02:23.530  -->  00:02:26.140
I moved it, so
with the position within the transform.
50

50

00:02:26.140  -->  00:02:29.260
So I move it, and, as I move the parent,
51

51

00:02:29.260  -->  00:02:32.030
the child moves as well,
relative to the parent.
52

52

00:02:32.030  -->  00:02:34.850
What happens if we change
the scale of the parent?
53

53

00:02:34.850  -->  00:02:36.530
So while selected on parent,
54

54

00:02:36.530  -->  00:02:41.170
if we increase the scale of the parent,
the child also increases, and
55

55

00:02:41.170  -->  00:02:45.580
you can see the relationship between
the distance changes, as well.
56

56

00:02:45.580  -->  00:02:47.480
It scales that whole relationship.
57

57

00:02:47.480  -->  00:02:50.430
So it is now applying
a scaling of two point.
58

58

00:02:50.430  -->  00:02:50.960
We'll make it easy.
59

59

00:02:50.960  -->  00:02:55.710
We'll say three, three, three, and
three, the A Zed doesn't matter, but
60

60

00:02:55.710  -->  00:02:57.860
we'll do that nonetheless, all right,
messed that up a little bit.
61

61

00:02:57.860  -->  00:03:02.330
Okay, three, three, three, now it's
gonna be applying a scale of three
62

62

00:03:02.330  -->  00:03:07.540
to this positioning of the child,
which is a position of minus two.
63

63

00:03:07.540  -->  00:03:11.470
Now, changes made to the Child only
impact the child, so if I go and
64

64

00:03:11.470  -->  00:03:16.400
change the scaling of the child,
it doesn't do anything to the parent.
65

65

00:03:16.400  -->  00:03:18.570
I move it around independently.
66

66

00:03:18.570  -->  00:03:21.220
Okay, we're building to something here,
I promise you.
67

67

00:03:21.220  -->  00:03:23.110
How does it impact animation?
68

68

00:03:23.110  -->  00:03:24.450
That's what we're building towards.
69

69

00:03:24.450  -->  00:03:29.960
The animator placed at the parent level
can animate the renderers of Parent and
70

70

00:03:29.960  -->  00:03:34.600
Children, whereas, the Animator
placed on the Child can only drive me
71

71

00:03:34.600  -->  00:03:37.950
animations of the Child and
its Children, so I'd show you this here.
72

72

00:03:37.950  -->  00:03:42.720
If I place an animator at the Parent
level, so Add Component animate tool.
73

73

00:03:42.720  -->  00:03:45.240
This is what drives animations.
74

74

00:03:45.240  -->  00:03:49.920
Then, it can see the child, and
the way that we're gonna do that, is,
75

75

00:03:49.920  -->  00:03:52.428
we haven't done a lot of this, but we'll
do this in a little bit more detail her.
76

76

00:03:52.428  -->  00:03:55.540
So if I click on the parent,
add an animate tool,
77

77

00:03:55.540  -->  00:03:59.690
and now, I need, what,
an animated controller, so
78

78

00:03:59.690  -->  00:04:02.800
we'll set ourselves up, just for
now, a little test folder in here.
79

79

00:04:02.800  -->  00:04:07.390
I'll create a Create Folder Test, and
80

80

00:04:07.390  -->  00:04:11.840
a little note to myself to delete, cuz
this is only for illustrative purposes.
81

81

00:04:11.840  -->  00:04:16.290
And within here, we'll right
click Create Animator Controller,
82

82

00:04:16.290  -->  00:04:18.900
and this will be ParentTest.
83

83

00:04:20.010  -->  00:04:23.490
Okay, now, while clicking on the parent,
I drag over the ParentTest.
84

84

00:04:23.490  -->  00:04:24.790
So it has an animator.
85

85

00:04:24.790  -->  00:04:27.260
And remember, animator, sorry,
an animator controller.
86

86

00:04:27.260  -->  00:04:30.643
Animator controller is what drives
all the various animations.
87

87

00:04:30.643  -->  00:04:32.497
Now, what can we do in here?
88

88

00:04:32.497  -->  00:04:37.532
You can see while clicked on our parent,
which is accessing our
89

89

00:04:37.532  -->  00:04:43.908
parent test animator controller, we
have to begin animating the star parent.
90

90

00:04:43.908  -->  00:04:45.190
Create an animation clip.
91

91

00:04:45.190  -->  00:04:47.880
So this is another way for
us to create animations.
92

92

00:04:47.880  -->  00:04:49.080
We haven't done it this way before.
93

93

00:04:49.080  -->  00:04:52.190
We've done it a more drag and drop way,
but let's do it this slower way, so
94

94

00:04:52.190  -->  00:04:53.680
we really clear and deliver it.
95

95

00:04:53.680  -->  00:04:57.470
We'll click Create, it's gonna ask us
where we want to create our new animation.
96

96

00:04:57.470  -->  00:05:01.540
So we'll call this just Animation 1,
we'll call it Test Animation 1,
97

97

00:05:01.540  -->  00:05:04.250
just to be super clear that we're
getting rid of all this stuff.
98

98

00:05:04.250  -->  00:05:07.750
And now you can see we have our
animation ready and raring.
99

99

00:05:07.750  -->  00:05:11.370
And something that we haven't played
round with it yet here, is Add Property.
100

100

00:05:11.370  -->  00:05:12.890
Now, when I click on Add Property,
101

101

00:05:12.890  -->  00:05:16.880
it will show me all of
the things that I can Animate.
102

102

00:05:16.880  -->  00:05:20.550
I have the transform, which is
referring to the parent's transform.
103

103

00:05:20.550  -->  00:05:23.610
You see, if I open that up,
position scale rotation.
104

104

00:05:23.610  -->  00:05:24.510
Let's just do something on there.
105

105

00:05:24.510  -->  00:05:26.570
Click the plus button.
106

106

00:05:26.570  -->  00:05:28.470
Now, if you're not
finding the plus button,
107

107

00:05:28.470  -->  00:05:31.590
let me just open up one of these to
see if I can simulate this, okay.
108

108

00:05:31.590  -->  00:05:34.240
If you're not finding the plus
button like I had the other day,
109

109

00:05:34.240  -->  00:05:36.460
you might need to move
this little slidey bar.
110

110

00:05:36.460  -->  00:05:39.790
At the moment, it all fits on my screen,
but depending upon your resolution,
111

111

00:05:39.790  -->  00:05:43.200
sometimes, that plus button disappears,
which is a real pain.
112

112

00:05:43.200  -->  00:05:45.250
But anyway, click on the plus.
113

113

00:05:45.250  -->  00:05:46.790
Now, it lets us animate.
114

114

00:05:46.790  -->  00:05:49.230
So it's gonna take the sprite.
115

115

00:05:49.230  -->  00:05:52.830
From the sprite renderer, whatever
was our sprite that we had in there,
116

116

00:05:52.830  -->  00:05:55.220
we're just going to place it at
the start and place it at the end.
117

117

00:05:55.220  -->  00:05:56.530
That is the sprite.
118

118

00:05:56.530  -->  00:05:58.200
We can go in there and
do what we did before.
119

119

00:05:58.200  -->  00:06:01.430
So we can click on record,
we can move it midway,
120

120

00:06:01.430  -->  00:06:05.310
we can move it down a little bit,
and then click off record.
121

121

00:06:05.310  -->  00:06:07.115
So that's our animation, up and down.
122

122

00:06:07.115  -->  00:06:09.110
Okay, very cool, up and down.
123

123

00:06:09.110  -->  00:06:13.890
We can also add properties for the child.
124

124

00:06:13.890  -->  00:06:15.660
So see here, how we've got the star child?
125

125

00:06:15.660  -->  00:06:20.700
If we open that up, now,
we can see that we have a transform, and
126

126

00:06:20.700  -->  00:06:22.940
we also have a sprite renderer.
127

127

00:06:22.940  -->  00:06:25.670
The sprite renderer is
particularly important if we have
128

128

00:06:25.670  -->  00:06:28.780
a sprite sheet with a whole
bunch of animations on it.
129

129

00:06:28.780  -->  00:06:30.590
Would go into the sprite renderer,
scroll down.
130

130

00:06:30.590  -->  00:06:31.705
This is the thing I was doing that before.
131

131

00:06:31.705  -->  00:06:33.641
I need to, [SOUND], see that?
132

132

00:06:33.641  -->  00:06:36.250
Man, I lost a lot of
time trying to find that.
133

133

00:06:36.250  -->  00:06:38.850
Figure out why it wasn't working when
I double-clicked on it the other day.
134

134

00:06:38.850  -->  00:06:40.640
But it's cuz the plus is there.
135

135

00:06:40.640  -->  00:06:41.590
And then, we'll click on plus.
136

136

00:06:41.590  -->  00:06:43.420
We'll get to that approach in a moment.
137

137

00:06:43.420  -->  00:06:45.380
But for now,
we'll just play around with the transform.
138

138

00:06:45.380  -->  00:06:47.100
So child transform.
139

139

00:06:47.100  -->  00:06:50.130
Click on,
we'll use position as well for now.
140

140

00:06:50.130  -->  00:06:51.340
Click on plus for that.
141

141

00:06:51.340  -->  00:06:55.970
Now, we can independently animate
the parent and the child.
142

142

00:06:55.970  -->  00:06:58.410
So if I open up child,
I can see my x, y's, add code.
143

143

00:06:58.410  -->  00:07:00.990
So I can click Curves to
get these things curves.
144

144

00:07:00.990  -->  00:07:02.780
But we'll just say as it's going up and
145

145

00:07:02.780  -->  00:07:06.550
down, we will be clicked
on child a record.
146

146

00:07:06.550  -->  00:07:11.500
I'll move the child a little bit
to the left, and then, unrecord,
147

147

00:07:11.500  -->  00:07:15.510
and so, as it's moving, you can see
the child is going in and out to the left.
148

148

00:07:15.510  -->  00:07:16.560
But the parent's going up and down.
149

149

00:07:16.560  -->  00:07:20.470
But the child keeps
the parent's animation,
150

150

00:07:20.470  -->  00:07:23.080
cuz the parent is moving up and down.
151

151

00:07:23.080  -->  00:07:27.430
Therefore, everything below it is
going to be moving up and down.
152

152

00:07:27.430  -->  00:07:32.280
Okay, let us do a, just very quickly,
do a slightly different approach,
153

153

00:07:32.280  -->  00:07:34.390
I'm gonna duplicate my parent and child.
154

154

00:07:36.040  -->  00:07:41.170
And I will remove the animator
from the parent, remove component.
155

155

00:07:41.170  -->  00:07:47.990
I will add the animator to the child, so
here we have an animator on the child.
156

156

00:07:47.990  -->  00:07:52.000
And now, I need to create myself
another Animated controller.
157

157

00:07:53.090  -->  00:07:55.500
We'll call this child test.
158

158

00:07:55.500  -->  00:07:58.450
I think you already know what's gonna go
on here, but I wanna be really clear.
159

159

00:07:58.450  -->  00:08:04.100
If we drag the child test animator
controller into the animator, okay.
160

160

00:08:04.100  -->  00:08:05.640
Now, that's great.
161

161

00:08:05.640  -->  00:08:07.720
And while clicking on the child,
162

162

00:08:07.720  -->  00:08:12.580
if we create an animation,
this will be test animation two.
163

163

00:08:13.600  -->  00:08:18.170
Okay, test animation two, on the chart,
if we go to add property,
164

164

00:08:18.170  -->  00:08:22.630
you can see we have a transform,
and we have a sprite renderer.
165

165

00:08:22.630  -->  00:08:25.830
We don't have an option for
parent and chart.
166

166

00:08:25.830  -->  00:08:30.280
All we are seeing is the child, so
just super quickly to illustrate that,
167

167

00:08:30.280  -->  00:08:32.210
you know what I'll move these
guys a little bit out of the way.
168

168

00:08:32.210  -->  00:08:35.480
They're currently sitting right on the top
of the things I duplicated it from.
169

169

00:08:35.480  -->  00:08:37.850
So we will move these up to the top.
170

170

00:08:37.850  -->  00:08:40.610
Just to be very clear, this is our
second pair we're working with here,
171

171

00:08:40.610  -->  00:08:41.780
up to the top.
172

172

00:08:43.780  -->  00:08:44.920
If I click on child,
173

173

00:08:44.920  -->  00:08:49.670
add property, transform,
there is no other options deeper below.
174

174

00:08:49.670  -->  00:08:57.510
Click on the plus, move it to there,
and do what we will, and just scale it.
175

175

00:08:57.510  -->  00:09:00.590
Just to do something different,
scale and record.
176

176

00:09:00.590  -->  00:09:05.130
Now, as I drag along, you can see it
gets bigger and stays big, as well.
177

177

00:09:05.130  -->  00:09:06.920
And it's only animating the chart.
178

178

00:09:06.920  -->  00:09:09.700
And then, the final thing I wanna show
you in here, is at the moment we have,
179

179

00:09:09.700  -->  00:09:11.350
we'll take our first pair.
180

180

00:09:11.350  -->  00:09:13.420
We have parent and child.
181

181

00:09:13.420  -->  00:09:16.100
If I was to get rid of
this particular child, and
182

182

00:09:16.100  -->  00:09:21.440
I will create a new empty game object,
I'll call this new child.
183

183

00:09:21.440  -->  00:09:23.790
Congratulations, you have a baby.
184

184

00:09:23.790  -->  00:09:26.190
So we have a new child and parent.
185

185

00:09:26.190  -->  00:09:31.850
If I click on parent, and
I have my animator, when I go
186

186

00:09:31.850  -->  00:09:36.710
to look within here, see first of all the
fact that I've deleted the previous child,
187

187

00:09:36.710  -->  00:09:40.050
now, it's saying start child the one
that I had before that I've deleted.
188

188

00:09:40.050  -->  00:09:43.310
Position missing,
it doesn't know what is going on.
189

189

00:09:43.310  -->  00:09:48.310
So we have to right click and remove
properties, it's gone, cuz we deleted it.
190

190

00:09:48.310  -->  00:09:52.340
Now, if I click on the Parent, and
go to Poperty, you can see that at
191

191

00:09:52.340  -->  00:09:56.100
the parent level, we have Transform,
and we have the Sprite Renderer.
192

192

00:09:56.100  -->  00:09:59.120
And in the Sprite Renderer, we can do a
bunch of things, we can change the color,
193

193

00:09:59.120  -->  00:10:02.430
if we have multiple sprites from
a sprite sheet, we can add all of those.
194

194

00:10:02.430  -->  00:10:06.970
When I look at the child,
I only see the transform.
195

195

00:10:06.970  -->  00:10:10.400
That's because the child doesn't yet
have a, what?
196

196

00:10:10.400  -->  00:10:14.190
It doesn't have a sprite renderer.
197

197

00:10:14.190  -->  00:10:17.280
This is really important when it
comes to animating sprite sheets.
198

198

00:10:17.280  -->  00:10:22.670
We need to have a sprite renderer,
so that when I drill into the,
199

199

00:10:22.670  -->  00:10:26.060
sorry, when I add property and
drill into this.
200

200

00:10:26.060  -->  00:10:27.750
So here is my new child.
201

201

00:10:27.750  -->  00:10:32.420
Now, I can see a sprite rendere, and
I can do a whole bunch of stuff to that.
202

202

00:10:32.420  -->  00:10:38.120
We can have the parents' animator,
render, something of the child, but
203

203

00:10:38.120  -->  00:10:42.200
in this case, where we have the animator
on the animator on the child, we can
204

204

00:10:42.200  -->  00:10:47.410
animate the render of the child, but we
can't animate the renderer of the parent.
205

205

00:10:47.410  -->  00:10:49.610
It doesn't look upwards like that.
206

206

00:10:49.610  -->  00:10:53.250
Okay, and one more thing I wanna
talk about is, and this is the main
207

207

00:10:53.250  -->  00:10:56.190
reason that we're having this conversation
now, is we're gonna add a couple of
208

208

00:10:56.190  -->  00:10:59.620
animation events, and we need to make
sure everything is lined up perfectly,
209

209

00:10:59.620  -->  00:11:05.890
is that the animator can see methods at
the same level, not above, and not below.
210

210

00:11:05.890  -->  00:11:10.742
So an animator placed here,
at the parent level, cannot use
211

211

00:11:10.742  -->  00:11:16.376
an animation event to call a method
on a script here on the child level.
212

212

00:11:16.376  -->  00:11:19.674
So for example, if we have, where are we?
213

213

00:11:19.674  -->  00:11:21.290
We're gonna have to make some changes.
214

214

00:11:21.290  -->  00:11:22.615
We'll have a look at our cactus.
215

215

00:11:22.615  -->  00:11:27.609
The moment the cactus,
we have the defenders script on the upper
216

216

00:11:27.609  -->  00:11:32.417
level of the cactus, and on the body,
we have the animator and
217

217

00:11:32.417  -->  00:11:37.950
the sprite renderer, and the shooter and
a couple of other things.
218

218

00:11:37.950  -->  00:11:44.370
So the animator can see our shooter
script, that's why we'll able to add or
219

219

00:11:44.370  -->  00:11:49.080
we can't add animation events in there,
but we cannot
220

220

00:11:49.080  -->  00:11:53.070
access anything that's on the defender's
script, for example, from our animator.
221

221

00:11:53.070  -->  00:11:57.720
So the golden rule here, is I've led
you down a little bit of a slight side
222

222

00:11:57.720  -->  00:12:02.920
alley that we're gonna fix up
operationally, is put all of your scripts
223

223

00:12:02.920  -->  00:12:06.790
at the parent level, and
your animator at the parent level.
224

224

00:12:06.790  -->  00:12:09.580
The most important thing is to have
the animator at the parent level,
225

225

00:12:09.580  -->  00:12:12.720
cuz then you can drill down and
animate anything below.
226

226

00:12:12.720  -->  00:12:18.310
But also, therefore, we need to have our
scripts at the parent level as well,
227

227

00:12:18.310  -->  00:12:21.430
so that it can talk to the animator.
228

228

00:12:21.430  -->  00:12:25.146
But if I was to go and
move that script, now,
229

229

00:12:25.146  -->  00:12:30.069
from the body, so
if I was to remove that script from here,
230

230

00:12:30.069  -->  00:12:34.808
remove component,
add it to the parent level shooter.
231

231

00:12:34.808  -->  00:12:36.167
Now, when we go back to the animator,
232

232

00:12:36.167  -->  00:12:38.600
don't worry about the fact that
those haven't been filled in yet.
233

233

00:12:38.600  -->  00:12:41.190
We go back to the animator
on the body level.
234

234

00:12:41.190  -->  00:12:45.570
We click on the animation,
which is on the animator.
235

235

00:12:45.570  -->  00:12:48.940
Looking, it doesn't find fire,
it doesn't know where it is.
236

236

00:12:48.940  -->  00:12:53.170
So therefore, we're up to a challenge
to recreate a couple of characters,
237

237

00:12:53.170  -->  00:12:55.610
we created not quite perfectly.
238

238

00:12:55.610  -->  00:13:00.830
For the lizard and the cactus, set them up
with a proper parent child relationship.
239

239

00:13:00.830  -->  00:13:02.990
And at the moment, we have the Lizard.
240

240

00:13:02.990  -->  00:13:06.510
It doesn't have a body on it,
so we're gonna create a body.
241

241

00:13:06.510  -->  00:13:10.010
Put the sprite renderer of
the Lizard onto the body.
242

242

00:13:10.010  -->  00:13:13.230
And then,
we'll need to recreate those animations.
243

243

00:13:13.230  -->  00:13:16.890
And then, make sure the parent has all
the scripts, as well as the animator.
244

244

00:13:16.890  -->  00:13:20.570
Make sure the child, or we'll call
it the body, has a renderer on it.
245

245

00:13:20.570  -->  00:13:22.540
And then, to animate your characters.
246

246

00:13:22.540  -->  00:13:23.050
So for
247

247

00:13:23.050  -->  00:13:26.390
those couple of characters that we've
created back to front, trophy is okay.
248

248

00:13:26.390  -->  00:13:28.800
We created the trophy, [SOUND] right here.
249

249

00:13:28.800  -->  00:13:30.380
We made sure we're careful about that.
250

250

00:13:30.380  -->  00:13:33.660
It has parent level with the animator and
the scripts we're putting there.
251

251

00:13:33.660  -->  00:13:37.440
And then, it has children underneath
that we can animate, no problem.
252

252

00:13:37.440  -->  00:13:43.270
So jump in, take on that challenge to
recreate your Lizard and your Cactus.
253

253

00:13:43.270  -->  00:13:45.980
And I will go through my
solution in the next video.
254

254

00:13:45.980  -->  00:13:49.240
So when you're done, jump onto the next
video, and I'll see you there soon.
