[MUSIC]
2

2

00:00:03,910  -->  00:00:08,002
In this video, we're starting the process
of spawning our defenders when we click
3

3

00:00:08,002  -->  00:00:11,691
the mouse button, we have a cactus
spawning at the zero zero origin point.
4

4

00:00:11,691  -->  00:00:15,525
So that we're starting that process of
getting defenders being controlled by
5

5

00:00:15,525  -->  00:00:16,171
the player.
6

6

00:00:16,171  -->  00:00:17,731
Let's jump in and get started.
7

7

00:00:17,731  -->  00:00:20,977
So the first step in this process is to
make sure that when we click the mouse,
8

8

00:00:20,977  -->  00:00:23,071
the system knows that
we've clicked the mouse.
9

9

00:00:23,071  -->  00:00:26,559
So I'm gonna offer this up to you as
a challenge right from the get go is,
10

10

00:00:26,559  -->  00:00:27,851
to test from mouse click.
11

11

00:00:27,851  -->  00:00:30,251
And we've done all this before, but
I'll give you a reminder on the steps.
12

12

00:00:30,251  -->  00:00:33,827
First of all,
create a core game area, game object,
13

13

00:00:33,827  -->  00:00:36,452
so a game object we call Core Game Area.
14

14

00:00:36,452  -->  00:00:40,371
Add a collider to the play area
where your defenders can be placed.
15

15

00:00:40,371  -->  00:00:43,980
For me, I'm placing them only in these
first, what's that, one, two, three,
16

16

00:00:43,980  -->  00:00:46,572
four, five, six, seven squares,
so in that area there.
17

17

00:00:46,572  -->  00:00:51,472
And then to use OnMouseDown(
) to listen for mouse clicks.
18

18

00:00:51,472  -->  00:00:52,992
So you'll need to create
yourself a script.
19

19

00:00:52,992  -->  00:00:57,252
I'm calling mine defenders spawner,
if you wanna call yours the same thing.
20

20

00:00:57,252  -->  00:01:01,576
And finally to debug log, mouse was
clicked, so that is your challenge here,
21

21

00:01:01,576  -->  00:01:06,177
the steps to it, take that on and I'll see
you back here when you've got that done.
22

22

00:01:08,117  -->  00:01:13,179
Okay, let's start off by making our
game object right-click create empty,
23

23

00:01:13,179  -->  00:01:15,337
we'll call this core game area.
24

24

00:01:15,337  -->  00:01:20,577
Within core game area we need to have
ourselves some sort of collision.
25

25

00:01:20,577  -->  00:01:24,977
So add a component which
will be a box collider 2D.
26

26

00:01:24,977  -->  00:01:28,497
Now I'm gonna show you a little bit of
a step to make this a lot more precise.
27

27

00:01:28,497  -->  00:01:31,817
You might have just grabbed the handles
and pulled the collider around.
28

28

00:01:31,817  -->  00:01:34,998
What I'll do is say,
what is the size in world units?
29

29

00:01:34,998  -->  00:01:40,014
We know that this is coordinates 1, 1,
and we know there is seven this way and
30

30

00:01:40,014  -->  00:01:44,351
five that way so I am gonna see what
happens if I make the size 7 by 5.
31

31

00:01:44,351  -->  00:01:46,681
Okay looks pretty good I reckon.
32

32

00:01:46,681  -->  00:01:48,984
Now I am going to reset
the transform my core game area,
33

33

00:01:48,984  -->  00:01:51,401
cuz it would just pluck right
in the middle of the screen.
34

34

00:01:51,401  -->  00:01:55,348
So reset that, now the middle of
my collision is down at the 0,
35

35

00:01:55,348  -->  00:01:59,902
0 origin point and I want the middle
to be in the middle of my place space.
36

36

00:01:59,902  -->  00:02:04,101
So this is starting from 1,
1, and up here is 7, 5.
37

37

00:02:04,101  -->  00:02:10,381
So my offset is gonna be 4 and
3, I believe, yes, exactly.
38

38

00:02:10,381  -->  00:02:14,701
So this was 0, this was 1,
and that 7, 5 up there.
39

39

00:02:14,701  -->  00:02:20,084
So to have an offset of 4, which is
halfway between our on the x axis between
40

40

00:02:20,084  -->  00:02:25,561
the left and the right and on y is 3,
halfway between the bottom and the top.
41

41

00:02:25,561  -->  00:02:28,582
Okay so we've created our play area.
42

42

00:02:28,582  -->  00:02:32,807
This is the only place that if I click,
I can place a defender down in this area,
43

43

00:02:32,807  -->  00:02:34,419
that's what I'm going for.
44

44

00:02:34,419  -->  00:02:40,282
Now let's make ourselves a script so
over in the script folder here,
45

45

00:02:40,282  -->  00:02:46,762
right-click, Create, C# Script and
I'll call this DefenderSpawner.
46

46

00:02:46,762  -->  00:02:50,402
Open that up in Visual Studio.
47

47

00:02:50,402  -->  00:02:52,702
Okay, use OnMouseDown to listen for
mouse clicks.
48

48

00:02:52,702  -->  00:02:55,853
So I'm gonna get rid of all my start and
update, and
49

49

00:02:55,853  -->  00:03:00,618
start by typing OnMouseDown and let it
auto complete all the stuff around it,
50

50

00:03:00,618  -->  00:03:04,793
what do we wanna do here,
well we'll do something nice and simple,
51

51

00:03:04,793  -->  00:03:08,340
debug.log, and
what did I say the message was gonna be?
52

52

00:03:08,340  -->  00:03:14,300
Mouse was clicked,
mouse was clicked, okay, semicolon.
53

53

00:03:14,300  -->  00:03:18,462
Save that, now we need to make sure that
we attach that script to our core game
54

54

00:03:18,462  -->  00:03:22,823
area, so I'll drag Defender Spawner It's
a cool game area when it's finished
55

55

00:03:22,823  -->  00:03:24,283
compiling and thinking.
56

56

00:03:24,283  -->  00:03:28,273
There we go, now we have that as
a component, Defender Spawner, excellent.
57

57

00:03:28,273  -->  00:03:31,933
When I click on play,
I'll open up my console so I can see that.
58

58

00:03:31,933  -->  00:03:35,895
And click, yeah, mouse was clicked,
excellent so that's a good first start.
59

59

00:03:35,895  -->  00:03:38,715
And one of the things that's easy
to forget about is this collision.
60

60

00:03:38,715  -->  00:03:42,136
If I click outside of the collision,
nothing happens, let me just clear that so
61

61

00:03:42,136  -->  00:03:42,655
we can see.
62

62

00:03:42,655  -->  00:03:45,957
Nothing happens there, nothing happens
there, I don't want the player to put
63

63

00:03:45,957  -->  00:03:48,633
anything in these spots, but
it happens just there, perfect.
64

64

00:03:48,633  -->  00:03:53,282
Okay, so one other thing we'll do
in this video is when we click,
65

65

00:03:53,282  -->  00:03:55,913
we spawn or instantiate our cactus.
66

66

00:03:55,913  -->  00:03:59,347
So if you know how to do that already,
jump in and take that on as a challenge,
67

67

00:03:59,347  -->  00:04:01,135
otherwise, let's do that together.
68

68

00:04:01,135  -->  00:04:03,254
We'll go back over into DefenderSpawner.
69

69

00:04:03,254  -->  00:04:07,963
We need to give ourselves this
mechanism of, what should we call this,
70

70

00:04:07,963  -->  00:04:10,009
I'll call it Spawn Defender.
71

71

00:04:10,009  -->  00:04:15,249
So private void SpawnDefender.
72

72

00:04:15,249  -->  00:04:17,031
What do we need to do in here?
73

73

00:04:17,031  -->  00:04:22,718
Well we need to instantiate and
I'm going to create this as a game object,
74

74

00:04:22,718  -->  00:04:25,851
so gameobject we'll call it defender.
75

75

00:04:25,851  -->  00:04:29,484
We could call it defenderspawn or
something more interesting than that, or
76

76

00:04:29,484  -->  00:04:33,135
newDefender, maybe that's better,
newDefender that's much clearer.
77

77

00:04:33,135  -->  00:04:38,825
NewDefender = instantiate, and
then what do we need to put in here?
78

78

00:04:38,825  -->  00:04:42,866
We need to put in the object to
instantiate the position and the rotation.
79

79

00:04:42,866  -->  00:04:45,166
This is gonna end up
being a really long line.
80

80

00:04:45,166  -->  00:04:49,083
I'll clean that up later on, but for
now, we'll say defender, and let's go,
81

81

00:04:49,083  -->  00:04:50,246
not DefenderSpawner.
82

82

00:04:50,246  -->  00:04:52,203
So it doesn't know what defender is yet,
I'll go and
83

83

00:04:52,203  -->  00:04:53,866
create that variable up
the top first of all.
84

84

00:04:53,866  -->  00:04:57,179
SerializeField, later on,
we'll make this more dynamic where
85

85

00:04:57,179  -->  00:05:00,372
we'll be picking from the UI who
the defender is, but for now,
86

86

00:05:00,372  -->  00:05:04,246
we'll just say SerializeField GameObject,
and it's called a defender.
87

87

00:05:04,246  -->  00:05:08,546
Now, we can go down to our Instantiate and
say we need a defender.
88

88

00:05:08,546  -->  00:05:10,506
And it's like, cool, I know what that is.
89

89

00:05:10,506  -->  00:05:11,547
Where do we want it positioned?
90

90

00:05:11,547  -->  00:05:14,969
Well, for now, we'll just do our
boring old transform.position,
91

91

00:05:14,969  -->  00:05:17,467
and it'll be probably in
the middle of the screen.
92

92

00:05:17,467  -->  00:05:21,234
And we'll say,
I will do Quaternion.identity,
93

93

00:05:21,234  -->  00:05:26,587
I often do it the transform.rotation
cuz I really don't care about it.
94

94

00:05:26,587  -->  00:05:31,183
But in this instance what you called
Quaternion.identity we're just saying
95

95

00:05:31,183  -->  00:05:33,907
a straight up no rotation needed,
thank you.
96

96

00:05:33,907  -->  00:05:37,647
Okay, save that up, that should be,
and I'm gonna do one last bit here.
97

97

00:05:37,647  -->  00:05:41,995
I'm gonna say as GameObject so
that we can see it in our hierarchy, and
98

98

00:05:41,995  -->  00:05:45,752
we can manipulate it,
we can do other things with it if we need
99

99

00:05:45,752  -->  00:05:49,977
to with this particular newDefender,
it's born as a GameObject.
100

100

00:05:49,977  -->  00:05:54,621
Okay, save that up, back over over
into Unity, click on Play, and
101

101

00:05:54,621  -->  00:05:59,100
when I click I should get a new
cactus somewhere up, sorry my bad,
102

102

00:05:59,100  -->  00:06:02,134
we need to actually
make a reference there.
103

103

00:06:02,134  -->  00:06:07,077
You see Defend none, so
click on the selector find our cactus.
104

104

00:06:07,077  -->  00:06:09,914
Double click cactus now
when we click on play,
105

105

00:06:09,914  -->  00:06:13,202
it's always that step of
the that I forget isn't it?
106

106

00:06:13,202  -->  00:06:16,162
Okay, nothing happening so
it's saying mouse was clicked.
107

107

00:06:16,162  -->  00:06:19,382
Why is it not happening my friends,
here's a little mini-challenge for you.
108

108

00:06:19,382  -->  00:06:22,144
If you haven't been doing
any of the challenges,
109

109

00:06:22,144  -->  00:06:26,085
this is a great one cuz a pretty simple
one to debug, have a look at that,
110

110

00:06:26,085  -->  00:06:30,257
yell at the screen what do we need to do
to actually have that cactus show up.
111

111

00:06:30,257  -->  00:06:33,897
On our mouse down,
we need to be spawning the defender.
112

112

00:06:33,897  -->  00:06:36,386
So calling this method of SpawnDefender,
113

113

00:06:36,386  -->  00:06:39,298
I'm gonna get rid of my mouse was clicked,
okay.
114

114

00:06:39,298  -->  00:06:40,954
So instead of clicking the mouse, sorry,
115

115

00:06:40,954  -->  00:06:43,858
instead of saying I clicked the mouse
we're gonna say spawn the defender.
116

116

00:06:43,858  -->  00:06:47,729
Click on play, oay click and
there we go and down in the 0,
117

117

00:06:47,729  -->  00:06:52,168
0 coordinate position we have
ourselves a defender being spawn.
118

118

00:06:52,168  -->  00:06:54,837
If I click it a gazillion times,
I get a whole bunch of
119

119

00:06:54,837  -->  00:06:59,228
these suckers down there in the bottom of
the screen shooting out their zucchini's.
120

120

00:06:59,228  -->  00:07:02,788
Okay so that's a good step for now, I'm
gonna break this up into smaller videos.
121

121

00:07:02,788  -->  00:07:04,188
So great work, well done.
122

122

00:07:04,188  -->  00:07:07,488
We now have an instantiating
