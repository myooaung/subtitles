00:00:06,949  -->  00:00:08,206

00:00:08,206  -->  00:00:10,657
&gt;&gt; Well, next up we're gonna
be diving into doing coding,
5

5

00:00:10,657  -->  00:00:12,146
getting our hands dirty with C#.

00:00:12,146  -->  00:00:13,662
This is where we make the magic happen.

00:00:20,012  -->  00:00:22,220
It will be much easier to pick
the course up and carry on and
11

11

00:00:22,220  -->  00:00:23,929
you'll be writing your first actual code.

00:00:23,929  -->  00:00:24,970
Let's get on with it.
