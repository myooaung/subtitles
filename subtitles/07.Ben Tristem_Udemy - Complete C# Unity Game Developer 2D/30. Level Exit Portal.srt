00:00:00,025  -->  00:00:05,783
[SOUND] Hello again, in this video,
we're gonna create a simple level exit,
2

2

00:00:05,783  -->  00:00:10,211
so that when my player jumps
over the enemy, hits the exit,
3

3

00:00:10,211  -->  00:00:13,241
then we trigger our next level loading.
4

4

00:00:13,241  -->  00:00:16,250
So let's jump in and get cracking.
5

5

00:00:16,250  -->  00:00:20,190
The first step in the process is to create
a visualization for our level exit.
6

6

00:00:20,190  -->  00:00:21,420
I have gone and
7

7

00:00:21,420  -->  00:00:26,060
created a little exit sign here, that
you can download against this lecture.
8

8

00:00:26,060  -->  00:00:28,810
I need to sort out my asset folder here,
its all over the place.
9

9

00:00:28,810  -->  00:00:32,880
There we go, sprites and
tiles, put it into sprites.
10

10

00:00:32,880  -->  00:00:36,320
Dragging that into our sprites folder,
you can see it there.
11

11

00:00:36,320  -->  00:00:38,400
Well, I've clicked on this.
12

12

00:00:38,400  -->  00:00:41,600
If I right click,
created 2D object sprite,
13

13

00:00:41,600  -->  00:00:47,570
that image is automatically populated
into our sprite slot here which is handy.
14

14

00:00:47,570  -->  00:00:52,000
I'm gonna rename this to Level Exit and
15

15

00:00:52,000  -->  00:00:55,210
we don't see it at the moment so
I will move over to the general position.
16

16

00:00:55,210  -->  00:00:57,980
We need to sort out our layers,
our sorting layer in particular.
17

17

00:00:57,980  -->  00:01:02,120
We'll go out to the top right here,
click on Layers, Edit Layers and
18

18

00:01:02,120  -->  00:01:06,090
I will add a new layer which
I'm gonna call Interactibles.
19

19

00:01:06,090  -->  00:01:08,790
Interactables, which
20

20

00:01:08,790  -->  00:01:12,300
basically saying things that the player
should be able to touch, pick up.
21

21

00:01:12,300  -->  00:01:14,750
Coins, power ups,
any of that kind of stuff.
22

22

00:01:14,750  -->  00:01:18,810
I also create that in our physics
layers here, Interactables.
23

23

00:01:18,810  -->  00:01:22,160
Pasting it from up the top so
it's then same name, and
24

24

00:01:22,160  -->  00:01:25,950
then on our little exit I'll assign
the sorting layer to intractable.
25

25

00:01:25,950  -->  00:01:31,290
Now it should appear and also the layer,
layer to intractable as well.
26

26

00:01:31,290  -->  00:01:33,560
Such confusion with the layer, layer.
27

27

00:01:33,560  -->  00:01:34,950
Okay, now that we've got that.
28

28

00:01:34,950  -->  00:01:38,720
Our last step in this process is to
make sure that the project settings,
29

29

00:01:38,720  -->  00:01:42,970
physics 2D, without intractable is
interacting with just the player.
30

30

00:01:42,970  -->  00:01:46,920
So that other things aren't
accidentally causing our interactible
31

31

00:01:46,920  -->  00:01:49,960
to be interactibled with,
if that makes sense.
32

32

00:01:49,960  -->  00:01:53,030
So I've clicked off all of the other
interactable check boxes and
33

33

00:01:53,030  -->  00:01:56,070
it's just player that
can interact with that.
34

34

00:01:56,070  -->  00:01:58,240
Back over to level exit here.
35

35

00:01:58,240  -->  00:01:59,670
We need to add ourselves some collision.
36

36

00:01:59,670  -->  00:02:01,630
So I'll add a box collider 2D.
37

37

00:02:01,630  -->  00:02:05,340
Make that a trigger, either that or
the player needs to be a trigger.
38

38

00:02:05,340  -->  00:02:10,840
We're gonna make this a trigger and then,
that looks pretty good in terms of that.
39

39

00:02:10,840  -->  00:02:11,970
It could be a little bit bigger.
40

40

00:02:11,970  -->  00:02:17,410
I'm gonna just reset the z axis here to 0,
so that it's not floating in and out.
41

41

00:02:17,410  -->  00:02:20,690
You can see, if I go into 3D modes,
then it does have an x position.
42

42

00:02:20,690  -->  00:02:23,570
It doesn't really, sorry,
a z position, or a z position.
43

43

00:02:23,570  -->  00:02:26,640
It doesn't really matter so much,
but I just like to have it at 0, so
44

44

00:02:26,640  -->  00:02:28,730
it's all lined up nice and neatly there.
45

45

00:02:28,730  -->  00:02:31,620
I will also increase it in scale.
46

46

00:02:31,620  -->  00:02:33,120
I think I'll double it in size.
47

47

00:02:33,120  -->  00:02:34,110
It's a bit bigger in there.
48

48

00:02:35,230  -->  00:02:40,550
Okay there we have now exit
image that we can interact with.
49

49

00:02:40,550  -->  00:02:43,030
Next part of the process is to
create some behavior for that.
50

50

00:02:43,030  -->  00:02:51,120
So add a component, I'm going to call this
script a level exit, and create that.
51

51

00:02:51,120  -->  00:02:55,100
Now in level exit, I'm not gonna need
the start and update methods, so
52

52

00:02:55,100  -->  00:02:56,770
I'm going to get rid of
those right from the get go.
53

53

00:02:56,770  -->  00:03:01,810
So I'll just pseudo code this out and
I'll make it a little bit cryptic, so
54

54

00:03:01,810  -->  00:03:04,340
that there's some challenge for
you in the challenge.
55

55

00:03:04,340  -->  00:03:09,540
So we need to create a method which
will be WhenSomethingHappens.
56

56

00:03:09,540  -->  00:03:13,060
I recommend you rename this method to
something a little bit more sensible,
57

57

00:03:13,060  -->  00:03:17,740
but at the moment, I'll call this
WhenSomethingHappens as our method here.
58

58

00:03:17,740  -->  00:03:23,800
And then when something does happen,
we want to start coroutine.
59

59

00:03:23,800  -->  00:03:28,750
In the coroutine we need
to have an IEnumerator.
60

60

00:03:28,750  -->  00:03:32,343
IEnumerator, there we go, and
61

61

00:03:32,343  -->  00:03:37,447
the IEnumerator Has A Name,
62

62

00:03:37,447  -->  00:03:42,900
HasAName and
you will name them as you like, and
63

63

00:03:42,900  -->  00:03:47,440
in here we need to have some
sort of yield with a delay.
64

64

00:03:49,170  -->  00:03:51,020
Then what else do we need to do?
65

65

00:03:51,020  -->  00:03:54,180
We need load the next scene.
66

66

00:03:54,180  -->  00:03:56,160
Okay, so that's our pseudo code.
67

67

00:03:56,160  -->  00:03:58,850
Something's gonna happen, want you to
figure out what it is that needs to
68

68

00:03:58,850  -->  00:04:00,700
happen, then we start our coroutine.
69

69

00:04:00,700  -->  00:04:06,850
Name the coroutine, sorry, start
the coroutine and name the IEnumerator.
70

70

00:04:06,850  -->  00:04:11,650
And put that up here in the coroutine and
then we yield with the delay and
71

71

00:04:11,650  -->  00:04:12,780
then we load the next scene.
72

72

00:04:12,780  -->  00:04:16,080
I'm gonna give the code just now for
loading the next scene actually.
73

73

00:04:16,080  -->  00:04:19,020
So this is more of a coroutine
exercise than a figuring out
74

74

00:04:19,020  -->  00:04:20,480
how to lead the next scene exercise.
75

75

00:04:20,480  -->  00:04:22,590
So I'll show you this process
while we're here together.
76

76

00:04:22,590  -->  00:04:24,590
I'm gonna create a variable,
77

77

00:04:24,590  -->  00:04:28,570
we first of all need to get what
the current scene is that we're on.
78

78

00:04:28,570  -->  00:04:31,360
Which reminds me we need to go into
moment and set up our build settings,
79

79

00:04:31,360  -->  00:04:32,850
we'll do that in just a moment.
80

80

00:04:32,850  -->  00:04:38,660
The current scene index because each
scene has an index will be what?
81

81

00:04:38,660  -->  00:04:42,188
Well we need to make sure we're
using the right namespace using
82

82

00:04:42,188  -->  00:04:48,700
the unityengine.scene management.
83

83

00:04:48,700  -->  00:04:50,010
Yep that's the one.
84

84

00:04:50,010  -->  00:04:52,250
Took a moment to remember that.
85

85

00:04:52,250  -->  00:04:55,700
So in here we know when
we say scene manager,
86

86

00:04:55,700  -->  00:04:57,970
we can use scene manager now that
we're using that name space.
87

87

00:04:57,970  -->  00:05:00,970
Scene manager.getactivescene.
88

88

00:05:00,970  -->  00:05:06,050
Get active scene, and .buildIndex.
89

89

00:05:06,050  -->  00:05:08,910
So we find out what is the current
build index and my apologies for
90

90

00:05:08,910  -->  00:05:11,750
all the squiggly red lines, cuz we
are doing this with in the pseudo code.
91

91

00:05:11,750  -->  00:05:13,150
With in we've got proper code.
92

92

00:05:13,150  -->  00:05:15,990
It's not auto completing and
it's got squiggly lines and so
93

93

00:05:15,990  -->  00:05:17,260
a little bit ugly and a mess.
94

94

00:05:17,260  -->  00:05:20,270
And I'm sure some of you out there
are yelling at the screen and saying, Aah!
95

95

00:05:20,270  -->  00:05:21,360
What's going on here.
96

96

00:05:21,360  -->  00:05:24,780
That's doesn't work proper but
the point is I wanna give you
97

97

00:05:24,780  -->  00:05:28,120
a bit of a challenge and
not give it to you all precisely.
98

98

00:05:28,120  -->  00:05:31,002
These two lines will be the once
that when I give to you precisely.
99

99

00:05:31,002  -->  00:05:35,912
The second line of this is that,
what do we do now with our scene manager,
100

100

00:05:35,912  -->  00:05:40,755
now that we have index, we need to add
one to it, to save the next scene.
101

101

00:05:40,755  -->  00:05:47,555
So we say scenemanager.loadscene,
so we want to load the next scene.
102

102

00:05:47,555  -->  00:05:53,175
Load next scene is this currentsceneindex
up here, which I'm gonna copy and
103

103

00:05:53,175  -->  00:05:58,622
paste because my auto complete is not
gonna work with that with my ID because
104

104

00:05:58,622  -->  00:06:03,500
it's not fitting within something
that makes sense to it, +1.
105

105

00:06:03,500  -->  00:06:07,280
Okay, so this part of the code in here,
I'll just give a space,
106

106

00:06:07,280  -->  00:06:12,080
this part is written in a way which
will say, take us to the next scene.
107

107

00:06:12,080  -->  00:06:15,200
And the other part of it is the other
part of the code that you should have
108

108

00:06:15,200  -->  00:06:19,160
all the foundation now to complete
that in a pretty straight forward way.
109

109

00:06:19,160  -->  00:06:22,800
Before I give you the challenge, we'll go
back here and setup our build index so
110

110

00:06:22,800  -->  00:06:24,910
that we know that it is accurate.
111

111

00:06:24,910  -->  00:06:29,140
I will go into my scenes or
my levels, highlight them all.
112

112

00:06:29,140  -->  00:06:31,130
Drag them into the scenes and build.
113

113

00:06:31,130  -->  00:06:34,110
Need to make sure that this
main menu is the top one.
114

114

00:06:34,110  -->  00:06:36,810
So it'll have seen indexes zero and
then level one, level two.
115

115

00:06:36,810  -->  00:06:40,300
As I mentioned in the last video,
we can update these in the future so
116

116

00:06:40,300  -->  00:06:42,880
they have more of a functionality name.
117

117

00:06:42,880  -->  00:06:46,580
So level with the ladder and
the first time you meet an enemy, but for
118

118

00:06:46,580  -->  00:06:48,090
now I'm leaving it at level one and two so
119

119

00:06:48,090  -->  00:06:51,680
it's super clear what it is
that we're doing as we do it.
120

120

00:06:51,680  -->  00:06:54,010
So you know what I'm up to in my levels.
121

121

00:06:54,010  -->  00:06:56,660
Okay, we don't need to click build,
back into here.
122

122

00:06:56,660  -->  00:06:59,440
Having a look at our script, you can
see that there's a little bit to do.
123

123

00:06:59,440  -->  00:07:03,170
So I'm gonna issue a challenge which is,
let me just roll that back up.
124

124

00:07:03,170  -->  00:07:07,510
Step one, use collision check to determine
when the player has reached the exit.
125

125

00:07:07,510  -->  00:07:11,860
Use a Coroutine so that level doesn't load
instantly, and I'm gonna give you bonus
126

126

00:07:11,860  -->  00:07:17,210
points if you add something flashy and
share with the community!
127

127

00:07:17,210  -->  00:07:19,460
So I'd love to see something
that you put in there.
128

128

00:07:19,460  -->  00:07:25,570
A big like particle effect, or maybe a
swirling portal, or have the screen blink.
129

129

00:07:25,570  -->  00:07:29,460
Or the player do a back flip, something
flashy to say that you have finished
130

130

00:07:29,460  -->  00:07:32,550
the level, you've completed it,
now you're learning the next level.
131

131

00:07:32,550  -->  00:07:36,210
So those of you who are into a bit of
flash, put something flashy in there.
132

132

00:07:36,210  -->  00:07:40,140
Share it with the community, let us
know about it, whether it's Facebook, or
133

133

00:07:40,140  -->  00:07:43,360
through the Q&amp;A section or
through our community forum.
134

134

00:07:43,360  -->  00:07:46,860
We would love to see some of your
flair that you've put into it.
135

135

00:07:46,860  -->  00:07:47,740
That would be super cool.
136

136

00:07:47,740  -->  00:07:48,850
So there's the challenge.
137

137

00:07:48,850  -->  00:07:51,240
This is the code that you need
to work through and tidy up and
138

138

00:07:51,240  -->  00:07:54,140
have no red lines once
you've completed this.
139

139

00:07:54,140  -->  00:07:55,624
And I will see you back here
when you've got that done.
140

140

00:07:58,318  -->  00:07:59,224
Okay, welcome back.
141

141

00:07:59,224  -->  00:08:00,293
So I don't know about you, but
142

142

00:08:00,293  -->  00:08:02,280
these red lines are really
driving me a little bit crazy.
143

143

00:08:02,280  -->  00:08:04,540
I'm looking forward to tightening this up.
144

144

00:08:04,540  -->  00:08:08,960
First of all,
we need to have a on trigger enter.
145

145

00:08:08,960  -->  00:08:13,760
So, OnTriggerEnter2D will be,
so OnTriggerEnter2D, so
146

146

00:08:13,760  -->  00:08:16,040
that's the thing that needs to happen.
147

147

00:08:16,040  -->  00:08:18,015
And that's not gonna auto
complete it complete for me.
148

148

00:08:18,015  -->  00:08:22,910
That's what I get when I try to be clever,
and give you a challenge without having it
149

149

00:08:22,910  -->  00:08:25,840
auto fill for me and
my ID doesn't know what's going on.
150

150

00:08:25,840  -->  00:08:28,470
So I have to type it a lot manually but
that's fine.
151

151

00:08:28,470  -->  00:08:29,980
It's good to practice typing.
152

152

00:08:29,980  -->  00:08:31,680
Okay, so start coroutine.
153

153

00:08:31,680  -->  00:08:33,150
Well, what sort of coroutine?
154

154

00:08:33,150  -->  00:08:34,620
We'll type this correctly as well.
155

155

00:08:34,620  -->  00:08:36,160
StartCoroutine.
156

156

00:08:36,160  -->  00:08:37,650
Now, it knows what's going on.
157

157

00:08:37,650  -->  00:08:41,740
We'll call this LoadNextLevel
which is what we wish to do.
158

158

00:08:41,740  -->  00:08:45,850
LoadNextLevel()) semicolon
at the end of that.
159

159

00:08:45,850  -->  00:08:48,890
I'm going to grab this,
copy this LoadNextLevel,
160

160

00:08:48,890  -->  00:08:52,670
just in case it doesn't wanna auto fill
for me, that will be our IEnumerator.
161

161

00:08:52,670  -->  00:08:55,320
So the StartCoroutine(LoadNextLevel()),
162

162

00:08:55,320  -->  00:08:57,650
then we're coming down
here to LoadNextLevel().
163

163

00:08:57,650  -->  00:09:00,360
We need our parentheses
at the end of that.
164

164

00:09:00,360  -->  00:09:03,030
Starting to get a few less
red squiggly lines in here.
165

165

00:09:03,030  -->  00:09:04,510
What sort of yield do we need?
166

166

00:09:04,510  -->  00:09:07,530
Cuz we're using our IEnumerator
we do need to yield,
167

167

00:09:07,530  -->  00:09:10,552
we will yield return is our syntax.
168

168

00:09:10,552  -->  00:09:17,520
New, [INAUDIBLE] well I like to wait for
seconds real time, so
169

169

00:09:17,520  -->  00:09:21,790
I know I can count one and count two and
count three, it's the real time seconds.
170

170

00:09:21,790  -->  00:09:22,880
And then, how long would that be?
171

171

00:09:22,880  -->  00:09:24,170
Well, we could make that, say, 2f.
172

172

00:09:25,660  -->  00:09:30,300
Or, even better, we could serialize this,
and say LevelLoadDelay, so
173

173

00:09:30,300  -->  00:09:33,300
we don't have any magic numbers
buried within our code down there.
174

174

00:09:34,750  -->  00:09:39,020
And we will right up to the very top of
our class here, we'll say, SerializeField.
175

175

00:09:40,090  -->  00:09:41,180
This is stuff we've done before.
176

176

00:09:41,180  -->  00:09:42,390
So it should be pretty familiar.
177

177

00:09:42,390  -->  00:09:44,280
Hopefully you had good success
with the challenge and
178

178

00:09:44,280  -->  00:09:45,450
it matches what I'm doing here.
179

179

00:09:45,450  -->  00:09:47,845
Even if my names are a little bit
different to yours that's okay.
180

180

00:09:47,845  -->  00:09:52,839
So our [SerializeField]
float LevelLoadDelay.
181

181

00:09:52,839  -->  00:09:57,470
Okay, and we'll initialize that to 2 F.
182

182

00:09:57,470  -->  00:09:59,050
So two seconds that will be.
183

183

00:09:59,050  -->  00:10:02,010
Wait for seconds,
real-time will be two seconds.
184

184

00:10:02,010  -->  00:10:04,490
As up her,
we can change that in the inspector, and
185

185

00:10:04,490  -->  00:10:08,940
then we have to load the next
scene is what we need to do.
186

186

00:10:08,940  -->  00:10:10,260
So we'll save.
187

187

00:10:10,260  -->  00:10:15,000
Let's hop back over into our scene,
I will click play, and all going to plan.
188

188

00:10:15,000  -->  00:10:17,170
My player will do what
they're supposed to do.
189

189

00:10:17,170  -->  00:10:20,700
Jump into that one second,
two second and badoom.
190

190

00:10:20,700  -->  00:10:22,180
There we go, the next level.
191

191

00:10:22,180  -->  00:10:23,490
Super cool.
192

192

00:10:23,490  -->  00:10:26,200
Now, I'm gonna add one
last bit to this video,
193

193

00:10:26,200  -->  00:10:28,080
which is my own little bit of flashiness.
194

194

00:10:28,080  -->  00:10:30,930
Hopefully, you took a moment to
put some flashiness in there.
195

195

00:10:30,930  -->  00:10:35,260
I'm gonna put the flashiness in which
is a little bit of a slow-mo moment,
196

196

00:10:35,260  -->  00:10:39,384
like a slow-motion moment, when we
go through the level to sort of slow
197

197

00:10:39,384  -->  00:10:42,295
everything down,
[NOISE] you made it kinda thing.
198

198

00:10:42,295  -->  00:10:47,950
To do that, to make that look interesting,
I need to grab my enemy or grab a enemy.
199

199

00:10:47,950  -->  00:10:50,870
Prefabs, Enemy, just so
we can see the effect.
200

200

00:10:50,870  -->  00:10:53,920
I'll put it right there as an interesting
little obstacle that you have to jump over
201

201

00:10:53,920  -->  00:10:55,090
the enemy to get in.
202

202

00:10:55,090  -->  00:10:57,610
This is my Obstacle level.
203

203

00:10:57,610  -->  00:10:59,620
So I'll take the enemy
out in the future but for
204

204

00:10:59,620  -->  00:11:01,720
now I'm just using this for
illustrative purposes.
205

205

00:11:01,720  -->  00:11:05,160
Jump back over into my levelExit script.
206

206

00:11:05,160  -->  00:11:12,450
And there's a method we can use in
here at the top of our loadNextLevel.
207

207

00:11:12,450  -->  00:11:16,445
We can use Time.timeScale.
208

208

00:11:16,445  -->  00:11:19,530
Time.timeScale which allows
us to say how fast or
209

209

00:11:19,530  -->  00:11:22,350
how slow our entire game is going to run.
210

210

00:11:22,350  -->  00:11:26,540
We can put that and say 0.2f.
211

211

00:11:26,540  -->  00:11:29,720
Even better once again run
a magic number buried in there.
212

212

00:11:29,720  -->  00:11:34,240
Let's say our LevelExitSlowMoFactor.
213

213

00:11:34,240  -->  00:11:37,200
Nice long, big, descriptive.
214

214

00:11:37,200  -->  00:11:41,620
I'm gonna copy that up here,
and serialize field.
215

215

00:11:41,620  -->  00:11:44,520
I'll parametrize and serialize this.
216

216

00:11:44,520  -->  00:11:52,085
Float, LevelExitSlowmoFactor
= 0.2f semicolon.
217

217

00:11:53,415  -->  00:11:56,315
It's important that we
return it back to normal.
218

218

00:11:56,315  -->  00:11:58,965
We return the matrix back
to it's normal speed.
219

219

00:11:58,965  -->  00:12:02,225
It's also important you don't
overuse this time dot time scout.
220

220

00:12:02,225  -->  00:12:03,455
It's pretty cool.
221

221

00:12:03,455  -->  00:12:06,005
You can do it for
really cool moments in your game, but
222

222

00:12:06,005  -->  00:12:08,845
don't use it to much cause players will
get a little bit upset if it's happening
223

223

00:12:08,845  -->  00:12:12,200
on every single little time they jump,
for example, but we need to return it.
224

224

00:12:12,200  -->  00:12:15,050
So we've done our yield,
we've gone back to our co routine.
225

225

00:12:15,050  -->  00:12:19,300
We've gone off for x number of seconds and
then when it returns,
226

226

00:12:19,300  -->  00:12:24,420
when it continues with load next level,
it will be after our yield.
227

227

00:12:24,420  -->  00:12:29,380
So at this point we need to
say time.timeScale equals
228

228

00:12:29,380  -->  00:12:34,450
back to normal which is 1f,
and that is normal timescale.
229

229

00:12:34,450  -->  00:12:37,950
Okay let's see how this goes,
save back into the build click play.
230

230

00:12:37,950  -->  00:12:42,400
Make sure that there is nothing
weird that is going on with that.
231

231

00:12:42,400  -->  00:12:46,680
Let's see if I can actually hit this
jump without bouncing into the enemy.
232

232

00:12:46,680  -->  00:12:50,081
Yep, got that, and then in there and
then [NOISE], all slows down, and
233

233

00:12:50,081  -->  00:12:51,477
then we load the next level.
234

234

00:12:51,477  -->  00:12:53,992
So that's a little bit of flashiness,
it's probably not
235

235

00:12:53,992  -->  00:12:57,620
as flashy as whatever flashiness you
put in, but I think it's pretty cool.
236

236

00:12:57,620  -->  00:13:01,410
The last steps we would do is
we would load our other scenes.
237

237

00:13:01,410  -->  00:13:05,900
Actually at the moment, in my main menu
scene, I'm gonna click a start button so
238

238

00:13:05,900  -->  00:13:07,480
I don't need the exit there.
239

239

00:13:07,480  -->  00:13:10,280
And in level two,
we don't actually have a level three, so
240

240

00:13:10,280  -->  00:13:11,490
I wouldn't need the exit yet.
241

241

00:13:11,490  -->  00:13:14,220
So this is actually the only scene
that needs the exit for the moment.
242

242

00:13:14,220  -->  00:13:17,620
So it's tight for now until we
have more scenes and more levels.
243

243

00:13:17,620  -->  00:13:20,830
So that's us, we've created a level exit.
244

244

00:13:20,830  -->  00:13:23,340
Hope you did well in this video, and
I'll see you in an upcoming video.
