00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:04,263
[MUSIC]
2

2

00:00:04,263  -->  00:00:07,130
In this video, we're making another enemy,
I've called mine big boy.
3

3

00:00:07,130  -->  00:00:10,840
He's bigger, stronger, tougher and
drops bombs at the player,
4

4

00:00:10,840  -->  00:00:13,172
so let's jump in and make another enemy.
5

5

00:00:13,172  -->  00:00:17,594
Let's start by selecting a new laser
beam bomb and a new enemy to use.
6

6

00:00:17,594  -->  00:00:21,841
So I'll go into my Kenny assets P&amp;Gs,
first of all we'll find a new enemy.
7

7

00:00:21,841  -->  00:00:25,811
And I think we'll go
with maybe a green guy,
8

8

00:00:25,811  -->  00:00:29,789
this green kind of butterfly looking dude.
9

9

00:00:29,789  -->  00:00:33,131
And we'll drag that into our sprites so
we know we are using that.
10

10

00:00:33,131  -->  00:00:36,125
And then we'll find a lasers, [SOUND].
11

11

00:00:36,125  -->  00:00:37,255
Scroll down,
12

12

00:00:37,255  -->  00:00:41,719
laser red 10 I think looks pretty good
as little bombs that are dropping.
13

13

00:00:41,719  -->  00:00:46,300
So we'll drag that over into
our sprites as well, excellent.
14

14

00:00:46,300  -->  00:00:49,429
Now the prefabs,
gonna go into the prefabs folder,
15

15

00:00:49,429  -->  00:00:51,716
and find one of our existing enemies.
16

16

00:00:51,716  -->  00:00:55,708
We'll take Roger, duplicate Roger,
and I wanna make a bigger enemy.
17

17

00:00:55,708  -->  00:01:00,023
So instead of Roger 1, we'll call this
bigger enemy, I don't know, Big Boy,
18

18

00:01:00,023  -->  00:01:00,728
there we go.
19

19

00:01:00,728  -->  00:01:03,115
That's a good name for
a big thing, isn't it, a Big Boy.
20

20

00:01:03,115  -->  00:01:07,283
And then I'm gonna go straight for
my sprites folder and
21

21

00:01:07,283  -->  00:01:12,172
drag in our enemyGreen currently
at the moment, enemyGreen5.
22

22

00:01:12,172  -->  00:01:16,621
Okay, so back into our Prefabs,
find where is Big Boy going?
23

23

00:01:16,621  -->  00:01:22,815
Roger 1, Big Boy, we will rename it
over in here as well to Big Boy.
24

24

00:01:22,815  -->  00:01:25,439
There we go,
we'll change the image of Big Boy.
25

25

00:01:25,439  -->  00:01:27,193
It's changes, it's updated, excellent.
26

26

00:01:27,193  -->  00:01:30,415
Now we'll give it a little bit of color
treatment, drag it into the scene so
27

27

00:01:30,415  -->  00:01:32,523
I can see when I make these
changes what happens.
28

28

00:01:32,523  -->  00:01:37,204
This is a pretty crude way of changing
the color of a sprite, of an image.
29

29

00:01:37,204  -->  00:01:39,245
It's much better if you
change it at source.
30

30

00:01:39,245  -->  00:01:43,741
But we were making kind of a purply color,
yeah.
31

31

00:01:43,741  -->  00:01:47,961
Purple Big Boy, there we go,
not too terrible.
32

32

00:01:47,961  -->  00:01:49,863
Okay, what else do we need to do?
33

33

00:01:49,863  -->  00:01:53,319
We've got a rigid body, kinematic,
excellent, the enemy script.
34

34

00:01:53,319  -->  00:01:56,769
Health, well Big Boy is gonna have
more health, we'll say 600 so
35

35

00:01:56,769  -->  00:01:59,101
it's a little bit tough
to actually destroy.
36

36

00:01:59,101  -->  00:02:03,354
Score value 460, tougher to kill,
more points to get.
37

37

00:02:03,354  -->  00:02:06,599
Shot counter, now we don't actually
need to be changing shot counter,
38

38

00:02:06,599  -->  00:02:09,753
that's left in there from when we
wanted to see it for debug purposes.
39

39

00:02:09,753  -->  00:02:13,714
So let's go and tidy that up by finding
our script, we need the enemy script.
40

40

00:02:16,580  -->  00:02:17,976
Open that up in Visual Studio.
41

41

00:02:17,976  -->  00:02:21,868
We just need to change it from serialized
field to non-serialized field.
42

42

00:02:21,868  -->  00:02:26,099
So let's find shot counter, remove
the serialized field cuz we don't need to
43

43

00:02:26,099  -->  00:02:28,548
be messing with that anymore,
save that up.
44

44

00:02:28,548  -->  00:02:32,376
Back over into your Big Boy, so
45

45

00:02:32,376  -->  00:02:37,840
Prefabs &gt; Prefabs folder and then Big Boy.
46

46

00:02:37,840  -->  00:02:42,108
Let's see over here,
okay Min.Time Between Shots 0.2,
47

47

00:02:42,108  -->  00:02:46,058
Maximum Time 0.6,
not really sure, just guessing.
48

48

00:02:46,058  -->  00:02:49,802
Projectile right now, this is where
we need to make a new projectile.
49

49

00:02:49,802  -->  00:02:51,917
So I'll come back to that in a moment.
50

50

00:02:51,917  -->  00:02:54,743
Let's just finish up going through these
things in Big Boy and make sure it's okay.
51

51

00:02:54,743  -->  00:02:57,954
So Projectile Speed, we're gonna have
it really slow, we'll see how 2 goes.
52

52

00:02:57,954  -->  00:03:03,908
Explosion, yeah, Death Effect, and laser,
we'll just go and randomly pick a Laser4.
53

53

00:03:03,908  -->  00:03:07,183
I think that might be okay, and
then shoot sound volume, okay.
54

54

00:03:07,183  -->  00:03:08,910
Everything else is pretty good.
55

55

00:03:08,910  -->  00:03:15,305
What I would like to do is to make Big Boy
bigger, so I'll go back to my sprites.
56

56

00:03:15,305  -->  00:03:21,245
Find the enemyGreen, and then I'm gonna
rename it while I'm here Big Boy.
57

57

00:03:21,245  -->  00:03:26,024
Just to show that I'm actually changing
something in here to make this
58

58

00:03:26,024  -->  00:03:29,187
a 50 under pixels per
unit I'm gonna apply.
59

59

00:03:29,187  -->  00:03:31,122
That should make it tons bigger.
60

60

00:03:31,122  -->  00:03:32,908
Okay, a little bit more bigger and
61

61

00:03:32,908  -->  00:03:36,056
menacing on the screen just by
changing the pixels per unit.
62

62

00:03:36,056  -->  00:03:37,643
Now back to Prefabs&gt; Big Boy,
63

63

00:03:37,643  -->  00:03:40,522
make sure we've done everything
we need to do in there.
64

64

00:03:40,522  -->  00:03:42,445
Damage deal script,
I think that's everything.
65

65

00:03:42,445  -->  00:03:46,181
Okay, now over to our projectile,
let's find our enemy laser.
66

66

00:03:46,181  -->  00:03:54,111
Duplicate enemy laser, we'll call this
in here we'll call it, Enemy Bomb.
67

67

00:03:56,619  -->  00:03:58,943
Okay, and then clicking on Enemy Bomb.
68

68

00:03:58,943  -->  00:04:03,018
And then let's go to our Sprites folder,
find my LaserRed10,
69

69

00:04:03,018  -->  00:04:05,544
drag that over into where the sprite is.
70

70

00:04:05,544  -->  00:04:08,084
And then drag our prefab
from our Prefabs folder,
71

71

00:04:08,084  -->  00:04:10,027
it's just taking a moment to update.
72

72

00:04:10,027  -->  00:04:14,777
We can right-click and do a refresh or
a re-import and that updates it.
73

73

00:04:14,777  -->  00:04:17,552
Okay, drag that in,
it's been tinted with yellow.
74

74

00:04:17,552  -->  00:04:22,115
I want to tint it more of a red color,
a lighter kind of red.
75

75

00:04:22,115  -->  00:04:25,280
Maybe a darker kind of red, there we go.
76

76

00:04:25,280  -->  00:04:27,112
Need to change the collision on this,
77

77

00:04:27,112  -->  00:04:29,752
because we're using
the previous capsule collider.
78

78

00:04:29,752  -->  00:04:34,803
I right-click, remove component, and
then instead add a component and
79

79

00:04:34,803  -->  00:04:38,643
I'll do collider, let's see,
kind of boxy in shape.
80

80

00:04:38,643  -->  00:04:41,956
So do a box collider, actually no,
I'm gonna change my mind on that.
81

81

00:04:41,956  -->  00:04:48,843
I'm gonna do a circle collider and
Add Component, Circle Collider 2D.
82

82

00:04:48,843  -->  00:04:51,074
Yeah, I think that's a little bit
more indicative of what I'm going
83

83

00:04:51,074  -->  00:04:51,698
for, excellent.
84

84

00:04:51,698  -->  00:04:54,537
So I have a collider,
we've got our Rigid Body 2D.
85

85

00:04:54,537  -->  00:04:58,003
We've changed the color, we've changed the
name of it, it's all looking pretty good.
86

86

00:04:58,003  -->  00:05:00,999
Does it have its appropriate script,
Damage Dealer script?
87

87

00:05:00,999  -->  00:05:04,224
How much damage, still just 100,
I think that's okay.
88

88

00:05:04,224  -->  00:05:07,475
Right, save that up,
now we need to spawn these guys.
89

89

00:05:07,475  -->  00:05:11,691
So let's go to Waves, and what I'm gonna
do is make another path, actually.
90

90

00:05:11,691  -->  00:05:14,200
So I've already got a couple of
instances in my path in the scene.
91

91

00:05:14,200  -->  00:05:16,356
They're not doing anything in here,
this is just so
92

92

00:05:16,356  -->  00:05:17,933
I can easily duplicate and then edit.
93

93

00:05:17,933  -->  00:05:24,780
So I've got Path (2), if I open that up
and look at Waypoint (0), click on W.
94

94

00:05:24,780  -->  00:05:25,646
Where are we gonna make this?
95

95

00:05:25,646  -->  00:05:27,517
Let's make it go right from the top, and
96

96

00:05:27,517  -->  00:05:30,337
remembering that the top starts
just outside of our camera.
97

97

00:05:30,337  -->  00:05:36,317
Waypoint 1, coming down from the left,
waypoint 2, zig to the left a little bit.
98

98

00:05:36,317  -->  00:05:39,920
And then waypoint 3, down to the right.
99

99

00:05:39,920  -->  00:05:43,383
So it's basically just zig-zagging
its way across the screen.
100

100

00:05:43,383  -->  00:05:47,567
Maybe we'll make that a little bit more
to the right, and 0 over to the left.
101

101

00:05:47,567  -->  00:05:50,245
Zig-zags its way down the screen,
bombing the player the whole time,
102

102

00:05:50,245  -->  00:05:51,281
I think that would be good.
103

103

00:05:51,281  -->  00:05:53,841
Actually, we need to
have it over to the side.
104

104

00:05:53,841  -->  00:05:56,132
We don't want the player just
to stand over to the left and
105

105

00:05:56,132  -->  00:05:57,574
be like, you can't touch me.
106

106

00:05:57,574  -->  00:06:02,196
We wanna actually cover the whole
play space, as this particular enemy
107

107

00:06:02,196  -->  00:06:06,677
comes down through the world so
that the player fears for their life.
108

108

00:06:06,677  -->  00:06:10,148
And then they zero in on the player and
bonk into them, okay, cool.
109

109

00:06:10,148  -->  00:06:15,418
So find our Paths folder,
drag path2 down there and in.
110

110

00:06:15,418  -->  00:06:17,939
Like I said, I don't need any of these,
so I'm gonna go ahead and delete them.
111

111

00:06:17,939  -->  00:06:21,158
They're just there so I can duplicate,
make extra copies of new things.
112

112

00:06:21,158  -->  00:06:25,608
But I can do that by dropping one of
my existing prefabs in as an instance.
113

113

00:06:25,608  -->  00:06:29,827
And then to create something new or I
could just duplicate a path down in here.
114

114

00:06:29,827  -->  00:06:34,522
Now to our Waves,
let's find our Waves folder.
115

115

00:06:34,522  -->  00:06:40,513
I'm going to click on Wave number 1 and
change it from Roger to Big Boy, Big Boy.
116

116

00:06:40,513  -->  00:06:44,537
And then from Path Prefab
instead of Path 0 do Path (2),
117

117

00:06:44,537  -->  00:06:49,052
time between spawns 0.5 and
0.3, we'll see how that goes.
118

118

00:06:49,052  -->  00:06:53,599
And I'll show you number of enemies we'll
say 6,and then the movements be we'll say
119

119

00:06:53,599  -->  00:06:56,600
2, so they're coming nice and
slowly into the screen.
120

120

00:06:56,600  -->  00:06:58,764
Let's see if we've captured
everything in there or
121

121

00:06:58,764  -->  00:07:00,349
if we've forgotten anything at all.
122

122

00:07:00,349  -->  00:07:02,989
I should delete these couple
of guys from the screen, but
123

123

00:07:02,989  -->  00:07:04,318
we'll leave it as now as is.
124

124

00:07:04,318  -->  00:07:07,137
Okay, so we haven't given it
the projectile that we want and
125

125

00:07:07,137  -->  00:07:09,306
they're a little bit
spaced close together.
126

126

00:07:09,306  -->  00:07:15,935
So let's find the enemy wave, so Wave 1.
127

127

00:07:15,935  -->  00:07:22,414
The time between spawns, we'll say 1,
random factor 0.5, hopefully that's okay.
128

128

00:07:22,414  -->  00:07:25,274
6 move speed, seemed okay at 2.
129

129

00:07:25,274  -->  00:07:29,134
And we've got a null reference exception
that'll give us some clues here.
130

130

00:07:29,134  -->  00:07:32,188
Object reference not set to an instance,
so Big Boy that we've dropped into
131

131

00:07:32,188  -->  00:07:34,779
the scene, that's just the one
we're playing around with.
132

132

00:07:34,779  -->  00:07:37,842
So we'll delete here and then we'll
delete the other one out of the scene.
133

133

00:07:37,842  -->  00:07:40,330
That should clear up those
errors that we've had.
134

134

00:07:40,330  -->  00:07:43,019
Now we need to change the projectile and
135

135

00:07:43,019  -->  00:07:47,419
we do that by clicking on Big Boy and
saying that his projectile,
136

136

00:07:47,419  -->  00:07:51,184
instead of Enemy Laser,
is going to be the Enemy Bomb.
137

137

00:07:51,184  -->  00:07:56,789
Okay, let's click play Do
a little bit [SOUND] shoot,
138

138

00:07:56,789  -->  00:07:58,616
out he comes dropping some bombs.
139

139

00:07:58,616  -->  00:08:03,613
Those bombs are dropping mightily fast,
we need to space them out a little bit,
140

140

00:08:03,613  -->  00:08:05,635
and he's a bit too easy to kill.
141

141

00:08:05,635  -->  00:08:09,264
Okay, so health we haven't changed
the health on Big Boy in our prefab.
142

142

00:08:09,264  -->  00:08:13,353
So let's make the health say 600,
actually you know what?
143

143

00:08:13,353  -->  00:08:18,154
I'm gonna be nasty and make it a 1000 and
then score value we'll say, 460,
144

144

00:08:18,154  -->  00:08:18,985
for example.
145

145

00:08:18,985  -->  00:08:22,497
And then Projectile Speed,
I think a little bit faster, so
146

146

00:08:22,497  -->  00:08:24,261
a 3 on the Projectile Speed.
147

147

00:08:24,261  -->  00:08:25,709
And then what I'm looking for?
148

148

00:08:25,709  -->  00:08:28,476
Prefabs, Big Boy, we want him shooting.
149

149

00:08:28,476  -->  00:08:32,974
So minimum time between shots, that's
way too little, so we'll say 1.5, and
150

150

00:08:32,974  -->  00:08:35,775
the maximum time between
shots we'll say 2.5.
151

151

00:08:35,775  -->  00:08:38,949
We'll see how that goes.
152

152

00:08:38,949  -->  00:08:43,095
Actually, we'll say from 1 to 2,
see how that is.
153

153

00:08:43,095  -->  00:08:47,352
Projectile speed, I think,
little bit faster, we'll say 5.
154

154

00:08:47,352  -->  00:08:52,130
And then we'll click on play,
see how that tuning is, [SOUND].
155

155

00:08:52,130  -->  00:08:56,051
Okay, we've got him coming out [SOUND],
shooting, shooting, it's taking awhile.
156

156

00:08:56,051  -->  00:08:58,524
The whole point of this is it takes
a while to shoot and to kill,
157

157

00:08:58,524  -->  00:09:01,108
and then we're still killing it
when these other ones come out.
158

158

00:09:01,108  -->  00:09:03,848
So I've got bullets going everywhere,
a little bit of bullet hell,
159

159

00:09:03,848  -->  00:09:05,086
which is exactly what we want.
160

160

00:09:05,086  -->  00:09:07,749
We could spawn another wave of them,
here they come now.
161

161

00:09:07,749  -->  00:09:09,641
Okay, so I haven't got a lot
of variety in my waves,
162

162

00:09:09,641  -->  00:09:10,931
I haven't really tuned that a lot.
163

163

00:09:10,931  -->  00:09:14,260
But for now,
I think this is a pretty good wave,
164

164

00:09:14,260  -->  00:09:17,766
that it's creating some good dodging and
[SOUND].
165

165

00:09:17,766  -->  00:09:20,535
Yes, okay, I like it, I like it a lot.
166

166

00:09:20,535  -->  00:09:24,983
Okay, so we got ourselves a new enemy,
a new wave, a new path, a new projectile,
167

167

00:09:24,983  -->  00:09:27,839
everything's working well,
it's all lining up.
168

168

00:09:27,839  -->  00:09:29,820
And I just wanted to go
through that whole process so
169

169

00:09:29,820  -->  00:09:31,211
we're testing out every bit of it.
170

170

00:09:31,211  -->  00:09:36,058
So reminding ourselves as well of how
we add tons of variation into our game.
171

171

00:09:36,058  -->  00:09:39,359
In the next video we'll add a little
bit of spice into that projectile so
172

172

00:09:39,359  -->  00:09:41,570
it looks a little bit
more interesting as well.
173

173

00:09:41,570  -->  00:09:46,525
But for
now my challenge to you is to add MOAR.
174

174

00:09:46,525  -->  00:09:49,348
So add more enemies, add more paths.
175

175

00:09:49,348  -->  00:09:52,572
Add more visual effects,
add more sound effects, and
176

176

00:09:52,572  -->  00:09:55,668
to show us what you got when
you have done all of that.
177

177

00:09:55,668  -->  00:09:57,507
So get in there and really play around,
178

178

00:09:57,507  -->  00:10:00,191
have some fun with making some
challenge for the player.
179

179

00:10:00,191  -->  00:10:03,279
Making some variety, making
different things, different enemies,
180

180

00:10:03,279  -->  00:10:04,775
different colors, everything.
181

181

00:10:04,775  -->  00:10:08,993
So now's a good time to play around
with what we currently have and
182

182

00:10:08,993  -->  00:10:13,528
to throw a whole bunch of more content
at your game and see how it feels.
183

183

00:10:13,528  -->  00:10:16,879
Okay, and please do share with what
you've got, I would love to see it.
184

184

00:10:16,879  -->  00:10:18,940
Great work and
I will see you in the next video.
