00:00:03,965  -->  00:00:08,304
Hello again, in this video, we're
organizing our folder structure, adding
3

3

00:00:08,304  -->  00:00:12,460
all of our states and all of our dialogue,
all of our next state conditions.
4

4

00:00:12,460  -->  00:00:16,796
And creating a game that we can play the
full way through with a start, a middle,
5

5

00:00:16,796  -->  00:00:19,209
and an end, let's jump in and get started.
6

6

00:00:19,209  -->  00:00:22,255
So here is your challenge, it's also
what were covering in this video.
7

7

00:00:22,255  -->  00:00:25,769
We're going to add an introduction state
with some instructions to the player,
8

8

00:00:25,769  -->  00:00:28,258
we'll add a Game Over state
with some sort of Play Again.
9

9

00:00:28,258  -->  00:00:32,315
We'll create all our story states, we'll
copy in our text, we'll hook up our next
10

10

00:00:32,315  -->  00:00:36,108
states, and we'll make sure we have
our folder structure nicely organized.
11

11

00:00:36,108  -->  00:00:39,239
So let's start with our folder structure,
actually, we're doing things a little bit
12

12

00:00:39,239  -->  00:00:41,540
from back to front from were I had
my Challenge slide just there.
13

13

00:00:41,540  -->  00:00:45,230
Give myself some space on the window,
just to know if you hold down control,
14

14

00:00:45,230  -->  00:00:47,450
and you roll your mouse wheel.
15

15

00:00:47,450  -->  00:00:50,000
You can move in and out, or
you can grab the little, do that,
16

16

00:00:50,000  -->  00:00:52,250
down the bottom down here and
slide around like that,
17

17

00:00:52,250  -->  00:00:55,059
if you prefer this sort of structure
to be looking at your folders.
18

18

00:00:55,059  -->  00:01:00,810
First thing I do is right-click Create
Folder, and I will call this scripts.
19

19

00:01:00,810  -->  00:01:03,845
So we can grab out two script files and
plot them in there so
20

20

00:01:03,845  -->  00:01:06,831
they're out of the way nicely organized,
there we go.
21

21

00:01:06,831  -->  00:01:11,612
Next up, I will right-click
Create Folder and I'll call the states.
22

22

00:01:11,612  -->  00:01:12,785
If it wants to order the complete,
23

23

00:01:12,785  -->  00:01:14,941
there we go, not what I complete,
but just general complete.
24

24

00:01:14,941  -->  00:01:17,452
It was thinking about something and
we will, let's see,
25

25

00:01:17,452  -->  00:01:19,972
we don't need room one anymore,
I'm gonna delete that.
26

26

00:01:19,972  -->  00:01:23,060
That was just placeholder and we,
likewise, don't need room two,
27

27

00:01:23,060  -->  00:01:24,293
I will delete that as well.
28

28

00:01:24,293  -->  00:01:28,531
StartingState, well that was actually
if I have a look at my flow diagram,
29

29

00:01:28,531  -->  00:01:30,228
that was actually State A1.
30

30

00:01:30,228  -->  00:01:35,466
So I'll rename now, just click
on that once or when you're when
31

31

00:01:35,466  -->  00:01:40,510
you clicked on your file you can hit F2,
we can call this A1.
32

32

00:01:40,510  -->  00:01:43,611
Now it's up to you if you wanna
get a little more detailed,
33

33

00:01:43,611  -->  00:01:48,041
a little bit more professional we'll say,
when you could use the name of it, A1,
34

34

00:01:48,041  -->  00:01:49,394
outside Hanger in here.
35

35

00:01:49,394  -->  00:01:54,100
So A1.Outside.Hanger so
then it's super clear.
36

36

00:01:54,100  -->  00:01:58,580
Not only can you order your files cuz
they'll be alphanumerically ordered,
37

37

00:01:58,580  -->  00:02:00,370
but you can also read on it and
38

38

00:02:00,370  -->  00:02:04,950
see, that's exactly what the state is
to make sure that there's no confusion.
39

39

00:02:04,950  -->  00:02:07,899
Now, we will drag this state
file into the states directory,
40

40

00:02:07,899  -->  00:02:09,837
I need a couple of other folders in here.
41

41

00:02:09,837  -->  00:02:13,645
Actually, I'm going to Give myself a bit
more structure create a folder, so
42

42

00:02:13,645  -->  00:02:15,237
I'm inside the States folder.
43

43

00:02:15,237  -->  00:02:18,092
Creating a new folder which
will be called Intro, and
44

44

00:02:18,092  -->  00:02:22,042
then another folder lots of folders
in this video, what did you do today?
45

45

00:02:22,042  -->  00:02:25,618
Made a lot of folders, okay,
this is gonna be called Game Over.
46

46

00:02:25,618  -->  00:02:29,927
And then I'll create another folder,
which I will call Hanger cuz in my game,
47

47

00:02:29,927  -->  00:02:34,564
the player in this particular section of
my game's running around in the Hanger, so
48

48

00:02:34,564  -->  00:02:36,545
it gives me some sort of structure.
49

49

00:02:36,545  -->  00:02:40,261
If I have say seven different major
sections of my game, then I can
50

50

00:02:40,261  -->  00:02:44,672
have them grouped and organized into
these particular sections of the game.
51

51

00:02:44,672  -->  00:02:48,884
Makes it easier to find things, you don't
wanna just have a huge long list of state
52

52

00:02:48,884  -->  00:02:51,402
files, it gets a little
bit tricky to find them.
53

53

00:02:51,402  -->  00:02:54,301
So I'll drag outside,
hanger into Hanger, there we go,
54

54

00:02:54,301  -->  00:02:56,146
now it's no longer outside Hanger.
55

55

00:02:56,146  -->  00:03:00,669
Look at that for inception meta point,
accidental meta point there,
56

56

00:03:00,669  -->  00:03:02,900
so I have my one State file in here.
57

57

00:03:02,900  -->  00:03:07,905
Let's come into intro,
right-click, create a state, and
58

58

00:03:07,905  -->  00:03:15,137
we'll call this State Introduction, and I
better give it a number, we'll call it A0.
59

59

00:03:15,137  -->  00:03:20,671
So in the introduction we're just saying
something like, welcome to this game.
60

60

00:03:20,671  -->  00:03:27,941
It's a choose your own adventure,
be careful what you wish for
61

61

00:03:27,941  -->  00:03:32,343
or something [LAUGH] clever like that.
62

62

00:03:32,343  -->  00:03:40,985
At each stage, you'll be asked
to push a key on the keyboard,
63

63

00:03:40,985  -->  00:03:44,986
for example, 1 or 2 or 3.
64

64

00:03:44,986  -->  00:03:50,776
And we could write in here
if we wanna add something,
65

65

00:03:50,776  -->  00:03:56,040
in terms of quitting the game for
in the future,
66

66

00:03:56,040  -->  00:04:01,448
we might say at any point in time,
push q to quit.
67

67

00:04:01,448  -->  00:04:03,538
We don't have that have
that hooked up yet, but
68

68

00:04:03,538  -->  00:04:06,750
that could be a thing to give people
that ability to get out quick, okay.
69

69

00:04:06,750  -->  00:04:10,577
So we've got our introduction in up there,
that would be our starting state, so
70

70

00:04:10,577  -->  00:04:14,084
remember we need to find on game,
need to find what is our startingState.
71

71

00:04:14,084  -->  00:04:16,968
Now it's this A0 introduction,
drag that in, so
72

72

00:04:16,968  -->  00:04:21,180
that'll be the very first state
that game plays when we hit Play.
73

73

00:04:21,180  -->  00:04:26,650
And that will be from there, we can
then say go to, we'll put this in now,
74

74

00:04:26,650  -->  00:04:31,170
we will go to in states in here we
need to make one that will give
75

75

00:04:31,170  -->  00:04:35,310
us the selection option and we'll say go
to outside Hangout, there we go, okay.
76

76

00:04:35,310  -->  00:04:37,329
So we've just got our introduction flow,
77

77

00:04:37,329  -->  00:04:40,078
really important to get the game flow so
people can start,
78

78

00:04:40,078  -->  00:04:43,240
have the game and then finish and
then know how to restart the game.
79

79

00:04:43,240  -->  00:04:45,812
Speaking of finishing, we go to Game Over,
80

80

00:04:45,812  -->  00:04:49,432
we'll create ourselves a state in here and
we'll call this.
81

81

00:04:49,432  -->  00:04:56,087
Now let me have a look at what I called
it on my flow diagram X1 Game Over.
82

82

00:04:56,087  -->  00:05:00,963
Okay, so this is X1 Game Over,
okay and then I did have some
83

83

00:05:00,963  -->  00:05:05,760
information in here,
I'll just go in here and copy that.
84

84

00:05:07,470  -->  00:05:12,519
Copy, copy, copy, great, and then click
and I was just copying with Ctrl + C,
85

85

00:05:12,519  -->  00:05:17,267
I assume you know how to do a copy and
paste, Ctrl + C, Ctrl + V, or Cmd + C,
86

86

00:05:17,267  -->  00:05:20,283
Cmd + V on the Mac, okay,
and that is in there.
87

87

00:05:20,283  -->  00:05:22,815
I've just put in my
little bit of story text,
88

88

00:05:22,815  -->  00:05:25,370
and then it's saying,
what do you wanna do?
89

89

00:05:25,370  -->  00:05:29,380
Yes, play again, so if someone does
want to play again, I think so
90

90

00:05:29,380  -->  00:05:31,710
we've got two states in here,
I'll just add in two.
91

91

00:05:31,710  -->  00:05:34,529
If they don't want to play again, I think
they would go straight to the Hangar.
92

92

00:05:34,529  -->  00:05:37,601
If they don't want to play again,
then I think we would take them back to
93

93

00:05:37,601  -->  00:05:40,227
the introduction screen,
which gives them instructions.
94

94

00:05:40,227  -->  00:05:43,963
It's kinda like a main menu instructions
on how to quit if they want.
95

95

00:05:43,963  -->  00:05:47,766
Okay, so we've hooked up that flow for
the intro, for the game over,
96

96

00:05:47,766  -->  00:05:49,644
and now to put in all of our states.
97

97

00:05:49,644  -->  00:05:54,103
I'm gonna bomb in a whole
bunch of them in here, so
98

98

00:05:54,103  -->  00:05:59,775
Create&gt; State, and
I'll call this A2 and then click on A2.
99

99

00:05:59,775  -->  00:06:05,183
Ctrl + D to duplicate and then we will
call it A3, wonderful, duplicate,
100

100

00:06:05,183  -->  00:06:10,273
duplicate, so I'm doing Ctrl + D or
Cmd + D that duplicates the file.
101

101

00:06:10,273  -->  00:06:12,820
And because there is nothing in these
files, it's okay to duplicate it.
102

102

00:06:12,820  -->  00:06:17,395
I've gone up to A12, did I need to
go up to A12 on my diagram here?
103

103

00:06:17,395  -->  00:06:23,076
I go up to A11, okay, that's cool so
now we can start with the Bs,
104

104

00:06:23,076  -->  00:06:28,530
so, A12, we can make this B1,
click on that, duplicate.
105

105

00:06:28,530  -->  00:06:35,251
B2, B3, B4, B5 I think we're up to B6,
and B6, that's where we went up to okay,
106

106

00:06:35,251  -->  00:06:40,919
so now I've got all of my states in there,
they're all sitting in Hangar.
107

107

00:06:40,919  -->  00:06:44,122
What I need to do is copy in
all of the story text and
108

108

00:06:44,122  -->  00:06:49,515
then hook up what is the next state that
we go to, making sure, being super careful
109

109

00:06:49,515  -->  00:06:55,010
that the instructions of click one to go
somewhere and click two to go somewhere.
110

110

00:06:55,010  -->  00:06:59,721
Making sure that I put the state that is
being described in one in element zero and
111

111

00:06:59,721  -->  00:07:03,097
the state that is being described
in two in element one and
112

112

00:07:03,097  -->  00:07:06,640
if I've got a third state then
that would be an element two.
113

113

00:07:06,640  -->  00:07:09,249
Just to make sure that the button
is corresponding to the state.
114

114

00:07:09,249  -->  00:07:12,805
So what I'm gonna do is pause the video
now and put in all my story text,
115

115

00:07:12,805  -->  00:07:16,484
if you wanna do the same, if you're
following along and doing this, and
116

116

00:07:16,484  -->  00:07:19,831
putting in a whole bunch of your
own story then please do that now.
117

117

00:07:19,831  -->  00:07:22,679
Add in all of your states, and
I'll see you back here in a moment.
118

118

00:07:22,679  -->  00:07:26,424
I'm pretty sure you don't want to watch me
copying and pasting for ten minutes, so
119

119

00:07:26,424  -->  00:07:29,862
I'll pause the video and I'll be back
here in a moment when I've done that.

120

00:07:29,862  -->  00:07:32,521
Welcome back,
I've added all of my states here, and
121

121

00:07:32,521  -->  00:07:36,008
as I was going through that process,
I found it really easy to see which
122

122

00:07:36,008  -->  00:07:39,039
of my states have I definitely
hooked up the next states for.
123

123

00:07:39,039  -->  00:07:41,833
Cuz you can see as you cycle through,
just with the left and
124

124

00:07:41,833  -->  00:07:45,826
right arrows on your keyboard as you cycle
through, you can see, yep, yes, yes,
125

125

00:07:45,826  -->  00:07:49,160
yes, yes, and then I notice,
no, there's nothing in there.
126

126

00:07:49,160  -->  00:07:53,683
And then I'd look at my diagram again and
see for state B5, B5,
127

127

00:07:53,683  -->  00:07:55,501
what do we need to do here?
128

128

00:07:55,501  -->  00:07:59,505
B5 needs to head off up to B6,
makes sense, so
129

129

00:07:59,505  -->  00:08:04,213
then I would drag B6 over to
where it says Next States and
130

130

00:08:04,213  -->  00:08:09,437
that automatically says and
drops B6 in there which is cool.
131

131

00:08:09,437  -->  00:08:11,249
Okay one thing I'll show you is,
132

132

00:08:11,249  -->  00:08:15,457
when you play your game if you click on
this button up here maximize play you can
133

133

00:08:15,457  -->  00:08:19,105
toggle that on when it's light
whitish color that means it's on.
134

134

00:08:19,105  -->  00:08:24,670
Clicking Play it means that your game
window will take up the entire screen.
135

135

00:08:24,670  -->  00:08:29,409
So you see here welcome to the game bad
mistake in here it doesn't say one to
136

136

00:08:29,409  -->  00:08:30,158
continue.
137

137

00:08:30,158  -->  00:08:33,875
So, as you play through you'll find bugs,
and you'll find issues,
138

138

00:08:33,875  -->  00:08:38,159
then pause the game, find that state that
is in our intro state, click on there,
139

139

00:08:38,159  -->  00:08:45,374
we need to say, push, 1 to continue.
140

140

00:08:45,374  -->  00:08:48,926
Okay, cool, found that, I'm gonna save
this, I haven't saved for a while,
141

141

00:08:48,926  -->  00:08:49,947
onwards and upwards.
142

142

00:08:49,947  -->  00:08:53,209
The other thing I'll point out while I'm
showing you stuff that I've done just now.
143

143

00:08:53,209  -->  00:08:57,794
I had two success states I've put them
as well in addition to the game over
144

144

00:08:57,794  -->  00:09:00,966
state that I had,
I didn't show you that before.
145

145

00:09:00,966  -->  00:09:04,340
I started putting in all my work these two
green guys in here I put those in game
146

146

00:09:04,340  -->  00:09:07,160
over cuz at the moment,
they represent game over for the game.
147

147

00:09:07,160  -->  00:09:10,208
So I need to Loop back to the start
of the game when I do this, okay, so
148

148

00:09:10,208  -->  00:09:12,685
let's click Play just to
make sure it's all working.
149

149

00:09:12,685  -->  00:09:14,717
I'm gonna do push one,
read it a little bit,
150

150

00:09:14,717  -->  00:09:18,099
kind of do a little of random button
pushing, make sure I don't get stuck.
151

151

00:09:18,099  -->  00:09:22,261
Should hit to some sort of dent
at some point klunk, okay cool.
152

152

00:09:22,261  -->  00:09:25,739
And one thing you might see as
you're doing this, you get an error,
153

153

00:09:25,739  -->  00:09:29,416
this is our first kind of significant
error that we're coming across.
154

154

00:09:29,416  -->  00:09:33,556
That for now we're going to ignore
cuz it's not breaking our game, but
155

155

00:09:33,556  -->  00:09:37,844
it's in nearly every circumstance we
should be paying close attention.
156

156

00:09:37,844  -->  00:09:41,764
Any time you see this red icon here,
the red icon down the bottom,
157

157

00:09:41,764  -->  00:09:45,923
that means danger, danger Will Robinson
something has gone wrong.
158

158

00:09:45,923  -->  00:09:50,574
For now all that means is we've
set up in our script that
159

159

00:09:50,574  -->  00:09:53,416
the player can push 1, 2 or 3.
160

160

00:09:53,416  -->  00:09:56,560
But some of our states only have,
for example,
161

161

00:09:56,560  -->  00:10:01,209
one option that they can push, so
one state that they can go onto next.
162

162

00:10:01,209  -->  00:10:05,000
So, from here if I was to push key 2,
then it would throw this error saying,
163

163

00:10:05,000  -->  00:10:08,430
hang on a minute, you pushed 2,
that's outside of our range.
164

164

00:10:08,430  -->  00:10:11,747
For now we're gonna leave that, there is
ways, there are ways to sort that out and
165

165

00:10:11,747  -->  00:10:14,777
resolve that, but for now it's cool,
we're not gonna worry about that,
166

166

00:10:14,777  -->  00:10:17,594
that's not the purpose of this
particular exercise for the moment.
167

167

00:10:17,594  -->  00:10:21,634
And it's something that place not gonna
see and it's not breaking out game so
168

168

00:10:21,634  -->  00:10:25,300
that's called but usually we would
jump on any sort of error that we get
169

169

00:10:25,300  -->  00:10:28,120
this super important to take notice of.
170

170

00:10:28,120  -->  00:10:31,040
Okay, so we've got a full game
that we can loop through,
171

171

00:10:31,040  -->  00:10:32,830
great work,
I'll see you in the next video.
