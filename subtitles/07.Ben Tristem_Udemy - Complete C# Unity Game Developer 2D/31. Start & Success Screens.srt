[MUSIC]
2

2

00:00:04,222  -->  00:00:06,621
In this video we'll be
creating our success levels so
3

3

00:00:06,621  -->  00:00:10,139
that when the player reaches the very end
of your game there is a scene that loads
4

4

00:00:10,139  -->  00:00:11,384
where they can run around.
5

5

00:00:11,384  -->  00:00:14,061
Some sort of congratulations,
winner, winner chicken dinner.
6

6

00:00:14,061  -->  00:00:17,128
Click the main menu, that takes
you back to the very first screen.
7

7

00:00:17,128  -->  00:00:19,804
This is our main screen where
we've implemented a start button,
8

8

00:00:19,804  -->  00:00:22,150
where you can start the game and
then go through the game.
9

9

00:00:22,150  -->  00:00:24,040
So it's all just very
functional at the moment.
10

10

00:00:24,040  -->  00:00:27,150
You can make it as pretty and awesome and
dressed up as you like, but for
11

11

00:00:27,150  -->  00:00:31,185
now we just want to get that full complete
game flow implemented in our game.
12

12

00:00:31,185  -->  00:00:33,535
Let's start by making
ourselves a start button.
13

13

00:00:33,535  -->  00:00:36,275
I'm gonna right click, go to UI &gt; Button.
14

14

00:00:36,275  -->  00:00:38,695
That automatically
creates a canvas as well.
15

15

00:00:38,695  -->  00:00:42,105
I'm just gonna rename
this main menu Canvas.
16

16

00:00:42,105  -->  00:00:45,315
Not critical to do that, but I like to
do it just do I know what's going on.
17

17

00:00:45,315  -->  00:00:50,629
And then button, we are going to
rename to start button,that is cool.
18

18

00:00:50,629  -->  00:00:52,690
And you can see underneath
the start button we have some text.
19

19

00:00:52,690  -->  00:00:56,250
The text we will name start game.
20

20

00:00:56,250  -->  00:00:57,986
Okay so that's all our naming done,
21

21

00:00:57,986  -->  00:01:00,677
although I guess that's
labeling as opposed to naming.
22

22

00:01:00,677  -->  00:01:03,967
I'm going to double click the start
button itself so it zooms in and
23

23

00:01:03,967  -->  00:01:06,630
reposition that so
it's in the middle of the screen.
24

24

00:01:06,630  -->  00:01:10,230
You can see when the line goes blue it's
in the middle, and hold down alt, so
25

25

00:01:10,230  -->  00:01:12,870
I'm going to move this a little
bit then hold down alt.
26

26

00:01:12,870  -->  00:01:15,740
So it moves both sides, and
drag it down a little bit, okay.
27

27

00:01:15,740  -->  00:01:18,160
So we've got the button roughly
the size that I want to have it,
28

28

00:01:18,160  -->  00:01:19,790
on top of my game screen there.
29

29

00:01:19,790  -->  00:01:22,160
I'm gonna have the two
windows side by side, so
30

30

00:01:22,160  -->  00:01:24,780
I can see how it actually
looks in my game screen.
31

31

00:01:24,780  -->  00:01:27,660
Drag this over,
you see at the moment that it's not
32

32

00:01:27,660  -->  00:01:30,200
matching with what we have on the left,
with what we have on the right.
33

33

00:01:30,200  -->  00:01:34,910
This is, as I move my perspective,
I move the scaling of my window.
34

34

00:01:34,910  -->  00:01:36,690
It's making a mess of my button here,
35

35

00:01:36,690  -->  00:01:40,140
so let's clean that up by
clicking on the main menu canvas.
36

36

00:01:40,140  -->  00:01:44,240
See the canvas scaler here instead of
constant pixel size say scale with
37

37

00:01:44,240  -->  00:01:45,460
screen size.
38

38

00:01:45,460  -->  00:01:49,580
Now as I move my window around, if we had
different resolution and different scaling
39

39

00:01:49,580  -->  00:01:52,450
and all that kind of good stuff,
the button will stay as we want it.
40

40

00:01:52,450  -->  00:01:54,810
And click on the button,
that'll take me down to text.
41

41

00:01:54,810  -->  00:01:57,510
Click on the button, there we go,
I'm gonna move these handles.
42

42

00:01:57,510  -->  00:02:00,170
Currently it's anchored just
generally in the middle.
43

43

00:02:00,170  -->  00:02:03,540
I'll click on the up,
I'm sorry on the top, so
44

44

00:02:03,540  -->  00:02:06,110
center top you can see it's
anchored up the center top now.
45

45

00:02:06,110  -->  00:02:08,500
What I want to do is anchor it
relative to the rest of the screen.
46

46

00:02:08,500  -->  00:02:10,610
So I need to grab the handles here,
47

47

00:02:10,610  -->  00:02:13,550
pull that down to the bottom left,
pull that to the bottom right.
48

48

00:02:13,550  -->  00:02:16,440
So I have a handle on each
of the corner of my canvas.
49

49

00:02:16,440  -->  00:02:19,230
That means this will stay
relative to screen size, as well.
50

50

00:02:19,230  -->  00:02:23,960
As we move it around, it's going
to stay anchored to its position
51

51

00:02:23,960  -->  00:02:27,230
on the outside of the screen.
52

52

00:02:27,230  -->  00:02:28,490
Last tip, click on the Start button.
53

53

00:02:28,490  -->  00:02:29,610
I'm gonna change the color.
54

54

00:02:29,610  -->  00:02:31,570
Well, this is probably
the second last step, actually.
55

55

00:02:31,570  -->  00:02:33,050
Make the color a little bit of a yellow.
56

56

00:02:33,050  -->  00:02:35,970
And then the last step, click on Text.
57

57

00:02:35,970  -->  00:02:38,750
And change the font size here,
make this 50, nice and
58

58

00:02:38,750  -->  00:02:40,750
big, probably change it to bold.
59

59

00:02:40,750  -->  00:02:43,460
Plenty of scope in there for
you to go and change the font,
60

60

00:02:43,460  -->  00:02:48,900
maybe do some text mesh pro and
make this look a little bit more fancy.
61

61

00:02:48,900  -->  00:02:50,170
For now that's it.
62

62

00:02:50,170  -->  00:02:51,130
Good for us.
63

63

00:02:51,130  -->  00:02:54,000
Actually I told a fib,
there's one last last step.
64

64

00:02:54,000  -->  00:02:55,540
How many last steps are we going to have,
Eric?
65

65

00:02:55,540  -->  00:02:59,590
Well one last last step, which is change
the highlight color and press color.
66

66

00:02:59,590  -->  00:03:02,400
Highlight color will change
to kind of an orangey color,
67

67

00:03:02,400  -->  00:03:03,830
that's when you mouse over it.
68

68

00:03:03,830  -->  00:03:08,040
And then when it is clicked,
we'll change it to a darker,
69

69

00:03:08,040  -->  00:03:09,360
kind of brownie color here.
70

70

00:03:09,360  -->  00:03:15,170
So I click play, then mouse over it and
we will see what effect that it has.
71

71

00:03:15,170  -->  00:03:17,210
Mouse over, yep and then click.
72

72

00:03:17,210  -->  00:03:19,070
And that's doing all the stuff
that I want it to do.
73

73

00:03:19,070  -->  00:03:21,741
And still move my character
around independent of that.
74

74

00:03:21,741  -->  00:03:25,890
You could just have the load next
out level exit button down here.
75

75

00:03:25,890  -->  00:03:27,060
And have the whole thing blank and
76

76

00:03:27,060  -->  00:03:28,580
let the player figure it out
when they come down here.
77

77

00:03:28,580  -->  00:03:31,670
That would be cool as well,
having an exciting way to learn how to.
78

78

00:03:31,670  -->  00:03:32,500
Exit a level but
79

79

00:03:32,500  -->  00:03:36,350
for now when it goes through this
mechanism of doing stop button.
80

80

00:03:36,350  -->  00:03:41,780
Okay, what we need to do for
our button is give it a script and
81

81

00:03:41,780  -->  00:03:45,590
with that script we want
to load in the next scene.
82

82

00:03:45,590  -->  00:03:47,170
So I come down to add component.
83

83

00:03:47,170  -->  00:03:52,730
We'll call this menu, yes,
and then create and add that.
84

84

00:03:52,730  -->  00:03:54,360
Open up Visual Studio.
85

85

00:03:54,360  -->  00:03:57,730
And this would be a very
simple script in here.
86

86

00:03:57,730  -->  00:04:00,879
I need to make sure we're
using the namespace,
87

87

00:04:00,879  -->  00:04:07,160
unityengine.scenemanagement.
88

88

00:04:07,160  -->  00:04:08,650
Okay, now we're using that.
89

89

00:04:08,650  -->  00:04:12,240
Going to remove the start and
update functions, we don't need those.
90

90

00:04:12,240  -->  00:04:17,660
Create our function,
which we'll call StartFirstLevel, I think.
91

91

00:04:17,660  -->  00:04:22,630
StartFirstLevel, and
I typed that in first cuz I wanna
92

92

00:04:22,630  -->  00:04:25,210
take a moment just to point out that
we're gonna need to make this public.
93

93

00:04:25,210  -->  00:04:29,805
So public Void needs to be public so
that from our button,
94

94

00:04:29,805  -->  00:04:36,430
we're in a position to cull this method,
so that we can load the next level.
95

95

00:04:36,430  -->  00:04:38,150
That's why we need to have it public.
96

96

00:04:38,150  -->  00:04:40,880
And then what do we need to do in here?
97

97

00:04:40,880  -->  00:04:45,330
Well, we need to say
scenemanager.loadscene.
98

98

00:04:45,330  -->  00:04:46,530
And what scene are we loading?
99

99

00:04:46,530  -->  00:04:47,450
We'll load scene one.
100

100

00:04:48,790  -->  00:04:49,840
That looks pretty good.
101

101

00:04:49,840  -->  00:04:55,070
And we click on our selector here,
hit the Scene tab.
102

102

00:04:55,070  -->  00:04:57,560
And then we're looking for
our start button,
103

103

00:04:57,560  -->  00:05:00,550
which is in the scene,
selected the start button.
104

104

00:05:00,550  -->  00:05:04,530
Now we have the start button,
which contains the menu script.
105

105

00:05:04,530  -->  00:05:08,770
From there we can click on Menu and
find Start First Level.
106

106

00:05:08,770  -->  00:05:10,870
That should be the mechanism for
when we click the button,
107

107

00:05:10,870  -->  00:05:14,950
it will run this method and
it will take us to the first level.
108

108

00:05:14,950  -->  00:05:16,790
Let's see if that actually works,
click play.
109

109

00:05:16,790  -->  00:05:21,650
I ran a little bit, click the button, and
110

110

00:05:21,650  -->  00:05:23,950
then it loads onto the next level,
fantastic.
111

111

00:05:25,280  -->  00:05:27,690
Okay, so that's the mechanism
of creating a start button.
112

112

00:05:27,690  -->  00:05:31,350
I want to top and tail the game, in other
words have something at the front and
113

113

00:05:31,350  -->  00:05:33,760
end by having a success screen as well.
114

114

00:05:33,760  -->  00:05:34,570
That's my challenge for
115

115

00:05:34,570  -->  00:05:39,430
you, create a success level,
where we have a final you win screen.
116

116

00:05:39,430  -->  00:05:41,761
Similar to the start menu but
with a you win, and
117

117

00:05:41,761  -->  00:05:45,037
then some sort of congratulations or
well done this is fantastic.
118

118

00:05:45,037  -->  00:05:49,621
And then a play again button, which will
take the player back to the first level.
119

119

00:05:49,621  -->  00:05:52,490
Or you could have it take
them back to the main menu.
120

120

00:05:52,490  -->  00:05:55,237
And then from there they can go to play.
121

121

00:05:55,237  -->  00:05:56,679
So maybe I'll do it that way.
122

122

00:05:56,679  -->  00:05:59,954
At the very end it says, finish or
success or well done and
123

123

00:05:59,954  -->  00:06:03,190
then have that take
the player to the main menu.
124

124

00:06:03,190  -->  00:06:05,870
And as a final step add some flair and
share,
125

125

00:06:05,870  -->  00:06:08,510
do something nifty with your final screen.
126

126

00:06:08,510  -->  00:06:11,993
When the player wins do something cool and
add some fireworks or
127

127

00:06:11,993  -->  00:06:14,829
the play doing backflips,
and share that with us.
128

128

00:06:14,829  -->  00:06:17,070
And when you've done that
I will see you back here.
129

129

00:06:19,100  -->  00:06:20,980
Okay, let's quickly go
through this together,
130

130

00:06:20,980  -->  00:06:25,325
I'm going to duplicate my main menu,
call this success.
131

131

00:06:25,325  -->  00:06:29,360
Make sure that I've gone up into my
build settings up Yonda, where are you?
132

132

00:06:29,360  -->  00:06:31,070
File, build settings.
133

133

00:06:31,070  -->  00:06:35,420
And to add Success in here and
have it as index number 3.
134

134

00:06:35,420  -->  00:06:37,460
Cool, that's all good.
135

135

00:06:37,460  -->  00:06:39,250
We're currently selected on Main Menu.
136

136

00:06:39,250  -->  00:06:40,860
Jump into Success screen.
137

137

00:06:40,860  -->  00:06:43,890
And do just a little bit of editing,
very quick editing here on the,
138

138

00:06:46,800  -->  00:06:49,350
Screen itself,
just to show it's a little bit different.
139

139

00:06:49,350  -->  00:06:53,610
So Instead of climbing,
we need to click on Foreground, and
140

140

00:06:53,610  -->  00:06:57,070
then on my tile brush, my rule tile.
141

141

00:06:57,070  -->  00:06:59,921
I'll get rid of all this
stuff at the top here,
142

142

00:06:59,921  -->  00:07:04,327
make it look like there's some
opening that they've reached the end.
143

143

00:07:04,327  -->  00:07:07,401
And some sort of, yeah,
some sort of teasing them ladder,
144

144

00:07:07,401  -->  00:07:11,180
that kind of goes nowhere,
I think might be a little interesting.
145

145

00:07:11,180  -->  00:07:15,482
Click on the climbing layer, click on the
ladder, and then here's a ladder that sort
146

146

00:07:15,482  -->  00:07:18,138
of just Ambiguously goes up
to the top of the screen.
147

147

00:07:18,138  -->  00:07:19,909
Okay not the greatest of final screen but
148

148

00:07:19,909  -->  00:07:23,150
one of those things it could be a little
bit cool having the player window.
149

149

00:07:23,150  -->  00:07:24,760
What on earth should I be doing here?
150

150

00:07:26,390  -->  00:07:30,300
We'll add something more complex as
we make the game in more detail,
151

151

00:07:30,300  -->  00:07:31,775
I think as for what we've got now.
152

152

00:07:31,775  -->  00:07:37,100
Okay so we've just duplicated all the
content over instead of our, where is it?
153

153

00:07:37,100  -->  00:07:44,630
Instead of our main menu canvas, I'll
rename this to finish canvas or success.
154

154

00:07:44,630  -->  00:07:48,920
Success menu canvas, okay.
155

155

00:07:50,420  -->  00:07:52,391
And then instead of the button being stop,
156

156

00:07:52,391  -->  00:07:54,709
I'm going to have this a replay button,
I think.
157

157

00:07:57,087  -->  00:08:01,110
Replay good replay button, and
158

158

00:08:01,110  -->  00:08:07,380
then the text will need
to say replay game, good.
159

159

00:08:07,380  -->  00:08:08,430
That looks pretty good.
160

160

00:08:08,430  -->  00:08:10,430
Like I say you can
differentiate this a bunch.
161

161

00:08:10,430  -->  00:08:12,540
For now I'm just going through
the role of functionality of it to
162

162

00:08:12,540  -->  00:08:13,650
make sure it all works.
163

163

00:08:13,650  -->  00:08:16,870
And then the script is gonna
do exactly the same thing.
164

164

00:08:16,870  -->  00:08:18,230
We need to point it back to the start.
165

165

00:08:18,230  -->  00:08:22,910
So that's our end screen, if we're
on here, loaded on the success menu.
166

166

00:08:22,910  -->  00:08:25,520
Run around, run around, run around,
and then click Replay Game.
167

167

00:08:25,520  -->  00:08:28,990
It takes us back to the first level,
it looks a little bit odd,
168

168

00:08:28,990  -->  00:08:31,420
cuz I've started my player in
the middle of the first level.
169

169

00:08:31,420  -->  00:08:33,770
But we'd have it start in the proper
place in the first level.
170

170

00:08:33,770  -->  00:08:36,370
If we want to have that go
back to the load screen,
171

171

00:08:36,370  -->  00:08:38,150
then we would change the button.
172

172

00:08:38,150  -->  00:08:45,810
Instead of it being Replay we would say,
main menu, or something along those lines.
173

173

00:08:45,810  -->  00:08:49,190
Change the button to main menu button,
174

174

00:08:49,190  -->  00:08:53,420
and then we need to change,
make a change for our script in here.
175

175

00:08:53,420  -->  00:08:56,720
Jumping in the menu, reload,
I guess I need to do that, yup.
176

176

00:08:56,720  -->  00:09:01,460
And then we create another
method instead of public void,
177

177

00:09:01,460  -->  00:09:06,465
start first level,
we're going to say Public void,
178

178

00:09:06,465  -->  00:09:13,360
LoadMainMenu, and
that will be a index of zero.
179

179

00:09:14,880  -->  00:09:19,010
Okay, then back over into our,
what's this we're on now.
180

180

00:09:19,010  -->  00:09:20,820
Main menu button down here.
181

181

00:09:20,820  -->  00:09:26,070
We need to change out on click,
instead of being main menu.
182

182

00:09:26,070  -->  00:09:30,410
Sorry, first startfirstlevel,
it needs to be loadmainmenu, there we go.
183

183

00:09:30,410  -->  00:09:32,150
We've saved that and
184

184

00:09:32,150  -->  00:09:36,920
then click play, all going to play, this
should take us back to the very start.
185

185

00:09:38,560  -->  00:09:40,220
Click Main Menu,
it takes us back to Start Game.
186

186

00:09:40,220  -->  00:09:41,410
Start Game, Run through.
187

187

00:09:41,410  -->  00:09:42,666
Get to the [SOUND].
188

188

00:09:42,666  -->  00:09:44,190
Okay, that killed me but that's all good.
189

189

00:09:44,190  -->  00:09:45,760
So we've got our flow worked out now.
190

190

00:09:45,760  -->  00:09:48,490
That should be enough functionality for
you to be able to do your full flow from
191

191

00:09:48,490  -->  00:09:50,740
Main Menu to Game through
all the game scenes.
192

192

00:09:50,740  -->  00:09:51,890
Back to the end, you win.
193

193

00:09:51,890  -->  00:09:53,310
Once you have that success,
194

194

00:09:53,310  -->  00:09:57,030
then you return back to
the very start of the screen.
195

195

00:09:57,030  -->  00:09:58,810
I said adding a little bit of flair or
196

196

00:09:58,810  -->  00:10:03,100
a little bit of something in there, some
text to let them know they actually won.
197

197

00:10:03,100  -->  00:10:04,740
Let's do that very briefly.
198

198

00:10:04,740  -->  00:10:09,960
So under my Success main menu,
I'm gonna right-click, UI, Text.
199

199

00:10:09,960  -->  00:10:15,332
And this text box will say
something along the lines of,
200

200

00:10:15,332  -->  00:10:19,915
let's see, winner, winner chicken dinner.
201

201

00:10:19,915  -->  00:10:23,240
For those of you who are familiar with
PUBG, you will know what that's all about.
202

202

00:10:23,240  -->  00:10:25,260
We'll make this 30, and
203

203

00:10:25,260  -->  00:10:30,280
we will change the size of that
a little bit, go to my t tool here.
204

204

00:10:32,040  -->  00:10:34,500
Move that, move this.
205

205

00:10:34,500  -->  00:10:36,965
Little bit bigger,
winner winner chicken dinner.
206

206

00:10:36,965  -->  00:10:41,270
Okay, center that text and I think I will
207

207

00:10:41,270  -->  00:10:45,130
put a line break in between these two,
there we go, winner winner chicken dinner.
208

208

00:10:45,130  -->  00:10:47,870
Its a little bit light,
lets make it white in color.
209

209

00:10:49,280  -->  00:10:52,120
The color of the text in here white,
there we go.
210

210

00:10:52,120  -->  00:10:56,970
Last step I'm just going to reposition
my text to be above the menu and
211

211

00:10:56,970  -->  00:11:00,620
my menu to be below my text, there we go.
212

212

00:11:00,620  -->  00:11:03,780
Okay, not super pretty,
but is super functional.
213

213

00:11:03,780  -->  00:11:06,920
There we have our final success screen.
214

214

00:11:06,920  -->  00:11:10,910
You've also created a main menu
screen which has a start button that
215

215

00:11:10,910  -->  00:11:11,890
launches the game.
216

216

00:11:11,890  -->  00:11:14,680
That's the full flow and
I'll see you in the next video for
217

217

00:11:14,680  -->  00:11:20,280
some more chunky aspects of getting our
game flowing nicely for the player.
218

218

00:11:20,280  -->  00:11:20,950
See you in there.
