00:00:00.050  -->  00:00:04.514
[SOUND] In this video, we're talking
game design for Laser Defender, and
2

2

00:00:04.514  -->  00:00:08.042
I wanted to take a moment just
to show you that I've gone and
3

3

00:00:08.042  -->  00:00:10.360
spruced up the graphics a little bit.
4

4

00:00:10.360  -->  00:00:14.035
Scrolling back around, some more
interesting bombs and lasers, and
5

5

00:00:14.035  -->  00:00:17.410
all that kind of good stuff
without enemies, without players.
6

6

00:00:17.410  -->  00:00:19.700
So this is the game, this is my prototype.
7

7

00:00:19.700  -->  00:00:22.630
You and I are gonna work on something
that'll probably end up like this.
8

8

00:00:22.630  -->  00:00:24.040
That's our goal or our game plan.
9

9

00:00:24.040  -->  00:00:25.630
And so the game itself.
10

10

00:00:25.630  -->  00:00:28.600
Lets just have a look at the features
that we require in our game.
11

11

00:00:28.600  -->  00:00:32.840
And a side note,
these is how I do my game design document.
12

12

00:00:32.840  -->  00:00:37.060
If I'm working on an indie project or
its just me and maybe one other person.
13

13

00:00:37.060  -->  00:00:37.880
This is it.
14

14

00:00:37.880  -->  00:00:42.750
I know a lot of people ask don't I need
a GDD with lots of information in it?
15

15

00:00:42.750  -->  00:00:43.980
When you're making a game like this,
16

16

00:00:43.980  -->  00:00:47.530
you don't really need to write it all down
cuz you're just jumping in and doing it.
17

17

00:00:47.530  -->  00:00:48.830
So what are we jumping in and doing?
18

18

00:00:48.830  -->  00:00:51.590
Well, we're saying,
we need to have a score on the right.
19

19

00:00:51.590  -->  00:00:53.420
Over here the score, the left is health.
20

20

00:00:53.420  -->  00:00:55.890
So we need to have that
somewhere on the screen.
21

21

00:00:55.890  -->  00:00:58.080
We need to have enemy waves on path.
22

22

00:00:58.080  -->  00:01:01.750
Now, some people might say,
well in your GDD or Game Design Document,
23

23

00:01:01.750  -->  00:01:04.930
don't you need to map out what all
the parts are and how they work?
24

24

00:01:04.930  -->  00:01:05.890
Not really.
25

25

00:01:05.890  -->  00:01:09.452
[LAUGH] All we need to know is that
the enemies come in from off screen,
26

26

00:01:09.452  -->  00:01:14.230
do some stuff, circle around, up and down,
left and right, dive, bomb the player.
27

27

00:01:14.230  -->  00:01:16.340
And then they disappear
off the screen again.
28

28

00:01:16.340  -->  00:01:18.370
We don't need to map all
that out in a document.
29

29

00:01:18.370  -->  00:01:21.070
It's a bit of a waste of time,
you need to get into the engine and
30

30

00:01:21.070  -->  00:01:23.330
play around with it before you
know what's gonna work well.
31

31

00:01:23.330  -->  00:01:24.750
The enemies need to be able to shoot.
32

32

00:01:24.750  -->  00:01:26.270
As you can see they're
shooting bullets down.
33

33

00:01:26.270  -->  00:01:29.660
I'd like to have a scrolling
background in our game, so
34

34

00:01:29.660  -->  00:01:31.630
I've made this nice little
star field in there.
35

35

00:01:31.630  -->  00:01:36.070
And also some parallax, pseudo parallax
by having some particle effects
36

36

00:01:36.070  -->  00:01:39.260
dropping down that'll make more
sense as we go through this section.
37

37

00:01:39.260  -->  00:01:42.410
And the player, obviously,
needs to be moving left or right.
38

38

00:01:42.410  -->  00:01:46.150
For this design, I've decided not to have
the player moving up or down but you could
39

39

00:01:46.150  -->  00:01:49.110
totally add that as functionality
into your game if you wanted.
40

40

00:01:49.110  -->  00:01:51.600
Have the player roam
anywhere within the world.
41

41

00:01:51.600  -->  00:01:53.250
I think that would be really cool.
42

42

00:01:53.250  -->  00:01:58.371
Something you can add for sure and,
of course, the player needs to shoot.
43

43

00:01:58.371  -->  00:01:59.967
Now in terms of the core games on,
44

44

00:01:59.967  -->  00:02:03.454
I told a little bit of a fib before when
I said this is all I'd come up with.
45

45

00:02:03.454  -->  00:02:06.212
I'd say these two slides is
usually what I've come up with.
46

46

00:02:06.212  -->  00:02:09.047
This is very, very important that
you have the prior experience and
47

47

00:02:09.047  -->  00:02:12.490
we've talked about this a few times, so
I'm not going to bang on about it to much.
48

48

00:02:12.490  -->  00:02:14.740
But you need to know what
are you trying to create?
49

49

00:02:14.740  -->  00:02:18.160
What emotion, what experience
are you creating for the player?
50

50

00:02:18.160  -->  00:02:19.650
I'm creating frantic in this.
51

51

00:02:19.650  -->  00:02:23.250
Lots of bullets, a little bit of bullet
hell going on, bullets everywhere,
52

52

00:02:23.250  -->  00:02:24.310
the player, left, right.
53

53

00:02:24.310  -->  00:02:25.950
My goodness!
I got that, I'm in trouble!
54

54

00:02:25.950  -->  00:02:27.960
So that frantic experience.
55

55

00:02:27.960  -->  00:02:30.550
Core Mechanic, obviously,
shoot enemies, dodge bullets.
56

56

00:02:30.550  -->  00:02:34.190
The theme is some sort of
space wars type thing.
57

57

00:02:34.190  -->  00:02:36.620
I'm flying through space in
my spaceshipy kinda things.
58

58

00:02:36.620  -->  00:02:37.940
And the core game loop.
59

59

00:02:37.940  -->  00:02:39.760
It's pretty obvious, but
it's good to write this out.
60

60

00:02:39.760  -->  00:02:44.620
It's a single level where we have endless
play where a player shoots enemies for
61

61

00:02:44.620  -->  00:02:48.360
points or for score until their
health reaches zero and game over.
62

62

00:02:48.360  -->  00:02:50.495
It's basically go for
as long as you can, get a big score and
63

63

00:02:50.495  -->  00:02:53.280
when you're out of health then you die and
the game is over.
64

64

00:02:53.280  -->  00:02:57.030
So the challenge I have for
you at this point is would you like to use
65

65

00:02:57.030  -->  00:02:59.100
my assets that you could see
on the screen just here.
66

66

00:02:59.100  -->  00:03:02.920
This is the sort of assets, I'm using a
Kenny's asset pack which is free and I'll
67

67

00:03:02.920  -->  00:03:07.570
provide you the assets for that, as well
as you can go grab your own from Kenny.
68

68

00:03:07.570  -->  00:03:09.040
Use my assets or find your own.
69

69

00:03:09.040  -->  00:03:11.580
So if you have a vision for
making maybe a pilot game or
70

70

00:03:11.580  -->  00:03:16.300
you're flying over clouds or a racing car
game where you're driving through streets,
71

71

00:03:16.300  -->  00:03:17.640
that would be fine as well.
72

72

00:03:17.640  -->  00:03:22.110
Or any other sort of top down shooter
then this might be a time for
73

73

00:03:22.110  -->  00:03:24.690
you to flex your creative
muscles in that area.
74

74

00:03:24.690  -->  00:03:27.260
So if you're gonna do your own thing,
find your assets now.
75

75

00:03:27.260  -->  00:03:27.940
That's the challenge.
76

76

00:03:27.940  -->  00:03:30.641
And what you'll need is obviously
a player, you'll need some enemies,
77

77

00:03:30.641  -->  00:03:33.578
you need a background, you need some
bullets, and some sound effects as well.
78

78

00:03:33.578  -->  00:03:37.174
Those are the assets you would
need to have to start off.
79

79

00:03:37.174  -->  00:03:39.190
If you'd like to use mine, not a problem.
80

80

00:03:39.190  -->  00:03:42.121
I'll be providing that for
you in upcoming lectures,
81

81

00:03:42.121  -->  00:03:44.107
where you can dowload it no problem.
82

82

00:03:44.107  -->  00:03:46.518
So if you're doing the challenge
jump in and do that now,
83

83

00:03:46.518  -->  00:03:48.794
otherwise I'll see you in
the next video right away.
84

84

00:03:48.794  -->  00:03:50.441
Let's get started.
