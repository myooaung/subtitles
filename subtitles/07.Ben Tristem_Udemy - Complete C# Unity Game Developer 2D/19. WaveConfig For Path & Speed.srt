[MUSIC]

2

00:00:04,105  -->  00:00:07,438
In this video,
we're gonna shift the movement speed and
3

3

00:00:07,438  -->  00:00:11,395
the wave configuration that has its
waypoints in it off the enemy and
4

4

00:00:11,395  -->  00:00:16,250
have all that information within the enemy
spawner and the waves themselves.
5

5

00:00:16,250  -->  00:00:20,490
So the enemy is clever in knowing what
path to follow, without us having to go
6

6

00:00:20,490  -->  00:00:24,540
and link all of those things onto
a particular enemy prefab itself.
7

7

00:00:24,540  -->  00:00:25,230
Why do this?
8

8

00:00:25,230  -->  00:00:26,010
Well this is so
9

9

00:00:26,010  -->  00:00:29,520
we can have this particular enemy
come in at different speeds and
10

10

00:00:29,520  -->  00:00:33,944
go on different paths and not always have
to go on the same path every single time.
11

11

00:00:33,944  -->  00:00:36,100
I think that's gonna give
us a lot more creativity.
12

12

00:00:36,100  -->  00:00:41,200
So what we'll start off with is jumping
over into the enemy pathing script.
13

13

00:00:41,200  -->  00:00:43,130
We haven't used that for a lecture or two.
14

14

00:00:43,130  -->  00:00:45,078
Enemy pathing is what
we will be looking at.
15

15

00:00:45,078  -->  00:00:48,952
And I'm gonna start here by highlighting
the fact that we need to or
16

16

00:00:48,952  -->  00:00:51,592
we can remove some of
our SerializedFields.
17

17

00:00:51,592  -->  00:00:54,412
So we still need to have
our WaveConfig variable but
18

18

00:00:54,412  -->  00:00:56,452
we don't need access to it anymore.
19

19

00:00:56,452  -->  00:00:59,536
So that will no longer show up
on the enemy in the inspector.
20

20

00:00:59,536  -->  00:01:02,217
And likewise, this float moveSpeed,
21

21

00:01:02,217  -->  00:01:07,100
we're going to remove completely and
replace it with something else.
22

22

00:01:07,100  -->  00:01:08,240
And what'll we replace it with?
23

23

00:01:08,240  -->  00:01:10,270
Well, here's a little challenge for you.
24

24

00:01:10,270  -->  00:01:14,560
I want you to get the speed for
the enemies from the WaveConfig data
25

25

00:01:14,560  -->  00:01:17,248
instead of using moveSpeed,
which I just deleted.
26

26

00:01:17,248  -->  00:01:21,220
So find where moveSpeed is,
or in my case was, and
27

27

00:01:21,220  -->  00:01:27,440
instead of using that moveSpeed variable,
get the information from the WaveConfig.
28

28

00:01:27,440  -->  00:01:29,010
Okay, so there's your challenge.
29

29

00:01:29,010  -->  00:01:30,558
Pause the video and jump into that now.
30

30

00:01:33,073  -->  00:01:33,680
Welcome back.
31

31

00:01:33,680  -->  00:01:35,460
Hopefully you are taking
on the challenges.
32

32

00:01:35,460  -->  00:01:39,110
They are the absolute number
one best way to learn.
33

33

00:01:39,110  -->  00:01:41,864
That's why you're taking this course and
34

34

00:01:41,864  -->  00:01:45,315
not just watching along
some random YouTube videos.
35

35

00:01:45,315  -->  00:01:48,782
This is the process of learning cuz
you're taking on the challenges,
36

36

00:01:48,782  -->  00:01:50,321
I hope as the best way to learn.
37

37

00:01:50,321  -->  00:01:53,849
So you can see now cuz I've delayed
moveSpeed, got the squiggly red line.
38

38

00:01:53,849  -->  00:02:00,170
Instead of moveSpeed, we need to access
our waveConfig., what's its gonna be?
39

39

00:02:00,170  -->  00:02:03,380
GetMoveSpeed, it's highlighted already,
GetMoveSpeed and
40

40

00:02:03,380  -->  00:02:06,300
then we need our parentheses
cuz it is a method.
41

41

00:02:06,300  -->  00:02:11,324
So, now it's going to go into our
waveConfig, get the particular
42

42

00:02:11,324  -->  00:02:17,076
movement speed that we've set for
this wave and then use that for our enemy.
43

43

00:02:17,076  -->  00:02:21,423
Now, in terms of the wave configuration,
to know which wave to follow, so
44

44

00:02:21,423  -->  00:02:24,117
that we don't have to
connect it up manually.
45

45

00:02:24,117  -->  00:02:28,738
We're going to add ourselves a new
public method that, in here,
46

46

00:02:28,738  -->  00:02:33,290
has the information that we feed
into our particular waypoint.
47

47

00:02:33,290  -->  00:02:37,669
So you can see this is following our path,
we need to know which path to follow.
48

48

00:02:37,669  -->  00:02:42,168
And to do that, we want something else to
be telling us that from another script.
49

49

00:02:42,168  -->  00:02:46,198
So what we'll do is we'll create
ourselves a public method,
50

50

00:02:46,198  -->  00:02:50,325
say public void, set,
we'll call this SetWaveConfig.
51

51

00:02:50,325  -->  00:02:53,432
Now we've been doing, I'm just
going to leave that midway through,
52

52

00:02:53,432  -->  00:02:55,075
just remind you in our waveConfigs.
53

53

00:02:55,075  -->  00:02:59,554
We've been doing these get methods
where we say hey, return me a value and
54

54

00:02:59,554  -->  00:03:02,961
that value we've established
in our waveConfig file.
55

55

00:03:02,961  -->  00:03:07,528
In this instance, we're gonna say hey,
set the particular thing for me.
56

56

00:03:07,528  -->  00:03:12,042
So it's a public method that
something else can be feeding into
57

57

00:03:12,042  -->  00:03:13,922
a value into this script.
58

58

00:03:13,922  -->  00:03:16,282
So it's a set method, if you will.
59

59

00:03:16,282  -->  00:03:20,332
And in here,
we put inside the parentheses, what is it?
60

60

00:03:20,332  -->  00:03:23,789
What's the information that we
need to have when this is called?
61

61

00:03:23,789  -->  00:03:28,634
So as soon as we have parameters in
our signature here, SetWaveConfig.
62

62

00:03:28,634  -->  00:03:33,236
As soon as we put something in here and
I'm gonna put in waveConfig, so it's of
63

63

00:03:33,236  -->  00:03:37,862
type waveConfig, we'll call it waveConfig
cuz that's what we need to know.
64

64

00:03:37,862  -->  00:03:42,033
We want to know what is the waveConfig
that we should be following for
65

65

00:03:42,033  -->  00:03:44,608
this current enemy on this current path.
66

66

00:03:44,608  -->  00:03:48,862
And so,
when anything calls this public method,
67

67

00:03:48,862  -->  00:03:52,724
it has to also tell us
what the waveConfig is.
68

68

00:03:52,724  -->  00:03:58,578
If it doesn't do that, if in another
script if we just say SetWaveConfig and
69

69

00:03:58,578  -->  00:04:01,601
open close parentheses, semicolon.
70

70

00:04:01,601  -->  00:04:02,771
If we just do that,
71

71

00:04:02,771  -->  00:04:07,600
then we're going to get an error because
we've constructed our method here,
72

72

00:04:07,600  -->  00:04:12,600
saying you have to give me, thou shall
give me the waveConfig information.
73

73

00:04:12,600  -->  00:04:15,750
So when we are calling our method from
another place, which we'll do in just
74

74

00:04:15,750  -->  00:04:19,740
a moment, we actually have to put
in there what the waveConfig is.
75

75

00:04:19,740  -->  00:04:24,160
So that this waveConfig
is getting fed into here.
76

76

00:04:24,160  -->  00:04:27,050
So we know that this
becomes a container for
77

77

00:04:27,050  -->  00:04:31,410
whatever it was that this
waveConfig is in the other file.
78

78

00:04:31,410  -->  00:04:34,100
Okay, just going nice and slow on
that because I know it puzzled me for
79

79

00:04:34,100  -->  00:04:37,760
a long time in terms of what's
this stuff inside the brackets?
80

80

00:04:37,760  -->  00:04:42,230
Well the main thing to know is that
we are wanting information from
81

81

00:04:42,230  -->  00:04:43,280
whoever called this.
82

82

00:04:43,280  -->  00:04:46,500
Now, this part is going to blow your
mind if you're not paying attention.
83

83

00:04:46,500  -->  00:04:48,880
So, get ready to pay some attention.
84

84

00:04:48,880  -->  00:04:54,397
What we need to do here is to set
the waveConfig variable in this class,
85

85

00:04:54,397  -->  00:04:58,336
which is up here,
we've set this as waveConfig.
86

86

00:04:58,336  -->  00:05:01,896
And we're using this waveConfig variable
in a number of spots down here to say
87

87

00:05:01,896  -->  00:05:03,334
okay, what I'm I following?
88

88

00:05:03,334  -->  00:05:06,927
What I'm I heading towards
in terms of my waveConfig?
89

89

00:05:06,927  -->  00:05:12,445
But then we also this concept of the
waveConfig local variable to this method,
90

90

00:05:12,445  -->  00:05:14,630
which is being passed back in.
91

91

00:05:14,630  -->  00:05:19,180
Now we could call this something
different like waveConfigToSet.
92

92

00:05:19,180  -->  00:05:21,770
We could do that but
at the end of the day, it's a waveConfig.
93

93

00:05:21,770  -->  00:05:27,048
So we're gonna use the same word,
waveConfig but it has two slightly
94

94

00:05:27,048  -->  00:05:32,056
different meanings or
they're slightly different variables.
95

95

00:05:32,056  -->  00:05:37,515
So what I'm going to say
in here is this.Wave,
96

96

00:05:37,515  -->  00:05:43,799
sorry, little w,
waveConfig = waveConfig, okay?
97

97

00:05:43,799  -->  00:05:45,920
And again, I'm gonna go slow on this so
it's super duper clear,
98

98

00:05:45,920  -->  00:05:47,362
I'll just get rid of
some of my white space.
99

99

00:05:47,362  -->  00:05:51,043
Super clear,
when we say this in front of waveConfig,
100

100

00:05:51,043  -->  00:05:55,374
we're referring to this in the class,
the instance variable.
101

101

00:05:55,374  -->  00:06:00,019
So at the top here, this variable can
be used throughout our entire class,
102

102

00:06:00,019  -->  00:06:01,432
our entire instance.
103

103

00:06:01,432  -->  00:06:06,358
Therefore, it is this, this is the thing
that we're on, this is the script,
104

104

00:06:06,358  -->  00:06:08,085
the class, the document.
105

105

00:06:08,085  -->  00:06:11,186
When we use this,
referring to this whole thing.
106

106

00:06:11,186  -->  00:06:16,492
So this.waveConfig is referring
to this particular waveConfig and
107

107

00:06:16,492  -->  00:06:21,614
then it equals the waveConfig that
we receive when something calls
108

108

00:06:21,614  -->  00:06:26,744
the public method SetWaveConfig and
passes to us the waveConfig.
109

109

00:06:26,744  -->  00:06:29,566
Okay, I'm gonna save up this and
then go to the spot where we are.
110

110

00:06:29,566  -->  00:06:32,133
I'm going to call the waveConfig and
I'll show you what I mean.
111

111

00:06:32,133  -->  00:06:37,670
So over into EnemySpawner,
instead of just instantiating,
112

112

00:06:37,670  -->  00:06:42,779
we're gonna create a new variable,
which we'll say var
113

113

00:06:42,779  -->  00:06:48,750
newEnemy = Instantiate and
then what and where and the rotation.
114

114

00:06:48,750  -->  00:06:52,861
So now we're storing this new enemy
each time we create an enemy,
115

115

00:06:52,861  -->  00:06:54,216
it will be newEnemy.
116

116

00:06:54,216  -->  00:06:57,494
And that allows us to grab the component,
so
117

117

00:06:57,494  -->  00:07:02,457
if we give ourselves a line between
the end of our instantiation and
118

118

00:07:02,457  -->  00:07:06,140
before the yield, we'll type in newEnemy.
119

119

00:07:06,140  -->  00:07:09,370
So, we're referring to this
newEnemy we've just created dot.
120

120

00:07:09,370  -->  00:07:11,867
So there's something within
the newEnemy that we're looking for.
121

121

00:07:11,867  -->  00:07:16,744
GetComponent, With our angle braces cuz
122

122

00:07:16,744  -->  00:07:20,823
when we create this game object,
we're looking for a particular thing.
123

123

00:07:20,823  -->  00:07:24,097
The component we're looking for
is the enemy pathing.
124

124

00:07:24,097  -->  00:07:25,744
So that's the enemy pathing script.
125

125

00:07:25,744  -->  00:07:29,674
Then when we have a look at our enemy, you
can see, if I find an enemy, you can see
126

126

00:07:29,674  -->  00:07:33,550
it has a script and the script is also
a component that's sitting on the enemy,
127

127

00:07:33,550  -->  00:07:36,045
that's how we can access
it using getComponent.
128

128

00:07:36,045  -->  00:07:39,087
Then we need to add our parentheses after
129

129

00:07:39,087  -->  00:07:43,209
enemy pathing.SetWaveConfig
that we just created.
130

130

00:07:43,209  -->  00:07:44,696
And what do we need to feed into that?
131

131

00:07:44,696  -->  00:07:47,665
We need to feed in,
you guessed it, the waveConfig.
132

132

00:07:47,665  -->  00:07:50,229
And which wave and
then put a semicolon on the end.
133

133

00:07:50,229  -->  00:07:51,944
Which waveConfig they're referring to?
134

134

00:07:51,944  -->  00:07:55,713
It's the waveConfig that's locally
within the SpawnAllEnemies.
135

135

00:07:55,713  -->  00:08:00,069
So it knows, this is the particular
wave that I'm referring to.
136

136

00:08:00,069  -->  00:08:04,014
And then when we call this method,
it's going to pass in this waveConfig
137

137

00:08:04,014  -->  00:08:08,230
that we're getting from here into our
enemy pathing because it required us.
138

138

00:08:08,230  -->  00:08:12,391
It said, you have to give me
this information when you
139

139

00:08:12,391  -->  00:08:17,290
are calling SetWaveConfig and
I'm gonna use this information
140

140

00:08:17,290  -->  00:08:21,367
to define my own waveConfig
in my particular class.
141

141

00:08:21,367  -->  00:08:25,956
Okay, let's save all of these, I've jumped
back over into Unity, click on our enemy.
142

142

00:08:25,956  -->  00:08:27,845
Those extra bits and
pieces are no longer there.
143

143

00:08:27,845  -->  00:08:29,054
Let's go find our waves.
144

144

00:08:29,054  -->  00:08:30,781
Click on Wave 1.
145

145

00:08:30,781  -->  00:08:35,572
I'm gonna change the movement speed
to 8 and make sure this works.
146

146

00:08:35,572  -->  00:08:36,317
Path zero, which one's path zero?
147

147

00:08:36,317  -->  00:08:37,704
That's that one.
148

148

00:08:37,704  -->  00:08:40,413
Okay, I'll change it to path one for now,
149

149

00:08:40,413  -->  00:08:45,010
on wave one just to check that
it works and then click on play.
150

150

00:08:45,010  -->  00:08:47,215
We should have it coming
from left to right, is it?
151

151

00:08:47,215  -->  00:08:48,010
Or right to left?
152

152

00:08:48,010  -->  00:08:49,364
Okay and they're going nice and fast,
153

153

00:08:49,364  -->  00:08:51,940
it looks like they're definitely
going eight amount of speed.
154

154

00:08:51,940  -->  00:08:55,722
If I was to just change it over to
the other path, to check this all works,
155

155

00:08:55,722  -->  00:09:00,064
path zero and make the movement speed,
I don't know, 20 just to be ridiculous.
156

156

00:09:00,064  -->  00:09:06,620
Click on play and it should go zing and
spawn, one, two, three, four, five.
157

157

00:09:06,620  -->  00:09:07,710
Excellent, okay, there we go.
158

158

00:09:07,710  -->  00:09:12,480
So now we've got more of our
information stored on our wave.
159

159

00:09:12,480  -->  00:09:15,750
The value in doing this is now we
can create waves where we mix and
160

160

00:09:15,750  -->  00:09:17,530
match the speed, the paths and
161

161

00:09:17,530  -->  00:09:21,570
the enemies to give us a whole
ton of variation within our game.
162

162

00:09:21,570  -->  00:09:22,480
So, great work.
163

163

00:09:22,480  -->  00:09:25,580
In the next video, we'll continue
on with spawning more waves.
