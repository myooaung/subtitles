00:00:04,500  -->  00:00:08,127
In this video, we're gonna write our
first line of code in Visual Studio.
2

2

00:00:08,127  -->  00:00:12,824
That's going to be print Hello World,
and then when we go into Unity and
3

3

00:00:12,824  -->  00:00:17,459
click play, in the console area of Unity,
it will print Hello World.
4

4

00:00:17,459  -->  00:00:21,788
This is a small but very significant step
in making sure that our environment is set
5

5

00:00:21,788  -->  00:00:26,270
up correctly, and Unity and Visual Studio
are working correctly together.
6

6

00:00:26,270  -->  00:00:28,850
Let's start by talking
briefly about how Unity and
7

7

00:00:28,850  -->  00:00:30,880
Visual Studio relate to one another.
8

8

00:00:30,880  -->  00:00:32,800
So Unity is our game engine.
9

9

00:00:32,800  -->  00:00:36,450
This is where we say what
the behaviors are in our game, and
10

10

00:00:36,450  -->  00:00:38,620
how all the pieces relate to one another.
11

11

00:00:38,620  -->  00:00:41,430
And how it all looks and
how it all shapes up and comes together.
12

12

00:00:41,430  -->  00:00:45,060
One of the pieces that we
use in Unity is our code,
13

13

00:00:45,060  -->  00:00:49,350
and our code is written in
files that are .cs files.
14

14

00:00:49,350  -->  00:00:52,975
These are also called scripts, and
they're a bunch of texts that say what
15

15

00:00:52,975  -->  00:00:57,095
are the rules and behaviors of the things
that we want to have happen in our game.
16

16

00:00:57,095  -->  00:01:00,895
And the place that we write these
scripts is in Visual Studio.
17

17

00:01:00,895  -->  00:01:05,640
Visual Studio is an IDE, that's
an Integrated Developer Environment.
18

18

00:01:05,640  -->  00:01:10,560
And it gives us a whole lot of structure
and tools to make our life easier, and
19

19

00:01:10,560  -->  00:01:12,500
to avoid making mistakes.
20

20

00:01:12,500  -->  00:01:16,267
So if you're a Mac user, this is a good
time to point out that there's really not
21

21

00:01:16,267  -->  00:01:20,051
a lot of differences between Mac and PC
when it comes to Unity and Visual Studio.
22

22

00:01:20,051  -->  00:01:23,612
But in the next video,
Ben is gonna through those differences, so
23

23

00:01:23,612  -->  00:01:27,173
it's really clear what you're
looking at and how it relates, and
24

24

00:01:27,173  -->  00:01:29,799
how it differs from what
we're seeing on the PC.
25

25

00:01:29,799  -->  00:01:33,352
So let's go ahead and
create our first scripts, and
26

26

00:01:33,352  -->  00:01:37,500
use Visual Studio to make
a little bit of magic in Unity.
27

27

00:01:37,500  -->  00:01:41,620
So let's open up Unity Hub, few after you
downloaded it, it might have a shortcut
28

28

00:01:41,620  -->  00:01:45,870
on your desktop, or you might need to
navigate to it through your Program menu.
29

29

00:01:47,020  -->  00:01:49,940
When you open that up, you can see
I've got a bunch of projects in here.
30

30

00:01:49,940  -->  00:01:53,970
If this is the first time you are using
Hub, then yours is probably empty.
31

31

00:01:53,970  -->  00:01:55,430
And you wanna make sure that,
32

32

00:01:55,430  -->  00:01:59,930
under Installs, you got 2018 or
later ready to go.
33

33

00:01:59,930  -->  00:02:02,750
So, from any of these tabs up hear,
click on New.
34

34

00:02:02,750  -->  00:02:04,980
And that will allow us
to create a new project,
35

35

00:02:04,980  -->  00:02:07,290
and it's gonna ask us where
we want to save that.
36

36

00:02:07,290  -->  00:02:09,520
Let me just show you my directory here.
37

37

00:02:09,520  -->  00:02:12,180
I put that and then we can see
exactly what's going on in here.
38

38

00:02:12,180  -->  00:02:15,450
So for me, I've created under my D drive.
39

39

00:02:15,450  -->  00:02:16,840
So just any of your drives.
40

40

00:02:16,840  -->  00:02:21,000
I've got a D drive here, I've created
a photo called Repos which is short for
41

41

00:02:21,000  -->  00:02:23,550
the terminology repositories,
which is something
42

42

00:02:23,550  -->  00:02:28,080
that'll be relevant later on in the course
when we look at source control.
43

43

00:02:28,080  -->  00:02:31,740
And then within Repos,
I've created Unity2D,
44

44

00:02:31,740  -->  00:02:35,650
which is where all of the projects
from this course are going to go,
45

45

00:02:35,650  -->  00:02:38,170
and the first section we're
working on isIntro_Setup.
46

46

00:02:38,170  -->  00:02:40,870
So, I encourage you to
do a similar structure,
47

47

00:02:40,870  -->  00:02:43,705
have a Repos directory
with our Unity2D course,
48

48

00:02:43,705  -->  00:02:48,584
and then for this particular section it's
intro and setup, ready and running this.
49

49

00:02:48,584  -->  00:02:51,226
So when we go into start our new project,
50

50

00:02:51,226  -->  00:02:55,812
we click on the three little dots to
the right of location, down here,
51

51

00:02:55,812  -->  00:03:00,710
and that will allow us to go and
choose where we want to set that up.
52

52

00:03:00,710  -->  00:03:04,881
Go to DATA, or DATA, depending
from where you're from, Repos, and
53

53

00:03:04,881  -->  00:03:07,370
then Unity2D, and then Intro_Setup.
54

54

00:03:07,370  -->  00:03:11,348
So I'm gonna just click on that once and
select Project, and
55

55

00:03:11,348  -->  00:03:14,270
we'll use that as our project location.
56

56

00:03:14,270  -->  00:03:16,940
Now it's really important to
know that a Unity Project
57

57

00:03:16,940  -->  00:03:21,200
is a folder with a set of directories and
a set of files with inside it.
58

58

00:03:21,200  -->  00:03:26,090
When we start a project, it's not just
one file, it's a whole bunch of files.
59

59

00:03:26,090  -->  00:03:29,540
We're gonna call the project name,
here we'll call this Hello World,
60

60

00:03:29,540  -->  00:03:33,050
as all good programming first
steps should be a Hello World, and
61

61

00:03:33,050  -->  00:03:37,350
under Template we're going to select 2D,
and then click Create project.
62

62

00:03:40,796  -->  00:03:43,095
There might be a little bit of loading,
a little bit of setup,
63

63

00:03:43,095  -->  00:03:45,590
a little bit of importing,
particularly if it's the first time.
64

64

00:03:45,590  -->  00:03:48,450
So bear with that, it should do
all of that automatically, and
65

65

00:03:48,450  -->  00:03:50,890
then we will be into the engine.
66

66

00:03:50,890  -->  00:03:53,040
Okay, so that started up our project.
67

67

00:03:53,040  -->  00:03:56,220
Let's just have a quick look in our
directory to see what happened there
68

68

00:03:56,220  -->  00:03:57,530
in the Intro_Setup.
69

69

00:03:57,530  -->  00:04:01,420
We now have a Hello World folder, I've got
a couple of other things in here that you
70

70

00:04:01,420  -->  00:04:03,310
won't have yet, cuz I've put them in.
71

71

00:04:03,310  -->  00:04:05,890
But the important thing is to see
that we've got a Hello World.
72

72

00:04:05,890  -->  00:04:08,920
Within that there's a whole bunch
of folders that Unity's created for
73

73

00:04:08,920  -->  00:04:13,030
us, including the Assets folder, and
that's where all of our information,
74

74

00:04:13,030  -->  00:04:16,130
all of our game assets,
and artwork, and scripts.
75

75

00:04:16,130  -->  00:04:19,580
Everything is gonna go into Assets,
so that's being created for us.
76

76

00:04:19,580  -->  00:04:22,670
If your layout looks different to mine,
you can come up to the top right here,
77

77

00:04:22,670  -->  00:04:25,340
it says Layout,
click on that button and find Default.
78

78

00:04:25,340  -->  00:04:29,390
When you click on Default, that should
default everything back to the default
79

79

00:04:29,390  -->  00:04:32,520
windows layout, so it should look
the same as what I have here.
80

80

00:04:32,520  -->  00:04:38,160
So from anywhere down in this Assets area
down here, right click, go to Create,
81

81

00:04:38,160  -->  00:04:42,520
and then find C# Script, click on that,
and you'll see it create a script.
82

82

00:04:42,520  -->  00:04:46,680
Now, important message, we wanna typing
straight away the name of our script,
83

83

00:04:46,680  -->  00:04:48,850
don't click anywhere else and
don't hit Enter.
84

84

00:04:48,850  -->  00:04:53,510
Cuz if you do that, you'll accidentally
create this file with the default name.
85

85

00:04:53,510  -->  00:04:54,930
And if we create it with the default name,
86

86

00:04:54,930  -->  00:04:59,470
when we go and rename it in a moment,
it will cause some issues and some errors.
87

87

00:04:59,470  -->  00:05:04,300
So you wanna make sure that while the
script name is still highlighted and blue,
88

88

00:05:04,300  -->  00:05:06,620
that you start typing straight away.
89

89

00:05:06,620  -->  00:05:10,850
We're gonna change the name of
this to HelloWorld, no spaces.
90

90

00:05:10,850  -->  00:05:12,877
And I've put capital H and capital W.
91

91

00:05:12,877  -->  00:05:17,019
And you know you've created your script
correctly if the name underneath
92

92

00:05:17,019  -->  00:05:21,559
the script there matches the name we see
over in inspector you can see public class
93

93

00:05:21,559  -->  00:05:22,410
HelloWorld.
94

94

00:05:22,410  -->  00:05:25,750
So if its Hello World there ,and
HelloWorld under your script, success,
95

95

00:05:25,750  -->  00:05:26,740
we are ready to go.
96

96

00:05:26,740  -->  00:05:29,180
If they are different,
Unity is gonna be a bit upset and
97

97

00:05:29,180  -->  00:05:32,300
you need to delete your script and
start that process again.
98

98

00:05:32,300  -->  00:05:34,490
So let's double click on HelloWorld.
99

99

00:05:35,690  -->  00:05:36,920
It'll open up Visual Studio.
100

100

00:05:36,920  -->  00:05:40,120
There might be a little bit of
initial setup and initial loading.
101

101

00:05:40,120  -->  00:05:41,580
Okay, and there's a lot going on here.
102

102

00:05:41,580  -->  00:05:44,420
There's a few things we don't need,
so I'm gonna close over here,
103

103

00:05:44,420  -->  00:05:47,340
my Solution Explorer, just x out on that.
104

104

00:05:47,340  -->  00:05:49,510
And my Team Explorer and Properties,
105

105

00:05:49,510  -->  00:05:52,978
all of those things we don't need at
the moment, so I'm gonna close that out.
106

106

00:05:52,978  -->  00:05:55,550
So this script that we
created over here in Unity
107

107

00:05:55,550  -->  00:05:59,360
already comes with a bunch of text,
a bunch of information on it.
108

108

00:05:59,360  -->  00:06:01,010
We're not gonna go into
the details of that yet,
109

109

00:06:01,010  -->  00:06:03,050
I promise you we'll get into all of that.
110

110

00:06:03,050  -->  00:06:06,510
And in no time you'll understand
everything that's going on within here.
111

111

00:06:06,510  -->  00:06:11,352
But for now, we're just going to get our
hands dirty by writing a line of code.
112

112

00:06:11,352  -->  00:06:15,988
So, I want you to click on line number 9,
clicking there underneath Start
113

113

00:06:15,988  -->  00:06:20,639
verses void start, just follow along
with me here, hands dirty, right.
114

114

00:06:20,639  -->  00:06:23,637
Our first line of code and type print, and
115

115

00:06:23,637  -->  00:06:28,990
after that we're gonna type open
brackets or open parenthesis.
116

116

00:06:28,990  -->  00:06:32,910
And then quotation mark, and
you can see cuz we are in
117

117

00:06:32,910  -->  00:06:37,530
our best friend of Visual Studio,
it knows what we wanna do.
118

118

00:06:37,530  -->  00:06:41,450
It's already give us a closed bracket and
a closed quotation mark.
119

119

00:06:41,450  -->  00:06:43,730
And it's already giving us some
information down here saying,
120

120

00:06:43,730  -->  00:06:46,390
hey you might wanna know this,
and this might be useful.
121

121

00:06:46,390  -->  00:06:47,510
This is great stuff.
122

122

00:06:47,510  -->  00:06:50,590
Over time you'll recognize that,
and you'll see this fantastic.
123

123

00:06:50,590  -->  00:06:52,650
For now, don't worry about all
that information coming out.
124

124

00:06:52,650  -->  00:06:56,590
We're gonna finish typing here,
we'll type Hello World.
125

125

00:06:56,590  -->  00:07:01,311
And then down the end of our
statement here, we need to type a ;,
126

126

00:07:01,311  -->  00:07:05,060
and you can see when we did that
the little squiggly red line went away.
127

127

00:07:05,060  -->  00:07:06,890
I'll do that one more time.
128

128

00:07:06,890  -->  00:07:10,580
When we've got no ; there's
a squiggly red line seen, and
129

129

00:07:10,580  -->  00:07:14,560
if you mouse over that,
you can see ;expected.
130

130

00:07:14,560  -->  00:07:17,763
So this is our best buddy Visual Studio
trying to help us out here,
131

131

00:07:17,763  -->  00:07:20,511
saying I really think you
should put a semicolon there.
132

132

00:07:20,511  -->  00:07:21,447
Yes, we do need to do one of those.
133

133

00:07:21,447  -->  00:07:23,432
Okay then, I want to hit Save, and
134

134

00:07:23,432  -->  00:07:26,940
you can see the little star
that was up here went away.
135

135

00:07:26,940  -->  00:07:32,860
And, we have a green line that appears
to say that we have saved our script.
136

136

00:07:32,860  -->  00:07:35,840
Now, back over into Unity this
is a script we're working on.
137

137

00:07:35,840  -->  00:07:39,270
It's been saved,
now there's one last step we need to do.
138

138

00:07:39,270  -->  00:07:42,120
Our script just sitting on
it's own isn't doing anything,
139

139

00:07:42,120  -->  00:07:45,690
we need to bring it into our world
by attaching it to a game object.
140

140

00:07:45,690  -->  00:07:48,009
And, the only game object
we've got is our camera.
141

141

00:07:48,009  -->  00:07:53,280
So, if your sample scene has closed,
you can click the little arrow next to it.
142

142

00:07:53,280  -->  00:07:56,460
That'll open it up to show all of
the things in the hierarchy underneath
143

143

00:07:56,460  -->  00:08:00,555
Sample Scene, and
you can see we have main camera.
144

144

00:08:00,555  -->  00:08:03,742
That's our game object,
the only game object in the moment.
145

145

00:08:03,742  -->  00:08:08,251
So we're going to drag our HelloWorld
script on to our main camera at
146

146

00:08:08,251  -->  00:08:09,209
the top here.
147

147

00:08:09,209  -->  00:08:13,264
We could have also dragged it over here
into the inspector while we're selected on
148

148

00:08:13,264  -->  00:08:16,687
main camera, either these ways
would have served the same purpose.
149

149

00:08:16,687  -->  00:08:20,113
You can see now when clicked on
main camera within the inspector,
150

150

00:08:20,113  -->  00:08:22,310
we've got our HelloWorld script there.
151

151

00:08:22,310  -->  00:08:26,860
If you come out to the top and
click the Play button, and
152

152

00:08:26,860  -->  00:08:30,700
open up the Console here,
we haven't talked about the Console yet.
153

153

00:08:30,700  -->  00:08:35,020
The Console is what allows
us to see the messages, and
154

154

00:08:35,020  -->  00:08:37,740
the information allows
us to debug our game.
155

155

00:08:37,740  -->  00:08:39,580
It's a great place to print things out.
156

156

00:08:39,580  -->  00:08:42,580
You can see Hello World is
written right in there.
157

157

00:08:42,580  -->  00:08:46,270
Success, we have created
our first line of code.
158

158

00:08:46,270  -->  00:08:47,440
Now I have a challenge for you, and
159

159

00:08:47,440  -->  00:08:51,060
what I would like you to do
is to print Hello YourName.
160

160

00:08:51,060  -->  00:08:54,270
So to modify our Hello World code,
161

161

00:08:54,270  -->  00:08:58,070
instead of printing out Hello World,
I'd like it to print out YourName.
162

162

00:08:58,070  -->  00:09:02,024
And obviously it wouldn't say YourName, it
would saying Hello Rick, or Hello Fred, or
163

163

00:09:02,024  -->  00:09:03,885
Hello Bob, whatever your name might be.
164

164

00:09:03,885  -->  00:09:07,711
So, pause the video now,
go into the script,
165

165

00:09:07,711  -->  00:09:12,227
change from Hello World to Hello YourName,
Save, and
166

166

00:09:12,227  -->  00:09:18,538
then go back into Unity and click Play,
and see that it tops Hello YourName.
167

167

00:09:18,538  -->  00:09:23,290
And after you do that, come back to
the video and play the video again, and
168

168

00:09:23,290  -->  00:09:28,827
I will my approach doing that as well, and
we can finish off this excercise together.
169

169

00:09:28,827  -->  00:09:30,029
So, I will see you in a moment.
170

170

00:09:32,621  -->  00:09:33,880
Okay, welcome back.
171

171

00:09:33,880  -->  00:09:35,590
We'll make sure we click out of play mode.
172

172

00:09:35,590  -->  00:09:39,350
I'd left ourselves in play mode, and
I really hope that you did that challenge.
173

173

00:09:39,350  -->  00:09:43,307
I'm gonna ask you to do a challenge
in each lecture in this course, and
174

174

00:09:43,307  -->  00:09:47,990
it's super super important that you
jump in and take on these challenges.
175

175

00:09:47,990  -->  00:09:51,330
Okay, so
I'm back over in VisualStudio here, and
176

176

00:09:51,330  -->  00:09:54,320
you can see our statement print("Hello
World"), I'm just gonna hop in here and
177

177

00:09:54,320  -->  00:09:57,940
change this to "Hello Rick" and hit Save.
178

178

00:09:57,940  -->  00:10:01,790
Back over into Unity, we don't need to
attach it to the main camera again,
179

179

00:10:01,790  -->  00:10:02,950
cuz it's already attached there.
180

180

00:10:02,950  -->  00:10:05,498
If we click on the main camera,
you can see Hello World,
181

181

00:10:05,498  -->  00:10:07,573
it's been updated because we've saved it.
182

182

00:10:07,573  -->  00:10:12,719
And then when I click play,
you should see Hello Rick down here.
183

183

00:10:12,719  -->  00:10:16,574
And this really was a quick exercise
to make sure that our environment is
184

184

00:10:16,574  -->  00:10:17,830
set up correctly.
185

185

00:10:17,830  -->  00:10:19,680
In the next section of the course,
Number Wizard,
186

186

00:10:19,680  -->  00:10:22,650
we'll be looking at all the things
that we went over very quickly here.
187

187

00:10:22,650  -->  00:10:23,600
About the inspector,
188

188

00:10:23,600  -->  00:10:27,880
about the layout, in terms of just things
like semi-colons, why are we doing them?
189

189

00:10:27,880  -->  00:10:30,690
So, all of that information we'll
be covering in great detail
190

190

00:10:30,690  -->  00:10:32,240
in the next section of the course.
191

191

00:10:32,240  -->  00:10:35,048
During the next video Ben is going
to be talking about Mac differences,
192

192

00:10:35,048  -->  00:10:37,650
if you are a Mac person,
that's a great video to watch.
193

193

00:10:37,650  -->  00:10:40,670
If not, you can skip that video and
go into the next video in the course.
194

194

00:10:40,670  -->  00:10:42,150
Great work, and I will see you again soon.
