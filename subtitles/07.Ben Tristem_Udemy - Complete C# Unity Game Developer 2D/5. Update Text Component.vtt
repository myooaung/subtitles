00:00:04.219 --> 00:00:08.315
Hello again, I'm super pumped for this
lecture because, in this conversation,
1

2
00:00:08.315 --> 00:00:11.340
we are going to be adding
programmatically, adding text.
2

3
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.570
So, that when we hit Play,
that text is fade in from our script and
3

4
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.290
it is put within our game.
4

5
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.250
So, this is gonna be a fantastic
way adding dynamically,
5

6
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.740
programmatically, adding
text into our game.
6

7
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.350
So, let's jump in and get started.
7

8
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.510
Now, we want a script where we
can put our game logic that says,
8

9
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:29.340
what's the information,
9

10
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.590
what's the text that should be displayed
when the player is playing our game?
10

11
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.080
And when we create a script, all scripts
need to be attached to a game object.
11

12
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.040
They need to be a component
of a game object.
12

13
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.160
So what we'll do starting off here is jump
over into our hierarchy and right-click.
13

14
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.510
And as I've said before, you can go up
to Game Object and get the same menu.
14

15
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.250
I prefer to right click and Create Empty.
15

16
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.800
That means empty game object.
16

17
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.850
You can see here it is called Game Object.
17

18
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.750
At the moment there is nothing
in this game object except for
18

19
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.530
it's transform information.
19

20
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.540
This Transform here is a component.
20

21
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.090
We will be talking about
components a bit more in a moment.
21

22
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.830
The transform component has values on it.
22

23
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.171
It has values for position,
rotation and scale and
23

24
00:01:10.171 --> 00:01:13.900
we worked through a little bit of
that in some previous lectures.
24

25
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.002
Let's rename our Game Object to Game.
25

26
00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:21.334
Now, we could call it game logic or game
flow or game structure any of those names
26

27
00:01:21.334 --> 00:01:25.538
would work, because we've only got this
one thing in this very simple game,
27

28
00:01:25.538 --> 00:01:26.980
we'll just call it Game.
28

29
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.680
So we know where that game
information is going to be placed.
29

30
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.290
Now you can see on our game
object we have one component.
30

31
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.950
Let's talk a little bit more about that.
31

32
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.730
Now I've created a little analogy here
where I'm looking at a sound stereo
32

33
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.900
system, it's a home stereo system.
33

34
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.960
And we've got a couple of speakers and
a television.
34

35
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.230
What we're looking at here
are the equivalent of Game Objects.
35

36
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.110
So the TV is a game object and
36

37
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.650
its function is to display
the visual information.
37

38
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:54.670
So it's our visual display.
38

39
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.430
We've got our speakers, and
that's about audio output and
39

40
00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.210
then we've got our stereo system
sitting on our shelf here.
40

41
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.600
Our shelf has some compartments and
41

42
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.430
on each compartments,
we have what we could consider components.
42

43
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.660
And the components could be a radio tuner,
a Blu-Ray player,
43

44
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.050
you might have Google Home you've set on
there, a DVD player, a record player,
44

45
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.095
maybe you're old school.
45

46
00:02:16.095 --> 00:02:18.620
[LAUGH] Most people don't have
many of these things nowadays.
46

47
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.300
A radio tuner?
47

48
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.980
What's that?
48

49
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:20.780
A record player?
49

50
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:21.620
Who uses those?
50

51
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.610
But this is an example of all
the things you might have
51

52
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.680
on your home stereo system sitting
on your shelving unit here.
52

53
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.210
These are components
of your stereo system.
53

54
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.520
And if you dig in that a little deeper,
each component for example our Blu-Ray
54

55
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.410
player has properties, and properties
in unity can be one of two things.
55

56
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.400
It can be values or references, so
56

57
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.680
an example of the value might
be over on our amplifier.
57

58
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.210
We might have the volume currently set
to eight, for example, that's a value.
58

59
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.420
We might have a value that we're
playing on our DVD player,
59

60
00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.930
we're playing track three,
that's the song we're playing.
60

61
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.760
And references are things that
like grabbing from somewhere else,
61

62
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.290
so what is the disc that we
put in our Blu-Ray player.
62

63
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.500
Maybe we're looking at
the latest Avengers movie and
63

64
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.270
we've put that into the Blu-Ray player,
that's a reference.
64

65
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.835
So the reference is the Blu-Ray player
disc that we put into our Blu-Ray player.
65

66
00:03:14.835 --> 00:03:20.073
So this is saying that game objects
such as our stereo shelving unit here,
66

67
00:03:20.073 --> 00:03:24.049
consists of components,
such as our Blu-Ray player.
67

68
00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.918
And our components are made
up of properties and
68

69
00:03:26.918 --> 00:03:31.020
the properties can be either values or
they can be references.
69

70
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.340
Let's have a look at that
back in unity to get some
70

71
00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.980
context is what we are talkng about here.
71

72
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.342
So we have game,
we've kinda got one component, Transform,
72

73
00:03:40.342 --> 00:03:43.290
and we've got values and positions.
73

74
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.286
And so every game object has a transform
because we need to know where in the world
74

75
00:03:47.286 --> 00:03:48.250
it will be placed.
75

76
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.140
So everything starts with the transform,
and it's good practice to,
76

77
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.350
when we first create an empty game object,
is to reset the position back to zero.
77

78
00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.300
We can do this a couple of ways.
78

79
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.048
We can type zero into the x, y,
z coordinates, and that will make it to
79

80
00:04:02.048 --> 00:04:05.991
the zero position or we could right
click on Transform and click Reset, or
80

81
00:04:05.991 --> 00:04:09.645
there's a little cog here
on the right and click Reset.
81

82
00:04:09.645 --> 00:04:12.345
It's not gonna have the impact at
the moment because we're not trying to
82

83
00:04:12.345 --> 00:04:14.855
visualize this particular game object.
83

84
00:04:14.855 --> 00:04:17.041
We're gonna use it to run our code, but
84

85
00:04:17.041 --> 00:04:20.759
it's just standard practice that
we reset our empty game object.
85

86
00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:23.407
So, they're sitting at the zero,
zero, zero, so
86

87
00:04:23.407 --> 00:04:25.830
we know to find if we do
need to find them, okay.
87

88
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.590
So that's the component and
then the values.
88

89
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.070
We're gonna add a new component.
89

90
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.950
We do that by clicking
the Add Component button.
90

91
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.090
And you can see all the various
components we have available to us here.
91

92
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.820
If you click on some of these,
here are some Physics 2D components.
92

93
00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.240
Here are some Audio components
such as the Audio Listener.
93

94
00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.200
Here are some Effects such
as a Particle System.
94

95
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.770
So it's a components though we
can put in our game object.
95

96
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.330
What we will do is scroll all the way
down and click on New Script.
96

97
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.230
We're gonna create a new script.
97

98
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.260
Another way to create a script
by adding a component is
98

99
00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.700
if we type into the search bar up here,
the name of our script.
99

100
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.930
So we are going to name our script
in this instance AdventureGame,
100

101
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.600
capital A, capital G with no spaces.
101

102
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.340
That's the convention for a new class.
102

103
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.600
It starts with a capital and
has capital on any other words.
103

104
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.160
And no spaces, and
the click New Script, Create and Add.
104

105
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.280
You can see, after we do that,
down in our Assets directory,
105

106
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.160
we now have a new script, with
AdventureGame as the name of that script.
106

107
00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.710
If you click on it,
you can see AdventureGame.cs,
107

108
00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.365
down the bottom of your
Unity Engine down there.
108

109
00:05:31.365 --> 00:05:33.140
AdventureGame.cs.
109

110
00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.656
Now let's double click
on AdventureGame.cs,
110

111
00:05:35.656 --> 00:05:37.013
to open up Visual Studio.
111

112
00:05:37.013 --> 00:05:38.099
It might take a minute.
112

113
00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:43.431
I'll expand mine a little bit so
you can see what's going on as we get
113

114
00:05:43.431 --> 00:05:46.540
more content on our scripts,
I'll probably zoom out a little bit.
114

115
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.430
But for now, I'll zoom in so you can see
things nice and clear on your screen.
115

116
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.890
You can see we have public
class AdventureGame.
116

117
00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.710
Now in our default script, the first thing
I want to do is to create a variable,
117

118
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.520
and I'm gonna make this
an instance variable,
118

119
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.770
or remember variable that's
available to our whole class here.
119

120
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.320
So underneath public class AdventureGame,
give ourselves a couple of lines.
120

121
00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.350
On line seven, I will type Text
because it will be of type text, so
121

122
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:10.540
what type of variable is it?
122

123
00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.723
It's not an int, it's not a float,
it's not a string, it's a text variable.
123

124
00:06:14.723 --> 00:06:19.256
And the text variable, undo that,
the text variable will be called text, so
124

125
00:06:19.256 --> 00:06:24.137
small T, all those variables start with a
small letter, and then any new words we do
125

126
00:06:24.137 --> 00:06:29.140
a capital letter, so textComponent is
what we'll call this, and then semicolon.
126

127
00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.974
And you can see that there's red
squiggly line underneath text,
127

128
00:06:32.974 --> 00:06:37.861
the error we're getting is the type 09
namespace, name text could not be found.
128

129
00:06:37.861 --> 00:06:41.556
What this means is text is a very
specific piece of information that is
129

130
00:06:41.556 --> 00:06:44.870
specific keyword that Unity knows,
however it doesn't know
130

131
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.708
where we're getting it from and
we need to use a particular namespace.
131

132
00:06:48.708 --> 00:06:53.908
So we need to tell Unity this is coming
from such and such a namespace so
132

133
00:06:53.908 --> 00:06:58.750
up at the top here,
underneath using UnityEngine we'll type,
133

134
00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.910
using UnityEngine.UI, semi-colon.
134

135
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:06.950
And that now says we will use
the UnityEngine User Interface namespace,
135

136
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.410
and all of the information that's
contain within there we now want to have
136

137
00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:12.190
access to in our class.
137

138
00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:15.570
And for now, don't worry about
exactly what is a namespace and
138

139
00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:16.830
what is inside a namespace.
139

140
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:21.130
Just know that we need to use
a particular namespace in order to access
140

141
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:22.970
the aspects of that namespace.
141

142
00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:27.715
For example, Text is a User Interface
keyword and we need to be using
142

143
00:07:27.715 --> 00:07:32.780
UnityEngine.UI in order for us to have
access to this particular keyword here.
143

144
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.252
Okay, so now we have our variable of type
Text and it is called textComponent.
144

145
00:07:37.252 --> 00:07:41.597
I'm gonna save that, I'm gonna add a new
thing here that we haven't seen before at
145

146
00:07:41.597 --> 00:07:42.791
the start of our line.
146

147
00:07:42.791 --> 00:07:45.584
And I'll give myself a space and
then go back to start so
147

148
00:07:45.584 --> 00:07:47.360
that we can order a complete list.
148

149
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:53.211
If you open a square brackets,
and type in serialized,
149

150
00:07:53.211 --> 00:07:59.820
serial, serialized field, and
then close square brackets.
150

151
00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:03.180
And for those of you English,
Australians out there, Canadians,
151

152
00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:04.750
you can see that we have zed.
152

153
00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.660
So using the North American
way of spelling this.
153

154
00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:10.091
Just a little bit of a gotcha that you
need to make sure that you have a zed or
154

155
00:08:10.091 --> 00:08:11.130
a z and not an s.
155

156
00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:12.490
So we have serialized field.
156

157
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:13.370
What does that mean?
157

158
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:16.270
Well, by putting this in
front of our variable.
158

159
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:19.190
And we can put serialized field
in front of any of our variables.
159

160
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:23.400
That means we now have this
available within our inspector so
160

161
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.360
that we can make changes in the inspector.
161

162
00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.020
What do we mean by that?
162

163
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:31.380
Let's save our script back over
into Unity, click on Game,
163

164
00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.890
this our game object we created.
164

165
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:37.190
And you can see we have our
AdventureGame script and
165

166
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:40.890
there now is a field down
here called textComponent.
166

167
00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:43.850
So the variable we've just created,
textComponent,
167

168
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:46.070
is now sitting here as a reference.
168

169
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:49.240
It's saying,
what would you like textComponent to be?
169

170
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.960
This is where we can hook things
up visually and say well, we want
170

171
00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:56.380
textComponent to be this particular
game object or this particular element.
171

172
00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.945
There's two ways to assign
to this field in here.
172

173
00:08:59.945 --> 00:09:04.001
One is to drag, we could go over into our
Canvas, which is over on our left in our
173

174
00:09:04.001 --> 00:09:07.698
hierarchy, we could find the particular
thing we're interested in.
174

175
00:09:07.698 --> 00:09:10.417
In this instance we're
interested in Story Text cuz we
175

176
00:09:10.417 --> 00:09:13.160
want to dynamically update
all of our Story Text.
176

177
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.930
And we could drag that
over into the field,
177

178
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:19.860
that's what I tend to do usually but for
now, let's do it the more careful way
178

179
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:24.890
which is to click on the little selector
to the right of our textComponent here.
179

180
00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:28.560
Click on that selector and
then select from our
180

181
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.080
appropriate game objects what
we would like to put in there.
181

182
00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:36.335
And you can see it's only giving us
the two things that Unity knows are text
182

183
00:09:36.335 --> 00:09:41.900
fields, that are text of type text, a
story text and tittle text, a typed text.
183

184
00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:46.010
Because in our script we said it must
be of type text nothing else will do,
184

185
00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:49.470
I will not let you put anything
else in this variable.
185

186
00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:56.150
I wanna not let you assign a light or
a camera or an enemy that has to be text.
186

187
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:57.660
That's what it means when we do type.
187

188
00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:01.530
So, we selected Story Text in here, so
we clicked on here, double click on
188

189
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:06.850
Story Text, when you all have Story Text
as our textComponent, very cool.
189

190
00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:07.660
The next step,
190

191
00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:11.550
back over into our script we need to do
something with this textComponent, and
191

192
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:18.730
in our start method we'll type this line
textComponent, and that's our variable.
192

193
00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:21.820
We're accessing this variable, we're
saying it's about this particular variable
193

194
00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:26.860
we've just created, dot, and
we'll type in here text.
194

195
00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:27.950
Now what does that mean?
195

196
00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:30.810
I'm just gonna put an equals here so it's
sitting in the next state ready to go.
196

197
00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:35.340
textComponent.text, if we go
back to our component over here,
197

198
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:40.410
we can see this is saying,
textComponent is the Story Text.
198

199
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:42.400
Okay, let's go look at Story Text.
199

200
00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.820
Story Text has its own components.
200

201
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:50.180
It has a Rect Transform, it has a Canvas
Renderer, and it has a Text component.
201

202
00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:51.420
So here's our Text component.
202

203
00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:53.560
There's even a little T
that sits next to it here.
203

204
00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:54.170
Text component,
204

205
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:58.320
we've got all this placeholder nonsense
that we've put in here for now.
205

206
00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.850
And now text component.
206

207
00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:05.800
But this is of type text, and
then the field here is the text field.
207

208
00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:10.510
So this is the text component and
this is the text field within the text.
208

209
00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:13.456
So it's a little bit confusing,
cuz it's text than text, and
209

210
00:11:13.456 --> 00:11:15.800
we're putting text into
text which is into text.
210

211
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:20.340
So a little bit confusing but it's super
important that we get these concepts now
211

212
00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:21.590
when the words are the same so
212

213
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:23.670
that you can see that these
are actually different things.
213

214
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:28.070
So this is the text component, and
this is the text property or text field or
214

215
00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:33.300
text values that we have within
our text component here.
215

216
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:38.290
So in our script, what we're saying is I
would like you to access textComponent,
216

217
00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:41.400
and then within textComponent,
that's why we have the dot here,
217

218
00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.530
it's saying underneath, or
within, or belonging to.
218

219
00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:46.610
We're gonna talk about the dot
a lot throughout this course.
219

220
00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:50.250
So for now, it's just a really gentle
introduction to this dot operator in here.
220

221
00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:53.940
But we're saying the textComponent,
within the textComponent,
221

222
00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:59.080
we are referring to, or
accessing the text property.
222

223
00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.960
That's what we're saying
with this statement here.
223

224
00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.230
And that needs to equal something,
well, what do we want it to equal?
224

225
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:07.440
We want it to equal whatever our game
should be saying at this point in time,
225

226
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.220
not placeholder story text,
text, text, text over and over.
226

227
00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.830
We want it to say something, so for now
we're gonna put it just another piece of
227

228
00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:16.800
placeholder, but it'll be placeholder
that we've driven through our code.
228

229
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.370
So this is the challenge that I have for
you,
229

230
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:21.830
is to add this text programmatically
from within our script.
230

231
00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:25.790
Finish the statement by assigning
a string to our text reference.
231

232
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:30.150
So if you have a look at it, we need to
assign a string to this text reference
232

233
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:34.080
here, and if that makes sense to you
like yep,that's cool Rick good to go,
233

234
00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.350
I now what to do there.
234

235
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:38.960
Or you wanna figure it out then
pause the video and jump in know.
235

236
00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.180
I'll give you a hint if your
scratching your head, but
236

237
00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:43.620
I want you to have a chance to jump in and
take that on right now.
237

238
00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.640
So pause the video if your good to go.
238

239
00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.990
Otherwise, here is your hint.
239

240
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:50.610
Your hint is, I'm a string.
240

241
00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:52.910
This is how we write a string.
241

242
00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:55.840
So that's your challenge,
assign a string and
242

243
00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:00.000
save your script, hit play and
see what happens in your game.
243

244
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.870
And I'll be back here with my
solution in just a moment.
244

245
00:13:05.824 --> 00:13:06.414
Right, so
245

246
00:13:06.414 --> 00:13:10.560
this is a pretty simple one in terms of
it only requires us adding a tiny bit.
246

247
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:15.679
What we're doing is assigning
a string by having our open brackets,
247

248
00:13:15.679 --> 00:13:21.251
and then our quotation marks, and
saying, I am added programmatically.
248

249
00:13:21.251 --> 00:13:24.654
Or what have you wanted to say,
hello world, or this is Rick, or
249

250
00:13:24.654 --> 00:13:26.670
the world is fantastic.
250

251
00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:29.500
Whatever you want or
something that's more theme to your games.
251

252
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:33.290
So, Steampunk forever, ftw, okay.
252

253
00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:36.677
So, I've added text component.txt equals,
I am added programmatically.
253

254
00:13:36.677 --> 00:13:41.347
Save that back over into Unity, if I click
Play now, it takes a moment to load for
254

255
00:13:41.347 --> 00:13:45.604
a loading our scripts understanding
what's going on, clicking play,
255

256
00:13:45.604 --> 00:13:49.540
I'm added programatically so
we've added that from our script.
256

257
00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:53.115
So this is the foundation for
our expand out to add out own text,
257

258
00:13:53.115 --> 00:13:57.705
and a variety of text into our game window
here so it can update dynamically when we
258

259
00:13:57.705 --> 00:14:00.704
push a button some other
piece of text gonna appear.
259

260
00:14:00.704 --> 00:14:03.615
And when we make a decision
some other text can appear so
260

261
00:14:03.615 --> 00:14:08.130
this is the foundation for it of having
our textComponent.text equals something.
261

262
00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:11.731
We've added that into our game,
we've created our game object,
262

263
00:14:11.731 --> 00:14:14.256
on our game object we
have a script component.
263

264
00:14:14.256 --> 00:14:17.913
And in our script component we have our
story text as our text component, so
264

265
00:14:17.913 --> 00:14:19.202
great work in this video.
265

266
00:14:19.202 --> 00:14:22.720
You're doing really well, and
I will see you in the next lecture.
