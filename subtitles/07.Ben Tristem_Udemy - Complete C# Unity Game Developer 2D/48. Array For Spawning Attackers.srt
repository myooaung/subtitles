[MUSIC]

2

00:00:04,050  -->  00:00:08,001
Hello, again, here's the outcome of what
we're going to do in this video that will
3

3

00:00:08,001  -->  00:00:11,470
change our spawners so that they
are spawning from an array of attackers.
4

4

00:00:11,470  -->  00:00:14,120
So you can see here it's sometimes a fox,
sometimes a lizard,
5

5

00:00:14,120  -->  00:00:18,550
sometimes a fox, whereas other lanes
we can say just lizards or just foxes.
6

6

00:00:18,550  -->  00:00:22,600
So it gives us more flexibility and
variety in our game, so let's jump in and
7

7

00:00:22,600  -->  00:00:23,620
get started.
8

8

00:00:23,620  -->  00:00:27,660
Okay in this video we're gonna be working
in the attacker's spawner script and
9

9

00:00:27,660  -->  00:00:29,240
pretty much no other scripts.
10

10

00:00:29,240  -->  00:00:33,540
And what I would like you to do
is a challenge for this video.
11

11

00:00:33,540  -->  00:00:37,180
So it's gonna be a little bit trickier,
but it's gonna be a good test for
12

12

00:00:37,180  -->  00:00:39,680
how well you understand arrays.
13

13

00:00:39,680  -->  00:00:44,080
And I'll give you the step for it here,
we wanna spawn attackers from array.
14

14

00:00:44,080  -->  00:00:46,640
First of all, so I'll give you
some detailed instructions and
15

15

00:00:46,640  -->  00:00:47,400
then see how you go.
16

16

00:00:47,400  -->  00:00:51,040
So change our Attacker variable
to Attacker [ ] array and
17

17

00:00:51,040  -->  00:00:52,450
rename appropriately.
18

18

00:00:52,450  -->  00:00:55,820
So just to anchor you for
what I'm talking about here, we have our
19

19

00:00:55,820  -->  00:01:00,510
serialized field attackerPrefab
as type Attacker at the top.
20

20

00:01:00,510  -->  00:01:04,370
That's what I'm talking about there,
and then to extract.
21

21

00:01:04,370  -->  00:01:08,200
So to take out where we
instantiate an Attacker[ ] and
22

22

00:01:08,200  -->  00:01:11,040
put that into a new method called Spawn().
23

23

00:01:11,040  -->  00:01:15,982
So find where we instantiate, put that
into a new method called Spawn(), and
24

24

00:01:15,982  -->  00:01:18,566
then make or change SpawnAttacker(),
25

25

00:01:18,566  -->  00:01:22,790
which is what we have in here currently,
SpawnAttacker().
26

26

00:01:22,790  -->  00:01:27,600
So to change that so it is responsible for
randomly picking an attacker
27

27

00:01:27,600  -->  00:01:32,590
index from the array and
calling Spawn() using that index.
28

28

00:01:32,590  -->  00:01:36,560
And hopefully that's enough for you to
use to jump in, take on this challenge.
29

29

00:01:36,560  -->  00:01:38,950
So give it your best shot and
I'll see you back here when you're done.
30

30

00:01:41,326  -->  00:01:46,440
Okay, so right up the top of our Attack
Spawner script, the Attacker Spawner.
31

31

00:01:46,440  -->  00:01:52,500
I'll change my Attacker into, I'll add my
square brackets, double-click, Ctrl+RR,
32

32

00:01:52,500  -->  00:01:57,630
I will change this to attackerPrefabArray,
and hit Apply.
33

33

00:01:57,630  -->  00:02:01,150
Now, that's gonna break some things
down here because we're trying to
34

34

00:02:01,150  -->  00:02:03,910
spawn from an array, but
we're not telling it where from the array.
35

35

00:02:03,910  -->  00:02:05,850
So we'll get to that in a moment,
first of all,
36

36

00:02:05,850  -->  00:02:08,170
I'm going to create my
method that I'll call.
37

37

00:02:08,170  -->  00:02:11,432
I'll delete my update method that's
hanging out down at the bottom down here,
38

38

00:02:11,432  -->  00:02:12,026
first of all.
39

39

00:02:12,026  -->  00:02:15,816
So I'll create a new method I'll
call private void Spawn, and
40

40

00:02:15,816  -->  00:02:20,260
then within here I need to know what
I'm spawning, or who I'm spawning.
41

41

00:02:20,260  -->  00:02:25,480
So I'll create a requirement of
a parameter that is an Attacker, and
42

42

00:02:25,480  -->  00:02:27,200
I'll call this myAttacker.
43

43

00:02:28,950  -->  00:02:31,924
And then within this method,
we're going to go in and
44

44

00:02:31,924  -->  00:02:36,830
grab our Attacker newAttacker Instantiate
etc., Cut that, Paste it down into here.
45

45

00:02:38,040  -->  00:02:41,360
Okay, still a bit of tidying up to do,
we'll get to that in a moment.
46

46

00:02:41,360  -->  00:02:45,683
Within SpawnAttacker, what are we doing
now, well let's create our index.
47

47

00:02:45,683  -->  00:02:50,821
So variables so var attackerIndex =,
48

48

00:02:50,821  -->  00:02:58,150
this is the random part,
Random.Range, there we go.
49

49

00:02:58,150  -->  00:03:04,062
And that will be from between what,
zero to the length of our array,
50

50

00:03:04,062  -->  00:03:08,107
and the length of the array
we can find by saying
51

51

00:03:08,107  -->  00:03:12,189
attackerPrefabArray., what, .length.
52

52

00:03:14,358  -->  00:03:18,274
Okay, so we've got our index,
it's gonna be somewhere between zero and
53

53

00:03:18,274  -->  00:03:20,630
how of the many attackers we've got.
54

54

00:03:20,630  -->  00:03:23,332
And then we want to call
our Spawn() method.
55

55

00:03:23,332  -->  00:03:28,710
Spawn(), and what are we spawning in here,
well we need to be spawning,
56

56

00:03:28,710  -->  00:03:32,225
its requiring we've just
created that we feed into it,
57

57

00:03:32,225  -->  00:03:34,880
who the attacker is and
the attacker is going to be who?
58

58

00:03:34,880  -->  00:03:40,560
It's going to be from our
attackerPrefabArray, then it's going to be
59

59

00:03:40,560  -->  00:03:46,950
an index within that, so,
attackerIndex, and then semicolon.
60

60

00:03:46,950  -->  00:03:50,260
Okay, so just to be clear on here, we've
said, an index somewhere between 0 and
61

61

00:03:50,260  -->  00:03:51,250
length of the array.
62

62

00:03:51,250  -->  00:03:54,160
And then let's spawn one
of those particular things,
63

63

00:03:54,160  -->  00:03:58,470
one of the attackers that we've just
gone and identified within our array.
64

64

00:03:58,470  -->  00:04:02,760
Now, when we come down to Attacker,
Attacker = Instantitate,
65

65

00:04:02,760  -->  00:04:06,040
attackerPrefabArray, instead
of attackerPrefabArray,
66

66

00:04:06,040  -->  00:04:07,550
what are we going to do in here?
67

67

00:04:07,550  -->  00:04:09,900
We're going to spawn myAttacker,
68

68

00:04:10,990  -->  00:04:14,500
which is what we've just passed
in from our SpawnAttacker().
69

69

00:04:14,500  -->  00:04:17,490
Okay, hopefully that all makes sense,
as always, if you've got any questions,
70

70

00:04:17,490  -->  00:04:19,000
throw them in the discussions.
71

71

00:04:19,000  -->  00:04:23,590
Let's save that up and see what we now
see when we click on our Spawners.
72

72

00:04:23,590  -->  00:04:28,140
That should update too, in a moment once
it's done thinking, should update to say
73

73

00:04:28,140  -->  00:04:33,010
okay, I've got an attackerPrefabArray
in here, currently the size is zero.
74

74

00:04:33,010  -->  00:04:38,760
And remember if we drag in our prefabs,
it will automatically update the size.
75

75

00:04:38,760  -->  00:04:42,328
So let's go and create let's just go and
find our attackers,
76

76

00:04:42,328  -->  00:04:46,710
click on Spawner(1),
highlight fox and lizard.
77

77

00:04:46,710  -->  00:04:50,560
Okay, I'm gonna have to click on
Spawner(1) and then click the Lock icon.
78

78

00:04:50,560  -->  00:04:56,480
Now if I click on fox and lizard, drag
those over the top of attackerPrefabArray,
79

79

00:04:56,480  -->  00:05:01,070
it makes the size of my array two and
puts in fox and lizard.
80

80

00:05:01,070  -->  00:05:05,830
If I, what spawn was that for, Spawner(1),
right, so if I unclick my lock,
81

81

00:05:05,830  -->  00:05:09,190
click on Play, Spawner(1) is
the spawner down on the bottom.
82

82

00:05:09,190  -->  00:05:10,460
Let's see what happens there.
83

83

00:05:10,460  -->  00:05:13,730
Ignore these top two,
I'm gonna just go to Scene View so
84

84

00:05:13,730  -->  00:05:16,320
you can see the moment they spawn.
85

85

00:05:16,320  -->  00:05:21,320
So a lizard came out after two to five
seconds, a fox came out, after two
86

86

00:05:21,320  -->  00:05:26,240
to five seconds, something came out,
the overactive gnome killed too quickly.
87

87

00:05:26,240  -->  00:05:28,680
Let's put our numbers down to one and
to one, so
88

88

00:05:28,680  -->  00:05:30,580
they're being produced very quickly.
89

89

00:05:30,580  -->  00:05:33,330
Now let's click on Play, I just wanna
check that it's producing sometimes
90

90

00:05:33,330  -->  00:05:35,760
lizard, sometimes fox, and
that there's a randomness.
91

91

00:05:35,760  -->  00:05:42,750
So lizard, fox, fox, fox, lizard,
okay, so now we've got this
92

92

00:05:42,750  -->  00:05:47,400
variability where it's not just always one
particular creature coming out of a lane.
93

93

00:05:47,400  -->  00:05:48,510
Now we could still keep that,
94

94

00:05:48,510  -->  00:05:53,450
I could say, Spawner(5),
I want to have as just lizards.
95

95

00:05:53,450  -->  00:05:55,702
So the top row is gonna be lizards.
96

96

00:05:55,702  -->  00:05:59,850
Once the player has played this level for
a little while, they realize, uh-huh,
97

97

00:05:59,850  -->  00:06:01,522
it's always lizards at the top.
98

98

00:06:01,522  -->  00:06:03,354
I can have strategy in my top lane.
99

99

00:06:03,354  -->  00:06:08,830
Spawner(4) we might say
that is always foxes.
100

100

00:06:08,830  -->  00:06:13,285
So no point putting grave stones in this
lane, cuz there's foxes coming in there.
101

101

00:06:13,285  -->  00:06:18,578
And then Spawner(2) and (3),
I will say both fox and
102

102

00:06:18,578  -->  00:06:24,150
lizard, if I drag them both
over in there fox and lizard.
103

103

00:06:24,150  -->  00:06:26,590
Okay so let's just click Play and
make sure that all works.
104

104

00:06:26,590  -->  00:06:29,625
I've gone and got this bottom lane
spitting out dudes really fast.
105

105

00:06:29,625  -->  00:06:34,500
The top four lines not as fast,
we've got variability, awesome.
106

106

00:06:34,500  -->  00:06:37,670
Okay so, it is not,
we haven't created with our game design,
107

107

00:06:37,670  -->  00:06:39,110
precision, at the moment.
108

108

00:06:39,110  -->  00:06:42,250
We haven't said it is exactly gonna be
a lizard and then three seconds later,
109

109

00:06:42,250  -->  00:06:43,350
exactly a fox.
110

110

00:06:43,350  -->  00:06:46,630
And then three seconds later exactly
another fox, and then five second exactly
111

111

00:06:46,630  -->  00:06:49,960
a lizard, its not that sort of
mechanic that we've created here.
112

112

00:06:49,960  -->  00:06:53,520
We've created randomness and
variability, which I think makes for
113

113

00:06:53,520  -->  00:06:56,463
great replay value and
keeps the player on their toes.
114

114

00:06:56,463  -->  00:06:59,213
But we do have enough control,
where like in the top lane,
115

115

00:06:59,213  -->  00:07:02,383
we can say, from a strategy point of view.
116

116

00:07:02,383  -->  00:07:07,293
Let's push out just one type here in one
type there and randomness down the bottom.
117

117

00:07:07,293  -->  00:07:09,433
Okay, so great work, and
I'll see you in the next video.
