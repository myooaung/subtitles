2

00:00:04,247  -->  00:00:06,250
Welcome to the next section of the course.
3

3

00:00:06,250  -->  00:00:07,900
This is Number Wizard UI, and
4

4

00:00:07,900  -->  00:00:11,794
we're taking the code base that we
created in Number Wizard Console,
5

5

00:00:11,794  -->  00:00:15,229
remember where we were having
a guess of higher or is it lower?
6

6

00:00:15,229  -->  00:00:18,766
And printing that out to the console,
we're gonna take that code base and
7

7

00:00:18,766  -->  00:00:21,621
we're gonna implement
an interactive user interface, so
8

8

00:00:21,621  -->  00:00:25,270
that we can click buttons and
determine what happens within the game.
9

9

00:00:25,270  -->  00:00:28,880
So this is going to mean getting
a little bit deeper into the UI canvas,
10

10

00:00:28,880  -->  00:00:33,520
talking about anchoring, how we anchor out
elements using text, using buttons and
11

11

00:00:33,520  -->  00:00:36,240
using images to make our game interesting.
12

12

00:00:36,240  -->  00:00:40,880
Where in terms of the buttons, we will
link up our button functionality with our
13

13

00:00:40,880  -->  00:00:44,680
code functionality, so
that we can have a public method
14

14

00:00:44,680  -->  00:00:48,700
within our script that we can
call when the button is pushed.
15

15

00:00:48,700  -->  00:00:52,850
So we've talked previously about
calling a method from another script.
16

16

00:00:52,850  -->  00:00:56,723
Now, we're gonna call a method from
a button push, which is really cool.
17

17

00:00:56,723  -->  00:00:59,291
Getting our fundamental
is really taking shape,
18

18

00:00:59,291  -->  00:01:03,410
with one of this that we're up to in
terms of our game development journey.
19

19

00:01:03,410  -->  00:01:08,300
We're going to be looking as well in a lot
of detail about scenes and scene loading.
20

20

00:01:08,300  -->  00:01:10,790
Again, this is a foundation
that we're gonna build upon
21

21

00:01:10,790  -->  00:01:12,420
in the later sections of the course.
22

22

00:01:12,420  -->  00:01:16,410
The first scene we'll have will be the
welcome to the game, what is your guess?
23

23

00:01:16,410  -->  00:01:19,530
The next scene will be the main
part of the game, which is,
24

24

00:01:19,530  -->  00:01:21,210
is it higher, is it lower?
25

25

00:01:21,210  -->  00:01:23,805
That's where we're doing all
the guess functionality.
26

26

00:01:23,805  -->  00:01:26,390
If you click on this,
you've got a correct button,
27

27

00:01:26,390  -->  00:01:29,520
then that will load up the third scene,
which will be a well done,
28

28

00:01:29,520  -->  00:01:32,370
congratulations, game over,
would you like to play again scene.
29

29

00:01:32,370  -->  00:01:36,470
So we'll be having those scenes that
we load and we progress through,
30

30

00:01:36,470  -->  00:01:38,030
working through that functionality.
31

31

00:01:38,030  -->  00:01:42,360
As well as getting our buttons hooked up
and creating a game that someone can click
32

32

00:01:42,360  -->  00:01:46,445
and play and go through the whole game
flow, the whole game loop of the game.
33

33

00:01:46,445  -->  00:01:49,425
Okay, so in the next video we're gonna
talk a little bit about the game design
34

34

00:01:49,425  -->  00:01:52,585
to make sure that we're super clear on
exactly what it is that we're creating.
35

35

00:01:52,585  -->  00:01:54,385
And then after that,
we're gonna be diving in and
36

36

00:01:54,385  -->  00:01:56,815
creating the functionality
of Number Wizard.
37

37

00:01:56,815  -->  00:01:58,535
So let's jump in and get started.
