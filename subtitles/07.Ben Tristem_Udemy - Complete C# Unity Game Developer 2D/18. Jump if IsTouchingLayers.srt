[MUSIC]
2

2

00:00:04,081  -->  00:00:07,461
You will have spotted the problem we have
in our game at the moment that I jump,
3

3

00:00:07,461  -->  00:00:09,697
that our player can jump,
and jump, and jump, and
4

4

00:00:09,697  -->  00:00:12,885
go flailing way off into the screen,
and then return again eventually.
5

5

00:00:12,885  -->  00:00:18,063
In this video, we're gonna resolve that
by having that the player can only jump
6

6

00:00:18,063  -->  00:00:23,270
when he is touching the ground, when
he's touching this foreground tilemap.
7

7

00:00:23,270  -->  00:00:25,670
The way we're gonna do
that is using layers.
8

8

00:00:25,670  -->  00:00:28,400
So up here in layers,
we kinda have everything on default,
9

9

00:00:28,400  -->  00:00:32,631
but we're gonna do that by setting up
a different layer for the foreground.
10

10

00:00:32,631  -->  00:00:33,690
Just a little bit on that,
11

11

00:00:33,690  -->  00:00:38,680
layers are useful if we have the same
functionality across multiple GameObjects.
12

12

00:00:38,680  -->  00:00:41,820
For example, you see this a lot when you
want to have a whole bunch of things
13

13

00:00:41,820  -->  00:00:43,400
ignored by the camera.
14

14

00:00:43,400  -->  00:00:47,530
So in other words, not displayed on the
screen, or you wanna have them clickable,
15

15

00:00:47,530  -->  00:00:49,777
or, as we're doing, as a collision check.
16

16

00:00:49,777  -->  00:00:53,718
So if we go into our foreground
tilemap here and change the layer,
17

17

00:00:53,718  -->  00:00:58,805
we can scroll down to Add Layer, and we've
already had a look at the sorting layers,
18

18

00:00:58,805  -->  00:01:03,124
which is to show what is displayed
first and second on top of each other.
19

19

00:01:03,124  -->  00:01:07,493
And then we go to User Layer 8,
and add in here Ground, so
20

20

00:01:07,493  -->  00:01:11,240
we now have this option
of a layer called Ground.
21

21

00:01:11,240  -->  00:01:15,630
Go back to Foreground,
and change that to Ground.
22

22

00:01:15,630  -->  00:01:20,770
So now, anything on this layer has
been designated as layer, Ground.
23

23

00:01:20,770  -->  00:01:22,620
Why do we have layers and tags?
24

24

00:01:22,620  -->  00:01:25,850
Well, it's just an extra layer
of organization, pardon the pun.
25

25

00:01:25,850  -->  00:01:28,940
It's an extra step of organization, so
26

26

00:01:28,940  -->  00:01:30,710
that we can have a whole
bunch of things on ground.
27

27

00:01:30,710  -->  00:01:34,000
And then,
also if we wanted to tag particular things
28

28

00:01:34,000  -->  00:01:37,570
that are within ground or
on different layers, but
29

29

00:01:37,570  -->  00:01:40,620
we still wanted to access them
then we can use tags as well.
30

30

00:01:40,620  -->  00:01:44,188
In this section we're not touching tags at
all, we're just having a look at layers.
31

31

00:01:44,188  -->  00:01:48,010
An illustrated common use of layers, if we
click on the main camera, you can see here
32

32

00:01:48,010  -->  00:01:53,340
a culling mask, where we say it's
currently saying everything is visible.
33

33

00:01:53,340  -->  00:01:58,060
If we click off, so if we turn off ground,
then in our camera here, or
34

34

00:01:58,060  -->  00:02:03,150
if I click play, we can see that
the mask has been applied to ground and
35

35

00:02:03,150  -->  00:02:04,380
we can't see the ground.
36

36

00:02:04,380  -->  00:02:07,895
That's why we can access that in code and
turn things on and off.
37

37

00:02:07,895  -->  00:02:10,600
Hollistically, this entire
layer we can turn on and
38

38

00:02:10,600  -->  00:02:13,230
off if that was something that
was useful for our gameplay.
39

39

00:02:13,230  -->  00:02:16,300
Let's go back and undo that,
turn the ground back on so
40

40

00:02:16,300  -->  00:02:18,530
we can see it in our camera preview there.
41

41

00:02:18,530  -->  00:02:21,360
The way we're gonna do
this is to stop jumping
42

42

00:02:21,360  -->  00:02:25,530
anytime by using
Collider2D.IsTouchingLayers.
43

43

00:02:25,530  -->  00:02:28,840
I've given you, in the resources,
a couple of docs to have a look at.
44

44

00:02:28,840  -->  00:02:33,430
They're not super detailed but
first one is Collider2D.isTouchingLayers.
45

45

00:02:33,430  -->  00:02:38,050
This will return true or false whether
the collider is touching any collider
46

46

00:02:38,050  -->  00:02:41,550
on the specified layermask or not.
47

47

00:02:41,550  -->  00:02:43,310
What do we mean by the layermask?
48

48

00:02:43,310  -->  00:02:46,960
Well, within here,
within Collider2D.IsTouchingLayers,
49

49

00:02:46,960  -->  00:02:50,160
we pass in LayerMask.GetMask.
50

50

00:02:50,160  -->  00:02:55,110
So goes in, gets a mask or
gets the mask for the particular layer or
51

51

00:02:55,110  -->  00:02:57,540
layers that we're interested in.
52

52

00:02:57,540  -->  00:03:02,180
And in our instance, the layer or
layers, just a layer
53

53

00:03:02,180  -->  00:03:06,060
at this point is the, if we've got
a foreground, is the ground layer.
54

54

00:03:06,060  -->  00:03:10,550
And all of the logic for
using the GetMask approach for using this
55

55

00:03:12,010  -->  00:03:16,540
over here, for using Layermask.GetMask,
is this is a very performant way of doing
56

56

00:03:16,540  -->  00:03:20,750
this collision check across all of
these different assets that we've got.
57

57

00:03:20,750  -->  00:03:22,509
So it brings us to a challenge, and
58

58

00:03:22,509  -->  00:03:25,193
the challenge is stop your
player multi-jumping.
59

59

00:03:25,193  -->  00:03:28,660
Finish the logic to stop
your player multi-jumping.
60

60

00:03:28,660  -->  00:03:31,065
You will need to use,
and here are the clues.
61

61

00:03:31,065  -->  00:03:36,030
Collider2D.IsTouchingLayers, and
you guessed it LayerMask.GetMask and
62

62

00:03:36,030  -->  00:03:39,550
you need to feed in the layer
that we've been talking about.
63

63

00:03:39,550  -->  00:03:42,220
You need to pass that
into LayerMask.GetMask.
64

64

00:03:42,220  -->  00:03:44,090
Also you'll need to use an if statement.
65

65

00:03:44,090  -->  00:03:47,380
You'll need to be in the player.cs script.
66

66

00:03:47,380  -->  00:03:49,430
That should be enough clues to go on for
now.
67

67

00:03:49,430  -->  00:03:51,480
If you're not sure about that, no problem.
68

68

00:03:51,480  -->  00:03:52,256
I'll see you in a moment.
69

69

00:03:54,260  -->  00:03:55,360
Okay, welcome back.
70

70

00:03:55,360  -->  00:03:58,410
We're gonna jump over
into our player script.
71

71

00:03:58,410  -->  00:04:02,620
First of all, I need to create
a reference to Collider2D.
72

72

00:04:02,620  -->  00:04:06,620
I'm gonna call this myCollider,
could call it myCollider2D.
73

73

00:04:06,620  -->  00:04:09,990
Yeah, why not?, myCollider2D.
74

74

00:04:09,990  -->  00:04:17,315
And then, next we need to get that
component, so myCollider2D = GetComponent.
75

75

00:04:17,315  -->  00:04:23,363
And now use of type Collider2D,
not at sign 2D but just plain old 2D.
76

76

00:04:25,361  -->  00:04:27,750
Okay, that looks pretty spiffy there.
77

77

00:04:27,750  -->  00:04:31,070
And then down to the one line
that I was mentioning before,
78

78

00:04:31,070  -->  00:04:31,920
where do we need to put that?
79

79

00:04:31,920  -->  00:04:35,060
Well we need to put it into Jump,
cuz Jump is the time when we're saying,
80

80

00:04:35,060  -->  00:04:36,410
should this or should this not happen.
81

81

00:04:36,410  -->  00:04:40,070
We're looking for an if statement in here,
if what's happening.
82

82

00:04:40,070  -->  00:04:45,050
Or first of all, it's good for
us to say, if, the condition is not met,
83

83

00:04:45,050  -->  00:04:47,280
then don't let the player jump.
84

84

00:04:47,280  -->  00:04:50,350
So rather than saying if
the condition is met, then jump.
85

85

00:04:50,350  -->  00:04:54,450
Otherwise, don't let the player jump,
it reads a lot neater and is a lot more
86

86

00:04:54,450  -->  00:04:58,030
effective if we say right at the start,
if a particular thing is not happening.
87

87

00:04:58,030  -->  00:04:59,220
So what's not happening?
88

88

00:04:59,220  -->  00:05:03,081
My collider 2D is touching layers.
89

89

00:05:04,490  -->  00:05:11,390
And then we need to pass into
that LayerMask.GetMask().
90

90

00:05:11,390  -->  00:05:13,140
Then what is our layer called?
91

91

00:05:13,140  -->  00:05:17,030
Well, because we are good units,
we're going to jump over here,
92

92

00:05:17,030  -->  00:05:23,390
go over into our Add Layer, double-click,
Copy, so get it 1000% correct.
93

93

00:05:23,390  -->  00:05:28,250
Pasting ground and then, that saying,
if we are not colliding,
94

94

00:05:28,250  -->  00:05:30,660
then what would we wanna do,
well we want to return.
95

95

00:05:30,660  -->  00:05:31,880
We can do that one of two ways.
96

96

00:05:31,880  -->  00:05:35,230
We can do it the longer way and
say, return.
97

97

00:05:35,230  -->  00:05:37,440
Or to make the whole thing
a little bit neater,
98

98

00:05:37,440  -->  00:05:42,130
we can put this all on one line instead
of maximize our readability here.
99

99

00:05:42,130  -->  00:05:44,190
We have return on the same line.
100

100

00:05:46,110  -->  00:05:51,290
Okay, so if we are not colliding with
ground then allow the player to jump.
101

101

00:05:51,290  -->  00:05:52,800
Let's save that.
102

102

00:05:52,800  -->  00:05:54,820
Hop back over into our scene.
103

103

00:05:55,960  -->  00:05:57,730
Okay, let's mash the space bar.
104

104

00:05:57,730  -->  00:05:59,840
Okay, and the player is only jumping once.
105

105

00:05:59,840  -->  00:06:04,260
Which was our design, just a single jump,
when the player is touching the ground.
106

106

00:06:04,260  -->  00:06:04,800
Great work.
So
107

107

00:06:04,800  -->  00:06:07,010
you've set up single jumping in your game.
108

108

00:06:07,010  -->  00:06:09,940
You've implemented layers,
added it to your foreground.
109

109

00:06:09,940  -->  00:06:13,810
So that we've got a content of a ground
layer that the play can only jump
110

110

00:06:13,810  -->  00:06:18,020
if they are touching layers, is touching
layers, you've implemented as well as
111

111

00:06:18,020  -->  00:06:23,610
the GetMask approach for saying if
the player is touching that ground layer.
112

112

00:06:23,610  -->  00:06:25,580
So we're done,
I will see you in the next video.
