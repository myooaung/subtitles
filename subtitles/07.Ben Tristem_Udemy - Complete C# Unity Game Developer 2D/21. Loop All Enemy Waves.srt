2

00:00:04,057  -->  00:00:07,895
In this video, we're gonna give ourselves
a way to have our waves loop over, and
3

3

00:00:07,895  -->  00:00:08,751
over, and over.
4

4

00:00:08,751  -->  00:00:12,232
So even if you have only two ways,
and I'm gonna change my to two here,
5

5

00:00:12,232  -->  00:00:16,362
it just goes wave one, wave two, wave one,
wave two, over, and over, and over so
6

6

00:00:16,362  -->  00:00:17,552
that our game can loop.
7

7

00:00:17,552  -->  00:00:21,841
So we'll hop over into EnemeySpawner.cs,
create ourselves a variable.
8

8

00:00:21,841  -->  00:00:24,377
So we'll serialize this, so
it's available in the inspector.
9

9

00:00:24,377  -->  00:00:28,019
We're making a bool, so it's either gonna
be either true or it's gonna be false and
10

10

00:00:28,019  -->  00:00:29,113
we'll call it looping.
11

11

00:00:29,113  -->  00:00:33,839
So I have a bool called looping,
which we will initialize as false.
12

12

00:00:33,839  -->  00:00:37,951
So bool looping = false;.
13

13

00:00:37,951  -->  00:00:41,889
And then within our start method
here's something really cool.
14

14

00:00:41,889  -->  00:00:48,389
We're we can say we can change the type
of return value for our start method.
15

15

00:00:48,389  -->  00:00:53,972
So that when the engine calls start, it is
doing something a little bit different,
16

16

00:00:53,972  -->  00:00:56,364
we can change it to an IEnumerator,
17

17

00:00:56,364  -->  00:01:00,696
so that we make our start a code routine,
which is really nifty.
18

18

00:01:00,696  -->  00:01:02,520
And then within our StartCoroutine,
19

19

00:01:02,520  -->  00:01:04,803
just gonna put my curly
braces down a line here.
20

20

00:01:04,803  -->  00:01:09,553
So within our StartCoroutine
we can create a do while loop,
21

21

00:01:09,553  -->  00:01:14,686
which basically means it goes over and
over and over at do while.
22

22

00:01:14,686  -->  00:01:17,028
And we'll make it while looping is true.
23

23

00:01:17,028  -->  00:01:21,391
So we'll give ourselves a little bit
of room here and start by typing do.
24

24

00:01:21,391  -->  00:01:24,897
And then give ourselves a code
block in here of curly braces.
25

25

00:01:24,897  -->  00:01:29,763
We're going to change our stock
StockCoroutines inot our yield conditions.
26

26

00:01:29,763  -->  00:01:36,001
So yield return
StartCoroutine SpawnAllWaves.
27

27

00:01:36,001  -->  00:01:38,399
So this now becomes the yield condition.
28

28

00:01:38,399  -->  00:01:43,581
Once we get into the do while loop, we're
saying do a thing, go, go, go, go, go.
29

29

00:01:43,581  -->  00:01:45,941
And then,
once it's finished doing all this,
30

30

00:01:45,941  -->  00:01:48,777
the yield will then return
back within our start method.
31

31

00:01:48,777  -->  00:01:55,245
And we can say, close our, curly braces
here, so we've got our yield condition.
32

32

00:01:55,245  -->  00:01:58,007
And then we can say, While (looping).
33

33

00:01:58,007  -->  00:02:00,625
And this is another way of saying
While (looping) equals true.
34

34

00:02:00,625  -->  00:02:03,160
We can say while, and
then in brackets, looping.
35

35

00:02:03,160  -->  00:02:07,103
So what we're doing here is saying when
the engine call start, do this thing,
36

36

00:02:07,103  -->  00:02:08,439
start the co-routines.
37

37

00:02:08,439  -->  00:02:10,767
This is a series co-routine.
38

38

00:02:10,767  -->  00:02:12,283
And we are gonna yield.
39

39

00:02:12,283  -->  00:02:13,917
So come back to start and
40

40

00:02:13,917  -->  00:02:18,994
continue with whatever is after this
statement once this has completed.
41

41

00:02:18,994  -->  00:02:20,947
So once this completed, we come back here.
42

42

00:02:20,947  -->  00:02:22,260
We see the while.
43

43

00:02:22,260  -->  00:02:25,717
If looping is true,
then it jumps back up to the do and
44

44

00:02:25,717  -->  00:02:27,771
it starts this all over again.
45

45

00:02:27,771  -->  00:02:31,611
And because it started as part of the
yield, then it waits until it's finished,
46

46

00:02:31,611  -->  00:02:33,146
then it comes back to the while.
47

47

00:02:33,146  -->  00:02:34,660
So this is a really neat loop and
48

48

00:02:34,660  -->  00:02:38,915
a really neat way of saying we can do this
particular thing here, this SpawnAllWaves,
49

49

00:02:38,915  -->  00:02:42,146
we can do it over, and over, and
over, so we can loop it in there.
50

50

00:02:42,146  -->  00:02:45,336
So we'll save this up and hop over
into Unity, check that it all worked.
51

51

00:02:45,336  -->  00:02:47,912
The first thing we need to
do is click On for Looping.
52

52

00:02:47,912  -->  00:02:51,350
So let's check it without looping on, and
make sure it's working as we're expecting.
53

53

00:02:51,350  -->  00:02:53,907
You might wanna stop at the end
of a number of waves, and
54

54

00:02:53,907  -->  00:02:57,314
then the player can go on to another
level, so you don't want it to loop.
55

55

00:02:57,314  -->  00:02:59,045
Okay, that's it without looping.
56

56

00:02:59,045  -->  00:03:01,973
We'll click Looping On, click on Play, and
57

57

00:03:01,973  -->  00:03:05,064
we should see these waves looped over and
over.
58

58

00:03:05,064  -->  00:03:09,186
Okay, once, twice, okay, so you can see,
they just keep getting spawned,
59

59

00:03:09,186  -->  00:03:10,691
and spawned, and spawned.
60

60

00:03:10,691  -->  00:03:13,940
And so you can imagine, this is a game,
if we're spawning all these waves, and
61

61

00:03:13,940  -->  00:03:15,249
the game is just going on and on,
62

62

00:03:15,249  -->  00:03:17,893
you don't have to have to have
created 300 different waves.
63

63

00:03:17,893  -->  00:03:22,411
You can create a certain number 10 or
20 or 30 and the game will go on and
64

64

00:03:22,411  -->  00:03:23,219
on forever.
65

65

00:03:23,219  -->  00:03:27,395
And if you make your enemies engaging,
if you make your waves interesting and
66

66

00:03:27,395  -->  00:03:30,992
all that kind of good stuff then
the player is gonna feel like this is
67

67

00:03:30,992  -->  00:03:33,642
a pretty awesome game to play for
a bunch of time.
68

68

00:03:33,642  -->  00:03:37,587
Okay, so it's just a quick
lecture on the do while loop and
69

69

00:03:37,587  -->  00:03:42,335
how we have used that within our
co-routine and how we have changed our
70

70

00:03:42,335  -->  00:03:47,188
Start method to be an IEnumerator so
that we can use it as a co-routine.
71

71

00:03:47,188  -->  00:03:50,803
Great work, well done, I'm sure you're
game is shaping up really nicely.
72

72

00:03:50,803  -->  00:03:53,558
I look forward you seeing your
sharing in the community.
73

73

00:03:53,558  -->  00:03:56,390
If you've got something neat that
you're enjoying with your waves,
74

74

00:03:56,390  -->  00:03:59,230
then please do share it with us, and
I'll see you in the next lecture.
