2

00:00:04.214  -->  00:00:04.720
Hello, again.
3

3

00:00:04.720  -->  00:00:08.650
In this video, we're gonna be using
animation events to control the problem we
4

4

00:00:08.650  -->  00:00:11.360
had of the lizard walking at one speed,
5

5

00:00:11.360  -->  00:00:15.160
even when they're supposed to be jumping
and now sliding across the screen, and
6

6

00:00:15.160  -->  00:00:20.160
having a little bit of fun to add more
depth to our control over our animation.
7

7

00:00:20.160  -->  00:00:23.530
So let's jump in and get started.
8

8

00:00:23.530  -->  00:00:26.670
Okay, what are animation events,
and where do we find them?
9

9

00:00:26.670  -->  00:00:28.410
Let me show you a slide.
10

10

00:00:28.410  -->  00:00:31.250
And to add an event,
you see our animation window here,
11

11

00:00:31.250  -->  00:00:34.500
there's the little button
that's the Add event button.
12

12

00:00:34.500  -->  00:00:39.410
That will add an event on the timeline,
wherever your timeline
13

13

00:00:39.410  -->  00:00:44.520
slider bar thingy is, and
you can add a whole bunch of events.
14

14

00:00:44.520  -->  00:00:47.950
This will call a function that
we have in our script, so
15

15

00:00:47.950  -->  00:00:49.270
let's put this into practice.
16

16

00:00:49.270  -->  00:00:52.520
Let's jump over and find Lizard Walk.
17

17

00:00:52.520  -->  00:00:55.000
And from Lizard Walk,
I wanna find my timeline.
18

18

00:00:55.000  -->  00:00:59.040
Sometimes you need to click around a
little bit, I find, to jog it into place.
19

19

00:00:59.040  -->  00:01:00.300
Cool, we've got it there.
20

20

00:01:00.300  -->  00:01:02.950
Here is the event button,
I'll click on that.
21

21

00:01:02.950  -->  00:01:07.200
That's added an event right at the front
of my timeline cuz that's where my slider,
22

22

00:01:07.200  -->  00:01:08.340
what's this thing called?
23

23

00:01:08.340  -->  00:01:12.651
The timeline line indicator doobie
whatsit, I think is the technical.
24

24

00:01:12.651  -->  00:01:16.115
Go look that up in the Unity docs,
I think that's what you'll find,
25

25

00:01:16.115  -->  00:01:17.230
the doobie whatsit.
26

26

00:01:17.230  -->  00:01:18.970
Okay, so I've added one event here.
27

27

00:01:18.970  -->  00:01:21.750
If I click over in the Inspector,
you can see that we have Function,
28

28

00:01:21.750  -->  00:01:23.510
Float, Int, String, Object.
29

29

00:01:23.510  -->  00:01:26.220
This means that we can call a function
30

30

00:01:26.220  -->  00:01:28.550
that we need to have
somewhere in our script.
31

31

00:01:28.550  -->  00:01:32.700
And the way we've structured this is
when Lizard Walk, as an animation,
32

32

00:01:32.700  -->  00:01:36.648
is placed on a lizard, and we have our
lizard prefab that it's on at the moment.
33

33

00:01:36.648  -->  00:01:40.480
Then another class that is
also on that game object,
34

34

00:01:40.480  -->  00:01:43.950
also on Lizard, we will be able to call.
35

35

00:01:43.950  -->  00:01:50.450
So let's create a function here called
SetMovementSpeed, SetMovementSpeed.
36

36

00:01:50.450  -->  00:01:55.400
So on Lizard Walk, we want our lizard to,
let's be a little bit crazy here.
37

37

00:01:55.400  -->  00:02:00.080
We'll set this to 10,
just to make sure this is working.
38

38

00:02:00.080  -->  00:02:01.730
That should be fun and crazy.
39

39

00:02:01.730  -->  00:02:04.740
So the very instant the lizard is created,
it'll be 10.
40

40

00:02:04.740  -->  00:02:08.688
You know what, I'm gonna grab this and
drag it, cuz you can move it around.
41

41

00:02:08.688  -->  00:02:13.003
I'm gonna drag it into the middle of my
timeline so that we'll go along, go along,
42

42

00:02:13.003  -->  00:02:16.084
and then we get at this point [SOUND],
it's gonna go to 10,
43

43

00:02:16.084  -->  00:02:17.705
which will be super exciting.
44

44

00:02:17.705  -->  00:02:21.010
Okeydokey, so let's go and
open up our script.
45

45

00:02:21.010  -->  00:02:23.711
I will open up the Attacker script.
46

46

00:02:23.711  -->  00:02:25.404
And working on the Attacker script,
47

47

00:02:25.404  -->  00:02:29.300
what I'm gonna do first of all is change
this notion of a serialized walkSpeed.
48

48

00:02:29.300  -->  00:02:31.978
So we want more than walkSpeed,
we want our lizard, or
49

49

00:02:31.978  -->  00:02:35.822
whichever attacker we're referring to,
to have a notion of movement speed,
50

50

00:02:35.822  -->  00:02:38.030
whether that's the jump or the walk.
51

51

00:02:38.030  -->  00:02:41.585
We wanna have this movement speed so that
we can have different amounts of speed.
52

52

00:02:41.585  -->  00:02:43.590
So I'm gonna just get rid of that and
53

53

00:02:43.590  -->  00:02:47.580
change it to a float,
doesn't need to be serialized.
54

54

00:02:47.580  -->  00:02:48.910
What should we call this, my friends?
55

55

00:02:48.910  -->  00:02:51.080
Let's call it currentSpeed, so
56

56

00:02:51.080  -->  00:02:54.020
we're very clear that's
currently how fast we're going.
57

57

00:02:54.020  -->  00:02:56.950
We'll initialize it to 1f, okay.
58

58

00:02:56.950  -->  00:02:59.130
And you know what,
I'm not gonna need my Start for now,
59

59

00:02:59.130  -->  00:03:00.480
we'll bring it back if we need it.
60

60

00:03:00.480  -->  00:03:02.970
I don't need to know that updates
are called once per frame.
61

61

00:03:02.970  -->  00:03:04.770
I think we know that by now.
62

62

00:03:04.770  -->  00:03:05.755
Instead of walkSpeed,
63

63

00:03:05.755  -->  00:03:10.660
I'll change this to currentSpeed
in my method here on the update.
64

64

00:03:10.660  -->  00:03:12.480
We're saying, move with current speed.
65

65

00:03:12.480  -->  00:03:15.440
Now, this is where we need
to do a little bit of magic.
66

66

00:03:15.440  -->  00:03:20.241
We need to have our animation,
when it comes along, plays [SOUND].
67

67

00:03:20.241  -->  00:03:23.990
When it gets to this frame on this
animation, it is going to call,
68

68

00:03:23.990  -->  00:03:25.300
let's click on that.
69

69

00:03:25.300  -->  00:03:27.008
It's going to call what?
70

70

00:03:27.008  -->  00:03:28.790
It's gonna call SetMovementSpeed, so
71

71

00:03:28.790  -->  00:03:33.380
we need to create SetMovementSpeed
as a public function.
72

72

00:03:33.380  -->  00:03:36.220
This is where I have a challenge for you.
73

73

00:03:36.220  -->  00:03:41.207
I want you to create a public method
called SetMovementSpeed(), and
74

74

00:03:41.207  -->  00:03:45.370
we will require that method to
pass in a float called speed.
75

75

00:03:45.370  -->  00:03:49.890
So it'll have the parameter,
which is a float, what we'll call speed.
76

76

00:03:49.890  -->  00:03:50.970
So hopefully that makes sense,
77

77

00:03:50.970  -->  00:03:55.470
a little bit of rejogging your
memory here on how that works.
78

78

00:03:55.470  -->  00:03:58.780
So I need to pass in a float called speed,
and then I'd like for you to update
79

79

00:03:58.780  -->  00:04:05.080
the attacker's current speed so that it is
now the speed value that was passed in.
80

80

00:04:05.080  -->  00:04:08.760
So I'm gonna pass in speed from.
81

81

00:04:08.760  -->  00:04:10.280
Where are we passing from?
82

82

00:04:10.280  -->  00:04:12.590
From over in here,
from our animation event.
83

83

00:04:12.590  -->  00:04:16.300
And it's gonna be a float, and then we
want to, in our script, in our Attacker
84

84

00:04:16.300  -->  00:04:21.780
script, to then update the current speed
to be the speed that was just passed in.
85

85

00:04:21.780  -->  00:04:22.730
So hopefully that makes sense.
86

86

00:04:22.730  -->  00:04:25.280
If not, sit there and
then ponder it for a while,
87

87

00:04:25.280  -->  00:04:26.620
see if you can get your brain around it.
88

88

00:04:26.620  -->  00:04:28.701
Give it your best shot,
this is how you learn the best,
89

89

00:04:28.701  -->  00:04:29.939
is taking on these challenges.
90

90

00:04:29.939  -->  00:04:32.554
And I'll see you back in here
in a moment for the solution.
91

91

00:04:35.259  -->  00:04:36.920
Okay, how did you get along with that?
92

92

00:04:36.920  -->  00:04:38.640
I'm pretty sure that you nailed it.
93

93

00:04:38.640  -->  00:04:41.070
But just in case,
let's go through this together.
94

94

00:04:41.070  -->  00:04:43.980
Back into my script, what I need
to do is create a public method.
95

95

00:04:43.980  -->  00:04:47.876
So public, there's no return type,
so it's void,
96

96

00:04:47.876  -->  00:04:52.820
and we're calling this SetMovementSpeed,
and I just wanna flag.
97

97

00:04:52.820  -->  00:04:54.600
I'll probably say this a few times,
98

98

00:04:54.600  -->  00:04:58.760
but we're referencing something that
is a string reference in essence.
99

99

00:04:58.760  -->  00:05:02.465
So if I was to go and
change the name of my method in here,
100

100

00:05:02.465  -->  00:05:06.425
it's not going to change the name that
we're seeing on our animation event, so
101

101

00:05:06.425  -->  00:05:09.525
it is a little bit of a clunky
approach for doing this.
102

102

00:05:09.525  -->  00:05:12.215
It's not perfect,
there are some shortfalls.
103

103

00:05:12.215  -->  00:05:15.455
But it gives us a gigantic amount of
104

104

00:05:15.455  -->  00:05:19.521
flexibility within our animation
to do super cool things.
105

105

00:05:19.521  -->  00:05:22.685
So I have SetMovementSpeed, probably
copy that and then paste it in here so
106

106

00:05:22.685  -->  00:05:23.775
we know we've got it right.
107

107

00:05:23.775  -->  00:05:26.300
And we need to pass in something,
so that'll be a float.
108

108

00:05:26.300  -->  00:05:27.762
And we'll call this speed.
109

109

00:05:27.762  -->  00:05:29.381
And then within our method,
110

110

00:05:29.381  -->  00:05:33.150
what do we want to do when
something calls SetMovementSpeed?
111

111

00:05:33.150  -->  00:05:37.570
Well, we need to change this currentSpeed
to be whatever has been passed in.
112

112

00:05:37.570  -->  00:05:43.820
So we can just say currentSpeed
is now assigned as speed.
113

113

00:05:43.820  -->  00:05:48.110
So if we go on passing 10, which we're
doing here, we're passing in 10,
114

114

00:05:48.110  -->  00:05:51.050
then we'll be multiplying
by 10 in the currentSpeed.
115

115

00:05:51.050  -->  00:05:53.203
Okay, that looks pretty sharp, I reckon.
116

116

00:05:53.203  -->  00:05:56.070
Save that, back over into Unity.
117

117

00:05:56.070  -->  00:06:01.751
Now, let's see what it's going to do,
click on Play Okay,
118

118

00:06:01.751  -->  00:06:04.732
our guy should jump, walk,
walk, walk, and then [SOUND].
119

119

00:06:04.732  -->  00:06:08.360
Takes off super fast when it gets to this
point where it's going 10, that's awesome.
120

120

00:06:08.360  -->  00:06:11.090
Now, just a little bit of playing around
here, having a little bit of fun.
121

121

00:06:11.090  -->  00:06:16.060
You could, at this point of your timeline,
say, walk normally, and then stop.
122

122

00:06:16.060  -->  00:06:20.332
And that is as simple as saying,
add a new animation event,
123

123

00:06:20.332  -->  00:06:24.097
find our name,
which we know is SetMovementSpeed.
124

124

00:06:24.097  -->  00:06:27.791
If you have any issues with this,
the first thing to do is make sure you're
125

125

00:06:27.791  -->  00:06:31.024
spelling it the same way there
as you're spelling over in here.
126

126

00:06:31.024  -->  00:06:34.187
And like I said, it's good to copy and
paste to make sure it's all good.
127

127

00:06:34.187  -->  00:06:36.260
I'm gonna set this at 0, Save.
128

128

00:06:36.260  -->  00:06:37.840
As simple as that, click on Play.
129

129

00:06:39.220  -->  00:06:41.360
Walk, walk, jump in first.
130

130

00:06:41.360  -->  00:06:45.691
Jump, boink, walk, walk, walk,
stop, and then [SOUND] take off.
131

131

00:06:45.691  -->  00:06:48.460
And then we could add another one
down here that stops it or starts it.
132

132

00:06:48.460  -->  00:06:52.330
So this is a great way to get tons of
control, not just over how your frames
133

133

00:06:52.330  -->  00:06:55.990
are playing with the animation, but also
the other things that you want your thing,
134

134

00:06:55.990  -->  00:06:57.740
your character, to be doing on screen.
135

135

00:06:57.740  -->  00:07:01.570
We could also get in here and
manipulate our frame.
136

136

00:07:01.570  -->  00:07:05.490
So I could stretch this out, and here,
if I wanted to have the character walk
137

137

00:07:05.490  -->  00:07:09.820
slowly, I grab that, I drag it, then
we can have our frames represent that.
138

138

00:07:09.820  -->  00:07:12.680
But I would need to grab our animation
event and move that back as well.
139

139

00:07:12.680  -->  00:07:16.580
So you can do a lot of monkeying around,
you can play around in here.
140

140

00:07:16.580  -->  00:07:19.440
Let's go and
implement our sensible solution now.
141

141

00:07:19.440  -->  00:07:22.700
So I'm going to shift this all
the way back to the start,
142

142

00:07:22.700  -->  00:07:26.340
if I can grab it properly, all the way
back to the start, delete this one.
143

143

00:07:26.340  -->  00:07:29.410
One more time, Rick,
learn how to use a mouse, would you?
144

144

00:07:29.410  -->  00:07:31.390
Okay, we're gonna set this to 1.
145

145

00:07:31.390  -->  00:07:34.460
That's the speed we want him to
be walking when he is walking.
146

146

00:07:34.460  -->  00:07:37.761
Find the other animation, which was,
a lot of the reason we were doing this
147

147

00:07:37.761  -->  00:07:41.990
is cuz when the character was jumping,
it was moving at one speed and sliding.
148

148

00:07:41.990  -->  00:07:44.500
So we add an animation
event at the start here.
149

149

00:07:44.500  -->  00:07:49.280
We paste in our SetMovementSpeed,
and change our float to 0,
150

150

00:07:49.280  -->  00:07:51.130
which it is already by default.
151

151

00:07:51.130  -->  00:07:52.330
That is excellent.
152

152

00:07:52.330  -->  00:07:54.750
Save that up, now see if this works.
153

153

00:07:54.750  -->  00:07:58.510
We want our character to jump,
not move, and then start walking.
154

154

00:07:58.510  -->  00:08:02.431
So jump, stationary, and
then start walking, awesome.
155

155

00:08:02.431  -->  00:08:06.756
And that is because, in our Animator,
we see that our character,
156

156

00:08:06.756  -->  00:08:10.090
where are you,
Animator Controller, here we go.
157

157

00:08:10.090  -->  00:08:12.610
We see that our Jump is first to happen.
158

158

00:08:12.610  -->  00:08:15.770
It's going at 0 speed, and
then we transition into Walk.
159

159

00:08:15.770  -->  00:08:20.302
And the very first frame of Walk, we are
telling it, through an animation event,
160

160

00:08:20.302  -->  00:08:25.140
where is my walk animation event,
we're telling it to move at speed of 1.
161

161

00:08:25.140  -->  00:08:28.330
Okay, cool, so
really super useful technique.
162

162

00:08:28.330  -->  00:08:30.610
This is something you can
use in fighting games, for
163

163

00:08:30.610  -->  00:08:33.100
example, if you wanna have
a character reaction.
164

164

00:08:33.100  -->  00:08:36.340
So right in the middle of
the frame is where they,
165

165

00:08:36.340  -->  00:08:40.140
it looks like they're punching the other
character, or punching the enemy,
166

166

00:08:40.140  -->  00:08:42.660
then that is the frame that
you can trigger the damage.
167

167

00:08:42.660  -->  00:08:44.990
So if you've got this big long swing,
168

168

00:08:44.990  -->  00:08:48.910
you're not having the code trying to
guess where the actual impact took place.
169

169

00:08:48.910  -->  00:08:53.520
You can do it right down to the exact
frame of this is exactly where the bullet
170

170

00:08:53.520  -->  00:08:57.370
strikes, or the punch hits,
or the character jumps.
171

171

00:08:57.370  -->  00:09:00.070
And you can be triggering all
manner of exciting things,
172

172

00:09:00.070  -->  00:09:03.510
sound effects, changes in variables, etc.
173

173

00:09:03.510  -->  00:09:08.130
So there it is, there's the technique
of using the animation event to
174

174

00:09:08.130  -->  00:09:10.060
add more depth to our animations.
175

175

00:09:10.060  -->  00:09:11.540
Great work, and
I'll see you in the next video.
