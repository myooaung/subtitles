00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.490
Hello again in this video are going to be creating some key frame animation to make our trophy bounce

2
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.690
flash let's jump and get started.

3
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:12.510
OK.

4
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.990
We're going to do is find our trophy and it's called Trophy heart.

5
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:23.680
In my assets in here it's going to drag for a fee cut into the sprite's folder from here right click

6
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.520
create folder which I will call trophy.

7
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.080
And then dreg if you cut into the double click on the photo look at trophy count you can see is just

8
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.240
a regular old image we need to cut that up.

9
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:42.380
So click on the Sprite mode from single to multiple and then apply.

10
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.230
From here we can click on the Sprite editor and have a look at it.

11
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.150
If we get a slice I think we can just click automatic and slice and it should be fine because as you

12
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.140
can see there is a gap between the two where we have this transparency.

13
00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.150
Then it will know what to do if you like yeah you know what I want to change it so I don't actually

14
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.550
have that.

15
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.550
They're all based sticky thing in there.

16
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.780
Then you can change it so this Sprite won't include that you can crop little bits out.

17
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.500
You can change the positioning of your glove to grab the blue handles here.

18
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.080
You can change exactly where this Sprite will be.

19
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.080
So let's do that let's do it all the way down to the end of this and have the trophy although the artwork

20
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.030
we received had a little kind of stem to it.

21
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.050
Let's have it with no state and see how that goes.

22
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.720
If I click on the bottom line you can see here are my two sprites that I've created.

23
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.900
Then click on a plie.

24
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.760
And then close out of that window.

25
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.450
Nice.

26
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.420
Next up we need to give ourselves a game.

27
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.690
Objects are right click create empty.

28
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.810
Call this trophy or is that the transformers we do.

29
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.660
And then if I double click on that it is way down in the bottom left which is the zero zero point now

30
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:48.970
because there's two parts.

31
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.520
There's the top part and the bottom part.

32
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.510
I'm going to have those as separate elements underneath my trophy separate children under the trophy

33
00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.080
game object.

34
00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.560
So first of all grab trophy.

35
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.310
Cut to zero on the top of trophy.

36
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.620
It will create that and it will add that as a child and also create a sprite renderer so that we can

37
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.330
see but we can't see it.

38
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.810
Why is that.

39
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.870
Well the order in layer will make this five the same as I've got my attackers that are coming in.

40
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.500
I get calls so we've got our image there now dragon trophy Cat 1 which is the base and I'll rename both

41
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.180
of these two.

42
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.310
Just top I think is good enough.

43
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.060
And then base it's all about the base.

44
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.690
There we go.

45
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.490
Now zoom in a little bit scroll.

46
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:37.300
In my base is not there because it has its bright red ribbon is still set to 0 put that to five okay

47
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.170
they're on top of each other.

48
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.270
It's in a good spot.

49
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.630
I'll grab the top and then with my movement key.

50
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.850
Just move it up there.

51
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.530
So I've made a little bit of a hodgepodge of these.

52
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.810
Right right right right right right.

53
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.800
In you can see there's that little bit of an edge there from where I cut off the Sprite.

54
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.660
I'll leave it for now if you want to.

55
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.020
You could go into an end in there and you could tidy that'll actually delete that little bit.

56
00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.610
But what we're doing at the moment I think if we're scroll here on the screen I'm probably not going

57
00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:02.200
to see it.

58
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.380
I just want to have that little base thing there I want it to look like this star was independent but

59
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.640
still part of the tree.

60
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:08.270
OK.

61
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.150
So we've got the top.

62
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.250
We've got the base.

63
00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.510
Next up we need to do some animation to make our animation work.

64
00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.600
I'm going to create an animator controller for the trophy.

65
00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.270
So clicking on the trophy actually not done in a cog on the trophy yet go into animations folder right

66
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.960
clicking here create an AM shown control.

67
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.010
Great we'll call this trophy.

68
00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:38.900
Now we could go on our trophy click add component add animator as the component but we can also do it

69
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:45.440
the one step slightly quicker way which is to grab our trophy animated controller dragon over a trophy.

70
00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:46.100
There we go.

71
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.720
It knows if you want a drag animator controller.

72
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.410
Well I guess I need to have an animator with which to put it on.

73
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.500
And it's already a trophy as an animator controller.

74
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.110
The next thing I'll do before animating is check the size so grab trophy to it.

75
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.620
Removing this whole unit over to here.

76
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.020
Parent and children next to the lizard it looks a little bit small.

77
00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:11.390
So mini challenge for you micro challenge is to change the size of the trophy.

78
00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.640
So it's a little bit bigger and a hint you'll need to have a look at pixels per unit.

79
00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.360
Okay so let's do that together.

80
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:27.590
Now if I find my sprite's fine trophy and then the trophy cut I will change from pixels per unit to

81
00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.620
will say 70 and then click on apply.

82
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.140
Okay what makes it bigger.

83
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.010
They're not quite in the right position but that's okay.

84
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.680
You know what I'm going to make it even a little bit bigger again so I'll make it.

85
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.770
I make it 60 and then click on apply.

86
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.680
Okay there we go back to the top and then move it relative to the base a little bit higher.

87
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.340
OK.

88
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.350
Good stuff.

89
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.090
Now what do we want to do next.

90
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.790
Well we want to add some animation.

91
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:55.930
Let's have a think about what we want to do.

92
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.290
You can just play around with it you can grab it and move it.

93
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.070
You can say what if we were to rotate it.

94
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.940
How would that look.

95
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.070
That actually looks pretty cool.

96
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:08.080
I think I might do a rotation in my little prototype before us doing some some translation up and down

97
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.600
but I'm kind of digging this.

98
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:11.820
The rotation part.

99
00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.190
Well you know what we've got one problem as we rotate our lighting.

100
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.900
This is something to pay attention to here because this is a Sprite and it's been created in a hand

101
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:20.540
drawn.

102
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.660
We've got our lighting up in the top right because the sun's coming from the top.

103
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.490
If I can rotate this now well it's not the background Rick rotate the actual thing.

104
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.840
If I rotate it you see the light goes to the bottom and to the top.

105
00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.500
So I think that's not going to work to rotate that that's going to look a little bit dumb.

106
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.170
So back to my original idea of having it bounce case how do we do that.

107
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.360
Well let's click on trophy.

108
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.230
We're an animator control a call and then click on create to create a new animation clip.

109
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.000
Where do we want to save this.

110
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.500
Well we'll save it into assets animations and more call this Rufa bounce.

111
00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.420
As an animation now we have a blink in the animation.

112
00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:01.120
Excellent.

113
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.140
And click on the top.

114
00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:06.330
Get it to my kind of neutral default position it's all looking pretty good.

115
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.440
Now we're going to create ourselves some key frame animation.

116
00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.050
So just add some key frames.

117
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:17.770
So grab the top of your trophy click on our samples to change at 24 make sure in the same as we've got

118
00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:18.300
for the lizard.

119
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.690
I think that's good.

120
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:25.270
And then now we'll make it do some bounce start in the bottom position click on the record button from

121
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.400
your animation window.

122
00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:34.470
We are now recording so whatever we do is going to add a key frame when we move something in our scene.

123
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:35.970
So let me give you an example.

124
00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:42.610
I'm going to move my slider a little bit just to calibrate you we've got 24 frames so in one second

125
00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:47.770
there'll be 24 frames in four frames eight frames to all from 16 up to 24 frames.

126
00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:52.980
So if I want to have something that lasts about up Martin I know a fifth or a quarter of it.

127
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:59.200
Then I'll move my slider along the top of my animation to approximately that looks like it's about six

128
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:06.280
frames and then if I move my trophy up as soon as I move it you see that this diamond has been added

129
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:11.860
that's a key frame has been added and moved up to the now move my slider on long little bit further

130
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:16.720
up to 12 and I'll drop it back to where it was back to there.

131
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:26.770
Move my slider up to let's see up to 18 and pull this up a little bit but not quite as far and then

132
00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.560
move it all the way down to 24 which is the end.

133
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:32.010
And move it back to wherever the original position was.

134
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:37.470
So I've been doing it just eyeballing it but you can get exact by moving this Slider again or let us

135
00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:41.510
see what we've done see how it moves boying denying denying So it interpolates.

136
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:48.570
It calculates if I need to be here at 0 and they're at 6 then I'm going to go a step in-between on each

137
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:49.500
frame.

138
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.420
Supercool and super easy.

139
00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:57.100
So if I get out of animation most out of record mode by clicking the button click on the play symbol

140
00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:00.790
or space bar boying dunboyne we've got some animation.

141
00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:01.360
Cool.

142
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:03.830
Not super amazing just yet but not too shabby.

143
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:05.230
Now it's finesse it a little bit.

144
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:11.140
You can highlight the dots highlight the key frames and then just drag to move them and that will speed

145
00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:16.180
up the amount of time it takes to get from that first point to the second point boingo doing.

146
00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:17.910
Doing that will is pretty cool as well.

147
00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:24.850
I think what we can also do is expand this Selecta here and we can see what's going on in the x y and

148
00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:25.310
z.

149
00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:30.310
Now is just about to tell you before that we've starting here you can see if I click on one of these

150
00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:35.200
key frames will click on the key frame for the y position because that's the thing that we're doing

151
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.840
most of our animation up and down on.

152
00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.360
You can see the position at the start is point 4 8.

153
00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:45.070
If I scroll long and say well I want this one to be exactly the same as that then I can click on this

154
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:46.400
particular key frame.

155
00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:53.890
So on the y position at my time and I can say I want this to be point four eight point four three not

156
00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:58.660
quite exactly right so make a point for 8 and you can see it's gone red to show that we have made a

157
00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:00.410
change there.

158
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:08.610
What I could have done as well is moused over or scroll my at my time to a particular point here.

159
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:12.190
Clicked on record again moved it within the scene.

160
00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.560
A little bit less high.

161
00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:17.980
Okay quick golf record and then that has changed it as well as a couple of ways.

162
00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:23.680
Make sure if you change if you're in record mode record mode and you want to change a key frame make

163
00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.350
sure your position exactly on top of that key frame.

164
00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:30.580
You might need to scroll in a bit to be sure because if you're slightly off and then you say OK I want

165
00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:35.590
to move it a little bit blank it makes a whole new bunch of key frames on that point and then try to

166
00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:38.130
go from where ever that key frame is to wherever that key frame is.

167
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:41.120
So just undo that right making good progress.

168
00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:45.200
Yes on the also want to show you is curve so right now on the bottom the animation window you see.

169
00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:46.600
Boop sheet next.

170
00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.860
That you see curves.

171
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:51.310
So show us what is happening in terms of the curve over time.

172
00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:57.370
You might be zoom way way out as I am hold down Shift and if you've got a really slow mouse wheel as

173
00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:02.410
I too for some reason my tail will be describing and then scrolls rolls across scrolls gold just to

174
00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:04.900
get this scale on the sides so zoomed in a bunch.

175
00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:06.160
Show us a quick where it is.

176
00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:08.480
But my mouse was a bit cranky.

177
00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:12.550
And then if you click your middle button on your mouse will bite and you can move around to get a different

178
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:13.610
view from it.

179
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:15.100
Up and down the there is scrolling.

180
00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:22.210
Now I can click on this key frame and then just move it to any new position move it left to right so

181
00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:27.540
the height of my bounce I could have it after one frame or I could have it after seven frames.

182
00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:30.310
I can have it down lower so not bounce quite so high.

183
00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:33.310
Remember I've clicked on the y position.

184
00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:35.680
Just give us a on the exposition and move.

185
00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:39.630
Well we don't we haven't created any key phrase to that yet but I could move that around you know.

186
00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.660
There should be some key friends I told a lie.

187
00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:42.700
Here they are down here.

188
00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:48.140
We just haven't moved it is what we have not done so it's all going to sit on pretty much the zero.

189
00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:55.040
You can see it's all there but if I was to click on this why it's moved to there and then say make the

190
00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.850
Y a bigger value then move it to the right.

191
00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.190
Or I can move it to the left just undo that.

192
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.900
I don't want to be moving it left and right at the moment just up and down.

193
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.380
So back to the why end.

194
00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:09.860
Sometimes that will be painful finding where your curve has got to arcane It zoomed in a bunch because

195
00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.430
it zoomed in was looking at the X..

196
00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:16.550
Right now what you want to have a good animation has some good pacing to it.

197
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:18.080
Were not going to go deep into that.

198
00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:22.240
I think that's a good thing for you to do some extra study on how to make something look good with bounce

199
00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.740
and sizzle and stuff.

200
00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:28.160
Having it uniform generally doesn't look as good as having a little bit of pacing to it so maybe it's

201
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.240
like slow the arm and then pull it back down fast.

202
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:36.170
So if we do that move our first one a little bit and then have it dropped down quickly.

203
00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:37.020
That's yeah.

204
00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:38.600
And then play about.

205
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:43.220
Now you can see it kind of looks like it's smashing into the ground like manufacturing something a little

206
00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:43.840
bit more.

207
00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:45.140
If we do it that way OK.

208
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:50.240
So you can play around with your curves to get slightly different values slightly different looks to

209
00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.130
your animation.

210
00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.320
So this brings me to the challenge that I have for you.

211
00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:58.360
Let's jump over to the challenged grain so that made the base of the trophies.

212
00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:00.430
So see how we've been just animating the top.

213
00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:05.600
Aren't you great now and make the base just to do something subtle also a little bit of scale or a little

214
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:10.190
bit of rotation of the bass to give it some movement so is your challenge champion.

215
00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:10.820
Take that on.

216
00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:12.380
Play around with it and do something.

217
00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:17.900
It looks pretty nifty and of course please share a little video if you can take a video of it in the

218
00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.030
community we'd love to see what you come up with.

219
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:24.230
But I'll see you back in a moment and I'll show you what I'm doing with my base of my trophy.

220
00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:28.660
Okay so I think I'm just going to do a little bit of wobble.

221
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:34.080
I think just a little bit of rotation left or right so clicking on my trophy you can see he is my animation

222
00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.740
currently just animating the top.

223
00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:37.000
So this is the.

224
00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.390
One of the children we've got.

225
00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:42.460
If I now click on my bass it's all about the bass.

226
00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:46.450
If I make a joke another five times before this lecture is over.

227
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:50.700
Now if I click on record I'm going to go back to the dope sheet.

228
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.790
I find this a little bit easier for this point.

229
00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:57.220
Move my slider back to the start of the animation cycle and.

230
00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:03.320
What do I want to have Apnea We'll just a of left right rotate based upon when the objects.

231
00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:06.890
Slams back down so we'll start.

232
00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:10.800
Left and in the middle have it rotated so quickly.

233
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:16.500
My eat all rotate a bit to the right and then as it slams back down.

234
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:22.030
At that point I'll have it be centred again so zero on my rotation.

235
00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:26.770
And then when it goes the other way I have a go to the left.

236
00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:29.200
It sounds like a nifty idea left.

237
00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:33.480
And then when we come back when it's lines back down or have it back to zero.

238
00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:38.970
One of the things you want to make sure you do is have your looping look good so if your first key frame

239
00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:44.220
looks quite different to your laskey frame then when you loop it or get to the end and then it'll snap

240
00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:47.430
in a really weird way from this last frame of the first frame.

241
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:51.330
So it's a good habit to have your first frame exactly the same as the last frame.

242
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:56.920
So we've got here a little bit of wobble from side to side not super happy with that at those that looks

243
00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.990
a little bit creepy between you and I.

244
00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:03.060
Let's have a look at our curves might just smooth it out a little bit.

245
00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:12.630
But scroll back in on this we're using these zayd rotation and I will just make it a little bit more

246
00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:14.060
subtle I think.

247
00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.490
So I think it's good.

248
00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:18.630
OK.

249
00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:23.290
So there we go it's not necessarily a work of art but it's not too bad.

250
00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:27.310
OK here's a little bit of a bonus I want to try something else just to show you that we can do more

251
00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:27.800
things.

252
00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:34.350
Is click on top get it to the point where it's right at the peak of its first jump up to about there.

253
00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:35.890
Yeah.

254
00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:38.490
Or there on our key frame because it's at the top.

255
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:39.730
Click on record.

256
00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:41.540
Now I can change the colour.

257
00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:45.850
And this is just the colour tinting over the top so it's not going to be an amazing effect but let's

258
00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:48.570
see if we can make it even more yellow.

259
00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.100
Is that much of a difference.

260
00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:54.500
It's only a tiny difference tiny tiny difference where we make it a little bit darker.

261
00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:55.120
Okay.

262
00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:55.930
And then.

263
00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.780
It is now added for Sprite render a colour.

264
00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:00.560
It's added a key.

265
00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.060
Frank rogo one key friend to the left.

266
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:05.250
Then I want to make that white.

267
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:09.440
And then if I go one key frame to the right one make that white as well.

268
00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:15.290
Otherwise it's going to Berlin from yellow key from here all the way back down to the White down there.

269
00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:16.900
So I want to have more of a blink.

270
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:19.460
So the key frames either side make it white.

271
00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:25.010
So then as we click out of recording mode come on goes blink gives the red colour in there maybe is

272
00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:29.810
a little bit too subtle so I'm going to drag my key frame one to the right one to the left so my blink

273
00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:31.290
will last a little bit longer.

274
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:38.240
Link line OK and make sure if you're doing any more fiddles in here click on record change the colour.

275
00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.860
I think we can do better than yellow.

276
00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:45.870
Let's go Orange should done orange or long Schneider super bright that makes a big difference.

277
00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.170
My eyesight it's not the best.

278
00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:49.570
Look it's we're doing a little bit of hackie art here.

279
00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:56.510
But just to show that we know how to use the tools out of record mode click play blank again just yellow

280
00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:58.530
sorry an orange as it comes up to the top.

281
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.820
OK.

282
00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:05.030
So we've animated the transform we've animated the rotation you can estimate scale if you wanted and

283
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:06.120
we've animated the colour.

284
00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:08.220
So there's a whole bunch of key frame animation.

285
00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.580
Great work all can.

286
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:12.050
Awesome I'll see you in the next lecture.
