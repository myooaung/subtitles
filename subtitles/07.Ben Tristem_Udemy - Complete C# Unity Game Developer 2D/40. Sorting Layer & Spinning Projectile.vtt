[MUSIC]
2

2

00:00:04.397  -->  00:00:08.563
In this video, we are going to make our
projectiles a little bit prettier and
3

3

00:00:08.563  -->  00:00:09.809
add a spin to our bomb.
4

4

00:00:09.809  -->  00:00:11.650
And we're gonna fix this problem.
5

5

00:00:11.650  -->  00:00:13.639
Let me show you what the problem is.
6

6

00:00:13.639  -->  00:00:16.073
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot,
shoot with the player.
7

7

00:00:16.073  -->  00:00:20.133
If I pause, come zinging in, you can see
that the projectile is being instantiated
8

8

00:00:20.133  -->  00:00:21.938
right from the middle of the player.
9

9

00:00:21.938  -->  00:00:23.795
So there are some things we can do here.
10

10

00:00:23.795  -->  00:00:25.935
One is that we can change the spawn point.
11

11

00:00:25.935  -->  00:00:28.076
We have the tip of the nose of the player.
12

12

00:00:28.076  -->  00:00:32.055
That's gonna be a similar problem with
the enemies when they're shooting, But
13

13

00:00:32.055  -->  00:00:34.405
things are gonna be
instantiated right on top.
14

14

00:00:34.405  -->  00:00:38.411
But there's a really quick and easy way
that we can resolve this by changing
15

15

00:00:38.411  -->  00:00:41.540
the rendering layer, so
the order in which we see things.
16

16

00:00:41.540  -->  00:00:45.212
At the moment we're seeing
the projectile on top of the player and
17

17

00:00:45.212  -->  00:00:47.748
then the player on top of the background,
but
18

18

00:00:47.748  -->  00:00:52.053
we can change the order that things
are rendered in or shown to the player in.
19

19

00:00:52.053  -->  00:00:54.565
So what we'll do is find our player laser.
20

20

00:00:54.565  -->  00:00:57.053
And then if you come over
to the sprite renderer,
21

21

00:00:57.053  -->  00:00:59.061
you'll see there's a sorting layer.
22

22

00:00:59.061  -->  00:01:02.175
If you click on sorting layer, there's
default and then add sortling layer.
23

23

00:01:02.175  -->  00:01:05.400
So we're gonna add ourselves another
sorting layer, click on that button.
24

24

00:01:05.400  -->  00:01:12.542
Click on the plus button and then
change the layout to Projectiles, okay.
25

25

00:01:12.542  -->  00:01:15.232
And you know what,
I don't remember which one comes first.
26

26

00:01:15.232  -->  00:01:19.332
I think whatever is first in
our list is rendered first,
27

27

00:01:19.332  -->  00:01:21.412
and therefore it is
underneath the other things.
28

28

00:01:21.412  -->  00:01:24.915
But we'll go and assign this, so
find the laser prefab, or sorry,
29

29

00:01:24.915  -->  00:01:26.581
the Player Laser prefab again.
30

30

00:01:26.581  -->  00:01:30.003
And then under Sorting Layer,
we need to change this to Projectiles.
31

31

00:01:30.003  -->  00:01:31.878
Let's see if that has changed it so
32

32

00:01:31.878  -->  00:01:34.927
that these projectiles are now
underneath the player.
33

33

00:01:34.927  -->  00:01:36.606
So, we'll shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.
34

34

00:01:36.606  -->  00:01:37.253
Click on Pause.
35

35

00:01:37.253  -->  00:01:38.337
I'm zooming in.
36

36

00:01:38.337  -->  00:01:41.156
Just scroll a frame at a time
by clicking the button, great.
37

37

00:01:41.156  -->  00:01:42.840
Now it's underneath there.
38

38

00:01:42.840  -->  00:01:45.688
And what we can do now is go to
our other projectiles in our game.
39

39

00:01:45.688  -->  00:01:47.043
Let's see, we've got the enemy bomb.
40

40

00:01:47.043  -->  00:01:52.667
Do the same thing, sorting layer,
assign those projectiles and
41

41

00:01:52.667  -->  00:01:58.920
then the enemy laser, the sorting layer,
define that as projectiles.
42

42

00:01:58.920  -->  00:02:02.484
So now all of our projectiles should be
seen underneath the things are spawning
43

43

00:02:02.484  -->  00:02:03.842
them or instantiating them.
44

44

00:02:03.842  -->  00:02:06.255
And you're not gonna get that weird,
45

45

00:02:06.255  -->  00:02:09.732
the lasers sitting over the top
of an enemy or a player.
46

46

00:02:09.732  -->  00:02:11.490
That's all looking pretty good.
47

47

00:02:11.490  -->  00:02:13.536
And when these other enemies come out,
48

48

00:02:13.536  -->  00:02:16.210
they are shooting underneath
themselves as well.
49

49

00:02:16.210  -->  00:02:18.170
Okay, cool, happy with that.
50

50

00:02:18.170  -->  00:02:20.250
That's one bit of what
we're doing in this video.
51

51

00:02:20.250  -->  00:02:22.960
The next bit we're gonna is add
a little bit of spin to our bombs.
52

52

00:02:22.960  -->  00:02:25.200
So you can see how their coming down,
their very straight,
53

53

00:02:25.200  -->  00:02:26.290
it's a little bit boring.
54

54

00:02:26.290  -->  00:02:28.570
We want some variation rather than
them kind of spinning around and
55

55

00:02:28.570  -->  00:02:31.370
be looking like little
spinning mind type things.
56

56

00:02:31.370  -->  00:02:34.110
The way we're gonna do that is
find the projectile enemy bomb,
57

57

00:02:34.110  -->  00:02:35.945
and then I will scroll on down.
58

58

00:02:35.945  -->  00:02:41.100
I'll add component which I will
call a spinner, spin or spinner.
59

59

00:02:41.100  -->  00:02:42.470
Okay, spinner.
60

60

00:02:42.470  -->  00:02:46.174
Hit Enter &gt; Create and add,
and then let's, you know what?
61

61

00:02:46.174  -->  00:02:48.204
First, I'm going to click on assets and
62

62

00:02:48.204  -->  00:02:50.900
then just drag my script
over into my Scripts folder.
63

63

00:02:52.192  -->  00:02:57.490
Okay, and
then find spinner where I use spinner.
64

64

00:02:57.490  -->  00:02:59.860
There we go, spinner open that up.
65

65

00:02:59.860  -->  00:03:01.330
It's a really, really simple script.
66

66

00:03:01.330  -->  00:03:03.960
If you know how to do this already,
then pause the video and jump in.
67

67

00:03:03.960  -->  00:03:08.085
Let me give you a hint, and that is we're
gonna delete just our start method.
68

68

00:03:08.085  -->  00:03:09.730
We need the update.
69

69

00:03:09.730  -->  00:03:13.614
My hint here is we're going
to use transform.rotate.
70

70

00:03:13.614  -->  00:03:17.189
So if that's enough of a hint for
you, pause the video and
71

71

00:03:17.189  -->  00:03:22.060
implement transform.rotate so
that our bombs spin around.
72

72

00:03:22.060  -->  00:03:26.450
Okay, and for the rest of us, I'm going
to, first of all, serialize a field,
73

73

00:03:26.450  -->  00:03:29.020
so we can say how fast it rotates.
74

74

00:03:29.020  -->  00:03:30.420
So it needs to be a float.
75

75

00:03:30.420  -->  00:03:36.310
This will be speedOfSpin, and
we'll initialize that at say 1f.
76

76

00:03:36.310  -->  00:03:40.313
And now an update,
we're gonna type transform.rotate.
77

77

00:03:40.313  -->  00:03:43.500
We're gonna use the rotation and
parentheses.
78

78

00:03:43.500  -->  00:03:47.840
Now what we're gonna do in here is the
rotation on the x, the rotation on the y,
79

79

00:03:47.840  -->  00:03:49.070
and the rotation on the z.
80

80

00:03:49.070  -->  00:03:52.610
If we're not sure what we should rotate,
let's just go in, click on our player.
81

81

00:03:52.610  -->  00:03:55.190
And then we look to see,
I'm pretty sure it's on the z.
82

82

00:03:55.190  -->  00:03:58.720
So if I change the z rotation, yep,
that's the sort of rotation we want.
83

83

00:03:58.720  -->  00:04:01.520
Any other rotation won't
make any sense in a 2D game.
84

84

00:04:01.520  -->  00:04:02.740
So I'm gonna be rotating on z.
85

85

00:04:02.740  -->  00:04:08.715
So 0, throw in the x, space, zero, comma
space at zero, and the x zero on the y.
86

86

00:04:08.715  -->  00:04:12.371
And then we're gonna say
speed of spin times,
87

87

00:04:12.371  -->  00:04:16.796
what do we times it by to have
it frame rate independent?
88

88

00:04:16.796  -->  00:04:22.545
Time.deltaTime, and
then semicolon at the end.
89

89

00:04:22.545  -->  00:04:25.490
That's a really simple way
of saying make it spin.
90

90

00:04:25.490  -->  00:04:27.630
Okay, come back in,
click on our Enemy Bomb.
91

91

00:04:27.630  -->  00:04:29.030
For some reason it's gone back to yellow.
92

92

00:04:29.030  -->  00:04:30.750
Maybe I made changes not on the prefab.
93

93

00:04:30.750  -->  00:04:32.050
We'll make it red.
94

94

00:04:32.050  -->  00:04:32.680
There we go.
95

95

00:04:32.680  -->  00:04:33.580
It's on the prefab.
96

96

00:04:33.580  -->  00:04:34.741
Scroll down, you know what?
97

97

00:04:34.741  -->  00:04:37.150
The speed of the spin,
I think 1 is not gonna be enough.
98

98

00:04:37.150  -->  00:04:41.020
That's just gonna be 1 degree per second,
I believe.
99

99

00:04:41.020  -->  00:04:46.300
Let's make this 360 to test my
assumption that it's saying how quickly.
100

100

00:04:46.300  -->  00:04:50.770
So what happens over one second,
we wanna do 360 degree rotation.
101

101

00:04:50.770  -->  00:04:52.020
Let's test to see that.
102

102

00:04:52.020  -->  00:04:55.058
If our bullets rotate,
take about a second.
103

103

00:04:55.058  -->  00:04:59.644
So out they come, one, yeah, that looks
like it's roughly a second to do a spin.
104

104

00:04:59.644  -->  00:05:01.839
So if you like that amount of spin,
that's cool.
105

105

00:05:01.839  -->  00:05:04.820
I think it looks a lot more dynamic
than just being flat and straight.
106

106

00:05:04.820  -->  00:05:07.636
I like that they're now coming
out nice and red as well.
107

107

00:05:07.636  -->  00:05:10.861
And if we were to put this up to say,
all right, 2,000,
108

108

00:05:10.861  -->  00:05:12.650
just for fun to see what happens.
109

109

00:05:12.650  -->  00:05:17.101
Click on Play, and then as they come
flying out, they're going to be [SOUND]
110

110

00:05:17.101  -->  00:05:20.719
spinning really fast and
get a weird kind of jiggity effect.
111

111

00:05:20.719  -->  00:05:24.928
Probably looks a little bit odd on the
video with my frame right of my recording
112

112

00:05:24.928  -->  00:05:28.193
software but I mean that's kind
of a neat effect of itself.
113

113

00:05:28.193  -->  00:05:30.805
It kinda gives it some animation and
some motion.
114

114

00:05:30.805  -->  00:05:35.337
I'm gonna put this back maybe just 720 so
that we have a little bit of spin,
115

115

00:05:35.337  -->  00:05:38.130
not too much but
enough to make it dynamic.
116

116

00:05:38.130  -->  00:05:38.720
So there we go.
117

117

00:05:38.720  -->  00:05:42.680
We've implemented some projectile
improvements to our game,
118

118

00:05:42.680  -->  00:05:44.660
some movements and motions, some spinning.
119

119

00:05:44.660  -->  00:05:46.200
You can add some randomness to this, so
120

120

00:05:46.200  -->  00:05:48.300
they don't all spin exactly
the same way if you wanted.
121

121

00:05:48.300  -->  00:05:49.940
You know how to do random.range.
122

122

00:05:49.940  -->  00:05:53.470
So lots of cool, great,
awesome things you can do in your game.
123

123

00:05:53.470  -->  00:05:55.520
As always, I look forward to
seeing what you're coming up with,
124

124

00:05:55.520  -->  00:05:57.430
so please do continue sharing.
125

125

00:05:57.430  -->  00:05:58.630
And I'll see you in the next lecture.
