[MUSIC]
2

2

00:00:04,398  -->  00:00:06,783
In this video,
we're snapping our cactus to the grid so
3

3

00:00:06,783  -->  00:00:09,693
it appears within our coordinate
system right in the middle there.
4

4

00:00:09,693  -->  00:00:13,512
We're resizing a little bit and doing a
little bit of finessing to make sure that
5

5

00:00:13,512  -->  00:00:16,316
it fits nicely and
there's no overlap between our cacti.
6

6

00:00:16,316  -->  00:00:17,092
Cacti is it the word?
7

7

00:00:17,092  -->  00:00:17,672
I think it is.
8

8

00:00:17,672  -->  00:00:19,630
Okay let's jump in and get started.
9

9

00:00:19,630  -->  00:00:21,850
So what exactly is going
on here at the moment.
10

10

00:00:21,850  -->  00:00:26,570
When we're clicking worldPos and
spawning at worldPos,
11

11

00:00:26,570  -->  00:00:29,460
it's spawning at a place that's
just anywhere underneath the mouse.
12

12

00:00:29,460  -->  00:00:34,240
So let's do a little Debug.Log and we'll
see exactly what the coordinates are here.
13

13

00:00:34,240  -->  00:00:36,960
What are we logging, worldPos.
14

14

00:00:36,960  -->  00:00:37,650
Semi colon.
15

15

00:00:37,650  -->  00:00:38,810
Back over in to unity.
16

16

00:00:38,810  -->  00:00:41,170
Let's have a look at the console.
17

17

00:00:41,170  -->  00:00:42,290
Click on play.
18

18

00:00:42,290  -->  00:00:47,902
Then when I click,
I am going to get 3.9,2.
19

19

00:00:47,902  -->  00:00:50,580
4.9, 2.9.
20

20

00:00:50,580  -->  00:00:52,570
Okay, so we are getting all
these point something or others,
21

21

00:00:52,570  -->  00:00:56,650
it's allowing us to click wherever and
it's being place underneath that.
22

22

00:00:56,650  -->  00:00:58,860
To one decimal place that is
showing us here at the moment.
23

23

00:00:58,860  -->  00:01:02,550
So we want it to be not one decimal
place but to be an integer.
24

24

00:01:02,550  -->  00:01:06,650
Integers don't have decimal places,
so the way that we are gonna do that,
25

25

00:01:06,650  -->  00:01:09,730
well, I'm just trying to clean my
console and click on a lot of place.
26

26

00:01:09,730  -->  00:01:14,400
The way we're gonna that is with
a method called RoundToInt.
27

27

00:01:14,400  -->  00:01:17,510
So we'll create ourselves which we do this
28

28

00:01:17,510  -->  00:01:20,910
underneath GetSquareClicked I
think that's a good spot for it.
29

29

00:01:20,910  -->  00:01:28,140
Create our self private
Vector2 SnapToGrid as a method.
30

30

00:01:28,140  -->  00:01:32,200
Then we wanna take in an argument
that will be the world position, or
31

31

00:01:32,200  -->  00:01:33,230
the raw world position.
32

32

00:01:33,230  -->  00:01:35,478
So we need to say what type it is first.
33

33

00:01:35,478  -->  00:01:36,053
Type Vector2.
34

34

00:01:36,053  -->  00:01:38,430
And we'll call this rawWorldPos.
35

35

00:01:38,430  -->  00:01:40,620
rawWorldPos we'll say.
36

36

00:01:40,620  -->  00:01:43,800
Save ourselves a few lectures of typing,
rawWorldPos.
37

37

00:01:43,800  -->  00:01:48,870
And now create a new variable which is
off type float, which we'll call newX
38

38

00:01:48,870  -->  00:01:58,380
that equals Mathf.RoundToInt is the new
thing we're using here, RoundToInt.
39

39

00:01:58,380  -->  00:02:00,250
And then, what does it want?
40

40

00:02:00,250  -->  00:02:02,136
It's looking for a float,
41

41

00:02:02,136  -->  00:02:07,058
we know we've just received rawWorldPos
when this is being called, so
42

42

00:02:07,058  -->  00:02:12,500
I'll say rawWorldPos.x because we're
just interested in the x value.
43

43

00:02:12,500  -->  00:02:17,445
So little microchallenge for you,
go ahead and create the same thing for
44

44

00:02:17,445  -->  00:02:18,669
a new y variable.
45

45

00:02:18,669  -->  00:02:22,386
Okay, so float newY =
46

46

00:02:22,386  -->  00:02:29,633
Mathf.RoundToInt(rawWorldPos.y).
47

47

00:02:29,633  -->  00:02:31,850
I probably could have copy and
pasted that, but there we go.
48

48

00:02:31,850  -->  00:02:32,990
We've typed it all out.
49

49

00:02:32,990  -->  00:02:34,370
And then what do we need to return?
50

50

00:02:34,370  -->  00:02:37,210
Well, we've already said we
need a vector2 being returned.
51

51

00:02:37,210  -->  00:02:43,410
So return and we're gonna be returning
a new vector2, so it's not just one value,
52

52

00:02:43,410  -->  00:02:49,820
we're returning a vector2
which will be newX and newY.
53

53

00:02:51,260  -->  00:02:54,680
And then we need to be calling SnapToGrid
somewhere, somewhere meaningful.
54

54

00:02:54,680  -->  00:02:56,870
I think we should do
this in GetSquareClicked,
55

55

00:02:56,870  -->  00:03:01,850
so right above where we're saying return
wolrdPos, we'll change that in a moment
56

56

00:03:01,850  -->  00:03:07,330
I can say Vector2 gridPos,
this is the grid position.
57

57

00:03:07,330  -->  00:03:09,255
We finally got to what
we wanna get to in here.
58

58

00:03:09,255  -->  00:03:14,922
= SnapToGrid, and then what do we,
now a little micro challenge for you.
59

59

00:03:14,922  -->  00:03:18,020
What are we passing in SnapToGrid?
60

60

00:03:18,020  -->  00:03:20,320
We're gonna pass in worldPos.
61

61

00:03:22,370  -->  00:03:26,320
And then instead of returning worldPos,
what do we wanna return?
62

62

00:03:26,320  -->  00:03:28,140
That's right, we wanna return gridPos.
63

63

00:03:29,260  -->  00:03:32,500
Okay, so this is converting world
position into grid position,
64

64

00:03:32,500  -->  00:03:34,140
we're returning grid position.
65

65

00:03:34,140  -->  00:03:37,930
This was a method that allowed us
to change our floats into integers,
66

66

00:03:37,930  -->  00:03:40,390
or at least to round to
the nearest integer.
67

67

00:03:40,390  -->  00:03:41,920
And then when we're spawning our defender,
68

68

00:03:41,920  -->  00:03:45,410
the same as we were doing before,
it's taking in this world position.
69

69

00:03:45,410  -->  00:03:47,630
We can probably rename this
just to make it clear.
70

70

00:03:47,630  -->  00:03:50,230
It doesn't matter.
This is all local within this method here.
71

71

00:03:50,230  -->  00:03:51,430
But let's rename it just so
72

72

00:03:51,430  -->  00:03:55,570
we're not getting confused with
that particular worldPos up there.
73

73

00:03:55,570  -->  00:03:59,850
We'll say this is, use my Control RR.
74

74

00:03:59,850  -->  00:04:02,870
We will call this roundedPos.
75

75

00:04:02,870  -->  00:04:05,820
Just so it's really clear,
that's the final round of position.
76

76

00:04:05,820  -->  00:04:12,190
Save that, jump back over in to Unity,
click on play and we'll see.
77

77

00:04:12,190  -->  00:04:16,800
If I click somewhere in the square,
it's putting it in the middle.
78

78

00:04:16,800  -->  00:04:19,140
Awesome and if I click,
it'll produce a whole bunch of them.
79

79

00:04:19,140  -->  00:04:21,100
We'll resolve that later on, but now,
80

80

00:04:21,100  -->  00:04:25,930
we're getting them in just one
spot on the grid, that's so cool.
81

81

00:04:25,930  -->  00:04:28,640
But we do have a little bit of an issue
where it doesn't quite fit properly so
82

82

00:04:28,640  -->  00:04:31,280
let's do a little bit of scaling
on our cactus while we're here.
83

83

00:04:31,280  -->  00:04:36,610
And go and find my sprite, cactus,
and find both idle and looping.
84

84

00:04:36,610  -->  00:04:43,570
The idle my pixels per unit I'll
change this to 125 and then apply.
85

85

00:04:43,570  -->  00:04:47,170
And then my cactus looping,
I'll do the same thing for.
86

86

00:04:48,250  -->  00:04:52,100
Change that to 125, my computer is having
a little bit of slow down at the moment.
87

87

00:04:52,100  -->  00:04:53,048
You can do it computer.
88

88

00:04:53,048  -->  00:04:54,648
Click Apply.
89

89

00:04:54,648  -->  00:04:58,260
Okay and then we see clicking around here,
that's much better although you know what,
90

90

00:04:58,260  -->  00:04:59,730
not quite right.
91

91

00:04:59,730  -->  00:05:03,100
They seem a little bit lower in
the square than I want them to do.
92

92

00:05:03,100  -->  00:05:06,030
So how do we resolve that
if we just move our cactus,
93

93

00:05:06,030  -->  00:05:09,210
we've got our one that we've dropped
in the, not the canvas, the cactus.
94

94

00:05:09,210  -->  00:05:10,020
Where are you, cactus?
95

95

00:05:10,020  -->  00:05:11,670
There you go.
I've got that one in here.
96

96

00:05:11,670  -->  00:05:15,130
I move that up or down then it's gonna
move the whole thing up or down.
97

97

00:05:15,130  -->  00:05:17,150
It's not gonna change
when we drop in a prefab.
98

98

00:05:17,150  -->  00:05:21,350
So what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to break out the cactus so
99

99

00:05:21,350  -->  00:05:23,720
that we have a cactus parent.
100

100

00:05:23,720  -->  00:05:26,470
So I right-click, Create Empty.
101

101

00:05:26,470  -->  00:05:28,422
And I will name this, cactus.
102

102

00:05:29,999  -->  00:05:31,100
It's a new cactus here.
103

103

00:05:31,100  -->  00:05:34,427
The old cactus I'm gonna
rename to cactus body,
104

104

00:05:34,427  -->  00:05:38,310
I would just call it body,
just to make it easier.
105

105

00:05:38,310  -->  00:05:42,710
And then we'll drag body so
it's underneath cactus, okay.
106

106

00:05:42,710  -->  00:05:44,121
Good, go back into my prefabs.
107

107

00:05:44,121  -->  00:05:47,170
Just delete the cactus
that I've got in there.
108

108

00:05:47,170  -->  00:05:50,080
Delete that, yep, drag in New Cactus so
109

109

00:05:50,080  -->  00:05:53,100
I can be super clear I've got the correct
cactus and not messing it up.
110

110

00:05:53,100  -->  00:05:57,940
Now I'll need to go to my spawners, no,
I need to go to my core game area and
111

111

00:05:57,940  -->  00:06:01,610
change from body defender into cactus.
112

112

00:06:01,610  -->  00:06:02,625
Where are you, cactus?
113

113

00:06:02,625  -->  00:06:05,160
[SOUND] Alphabetical order, there we go.
114

114

00:06:05,160  -->  00:06:07,140
Okay, so
now we've got that hooked up correctly.
115

115

00:06:07,140  -->  00:06:09,820
Let's just check that our
cactus drops into the scene and
116

116

00:06:09,820  -->  00:06:13,330
does what it needs to do before
we go forward further on that.
117

117

00:06:13,330  -->  00:06:14,460
It does and it's way off.
118

118

00:06:14,460  -->  00:06:19,560
That's cuz we have when we had our
cactus body we need to reset that and
119

119

00:06:19,560  -->  00:06:23,480
then the body is reset within the cactus.
120

120

00:06:23,480  -->  00:06:25,900
Okay so now the cactus is at zero, zero.
121

121

00:06:25,900  -->  00:06:32,500
I can move it around knowing that the body
is reset to zero within the cactus parent.
122

122

00:06:32,500  -->  00:06:33,130
Okay.
123

123

00:06:33,130  -->  00:06:34,188
Body is reset to zero.
124

124

00:06:34,188  -->  00:06:40,000
Now that it's reset to zero,
when I place the cactus in the scene.
125

125

00:06:40,000  -->  00:06:41,380
So I'll click and drop one.
126

126

00:06:41,380  -->  00:06:44,340
Okay I want it to be
moved up a little bit.
127

127

00:06:44,340  -->  00:06:47,450
So I'll grab the bodies,
so here's the cactus.
128

128

00:06:47,450  -->  00:06:51,540
I'll grab the body and
move that up just a little bit.
129

129

00:06:51,540  -->  00:06:53,310
Okay, you can see that.
130

130

00:06:53,310  -->  00:06:54,230
Just a little bit.
131

131

00:06:54,230  -->  00:06:56,990
So now there's an offset
between the cactus parent and
132

132

00:06:56,990  -->  00:07:02,750
the cactus body that the cactus body
has been moved up by .14 on the y axis.
133

133

00:07:02,750  -->  00:07:04,990
And then click on Play, and
I'll see if that's centered.
134

134

00:07:04,990  -->  00:07:09,140
That's a little bit finicky,
but it's feeling better.
135

135

00:07:09,140  -->  00:07:11,949
I can probably do it down a tiny bit,
but okay,
136

136

00:07:11,949  -->  00:07:14,917
I'll do that just so
I can sleep easily at night.
137

137

00:07:14,917  -->  00:07:19,500
0.1, okay, apply that to the prefab.
138

138

00:07:21,320  -->  00:07:23,440
Click on Play,
did I play it last time to the prefab,
139

139

00:07:23,440  -->  00:07:26,340
I'm not sure if I did but click it down.
140

140

00:07:26,340  -->  00:07:27,810
Now, it's feeling a lot more centered.
141

141

00:07:27,810  -->  00:07:30,949
In the middle there's no overlap and
success.
142

142

00:07:30,949  -->  00:07:35,507
They're shooting [SOUND].
143

143

00:07:35,507  -->  00:07:38,030
Boom, yep, they're shooting, okay,
so it's all looking pretty good.
144

144

00:07:38,030  -->  00:07:39,490
We've got our cactus in the scene.
145

145

00:07:39,490  -->  00:07:41,760
We can place it in positions on the grid.
146

146

00:07:41,760  -->  00:07:43,060
It's snapping to the grid.
147

147

00:07:43,060  -->  00:07:44,170
It's all feeling quite good.
148

148

00:07:44,170  -->  00:07:45,100
Great work, well done.
149

149

00:07:45,100  -->  00:07:47,160
We can now place defenders.
150

150

00:07:47,160  -->  00:07:48,060
I'll see you in the next video.
