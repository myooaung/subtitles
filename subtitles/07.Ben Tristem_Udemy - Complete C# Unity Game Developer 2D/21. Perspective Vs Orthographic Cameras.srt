2

00:00:03,883  -->  00:00:04,880
Hello again and welcome.
3

3

00:00:04,880  -->  00:00:08,900
This is a quick video on perspective
versus orthographic cameras,
4

4

00:00:08,900  -->  00:00:12,580
to make sure we're super clear
on what our camera is doing,
5

5

00:00:12,580  -->  00:00:16,810
when we get into setting up our
Cinemachine camera in the upcoming videos.
6

6

00:00:16,810  -->  00:00:20,930
Up till now, in our 3D games,
we've been using a perspective camera,
7

7

00:00:20,930  -->  00:00:23,550
the form of projection is perspective.
8

8

00:00:23,550  -->  00:00:25,646
That means that anything
close to the camera,
9

9

00:00:25,646  -->  00:00:29,031
let me increase my game window here,
close to the camera looks bigger, and
10

10

00:00:29,031  -->  00:00:32,870
further away looks smaller, just as it
would look in real life to our eye.
11

11

00:00:32,870  -->  00:00:36,493
And that's useful to give perspective, so
it makes the player feel if I am here,
12

12

00:00:36,493  -->  00:00:38,782
I have to run further away,
run, run, run, run,
13

13

00:00:38,782  -->  00:00:41,110
run to get to the things
down at the back there.
14

14

00:00:41,110  -->  00:00:43,550
So the player can see depth,
it's really good with that.
15

15

00:00:43,550  -->  00:00:45,560
And you can see,
just literally looking at the camera,
16

16

00:00:45,560  -->  00:00:49,320
that if I move the camera forward our
white lines are showing our field of view.
17

17

00:00:49,320  -->  00:00:53,410
When our field of view is closer to
these blocks, there's less space.
18

18

00:00:53,410  -->  00:00:55,930
You can see that maybe another
couple of blocks could fit left and
19

19

00:00:55,930  -->  00:00:59,760
right in here, but down the end there's
a lot of space between my blocks and
20

20

00:00:59,760  -->  00:01:02,640
the side of the camera,
where the camera's view is.
21

21

00:01:02,640  -->  00:01:05,780
And that's showing as well the perspective
that these things are gonna
22

22

00:01:05,780  -->  00:01:09,820
be smaller because of their relative
size fitting within the field of view,
23

23

00:01:09,820  -->  00:01:13,440
these things are gonna be bigger because
of the relative size within the field of
24

24

00:01:13,440  -->  00:01:14,370
view as well.
25

25

00:01:14,370  -->  00:01:18,260
So that's the field of view and
using a perspective camera to show depth.
26

26

00:01:18,260  -->  00:01:23,380
If we change the camera to orthographic,
we don't have that depth anymore,
27

27

00:01:23,380  -->  00:01:26,330
we don't have our field of
view going out to the side.
28

28

00:01:26,330  -->  00:01:29,410
It is being projected just straight
the whole way, so it's this big,
29

29

00:01:29,410  -->  00:01:31,040
long straight box.
30

30

00:01:31,040  -->  00:01:35,950
Nothing will be shown at a different
size because it's relatively the same
31

31

00:01:35,950  -->  00:01:40,060
within our camera's field of view,
within our camera's projection.
32

32

00:01:40,060  -->  00:01:43,210
And you can see, our game window over
here shows that the blocks at the front
33

33

00:01:43,210  -->  00:01:45,200
look the same size as
the blocks at the back.
34

34

00:01:45,200  -->  00:01:46,470
Now, why would we do this?
35

35

00:01:46,470  -->  00:01:50,080
Well, it's particularly useful in games
when we want the player to see that this
36

36

00:01:50,080  -->  00:01:53,159
thing at the back, sorry, at the front,
has the same importance and
37

37

00:01:53,159  -->  00:01:56,260
the same amount of visual information
as the thing at the back.
38

38

00:01:56,260  -->  00:01:59,680
When we're at perspective, it's a lot
harder to see if I'm playing a game.
39

39

00:01:59,680  -->  00:02:03,370
As we did in Rome Rush,
40

40

00:02:03,370  -->  00:02:06,860
we could see that if we played with our
camera and made it more skewed like this,
41

41

00:02:06,860  -->  00:02:10,290
it's hard to place a tower at
the back than if we use orthographic.
42

42

00:02:10,290  -->  00:02:14,090
So you can go back into Rome Rush and play
around with having an orthographic camera,
43

43

00:02:14,090  -->  00:02:16,540
if you think it can look good.
44

44

00:02:16,540  -->  00:02:20,340
And to make sure the player can
place towers at the front and
45

45

00:02:20,340  -->  00:02:23,190
the back without things
getting skewed like that.
46

46

00:02:23,190  -->  00:02:26,100
And obviously, it's also good if
we're using 2D assets that we know.
47

47

00:02:26,100  -->  00:02:29,910
This asset placed on the screen here is
gonna look exactly the same if we place
48

48

00:02:29,910  -->  00:02:31,550
that asset up in the back there.
49

49

00:02:31,550  -->  00:02:34,910
With 3D assets we don't have that issue as
much, there's a lot more flexibility in
50

50

00:02:34,910  -->  00:02:37,800
how we can move the camera around,
and rotate, and all that good stuff.
51

51

00:02:37,800  -->  00:02:39,270
So that's orthographic.
52

52

00:02:39,270  -->  00:02:41,487
And obviously, we're in a 2D game,
we're using orthographic,
53

53

00:02:41,487  -->  00:02:44,180
so as you run along,
we don't have any skewing.
54

54

00:02:44,180  -->  00:02:48,280
If we used a perspective camera as we run
along in our game from left to right,
55

55

00:02:48,280  -->  00:02:50,250
then we do get this skewing.
56

56

00:02:50,250  -->  00:02:56,180
Excellent if you wanna get that kind of
parallax scrolling look in the background,
57

57

00:02:56,180  -->  00:02:58,840
if you've got a 3D side scrolling game,
58

58

00:02:58,840  -->  00:03:03,160
then having this kind of approach
is really, really useful.
59

59

00:03:03,160  -->  00:03:06,660
The other things for us to know about
with the camera is our clipping planes.
60

60

00:03:06,660  -->  00:03:11,144
Our near clipping planes and far
clipping planes is a way for us to say,
61

61

00:03:11,144  -->  00:03:14,948
at what point do we not display
the thing in the game window?
62

62

00:03:14,948  -->  00:03:17,259
So you can see,
I'm playing around with it over here,
63

63

00:03:17,259  -->  00:03:19,390
difficult seeing everything on the screen.
64

64

00:03:19,390  -->  00:03:24,010
We have a clipping plane that says,
don't show anything if it
65

65

00:03:24,010  -->  00:03:29,140
is closer than 16 or if it's,
as I scroll this up, If it's closer than,
66

66

00:03:29,140  -->  00:03:31,060
we'll see when we get
rid of the blocks here.
67

67

00:03:31,060  -->  00:03:34,930
Okay, if it's closer than 40,
then don't display that on the screen.
68

68

00:03:34,930  -->  00:03:39,647
And that's really handy if you don't want
the player to accidentally be bumping into
69

69

00:03:39,647  -->  00:03:42,530
something and
having it render right in their face,
70

70

00:03:42,530  -->  00:03:46,345
you can use this clipping plane
to prevent that from happening.
71

71

00:03:46,345  -->  00:03:50,097
If we're using our orthographic view,
we don't have a need to do that clipping
72

72

00:03:50,097  -->  00:03:52,505
plane so
much cuz we're not really in our 2D game,
73

73

00:03:52,505  -->  00:03:55,362
we're not gonna be putting
things that close to the camera.
74

74

00:03:55,362  -->  00:03:59,182
But it's the same principle that
you can prevent that from happening
75

75

00:03:59,182  -->  00:03:59,942
in terms of clipping.
76

76

00:03:59,942  -->  00:04:01,502
And the same with the far plane.
77

77

00:04:01,502  -->  00:04:04,672
The default orthographic is set
way off in the distance, but
78

78

00:04:04,672  -->  00:04:09,022
we can bring that all the way up to here
to change what we display on the screen.
79

79

00:04:09,022  -->  00:04:12,552
So you can see the orthographic camera,
it's just straight the whole way, so
80

80

00:04:12,552  -->  00:04:16,420
if I put it cube way down in
that backend of the camera,
81

81

00:04:16,420  -->  00:04:19,480
we would see it the same as
we see it at the front here.
82

82

00:04:19,480  -->  00:04:20,540
And we're on perspective here.
83

83

00:04:20,540  -->  00:04:24,840
The last point I'll make is in 3D games,
rotation is a fairly natural thing for
84

84

00:04:24,840  -->  00:04:25,520
the camera to do.
85

85

00:04:25,520  -->  00:04:28,890
Rotating up and down and around,
and we often follow an object.
86

86

00:04:28,890  -->  00:04:32,551
So if you have something that's moving,
either the player or an enemy or
87

87

00:04:32,551  -->  00:04:36,512
you have a cut scene where you wanna watch
something drive past, then you might
88

88

00:04:36,512  -->  00:04:40,251
[SOUND], you rotate the camera to watch
that thing move across the screen.
89

89

00:04:40,251  -->  00:04:43,140
And our 2D game, if we're not gonna
be doing any camera rotation,
90

90

00:04:43,140  -->  00:04:44,570
it tends to look a little bit odd.
91

91

00:04:44,570  -->  00:04:50,740
Let me just pretend here that one of
these cubes is our background plane,
92

92

00:04:50,740  -->  00:04:56,980
just to scale this up,
And scale it across.
93

93

00:04:58,050  -->  00:05:01,471
So if this is the background
behind our scene that we can see,
94

94

00:05:01,471  -->  00:05:05,900
if we are on an orthographic camera and
we are doing, so orthographic camera,
95

95

00:05:05,900  -->  00:05:10,150
we can see that there's the background,
there's cubes in the front.
96

96

00:05:10,150  -->  00:05:14,822
As soon as we rotate our camera, then
our whole background goes sideways and
97

97

00:05:14,822  -->  00:05:18,180
it breaks, [LAUGH] breaks
what we're trying to go for,
98

98

00:05:18,180  -->  00:05:22,284
that our world is a 2D world, and
we see this flat plane behind it.
99

99

00:05:22,284  -->  00:05:26,372
So just I'm raising that point now because
when we're talking about Cinemachine,
100

100

00:05:26,372  -->  00:05:29,827
when you're applying 3D,
you'll have a mechanism where you can look
101

101

00:05:29,827  -->  00:05:33,593
at something moving around, and
that will potentially rotate your camera.
102

102

00:05:33,593  -->  00:05:36,783
But in a 2D world, we don't want
to use look at, all we wanna do,
103

103

00:05:36,783  -->  00:05:40,437
I'll just move this guy out of the way
a little bit so that we can see our cubes
104

104

00:05:40,437  -->  00:05:43,221
again, all we want to be doing
with our camera is moving or
105

105

00:05:43,221  -->  00:05:45,385
transposing our camera from left to right.
106

106

00:05:45,385  -->  00:05:48,165
It moves around left and
right, and up and down.
107

107

00:05:48,165  -->  00:05:50,345
And we don't have that
mechanism of rotation,
108

108

00:05:50,345  -->  00:05:53,505
it just doesn't fit within our 2D
games cuz it doesn't make sense.
109

109

00:05:53,505  -->  00:05:56,535
Now assets are all flat,
Paper Mario style, so
110

110

00:05:56,535  -->  00:05:58,600
it wouldn't look very good at all.
111

111

00:05:58,600  -->  00:06:02,270
Okay, so that's just a quick rundown on
perspective versus orthographic to make
112

112

00:06:02,270  -->  00:06:04,210
sure we're super clear on
what's going on there,
113

113

00:06:04,210  -->  00:06:06,580
not confused between
those two perspectives.
114

114

00:06:06,580  -->  00:06:10,400
In Cinemachine, we do have the option
of using perspective or orthographic.
115

115

00:06:10,400  -->  00:06:13,508
And in this section,
the section of the course,
116

116

00:06:13,508  -->  00:06:16,294
we're just doing orthographic
as our camera, and
117

117

00:06:16,294  -->  00:06:20,399
doing a whole bunch of cool Cinemachine
stuff using orthographic camera.
118

118

00:06:20,399  -->  00:06:23,790
And that is in the upcoming video,
so I will see you in that video.
