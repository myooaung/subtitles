2

00:00:03.900  -->  00:00:06.994
In this video,
we're gonna take our requirements and
3

3

00:00:06.994  -->  00:00:10.235
turn it into the actual elements
we need within our game.
4

4

00:00:10.235  -->  00:00:14.588
So creating the background, the title,
the buttons, and the guess text.
5

5

00:00:14.588  -->  00:00:18.215
So let's jump in and
get our game screen all ready for action.
6

6

00:00:18.215  -->  00:00:21.635
We need our game screen functionality,
this is what we want to have it look like.
7

7

00:00:21.635  -->  00:00:24.744
And here is us tagging
the different components of this,
8

8

00:00:24.744  -->  00:00:26.183
the different elements.
9

9

00:00:26.183  -->  00:00:27.053
We need the text,
10

10

00:00:27.053  -->  00:00:30.535
we need our background, we need to
have our dialogue before the guess.
11

11

00:00:30.535  -->  00:00:33.471
We need to have the guess itself,
as well as a background for the text.
12

12

00:00:33.471  -->  00:00:35.002
We need our three buttons.
13

13

00:00:35.002  -->  00:00:37.812
So listing this app is a challenge
to you if you wanna jump in and
14

14

00:00:37.812  -->  00:00:39.118
take this on as a challenge.
15

15

00:00:39.118  -->  00:00:40.085
Here is what we need.
16

16

00:00:40.085  -->  00:00:41.048
Here is what I'd like you to do.
17

17

00:00:41.048  -->  00:00:43.213
Prepare your games screen.
18

18

00:00:43.213  -->  00:00:45.515
We need the heading which
I've tagged as number one.
19

19

00:00:45.515  -->  00:00:47.688
The main background tagged as two.
20

20

00:00:47.688  -->  00:00:49.921
The three buttons three, four, five.
21

21

00:00:49.921  -->  00:00:50.672
Where is six?
22

22

00:00:50.672  -->  00:00:53.128
Six is the dialogue text.
23

23

00:00:53.128  -->  00:00:55.815
Just a little bit a flavor
leading into the guess, so
24

24

00:00:55.815  -->  00:00:59.721
you know without this thing right here
is the guess, underneath the guess,
25

25

00:00:59.721  -->  00:01:03.322
I have got this is item seven here,
I have got a little background, and
26

26

00:01:03.322  -->  00:01:05.792
then the guess text is on
top of the background.
27

27

00:01:05.792  -->  00:01:09.101
Make sure you take note of where you
need parent and child relationship.
28

28

00:01:09.101  -->  00:01:13.372
So the guess text should be
a child to this text box.
29

29

00:01:13.372  -->  00:01:17.319
So the background that we've got
that the text is underneath here.
30

30

00:01:17.319  -->  00:01:20.536
So that if you move around this box,
it'll move around the text as well.
31

31

00:01:20.536  -->  00:01:24.096
So that is the requirements, that's
the challenge, jump in take that on now.
32

32

00:01:24.096  -->  00:01:25.596
And when you come back,
33

33

00:01:25.596  -->  00:01:29.647
I'll go through a quick flow of
me adding my elements to my game.
34

34

00:01:31.818  -->  00:01:32.675
Okay, welcome back.
35

35

00:01:32.675  -->  00:01:36.750
Let's see when we do this fast and
furious or at least efficiently.
36

36

00:01:36.750  -->  00:01:37.410
That's what we wanna do.
37

37

00:01:37.410  -->  00:01:39.222
I'm gonna start off with
the buttons actually.
38

38

00:01:39.222  -->  00:01:44.614
So if I click on my success button here,
where are we in terms of our canvas here?
39

39

00:01:44.614  -->  00:01:48.489
Canvas and duplicate that,
and drag it up a little bit.
40

40

00:01:48.489  -->  00:01:53.741
We will call this this one
needs to be our higher button.
41

41

00:01:53.741  -->  00:01:56.415
Higher makes sense that
higher is on the top.
42

42

00:01:56.415  -->  00:01:59.142
Higher great, you can hear me
bashing away on my keyboard.
43

43

00:01:59.142  -->  00:02:01.393
It's a little bit loud today,
I think on my keyboard.
44

44

00:02:01.393  -->  00:02:04.031
And we need to, we'll leave this for now.
45

45

00:02:04.031  -->  00:02:05.011
Actually, I'll turn this off.
46

46

00:02:05.011  -->  00:02:05.897
We're doing no function.
47

47

00:02:05.897  -->  00:02:08.149
We don't wanna accidentally
click on that and do something.
48

48

00:02:08.149  -->  00:02:11.870
We'll be clicking out that
functionality in the next video or two.
49

49

00:02:11.870  -->  00:02:15.096
We need to change the text
on our higher button.
50

50

00:02:15.096  -->  00:02:19.749
Instead of being called success,
it should be called higher and
51

51

00:02:19.749  -->  00:02:22.259
the text itself should be higher.
52

52

00:02:22.259  -->  00:02:24.295
And then from here,
that's pretty good with that.
53

53

00:02:24.295  -->  00:02:28.204
We're gonna duplicate the higher button
and create ourselves a lower button.
54

54

00:02:28.204  -->  00:02:30.881
Lower button, doink doink doink.
55

55

00:02:30.881  -->  00:02:33.977
Wonderful, and
looking at the text as well.
56

56

00:02:33.977  -->  00:02:35.490
It currently says higher text.
57

57

00:02:35.490  -->  00:02:38.319
We need this to be called lower text.
58

58

00:02:38.319  -->  00:02:40.930
And we will type the word lower.
59

59

00:02:40.930  -->  00:02:44.247
Finally, click on my Move tool,
might it right down below.
60

60

00:02:44.247  -->  00:02:47.521
Whoops, we need to grab the entire button,
not just the text.
61

61

00:02:47.521  -->  00:02:50.321
Drag it down, there we go Higher,
Success and Lower.
62

62

00:02:50.321  -->  00:02:51.836
Success might not be the right word there.
63

63

00:02:51.836  -->  00:02:56.161
We can change that later on, probably,
you got it, or what do we say now, specs,
64

64

00:02:56.161  -->  00:02:56.866
that's it.
65

65

00:02:56.866  -->  00:03:00.504
So we'll change that later on, but for now
we just want to get in our functionality.
66

66

00:03:00.504  -->  00:03:04.563
Okay next, what I wanted to do,
my list here was to create a heading.
67

67

00:03:04.563  -->  00:03:06.754
So into the canvas, right click.
68

68

00:03:06.754  -->  00:03:13.067
UI Textmespro, I'll move my text
mesh pro element up to the top and
69

69

00:03:13.067  -->  00:03:19.044
create something in here that
is something along the lines of,
70

70

00:03:19.044  -->  00:03:22.797
"I shall attempt to read your mind".
71

71

00:03:22.797  -->  00:03:26.887
And these things, I was saying
before about challenge and solution.
72

72

00:03:26.887  -->  00:03:30.166
So much easier when we've
already just mapped out, and
73

73

00:03:30.166  -->  00:03:33.533
I do this in actual the Google Slides
that I've got here.
74

74

00:03:33.533  -->  00:03:37.017
I map this out in here, you can do this
in PowerPoint, you can do it in Excel,
75

75

00:03:37.017  -->  00:03:38.391
on Word or in a piece of paper.
76

76

00:03:38.391  -->  00:03:42.244
But mapping out your wire frame,
that is what are the elements you need and
77

77

00:03:42.244  -->  00:03:43.620
roughly where do they go?
78

78

00:03:43.620  -->  00:03:46.041
Makes this process in Unity so
much easier and
79

79

00:03:46.041  -->  00:03:50.128
more efficient when you've already
mapped out a little diagram like that.
80

80

00:03:50.128  -->  00:03:53.240
So what we need to do next is just
make our text box a little bit bigger.
81

81

00:03:53.240  -->  00:03:58.027
Click on my T tool here, so
I can give ourselves a bit more space.
82

82

00:03:58.027  -->  00:03:59.937
Drag it that way, drag it that way,
83

83

00:03:59.937  -->  00:04:03.319
I'm gonna push the game screen
over there a little bit for now.
84

84

00:04:03.319  -->  00:04:05.944
I leave the font as it is,
I'll change the font later on.
85

85

00:04:05.944  -->  00:04:09.172
Perhaps make it 80, so it's nice and big.
86

86

00:04:09.172  -->  00:04:11.782
This exercise is gonna be less
about making it look pretty and
87

87

00:04:11.782  -->  00:04:13.942
more about just getting it
in the place we want it.
88

88

00:04:13.942  -->  00:04:17.219
I'll do center alignment,
"I shall attempt to read your mind".
89

89

00:04:17.219  -->  00:04:19.637
Okay, it looks similar
to what we're going for.
90

90

00:04:19.637  -->  00:04:22.640
Next up, Canvas right-click, UI.
91

91

00:04:22.640  -->  00:04:24.140
We will put in a image.
92

92

00:04:24.140  -->  00:04:28.709
That will be an image,
if I was to speak proper English.
93

93

00:04:28.709  -->  00:04:32.886
We will use this to just create a little
bit of a different color to show this is
94

94

00:04:32.886  -->  00:04:34.797
where the action is taking place.
95

95

00:04:34.797  -->  00:04:37.246
Now, it's gone and plonked over the top.
96

96

00:04:37.246  -->  00:04:40.489
So what we need to do is drag
it all the way up to the top, so
97

97

00:04:40.489  -->  00:04:42.640
now it'll sit down the very bottom.
98

98

00:04:42.640  -->  00:04:44.010
Did I not drag that to the right spot?
99

99

00:04:44.010  -->  00:04:47.749
Undo, this time I will actually will drag
it all the way up to the top, there we go.
100

100

00:04:47.749  -->  00:04:53.688
This is our image, change our color of
the image to similar to what I had before.
101

101

00:04:53.688  -->  00:04:56.033
Some sort of bluish type color.
102

102

00:04:56.033  -->  00:04:58.375
There we go again,
not furnishing the colors just yet.
103

103

00:04:58.375  -->  00:05:02.589
Functionality first,
functionality over form as a first step.
104

104

00:05:02.589  -->  00:05:03.993
Now, where do we want this anchored?
105

105

00:05:03.993  -->  00:05:05.762
We should be thinking about that,
106

106

00:05:05.762  -->  00:05:08.389
I'll leave my anchor points
in the middle for now.
107

107

00:05:08.389  -->  00:05:11.587
I think I want that, I don't think I
want it stretching to the outside.
108

108

00:05:11.587  -->  00:05:13.920
We can play around with our
anchor points later on.
109

109

00:05:13.920  -->  00:05:16.882
For now, we're getting in the
functionality sort of background there.
110

110

00:05:16.882  -->  00:05:18.520
What is next on our list?
111

111

00:05:18.520  -->  00:05:22.295
We need the, we've got the heading,
we've got our background.
112

112

00:05:22.295  -->  00:05:27.171
We've come dialogue text comes next,
so right click canvas,
113

113

00:05:27.171  -->  00:05:29.384
UI, another Textmeshpro.
114

114

00:05:29.384  -->  00:05:33.375
Just gonna use text mesh pro
all the time at the moment.
115

115

00:05:33.375  -->  00:05:34.745
Drag it over a little bit, no.
116

116

00:05:34.745  -->  00:05:37.032
Drag over the entire element.
117

117

00:05:37.032  -->  00:05:39.870
Get in a little bit closer, there we go.
118

118

00:05:39.870  -->  00:05:42.372
And for this one,
again I will center a line.
119

119

00:05:42.372  -->  00:05:44.222
What are we typing in here?
120

120

00:05:44.222  -->  00:05:52.176
We are typing in [SOUND] "My guess is...".
121

121

00:05:52.176  -->  00:05:55.698
Okay make the font a little bit bigger,
say 60.
122

122

00:05:55.698  -->  00:05:59.514
That looks decent, and
white is fine for now.
123

123

00:05:59.514  -->  00:06:00.374
White is fine,
124

124

00:06:00.374  -->  00:06:04.029
just something that I should be
paying attention to as I go along.
125

125

00:06:04.029  -->  00:06:06.938
What have we called this text mesh
text pro text, that's no good.
126

126

00:06:06.938  -->  00:06:08.416
Need to call it heading text.
127

127

00:06:08.416  -->  00:06:12.511
Make sure you're always updating your
name so you know exactly what's going on.
128

128

00:06:12.511  -->  00:06:19.062
The one we just added here should
be called for me dialog text.
129

129

00:06:19.062  -->  00:06:21.356
Okay cool this is making progress.
130

130

00:06:21.356  -->  00:06:23.394
What else did I not name background.
131

131

00:06:23.394  -->  00:06:24.828
I didn't name.
132

132

00:06:24.828  -->  00:06:29.090
Background, okay, success button is named,
higher button is named, lower button is
133

133

00:06:29.090  -->  00:06:32.556
named, heading text, dialogue text,
and background are all named.
134

134

00:06:32.556  -->  00:06:37.196
Okay, next aspect is,
right click on Canvas,
135

135

00:06:37.196  -->  00:06:40.328
UI, and we need another image.
136

136

00:06:40.328  -->  00:06:44.962
This image I'll move down into the middle,
roughly around here,
137

137

00:06:44.962  -->  00:06:47.038
make this one a yellow color.
138

138

00:06:47.038  -->  00:06:50.467
I think I'll change my buttons pretty
soon from yellow to something else.
139

139

00:06:50.467  -->  00:06:54.419
We'll make the guess nice and
yellow under the image here.
140

140

00:06:54.419  -->  00:06:59.143
Change the name of this
to guess background.
141

141

00:06:59.143  -->  00:07:03.583
Okay, going pretty fast here but
you could always slow the video down,
142

142

00:07:03.583  -->  00:07:06.839
to say half speed,
if you wanted got out text books.
143

143

00:07:06.839  -->  00:07:09.958
There we go, it's cold guess background.
144

144

00:07:09.958  -->  00:07:14.640
Next up, I want to child underneath
my little background here
145

145

00:07:14.640  -->  00:07:19.241
right click on guess background,
UI and Textmeshpro text.
146

146

00:07:19.241  -->  00:07:23.036
Again, it's all in white, that's not
very good, made a change to color.
147

147

00:07:23.036  -->  00:07:27.481
Come down to color vertex,
make this a darkish kind of color,
148

148

00:07:27.481  -->  00:07:31.938
I think works and then I will put
in here three question marks.
149

149

00:07:31.938  -->  00:07:34.489
One, two, three to signify that
our number's probably gonna be,
150

150

00:07:34.489  -->  00:07:36.117
well it could be up to four, couldn't it?
151

151

00:07:36.117  -->  00:07:39.254
So we'll have four in there,
so make sure four can fit.
152

152

00:07:39.254  -->  00:07:43.144
And then the size, I'll pump up to 80,
yeah, that looks pretty good.
153

153

00:07:43.144  -->  00:07:48.596
And then, move the positioning
of that a little bit more.
154

154

00:07:48.596  -->  00:07:52.600
Now with this,
I do want to anchor the guess.
155

155

00:07:52.600  -->  00:07:55.096
We need to name this first
before I do the anchors.
156

156

00:07:55.096  -->  00:07:58.720
Name this as Guess,
Guess text is what we're gonna call it.
157

157

00:07:58.720  -->  00:08:00.087
Guess text I think is good, yeah.
158

158

00:08:00.087  -->  00:08:03.264
And then, I will anchor these to stretch.
159

159

00:08:03.264  -->  00:08:07.090
And that should stretch to the parent
that it's sitting within, that's great.
160

160

00:08:07.090  -->  00:08:11.971
So if we were to move around the guest
background, then the guest goes with it.
161

161

00:08:11.971  -->  00:08:15.628
Or if we were to stretch it then
it should stay in the middle.
162

162

00:08:15.628  -->  00:08:17.865
What have we not done in here,
163

163

00:08:17.865  -->  00:08:23.512
we should move the boxes of our actual
Textmeshpro element to the outside.
164

164

00:08:23.512  -->  00:08:28.575
Just to be thorough with that,
and then to center align that
165

165

00:08:28.575  -->  00:08:33.554
as well as just expand my
inspector middle of the box here.
166

166

00:08:33.554  -->  00:08:37.737
So all of these elements on
the guest should be all lined up.
167

167

00:08:37.737  -->  00:08:41.282
A little bit finicky here,
some of these, there we go.
168

168

00:08:41.282  -->  00:08:44.838
All of them should be lined up around
where the actual guess background is.
169

169

00:08:44.838  -->  00:08:48.602
So then now, if I move the guess
background, you can see that it
170

170

00:08:48.602  -->  00:08:53.521
stays centered within that both on the
horizontal and the vertical, wonderful.
171

171

00:08:53.521  -->  00:08:54.762
So let's do a little checklist here.
172

172

00:08:54.762  -->  00:08:55.702
What have we got?
173

173

00:08:55.702  -->  00:08:58.448
I shall tend to read your mind,
that's our heading, we've got Higher,
174

174

00:08:58.448  -->  00:08:59.217
Success and Lower.
175

175

00:08:59.217  -->  00:09:02.156
But my guess is we've got
the date guessed text in there,
176

176

00:09:02.156  -->  00:09:05.596
we've named everything as it should be,
so we can easily find it.
177

177

00:09:05.596  -->  00:09:10.146
And that's important that we can find it,
so that we know what to assign when we're
178

178

00:09:10.146  -->  00:09:13.076
saying where the text should go,
when doing a guess.
179

179

00:09:13.076  -->  00:09:18.063
So that is our game screen, all created
ready to go, all prepared, great work.
180

180

00:09:18.063  -->  00:09:19.572
Hopefully, yours looks as nifty as mine.
181

181

00:09:19.572  -->  00:09:22.923
Hopefully, looks even niftier,
I'd love to see some screenshots.
182

182

00:09:22.923  -->  00:09:26.443
If you'd like to share what you've come
up with, share your color approach and
183

183

00:09:26.443  -->  00:09:27.610
share what you've done.
184

184

00:09:27.610  -->  00:09:30.915
And I'll see you in the next lecture
where we will start to get our code that
185

185

00:09:30.915  -->  00:09:33.384
we've previously created
in Number Wizard Console.
186

186

00:09:33.384  -->  00:09:37.965
We'll get it all ready, so that we can
start feeding into our actual game.
187

187

00:09:37.965  -->  00:09:39.080
Great work, see you soon.
