2

2

00:00:04.085  -->  00:00:07.540
Okay, so real quick video to show you
how to search and find animation events.
3

3

00:00:07.540  -->  00:00:13.290
So we're over in StarDisplay, and
we've recently created AddStars.
4

4

00:00:13.290  -->  00:00:15.880
For example,
we can see AddStars right here.
5

5

00:00:15.880  -->  00:00:20.760
And at some point we might say,
what is actually calling AddStars?
6

6

00:00:20.760  -->  00:00:25.249
And what we've been doing is saying,
highlight that Ctrl+F, or Cmd on the Mac,
7

7

00:00:25.249  -->  00:00:28.504
and we can say AddStars,
search through entire solution,
8

8

00:00:28.504  -->  00:00:30.080
click the little Find Next.
9

9

00:00:30.080  -->  00:00:32.800
It'll show us all the places
that we've got AddStars.
10

10

00:00:32.800  -->  00:00:35.630
AddStars, and
we could be misled into thinking,
11

11

00:00:35.630  -->  00:00:38.680
these are the couple of spots in our code,
in our scripts.
12

12

00:00:38.680  -->  00:00:44.610
Let's see, it's in Defender script and
it's in our StarDisplay script.
13

13

00:00:44.610  -->  00:00:45.720
That's all there is.
14

14

00:00:45.720  -->  00:00:50.464
But what we're missing is the fact that we
are calling this as an animation event,
15

15

00:00:50.464  -->  00:00:54.730
and animation events are a little bit
clunky because they're tucked away
16

16

00:00:54.730  -->  00:00:55.641
within Unity.
17

17

00:00:55.641  -->  00:00:59.226
You might say, where on [LAUGH]
Earth do I have that one little
18

18

00:00:59.226  -->  00:01:02.680
white button thing that's
tucked away in my animation?
19

19

00:01:02.680  -->  00:01:08.360
So what we can do in here is find the
particular method that you're looking for,
20

20

00:01:08.360  -->  00:01:13.830
and on a PC, Ctrl+Shift+F, and
that will bring up Find and Replace.
21

21

00:01:13.830  -->  00:01:20.760
Alternatively, we can go up to
Edit&gt;Find and Replace&gt;Find in Files.
22

22

00:01:20.760  -->  00:01:24.070
So on a Mac I'm not exactly sure where
it is, sorry about that, Mac users.
23

23

00:01:24.070  -->  00:01:27.250
But if you look around and
find the Find and Replace and
24

24

00:01:27.250  -->  00:01:31.875
Find all Files, now we get a slightly
different dialog box to when, whoops.
25

25

00:01:31.875  -->  00:01:35.123
[SOUND] And
let me just put this back down here so
26

26

00:01:35.123  -->  00:01:38.985
it's not taking up the entirety
of our [LAUGH] screen.
27

27

00:01:38.985  -->  00:01:40.950
Just drag it over there, sorry about that.
28

28

00:01:40.950  -->  00:01:44.234
Okay, and so within here the important to
do, make sure you've got all the things
29

29

00:01:44.234  -->  00:01:46.911
ticked on that I've got ticked on,
so include sub folders, etc.
30

30

00:01:46.911  -->  00:01:50.950
We're looking for AddStars, and
we're looking in the entire solution.
31

31

00:01:50.950  -->  00:01:55.180
What you wanna do here is
choose Search Folders.
32

32

00:01:55.180  -->  00:02:00.960
And then to find the folder
where your project is,
33

33

00:02:00.960  -->  00:02:03.620
so the Repo,
wherever your project is hanging out.
34

34

00:02:03.620  -->  00:02:07.555
So for me it's within Glitch_Garden,
whoops, I went a couple too many there.
35

35

00:02:07.555  -->  00:02:09.870
Glitch_Garden&gt;Assets, and
36

36

00:02:09.870  -->  00:02:13.940
then you need to click this button here
to add that to the selected folders.
37

37

00:02:13.940  -->  00:02:15.690
Now when I click OK and
38

38

00:02:15.690  -->  00:02:20.610
then it say Find All I'll get this extra
little dialog down here, the results.
39

39

00:02:20.610  -->  00:02:26.270
And you can see I've got, let's see, the
first one I've got is Trophy Bounce.anim.
40

40

00:02:26.270  -->  00:02:28.602
If I click on that it'll
show me all this detail.
41

41

00:02:28.602  -->  00:02:30.611
We're not gonna have to
look through there and
42

42

00:02:30.611  -->  00:02:34.112
figure out exactly what all this means,
but I can see that it's highlighted that
43

43

00:02:34.112  -->  00:02:36.920
this function name AddStars
is being used somewhere.
44

44

00:02:36.920  -->  00:02:42.320
It should show me the frame I think,
if I can figure out how to read this.
45

45

00:02:42.320  -->  00:02:46.400
I think this one in here is the number
of stars that's being added,
46

46

00:02:46.400  -->  00:02:48.310
so this is our integer parameter.
47

47

00:02:49.900  -->  00:02:51.925
And the time is at 0.45.
48

48

00:02:51.925  -->  00:02:55.795
That's useful to a degree, but
basically what we can then do is say,
49

49

00:02:55.795  -->  00:02:57.150
okay, Trophy Bounce.
50

50

00:02:57.150  -->  00:02:58.600
So I go look for my animation.
51

51

00:02:58.600  -->  00:03:03.730
I can search within my window here,
Trophy Bounce, and
52

52

00:03:03.730  -->  00:03:06.100
then you can see my
Trophy Bounce animation.
53

53

00:03:06.100  -->  00:03:09.993
Now I can look about halfway along,
cuz it was 0.5 seconds,
54

54

00:03:09.993  -->  00:03:13.605
0.45 seconds, and
I can see AddStars is right there.
55

55

00:03:13.605  -->  00:03:15.277
And if I'm using AddStars or
56

56

00:03:15.277  -->  00:03:20.223
calling AddStars in a bunch of different
animations, then they'll be listed out in
57

57

00:03:20.223  -->  00:03:24.630
here all the extra places that we
are calling AddStars, so super useful.
58

58

00:03:24.630  -->  00:03:26.440
Hopefully that'll get you out of trouble.
59

59

00:03:26.440  -->  00:03:29.660
We can do it the other way around,
whereas we get in here and we say, okay,
60

60

00:03:29.660  -->  00:03:34.020
let's have a look at Lizard
on our Lizard animation.
61

61

00:03:34.020  -->  00:03:36.515
Here's an animation event,
SetMovementSpeed.
62

62

00:03:36.515  -->  00:03:41.018
Hm, I wonder where that is in my code,
what script does that belong to?
63

63

00:03:41.018  -->  00:03:47.335
And then from anywhere within here, again,
Edit&gt;Find and Replace&gt;Find in Files.
64

64

00:03:47.335  -->  00:03:50.765
And instead of AddStars, we're searching
for, what was it over here called?
65

65

00:03:50.765  -->  00:03:55.405
SetMovementSpeed, so
I type in SetMovementSpeed.
66

66

00:03:56.680  -->  00:03:58.530
And then Find All, same deal.
67

67

00:03:58.530  -->  00:04:06.480
That should now show me
the Lizard Jump.anim and Lizard Walk.anim.
68

68

00:04:06.480  -->  00:04:09.707
Great, so I can see exactly where
those things are being selected and
69

69

00:04:09.707  -->  00:04:10.810
changed from.
70

70

00:04:10.810  -->  00:04:12.137
Okay, hopefully you find that useful.
71

71

00:04:12.137  -->  00:04:13.390
I'll see you in the next video.
