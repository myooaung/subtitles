00:00:04,024  -->  00:00:06,532
Hello again.
In this video we'll be adding resources to
2

2

00:00:06,532  -->  00:00:10,687
our scores by creating an animation event,
and then creating a little animation with
3

3

00:00:10,687  -->  00:00:13,475
our star so they can visualize
as our points are going up.
4

4

00:00:13,475  -->  00:00:15,330
Let's jump in and get started.
5

5

00:00:15,330  -->  00:00:17,359
I haven't scribbled on the screen for
a while so
6

6

00:00:17,359  -->  00:00:19,299
let's do a little bit
of screen scribbling.
7

7

00:00:19,299  -->  00:00:23,567
And I wanna talk about the positioning of
where we need to be calling methods from.
8

8

00:00:23,567  -->  00:00:27,880
So when we have an animation
event that sits on our timeline,
9

9

00:00:27,880  -->  00:00:30,502
it can only be getting the function or
10

10

00:00:30,502  -->  00:00:35,171
the method from anything that is
at that level of the game object.
11

11

00:00:35,171  -->  00:00:37,986
So currently we have the defender script,
so
12

12

00:00:37,986  -->  00:00:42,963
we can access with our animation event
anything that is in the defender script.
13

13

00:00:42,963  -->  00:00:47,295
However, the thing we need to
be accessing to be adding stars,
14

14

00:00:47,295  -->  00:00:52,361
which is what we wanna be doing, like,
[SOUND], and then this score here,
15

15

00:00:52,361  -->  00:00:56,887
our star display will go out from for
example 100, to 107.
16

16

00:00:56,887  -->  00:01:01,885
The way that we're doing that is
through these starred display script
17

17

00:01:01,885  -->  00:01:04,861
which is sitting on our starred display.
18

18

00:01:04,861  -->  00:01:09,104
So we need a mechanism to say well, we
need to be able to see from within here.
19

19

00:01:09,104  -->  00:01:10,810
This is the same level.
20

20

00:01:10,810  -->  00:01:15,507
As the animation event, we need to be out
of call in this particular script in here.
21

21

00:01:15,507  -->  00:01:19,407
Normally, we would just say
find StarDisplay and go for it,
22

22

00:01:19,407  -->  00:01:20,559
call the method.
23

23

00:01:20,559  -->  00:01:24,067
But we don't have that mechanism within
here when we add an animation event.
24

24

00:01:24,067  -->  00:01:28,586
So we need to do something a little
bit tricky in order for us to access,
25

25

00:01:28,586  -->  00:01:31,664
that is by calling within
the Defender script.
26

26

00:01:31,664  -->  00:01:34,824
We need to create ourselves a method,
a public method.
27

27

00:01:34,824  -->  00:01:38,655
Public method that will call
the method we're looking for
28

28

00:01:38,655  -->  00:01:42,251
in StarDisplay so
that the animation event can call our
29

29

00:01:42,251  -->  00:01:45,947
public method that's sitting
on the Defender script.
30

30

00:01:45,947  -->  00:01:50,085
So if that seems like 1,000 lines and
it doesn't make sense, no problem,
31

31

00:01:50,085  -->  00:01:51,892
we will sort it all out in a moment.
32

32

00:01:51,892  -->  00:01:53,348
Let me clean my screen.
33

33

00:01:53,348  -->  00:01:57,209
Okay, so jump over to Visual Studio,
open up StarDisplay, and
34

34

00:01:57,209  -->  00:01:59,573
we'll also need our Defender script.
35

35

00:01:59,573  -->  00:02:02,819
StarDisplay, we're looking at,
in particular,
36

36

00:02:02,819  -->  00:02:07,776
we're interested in the AddStars method
and we're looking to pass an amount.
37

37

00:02:07,776  -->  00:02:11,352
So if we go over to Defender now
as our script we're gonna work in,
38

38

00:02:11,352  -->  00:02:13,509
we'll create ourselves a new method.
39

39

00:02:13,509  -->  00:02:18,384
So give ourselves a couple of lines, it
will be a public method, public void, and
40

40

00:02:18,384  -->  00:02:20,096
we'll call this AddStars.
41

41

00:02:20,096  -->  00:02:23,750
So I am gonna call it the exact same
thing I am calling it on StarDisplay.
42

42

00:02:23,750  -->  00:02:26,298
You might want to call it something
slightly different if that is gonna
43

43

00:02:26,298  -->  00:02:26,822
confuse you.
44

44

00:02:26,822  -->  00:02:31,210
But I know that you're up for this
challenge and that you're not confused
45

45

00:02:31,210  -->  00:02:35,050
easily so it's all good, and
we will have an integer of amount.
46

46

00:02:35,050  -->  00:02:36,564
Now within here what are we doing?
47

47

00:02:36,564  -->  00:02:40,729
Well, it's pretty much just saying go and
do this thing is what we're up to.
48

48

00:02:40,729  -->  00:02:43,969
So if you know how to do
that pause the video and
49

49

00:02:43,969  -->  00:02:49,699
take on that little challenge there to
find that object and to call that method.
50

50

00:02:49,699  -->  00:02:52,834
Okay, what we're doing
is find object of type.
51

51

00:02:52,834  -->  00:02:56,715
The type is StarDisplay,
well, not star int display.
52

52

00:02:56,715  -->  00:03:01,656
Getting a little emotional, StarDisplay,
dot, what our method well, it is AddStars,
53

53

00:03:01,656  -->  00:03:03,486
that was the first one in my list.
54

54

00:03:03,486  -->  00:03:04,432
What are we parsing in?
55

55

00:03:04,432  -->  00:03:08,316
We're parsing this amount
that we are requiring,
56

56

00:03:08,316  -->  00:03:12,936
however calls the Defenders Method
of AddStars to parse in.
57

57

00:03:12,936  -->  00:03:16,945
So we'll also call this amount semicolon.
58

58

00:03:16,945  -->  00:03:19,784
Okay, now when we jump
back over into Unity,
59

59

00:03:19,784  -->  00:03:23,158
we will, you're not here's a time for
a challenge.
60

60

00:03:23,158  -->  00:03:25,291
I was nearly gonna give you the solution
to the challenge accidentally.
61

61

00:03:25,291  -->  00:03:27,557
Here's a challenge,
I think this is a pretty easy one.
62

62

00:03:27,557  -->  00:03:30,756
This should be something that you can
absolutely smash out of the park.
63

63

00:03:30,756  -->  00:03:35,653
Easy Peasy Lemon Squeezy is to use
an animation event on the trophy
64

64

00:03:35,653  -->  00:03:37,978
to add resources to our total.
65

65

00:03:37,978  -->  00:03:40,567
Add as many resources
as you like each time.
66

66

00:03:40,567  -->  00:03:42,063
And as bonus points,
67

67

00:03:42,063  -->  00:03:47,149
to make a little star grow out of
the trophy when the resources are added.
68

68

00:03:47,149  -->  00:03:51,058
And I've given you previously, we're using
this in one of our previous lectures in
69

69

00:03:51,058  -->  00:03:53,331
sprites currently not in use,
we have the star.
70

70

00:03:53,331  -->  00:03:57,407
That's what I'm gonna be having animate,
and I'll be using the animation system.
71

71

00:03:57,407  -->  00:03:59,315
I won't be doing it as an instantiation.
72

72

00:03:59,315  -->  00:04:03,354
So we making a star grow as well, but
the first thing is animation event and
73

73

00:04:03,354  -->  00:04:06,762
then taken on that star growing
animation as well if you like.
74

74

00:04:06,762  -->  00:04:10,535
So I will see you back here shortly.
75

75

00:04:10,535  -->  00:04:15,144
Okay, pretty straightforward I think,
if we're clicked on trophy, and
76

76

00:04:15,144  -->  00:04:18,083
we are accessing our
trophy animation in here.
77

77

00:04:18,083  -->  00:04:21,100
You can see, [SOUND] bounce,
where do I want to be calling?
78

78

00:04:21,100  -->  00:04:25,877
So where do I wanna say, make a new star,
AddStars' right about bang,
79

79

00:04:25,877  -->  00:04:27,243
when it slams down.
80

80

00:04:27,243  -->  00:04:30,962
I think that's a pretty cool spot, so
that's where I will click my Add Event.
81

81

00:04:30,962  -->  00:04:32,199
And I search from within here.
82

82

00:04:32,199  -->  00:04:34,407
We've got AddStars,
it's looking for how much.
83

83

00:04:34,407  -->  00:04:37,940
We're gonna have a really tiny amount, so
I want to have this happen quite regularly
84

84

00:04:37,940  -->  00:04:40,600
like little factories going [SOUND]
churning out a lot of stuff.
85

85

00:04:40,600  -->  00:04:42,186
So I'll add, say, all right, three.
86

86

00:04:42,186  -->  00:04:44,798
I don't even, I haven't played
around with the churning of this, so
87

87

00:04:44,798  -->  00:04:45,831
we'll see how that feels.
88

88

00:04:45,831  -->  00:04:49,112
Should add three stars
each time that plays.
89

89

00:04:49,112  -->  00:04:52,541
So I'm going to make sure I
apply that back to the prefab.
90

90

00:04:52,541  -->  00:04:55,304
Nothing to apply, because we've
been working on that animation.
91

91

00:04:55,304  -->  00:04:58,466
Cool, click on Play.
92

92

00:04:58,466  -->  00:05:01,804
Watch our score, 100, 103, 106, 109.
93

93

00:05:01,804  -->  00:05:02,786
I think that's really cool.
94

94

00:05:02,786  -->  00:05:04,210
I like this constant.
95

95

00:05:04,210  -->  00:05:08,346
And if we add another one or two or
three, it's gonna be adding tons.
96

96

00:05:08,346  -->  00:05:10,148
Click, click, click, click, all going,
97

97

00:05:10,148  -->  00:05:12,053
I like that,
I kind of like lots of little ones.
98

98

00:05:12,053  -->  00:05:14,612
The original Plants vs Zombie games,
you see it and you wait and you wait and
99

99

00:05:14,612  -->  00:05:15,797
you wait and you wait and you wait.
100

100

00:05:15,797  -->  00:05:19,115
And then a big kind of thing appears of
whatever it is, 100 points we'll say, and
101

101

00:05:19,115  -->  00:05:20,721
then you wait and wait and wait and wait.
102

102

00:05:20,721  -->  00:05:22,098
I like this constant progression.
103

103

00:05:22,098  -->  00:05:25,455
I think there's better feedback to
the player about, okay, this cactus costs,
104

104

00:05:25,455  -->  00:05:26,341
whatever, 100.
105

105

00:05:26,341  -->  00:05:28,421
I need to wait until I get to that point.
106

106

00:05:28,421  -->  00:05:29,453
Okay.
107

107

00:05:29,453  -->  00:05:32,032
So that's my preference,
you can do it however you like, though.
108

108

00:05:32,032  -->  00:05:35,541
You can change the timing and
pacing of your animation.
109

109

00:05:35,541  -->  00:05:38,992
So next thing I said is let's make
ourselves a little visualization for
110

110

00:05:38,992  -->  00:05:40,096
that so it looks cool.
111

111

00:05:40,096  -->  00:05:44,604
I've got my star, I will grab my star and
drag it into trophy,
112

112

00:05:44,604  -->  00:05:47,662
cuz that's where it'll be hanging out.
113

113

00:05:47,662  -->  00:05:52,611
And we have our just one single,
one single Sprite of our star.
114

114

00:05:52,611  -->  00:05:57,192
Cool, now, I'm also, let's see,
what level do we want this at?
115

115

00:05:57,192  -->  00:05:58,001
Well, we've got our trophy.
116

116

00:05:58,001  -->  00:05:59,695
We've got the top and the base.
117

117

00:05:59,695  -->  00:06:02,723
We've set this up in a nice way so
we can move things around.
118

118

00:06:02,723  -->  00:06:05,106
Do I want the star to belong to the top?
119

119

00:06:05,106  -->  00:06:09,210
So if I was to move the top over there,
my star is going to be over there as well.
120

120

00:06:09,210  -->  00:06:09,905
I don't think so.
121

121

00:06:09,905  -->  00:06:13,989
I think I want the star just to
belong to the entire trophy, so
122

122

00:06:13,989  -->  00:06:17,206
at the trophy level I will
add a new game object.
123

123

00:06:17,206  -->  00:06:18,401
So Create Empty.
124

124

00:06:18,401  -->  00:06:23,578
We'll call this Star, and then add a
component which will be a Sprite Renderer.
125

125

00:06:23,578  -->  00:06:26,637
It's not a spirit, a Sprite Renderer.
126

126

00:06:26,637  -->  00:06:28,038
There we go, Sprite Renderer.
127

127

00:06:28,038  -->  00:06:29,120
What do we want to have it look like?
128

128

00:06:29,120  -->  00:06:30,909
We wanna have it look like
this little star over here.
129

129

00:06:30,909  -->  00:06:32,701
Drag that into the sprite.
130

130

00:06:32,701  -->  00:06:35,895
Now change the Order in Layer to 6.
131

131

00:06:35,895  -->  00:06:37,542
I believe that'll have
it sit over the top.
132

132

00:06:37,542  -->  00:06:38,971
Great, it's nice and massive.
133

133

00:06:38,971  -->  00:06:42,364
We wish to scale that down a little bit,
I think, so I'll start off.
134

134

00:06:42,364  -->  00:06:47,964
Should we do this on our Sprite sheet or
should we do this on our game object?
135

135

00:06:47,964  -->  00:06:52,963
I'll do this on the Sprite sheet,
I think, so Pixels Per Unit,
136

136

00:06:52,963  -->  00:06:59,276
we will half that to 50, and then apply,
oops, that was the wrong way around.
137

137

00:06:59,276  -->  00:07:02,445
Okay, my bad,
200 pixels per unit and then apply.
138

138

00:07:02,445  -->  00:07:04,035
There we go, got myself back to front.
139

139

00:07:04,035  -->  00:07:06,791
Okay, as a starting point
make it a little bit smaller.
140

140

00:07:06,791  -->  00:07:07,695
That looks pretty cool.
141

141

00:07:07,695  -->  00:07:10,457
So just a reminder,
I clicked on my Sprite Asset and
142

142

00:07:10,457  -->  00:07:12,846
then changed the pixels per unit to 200.
143

143

00:07:12,846  -->  00:07:14,530
Okay so we have our Starlet animated.
144

144

00:07:14,530  -->  00:07:16,572
Now we'll Add Property, find the Star.
145

145

00:07:16,572  -->  00:07:17,702
Drill down into the star.
146

146

00:07:17,702  -->  00:07:20,035
I think I'm gonna use,
I'm gonna go pretty simple on this.
147

147

00:07:20,035  -->  00:07:24,389
I'll start off by adding Scale, and
then within my star scale just here,
148

148

00:07:24,389  -->  00:07:26,159
what do we wanna have happen?
149

149

00:07:26,159  -->  00:07:31,062
Well, I wanna have it nothing like
a zero scale, and then probably around
150

150

00:07:31,062  -->  00:07:35,824
about bump here start to appear, and
then grow and shrink a little bit.
151

151

00:07:35,824  -->  00:07:41,189
So I will find the point where I want
it to be at roughly the right size.
152

152

00:07:41,189  -->  00:07:43,194
So around about here,
I'll have it full size-ish.
153

153

00:07:43,194  -->  00:07:46,781
That's just a bit after my animation
event, so I click on Record,
154

154

00:07:46,781  -->  00:07:47,687
add a keyframe.
155

155

00:07:47,687  -->  00:07:52,576
I'm gonna drag my slider back to where
the animation event takes place.
156

156

00:07:52,576  -->  00:07:57,710
I could add a key frame or
I could just type straight in here 000.
157

157

00:07:57,710  -->  00:08:01,924
Then make sure I go all
the way back to the Start, and
158

158

00:08:01,924  -->  00:08:04,872
I go 000 on my scaling on my star.
159

159

00:08:04,872  -->  00:08:08,545
So it starts off as a key frame
saying that it's going to be 0000.
160

160

00:08:08,545  -->  00:08:13,357
The event takes place, the animation
events and then my Star start to grow.
161

161

00:08:13,357  -->  00:08:14,711
Okay, it gets trumped.
162

162

00:08:14,711  -->  00:08:17,962
Full-ish sized, that's probably
a little bit bigger than what I want.
163

163

00:08:17,962  -->  00:08:24,311
So we'll change it to 0.80 and
0.80, just to be thorough.
164

164

00:08:24,311  -->  00:08:28,025
And then that's the size of my
scaling that I want all the way at
165

165

00:08:28,025  -->  00:08:29,318
the very end as well.
166

166

00:08:29,318  -->  00:08:33,464
Okay, so that was a little bit of a clunky
way but you can see it's working.
167

167

00:08:33,464  -->  00:08:37,314
The manual way okay, so we have 0.8,
it's going from 000 grows to 0.8.
168

168

00:08:37,314  -->  00:08:39,638
Now we need to put a little bit
kind of a zig zaggy movement.
169

169

00:08:39,638  -->  00:08:42,098
Let me scroll in so
we can see this more easily.
170

170

00:08:42,098  -->  00:08:49,579
We'll also add a property of Star and
then transform and position.
171

171

00:08:49,579  -->  00:08:52,253
We can do a little bit of rotation
as well if our heart desires.
172

172

00:08:52,253  -->  00:08:54,552
We've got our star scrolling around here.
173

173

00:08:54,552  -->  00:08:57,310
Okay, you can see it's
growing from the middle.
174

174

00:08:57,310  -->  00:09:02,289
I'm going to actually start it
I think a little bit lower.
175

175

00:09:02,289  -->  00:09:05,214
So let's start Record,
get it in the position we want it to be,
176

176

00:09:05,214  -->  00:09:06,662
probably around about there.
177

177

00:09:06,662  -->  00:09:09,834
Move it up a little bit to that point.
178

178

00:09:09,834  -->  00:09:12,382
Drag the star up yonder.
179

179

00:09:12,382  -->  00:09:15,531
Little bit higher up here
all the way up to the top.
180

180

00:09:15,531  -->  00:09:17,997
I'm gonna sort of have
it zigzag up to the top.
181

181

00:09:17,997  -->  00:09:18,817
They how's that looking?
182

182

00:09:18,817  -->  00:09:20,306
Now drag along.
183

183

00:09:20,306  -->  00:09:22,695
Yeah, don't yeah,
just nice and simple actually.
184

184

00:09:22,695  -->  00:09:24,304
No, I'll put a little bit of variation.
185

185

00:09:24,304  -->  00:09:28,660
I'll zip it up to the top and
then it's gonna wobble a little bit.
186

186

00:09:28,660  -->  00:09:32,633
There we go, a little bit of wobbling,
nice and then I think I want it to,
187

187

00:09:32,633  -->  00:09:36,624
then it's making its way down to the back
end so we need to have it up here.
188

188

00:09:36,624  -->  00:09:42,445
I think I want it to shrink at the end,
so it kind of grows and then shrinks.
189

189

00:09:42,445  -->  00:09:45,461
So see how this just grows and
then shrinks.
190

190

00:09:45,461  -->  00:09:51,281
Grows, probably need another scaling key
frame in there just to keep it large-ish.
191

191

00:09:51,281  -->  00:09:53,743
Okay it's a little bit kind of
just fiddling around with it,
192

192

00:09:53,743  -->  00:09:54,868
won't go too much longer.
193

193

00:09:54,868  -->  00:09:57,144
I think that's fine, how's it going?
194

194

00:09:57,144  -->  00:10:00,948
Yep, wop, yep, okay cool,
that looks pretty neat I think.
195

195

00:10:00,948  -->  00:10:07,413
Let's test that out by back into the
games, make sure it all looks pretty good.
196

196

00:10:07,413  -->  00:10:08,827
Doesn't need to be super amazing.
197

197

00:10:08,827  -->  00:10:10,728
Yeah, and
it's floating up pretty quick, and
198

198

00:10:10,728  -->  00:10:12,637
it looks like it's coming
out of the base of it.
199

199

00:10:12,637  -->  00:10:14,235
Okay cool, we got there in the end.
200

200

00:10:14,235  -->  00:10:16,622
And did I apply that?
201

201

00:10:16,622  -->  00:10:17,718
Yeah, that looks cool.
202

202

00:10:17,718  -->  00:10:18,464
Awesome.
203

203

00:10:18,464  -->  00:10:19,744
Okay, and now our score is going up.
204

204

00:10:19,744  -->  00:10:22,843
Each time it hits, a little star is being
appeared, it looks like it's floating.
205

205

00:10:22,843  -->  00:10:26,928
The reason I've scaled it down at the end
is kind of, it's disappearing at the end.
206

206

00:10:26,928  -->  00:10:28,299
Great, happy with that.
207

207

00:10:28,299  -->  00:10:29,494
Okay, good stuff.
208

208

00:10:29,494  -->  00:10:33,348
We've got our star animating, we're adding
our scores so our resource is going up.
209

209

00:10:33,348  -->  00:10:36,244
I think in the next video we
need to get ourselves a cost so
210

210

00:10:36,244  -->  00:10:38,536
that we can actually
be spending our stars.
211

211

00:10:38,536  -->  00:10:40,350
Great work in this video, and
I'll see you again real soon.
