00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:04,091
[MUSIC]

2

00:00:04,091  -->  00:00:08,182
Hey, hey in this video, we're gonna be
creating a simple defender that has some
3

3

00:00:08,182  -->  00:00:10,660
animation and
maybe changes color a little bit.
4

4

00:00:10,660  -->  00:00:12,226
And an animation event that says,
5

5

00:00:12,226  -->  00:00:15,416
this is the point where we want it to
shoot out some sort of projectile.
6

6

00:00:15,416  -->  00:00:19,484
So that in upcoming videos, we can have
our defenders actually do defending.
7

7

00:00:19,484  -->  00:00:22,859
So let's jump in and
set up a simple defender prefab.
8

8

00:00:22,859  -->  00:00:26,661
A quick tidy up,
I'm gonna creat a empty game object.
9

9

00:00:26,661  -->  00:00:31,845
An empty game object to use better
grammar and I'll call this Sporners.
10

10

00:00:31,845  -->  00:00:37,098
Reset the transform of that and then just
place my five Sporners underneath that.
11

11

00:00:37,098  -->  00:00:39,627
So just tidy it up a little bit,
there we go.
12

12

00:00:39,627  -->  00:00:41,374
Lovely and my trophy.
13

13

00:00:41,374  -->  00:00:43,161
Have we prefabbed the trophy?
14

14

00:00:43,161  -->  00:00:44,155
Yes, we have.
15

15

00:00:44,155  -->  00:00:47,233
So I just removed the trophy
from the scene for now.
16

16

00:00:47,233  -->  00:00:49,544
Well, actually, nope,
I'm going to leave it there.
17

17

00:00:49,544  -->  00:00:52,239
So we keep it tidy and we don't
have things getting in the way, but
18

18

00:00:52,239  -->  00:00:55,533
it's sometimes good to have a visual
representation in a point of comparison.
19

19

00:00:55,533  -->  00:00:57,274
So let's leave it in there, okay?
20

20

00:00:57,274  -->  00:01:00,550
So what we need to do is start
off with a big old challenge,
21

21

00:01:00,550  -->  00:01:03,712
cuz I think you're ready to
take on all these aspects.
22

22

00:01:03,712  -->  00:01:08,093
That's creating a defender,
the animations and animated controller.
23

23

00:01:08,093  -->  00:01:11,352
So slice up the sprite sheet,
what I'm gonna do is choose.
24

24

00:01:11,352  -->  00:01:14,866
Let me see, so
we do this together from my not in use.
25

25

00:01:14,866  -->  00:01:16,436
I'm gonna create cactus.
26

26

00:01:16,436  -->  00:01:21,022
So let me just create a new folder here.
27

27

00:01:21,022  -->  00:01:23,290
Cache, cache does.
28

28

00:01:23,290  -->  00:01:27,745
Okay and then from my not in use,
I'm gonna grab cactus distitle and
29

29

00:01:27,745  -->  00:01:31,044
cactus dislooping and
drag this in to cache this.
30

30

00:01:31,044  -->  00:01:34,978
Okay, so slice u your sprite sheet,
the one that I was selecting they are not
31

31

00:01:34,978  -->  00:01:38,975
the ones and create an idle animation
from the idle animation sprite sheet and
32

32

00:01:38,975  -->  00:01:42,574
create an attack animation from
the attack animation sprite sheet.
33

33

00:01:42,574  -->  00:01:47,525
And then to add an animation event when
you feel that the defender should shoot
34

34

00:01:47,525  -->  00:01:51,942
a projectile at that to the attack
animation, an animation event and
35

35

00:01:51,942  -->  00:01:56,893
then to create an animated controller
where we start off in idle animation and
36

36

00:01:56,893  -->  00:01:59,203
then just go straight into attack.
37

37

00:01:59,203  -->  00:02:02,958
So at the moment we won't have any sort of
trigger to say to go from idle to attack,
38

38

00:02:02,958  -->  00:02:05,736
but we'll have our shape set up,
so we're ready for that.
39

39

00:02:05,736  -->  00:02:07,564
So it's a pretty meaty challenge, jump in.
40

40

00:02:07,564  -->  00:02:10,399
Take that on, I'll see you back
here when you've got that done or
41

41

00:02:10,399  -->  00:02:11,698
you can do it at the same time.
42

42

00:02:11,698  -->  00:02:15,688
I'm doing it just now,
if you'd like to do that.
43

43

00:02:15,688  -->  00:02:16,494
Okay, let's see.
44

44

00:02:16,494  -->  00:02:19,910
So we've got our idle and
I'm going to slice it up.
45

45

00:02:19,910  -->  00:02:25,317
Change my sprite mode to multiple,
click on Apply.
46

46

00:02:25,317  -->  00:02:27,165
Now let's have a look at this.
47

47

00:02:27,165  -->  00:02:31,647
Cactus Idle and
take note it's 924 by 1008.
48

48

00:02:31,647  -->  00:02:36,745
Get out my calculator, Calculator,
cuz I'm gonna slice by grid.
49

49

00:02:36,745  -->  00:02:38,064
This will be not, how many have we got?
50

50

00:02:38,064  -->  00:02:39,954
One, two, three, four, five, six.
51

51

00:02:39,954  -->  00:02:44,848
So 942 divided by 6 equals 157.
52

52

00:02:44,848  -->  00:02:49,738
I'm gonna write that down
on my bit of paper here and
53

53

00:02:49,738  -->  00:02:54,624
then 108 divided by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
54

54

00:02:54,624  -->  00:02:58,861
7, 8, 1008 divided by 8 is 126.
55

55

00:02:58,861  -->  00:03:03,630
Now, we go into sprite editor.
56

56

00:03:03,630  -->  00:03:08,712
Go up to slice,
change this to grid by cell size and
57

57

00:03:08,712  -->  00:03:12,836
we'll change this to 157 by 126.
58

58

00:03:12,836  -->  00:03:15,665
I've done this before, so
it should be pretty familiar.
59

59

00:03:15,665  -->  00:03:18,459
That's all looking pretty good with
just a little bit of a cycle through.
60

60

00:03:18,459  -->  00:03:19,904
Yeah, that looks good.
61

61

00:03:19,904  -->  00:03:21,519
Okay, it's all looking pretty good.
62

62

00:03:21,519  -->  00:03:23,713
Nothing's been chopped off
at all looks in a good spot.
63

63

00:03:23,713  -->  00:03:25,537
Okay, then click on Apply.
64

64

00:03:25,537  -->  00:03:28,492
Nice, close that out for now.
65

65

00:03:28,492  -->  00:03:31,352
We have our sprite sheet sliced up.
66

66

00:03:31,352  -->  00:03:33,853
I'll go and slice up the other one for
now while I'm here.
67

67

00:03:33,853  -->  00:03:37,500
The cactus looping,
otherwise known as the Cactus Attack.
68

68

00:03:37,500  -->  00:03:38,943
Sounds like a bad movie, doesn't it?
69

69

00:03:38,943  -->  00:03:41,548
Multiple, [LAUGH] click Apply.
70

70

00:03:41,548  -->  00:03:43,071
Click on the sprite editor.
71

71

00:03:43,071  -->  00:03:44,752
This is different again, okay.
72

72

00:03:44,752  -->  00:03:47,410
Let me find the cactus looping,
the dimensions here.
73

73

00:03:47,410  -->  00:03:50,958
So left to right, we've got one,
two, three, four, five, six.
74

74

00:03:50,958  -->  00:03:53,560
This has got a lot of images on it,
hasn't it?
75

75

00:03:53,560  -->  00:03:58,137
So this is 942 that I'm getting from
76

76

00:03:58,137  -->  00:04:03,385
down here in the dimensions divided by 6.
77

77

00:04:03,385  -->  00:04:04,639
That's 157 again.
78

78

00:04:04,639  -->  00:04:09,455
Okay, that makes it easy and
then it is 1638.
79

79

00:04:09,455  -->  00:04:10,968
I think this is gonna be exactly the same.
80

80

00:04:10,968  -->  00:04:14,687
1638 divided by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
81

81

00:04:14,687  -->  00:04:19,517
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 126.
82

82

00:04:19,517  -->  00:04:20,696
Yes, it is exactly the same.
83

83

00:04:20,696  -->  00:04:21,585
Okay, great.
84

84

00:04:21,585  -->  00:04:23,746
157, 126, slice that up.
85

85

00:04:23,746  -->  00:04:25,022
It all looks pretty good.
86

86

00:04:25,022  -->  00:04:30,163
Click on Apply and job is done, fantastic.
87

87

00:04:30,163  -->  00:04:33,603
Did you play the old Warcraft
games way back in the day?
88

88

00:04:33,603  -->  00:04:35,570
Warcraft II, job's done.
89

89

00:04:35,570  -->  00:04:38,630
That's how the peasant used to say
that they'd finished their job.
90

90

00:04:38,630  -->  00:04:41,096
That's what I thought of just now and
I'm saying job done.
91

91

00:04:41,096  -->  00:04:45,051
Okay, Cactus Idle,
highlight all of the Idle frames,
92

92

00:04:45,051  -->  00:04:47,669
right-click, create animation.
93

93

00:04:47,669  -->  00:04:48,851
There it is.
94

94

00:04:48,851  -->  00:04:54,179
Animation, we'll call this Cactus Idle.
95

95

00:04:54,179  -->  00:04:58,215
Drag my Cactus Idle animation
to my animation folder.
96

96

00:04:58,215  -->  00:05:02,164
Now we will create our next animation
which will be cactus looping,
97

97

00:05:02,164  -->  00:05:04,046
highlight all of these frames.
98

98

00:05:04,046  -->  00:05:09,893
There's ton of them, 63 and
then create animation and
99

99

00:05:09,893  -->  00:05:14,371
we'll call this Cactus Attack,
Cactus Attack.
100

100

00:05:14,371  -->  00:05:18,147
There we go, drop that into
the animation folder as well.
101

101

00:05:18,147  -->  00:05:19,430
Soon, we'll need to organize this.
102

102

00:05:19,430  -->  00:05:20,389
Actually, it's getting pretty close.
103

103

00:05:20,389  -->  00:05:25,076
I'm gonna organize this into attackers and
defenders, so create a new folder.
104

104

00:05:25,076  -->  00:05:32,045
Attackers and
then another folder, defenders.
105

105

00:05:32,045  -->  00:05:36,947
And then the cactus
goes into attackers and
106

106

00:05:36,947  -->  00:05:41,450
the lizard goes into, sorry attacks.
107

107

00:05:41,450  -->  00:05:42,695
God, I've got everything wrong here.
108

108

00:05:42,695  -->  00:05:43,824
It's attackers.
109

109

00:05:43,824  -->  00:05:48,416
Rick, you dingbat and then we need to,
did I just put them in there?
110

110

00:05:48,416  -->  00:05:51,766
Okay, so the cactus is a defender.
111

111

00:05:51,766  -->  00:05:54,240
Thank you for
those of you yelling at the screen.
112

112

00:05:54,240  -->  00:05:55,349
Rick, what are you doing?
113

113

00:05:55,349  -->  00:05:59,682
And then we have the trophy,
which technically is a defender.
114

114

00:05:59,682  -->  00:06:00,851
It's one of the goodies.
115

115

00:06:00,851  -->  00:06:02,146
Okay, here we go.
116

116

00:06:02,146  -->  00:06:05,278
Now that we've done that,
let's while we're here,
117

117

00:06:05,278  -->  00:06:08,421
let's just quickly create
our animated controller.
118

118

00:06:08,421  -->  00:06:13,021
So right-click,
Create &gt; Animator Controller that
119

119

00:06:13,021  -->  00:06:17,921
we'll call cactus and
then click on the animator window.
120

120

00:06:17,921  -->  00:06:20,224
This should be the animator controller for
the cactus.
121

121

00:06:20,224  -->  00:06:21,702
Yes, it looks like it indeed.
122

122

00:06:21,702  -->  00:06:23,966
Excellent, what do we need to do next?
123

123

00:06:23,966  -->  00:06:25,923
Well, we need to create a game object.
124

124

00:06:25,923  -->  00:06:28,644
I didn't have that on my list, hopefully
you figured that out and found it.
125

125

00:06:28,644  -->  00:06:33,280
So right-click,
create empty this will be called cactus.
126

126

00:06:33,280  -->  00:06:36,440
Reset the transform back down to zero,
zero.
127

127

00:06:36,440  -->  00:06:39,278
We need to give this a sprite render, so
128

128

00:06:39,278  -->  00:06:43,494
we can see what it looks like and
see where it is in the game.
129

129

00:06:43,494  -->  00:06:47,042
Now pick one of our frames, so
go to cactus for the sprites.
130

130

00:06:47,042  -->  00:06:50,838
Which one do we wanna have represent
just how the cactus looks normally?
131

131

00:06:50,838  -->  00:06:53,890
Cactus one just fine and dandy, and
132

132

00:06:53,890  -->  00:06:58,588
we will drag Cactus Looping_1over
onto our sprite.
133

133

00:06:58,588  -->  00:06:59,390
There we go.
134

134

00:06:59,390  -->  00:07:03,104
Now change the border to five,
that's all the same.
135

135

00:07:03,104  -->  00:07:04,550
Great, that looks pretty good.
136

136

00:07:04,550  -->  00:07:09,410
Moving on to the thing might be a tiny bit
too big, but I'll leave it big for now.
137

137

00:07:09,410  -->  00:07:12,888
You can have a little bit of overlap,
perhaps and see how that goes.
138

138

00:07:12,888  -->  00:07:16,815
You can change that pretty easily later on
just by changing out pixels per unit in
139

139

00:07:16,815  -->  00:07:17,761
our spreadsheet.
140

140

00:07:17,761  -->  00:07:18,583
So here we go.
141

141

00:07:18,583  -->  00:07:20,104
We've got a cactus on the screen.
142

142

00:07:20,104  -->  00:07:22,188
We've got some animations.
143

143

00:07:22,188  -->  00:07:26,912
Let's go back to our animated
controller in defenders.
144

144

00:07:26,912  -->  00:07:28,612
Okay, got cactus here.
145

145

00:07:28,612  -->  00:07:33,171
Cactus dragging, our cactus first of all,
dragging the idle, Cactus Idle.
146

146

00:07:33,171  -->  00:07:37,158
Blink, that creates that as it's
first step and then Cactus Attack.
147

147

00:07:37,158  -->  00:07:41,053
We'll do the same as we did before where
we say, right-click from Cactus Idle,
148

148

00:07:41,053  -->  00:07:42,904
make transition into Cactus Attack.
149

149

00:07:42,904  -->  00:07:46,080
At the moment there's no condition for
when it should go into there,
150

150

00:07:46,080  -->  00:07:49,499
it'll just go straight in there after
it finishes doing its Cactus Idle.
151

151

00:07:49,499  -->  00:07:52,907
Have a look at the transition and
just clean that up a little bit.
152

152

00:07:52,907  -->  00:07:57,142
I like to have a 0 transition for
these 2D assets.
153

153

00:07:57,142  -->  00:08:01,139
Get that out of the way, that's pretty
good and then the exit time of one.
154

154

00:08:01,139  -->  00:08:02,439
Great, great stuff.
155

155

00:08:02,439  -->  00:08:07,408
Okay, Cactus Idle, let's make sure
it is not looping in our animation.
156

156

00:08:07,408  -->  00:08:09,344
Yep, that's correct and
then cactus attack.
157

157

00:08:09,344  -->  00:08:13,661
We'll leave that looping,
I think and loop that.
158

158

00:08:13,661  -->  00:08:15,632
Okay, that should be all pretty good.
159

159

00:08:15,632  -->  00:08:23,947
Last bit here is we need to say that
we need an animator on our cactus.
160

160

00:08:23,947  -->  00:08:26,835
Animator and
then what's our animator controller?
161

161

00:08:26,835  -->  00:08:30,121
Click on selector, it will be the cactus.
162

162

00:08:30,121  -->  00:08:35,481
Now all going to plan, that should animate
our cactus that goes from idle And
163

163

00:08:35,481  -->  00:08:38,599
the idle and
the attack are pretty similar.
164

164

00:08:38,599  -->  00:08:40,239
Well, that's very slow.
165

165

00:08:40,239  -->  00:08:44,874
And then [SOUND] okay, so again,
I wanna speed that up a whole bunch.
166

166

00:08:44,874  -->  00:08:46,207
Let's go and have a look at that.
167

167

00:08:46,207  -->  00:08:51,723
Cactus Idle for the moment for
animation is 12 frames per second and
168

168

00:08:51,723  -->  00:08:54,778
we've got tons, and tons of frames.
169

169

00:08:54,778  -->  00:08:57,819
Okay, so let us change that to,
170

170

00:08:57,819  -->  00:09:03,461
make it 24 like our other ones and
then the cactus attack.
171

171

00:09:03,461  -->  00:09:06,963
We'll make that 24 as well
just have a look at that.
172

172

00:09:06,963  -->  00:09:09,732
Make sure it's all looking nice and
neat, and tidy.
173

173

00:09:09,732  -->  00:09:11,631
So bounce, bounce, a little bit of bounce.
174

174

00:09:11,631  -->  00:09:13,167
And then now I'm gonna shoot.
175

175

00:09:13,167  -->  00:09:15,759
Okay, that's looking pretty good and
then it loops around.
176

176

00:09:15,759  -->  00:09:20,297
What I'll do in here just add one
little bit of flair into our attack,
177

177

00:09:20,297  -->  00:09:25,630
if I can get this happening is if I click
on the cactus attack animation which I am.
178

178

00:09:25,630  -->  00:09:27,471
I'm gonna click on Record.
179

179

00:09:27,471  -->  00:09:31,164
It's not letting me do that,
because I need to click on my cactus, and
180

180

00:09:31,164  -->  00:09:32,677
now it should let me record.
181

181

00:09:32,677  -->  00:09:34,599
Yes, click on Record.
182

182

00:09:34,599  -->  00:09:37,620
Move it to where I think it should shoot.
183

183

00:09:37,620  -->  00:09:41,000
Sorry, I'm on idle at the moment just
change the selection here to attack.
184

184

00:09:41,000  -->  00:09:44,958
Now, click on Record and
move it up to, maybe it's gonna go.
185

185

00:09:44,958  -->  00:09:49,685
[SOUND] Okay, [SOUND] so
the animation's not really made for
186

186

00:09:49,685  -->  00:09:55,389
shooting bullets, but maybe just as
it opens its mouth wide up there.
187

187

00:09:55,389  -->  00:09:58,003
So what I'll do is I'll add
an animation even in a moment.
188

188

00:09:58,003  -->  00:10:00,202
Actually, I'll do that right now
just click my animation event.
189

189

00:10:00,202  -->  00:10:01,391
We'll come back to that in a moment.
190

190

00:10:01,391  -->  00:10:05,860
What I'm gonna do in here is just change
the color of my sprite renderer on
191

191

00:10:05,860  -->  00:10:06,681
the cactus.
192

192

00:10:06,681  -->  00:10:11,670
So we will have it build up
to some sort of bright color.
193

193

00:10:11,670  -->  00:10:15,172
Watch we have it build up to a red.
194

194

00:10:15,172  -->  00:10:18,536
It's gonna be a little bit ugly,
my friends, but that's okay.
195

195

00:10:18,536  -->  00:10:23,098
Maybe build up to a bright green and then
I'm going to move back a little bit here.
196

196

00:10:23,098  -->  00:10:27,655
So we've got a key frame and then move
back to here a little bit on my selection,
197

197

00:10:27,655  -->  00:10:29,670
and put that back to normal white.
198

198

00:10:29,670  -->  00:10:32,530
So then, turn off my record mode.
199

199

00:10:32,530  -->  00:10:35,483
It should go normal, normal, normal and
then bright green and then blunk.
200

200

00:10:35,483  -->  00:10:37,016
Okay, it stayed on bright green.
201

201

00:10:37,016  -->  00:10:38,697
So I wanna have it after it shoots.
202

202

00:10:38,697  -->  00:10:44,516
I wanna have it go back to being white
again or no tinting as the case might be.
203

203

00:10:44,516  -->  00:10:47,051
Okay, so I'll click on Play,
see how this looks.
204

204

00:10:47,051  -->  00:10:52,095
[SOUND] And then building up and
then down, building up and down.
205

205

00:10:52,095  -->  00:10:55,206
So you could put a little bit of a flash
at the end there just as it shoots.
206

206

00:10:55,206  -->  00:10:56,978
It could be yellow, for example.
207

207

00:10:56,978  -->  00:11:00,080
But this is gonna give the player
a little bit of visual flair.
208

208

00:11:00,080  -->  00:11:01,485
So there's a lot more you can do for
color.
209

209

00:11:01,485  -->  00:11:04,513
I think this is pretty interesting
white add some depth to this bright.
210

210

00:11:04,513  -->  00:11:09,042
So we've got, now we have our animation
event and I believe that's looking
211

211

00:11:09,042  -->  00:11:14,093
a littler bit different as were expecting
as we don't have any script on our cactus.
212

212

00:11:14,093  -->  00:11:19,708
And a defender script as we have with our
lizard, we've got another script on there.
213

213

00:11:19,708  -->  00:11:22,424
So it's looking a little bit different,
our animation event.
214

214

00:11:22,424  -->  00:11:23,629
So we'll leave it for now.
215

215

00:11:23,629  -->  00:11:25,356
We've got everything setup
that we wanted to setup.
216

216

00:11:25,356  -->  00:11:27,661
This was just a quick little video to say,
let's get our.
217

217

00:11:27,661  -->  00:11:29,175
Defender ready and raring.
218

218

00:11:29,175  -->  00:11:30,915
We've out or event in there.
219

219

00:11:30,915  -->  00:11:33,613
That's the point where we want
to say this is where you shoot.
220

220

00:11:33,613  -->  00:11:34,922
Okay, that's looking pretty good.
221

221

00:11:34,922  -->  00:11:35,808
We've got our defender.
222

222

00:11:35,808  -->  00:11:40,890
Last step of prefabbing that, so
drag our cactus down into your prefabs.
223

223

00:11:40,890  -->  00:11:44,211
We'll do a little bit more
work on the cactus, so
224

224

00:11:44,211  -->  00:11:46,973
I'll leave it up here in our hierarchy.
225

225

00:11:46,973  -->  00:11:51,125
Good stuff, so we're ready to create some
functionality where the cactus will shoot
226

226

00:11:51,125  -->  00:11:53,619
and be damaged and
have health all of those things.
227

227

00:11:53,619  -->  00:11:55,030
So great work and
I'll see you in the next video.
