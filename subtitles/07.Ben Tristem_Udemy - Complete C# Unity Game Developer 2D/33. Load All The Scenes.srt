Hello Mark.
1

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:05,660
I I'm in this video.
2

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:10,420
We're going to be creating our Start Menu our game over menu putting in our text and creating our buttons
3

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,450
so that we can do things such as logging on START and Starting our game.
4

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:19,370
So things that we've done before about superimportant to make sure that we've got a four game loop so
5

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,010
that's jumping to get started.
6

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,110
This video's going to be structured as a big challenge for you.
7

8
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,010
So the challenge is to connect the scenes.
8

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:32,960
What I mean by that is to create a Start menu scene and a game overseen that we can connect with our
9

10
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:40,250
games screen and the buttons you all need on the Start menu are a start game and quit an on the game
10

11
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:45,120
overseen you need a player in end main menu so make sure you've got that functionality.
11

12
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:51,050
And we need to have a level dot C S where we write our public methods.
12

13
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:57,680
We need to have a load game over method load games scene loads start menu and quick game.
13

14
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,640
Now what I'd like to say is that I'm going to do this in a very simple way.
14

15
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:10,040
I'm just going to literally say load the game over scene by using a string reference and just that part
15

16
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,880
of the reason to do that is so that we can use it because we haven't used it before and to see what
16

17
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,640
the pros and cons are of doing that.
17

18
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:21,460
If you want to do something that's more sophisticated or more complicated or more scalable then absolutely
18

19
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:22,560
go ahead and doing that.
19

20
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,830
To do that particularly if you're a bit more experienced.
20

21
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,590
Sorry take on that challenge and see you back here soon.
21

22
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:33,140
Okay so the first thing to do is just to make sure that everything is prefabbed so that I can easily
22

23
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,140
create new scenes knowing that I have my prefabbed items my Starfield closeness staff feel fine need
23

24
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,040
to drag into my prefab for is one at a time.
24

25
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,750
Starfield There we go.
25

26
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,200
Roger that's hanging out my saying I'm going to get rid of him now.
26

27
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,000
I think we need him.
27

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,250
Thank you so much Roger for your support.
28

29
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,230
And we're ready to roll also right click in the hierarchy create empty.
29

30
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:59,450
I will rename this to be level as a level game object would be level controller or level loading but
30

31
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:04,580
I was going to court level reset the transform by right clicking on level.
31

32
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:11,180
I need to add a script so into my scripts folder right click create a C sharp script which I will call
32

33
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:11,900
level.
33

34
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,450
Again this could be level loading because that's all it's doing.
34

35
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:18,500
But until we have more functionality just calling it level is totally fine.
35

36
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,360
So drag level over onto our level game object and we're ready to roll.
36

37
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,490
Double click on that.
37

38
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,760
Which will open up visual studio.
38

39
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,400
I am going to remove my start and update method and create a few public methods in here that we can
39

40
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,080
call so.
40

41
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,010
First of all public volleyed What shall we do first.
41

42
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,400
I will do star load so low.
42

43
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,110
Start menu.
43

44
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:49,770
And then open those parentheses curly braces.
44

45
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:59,200
We need to use the scene management so using unity engine Dort seen management semicolon make sure we
45

46
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,650
are using that and then what are we doing in our load's start menu while I'm going to do a very literal
46

47
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,290
way of working through this.
47

48
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,160
I'm going to say just load this particular scene.
48

49
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,680
It's not super scalable and it's something you can get stuck.
49

50
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,300
If you do it the wrong way.
50

51
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,450
But I want to show you a slightly different way to what we've done in other videos and what we're going
51

52
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,270
to do and other sections of the course loads start menu.
52

53
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:29,760
I know in my game that start menu is always going to be the very first scene in my game so I'm going
53

54
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,440
to say.
54

55
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:36,700
Scene manager daut Load scene and then in parentheses I'm going to put 0.
55

56
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,840
Because I know this will absolutely be seen as zero.
56

57
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:46,870
The very first scene I know that for a fact if it was in the first scene then things would not go well
57

58
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,680
so it's just fine.
58

59
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,520
Bear in mind take the next method public and avoid load.
59

60
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,300
What are we learning.
60

61
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:55,940
Load the MAIN game again.
61

62
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:00,580
I've only got one level in my game if you have a game where you complete the level and you go the next
62

63
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,050
level.
63

64
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,510
Next level then you need to do something similar to what we did and block break.
64

65
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:08,950
But I've just got the one game scene sorry in here.
65

66
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,720
Actually I don't call it.
66

67
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm just going to call it load game because in my scenes it's actually called who did it.
67

68
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,000
It seems called game so I just call that load game and then parentheses.
68

69
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:30,740
And in our ops in our calibrators he is seen manager dot.
69

70
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:31,460
Seen.
70

71
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,900
And I'm going to do this slightly differently.
71

72
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,470
Then I did my load.
72

73
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,530
The start menu just to show you a different way of doing this.
73

74
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:48,110
I'm going to use a string reference for this where I have in my quotations game and then semicolon.
74

75
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:52,930
So you can load something based upon the scene index or based upon the name of the scene.
75

76
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,550
Why don't we like string references.
76

77
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,620
Well if I went and changed the name of game to B.
77

78
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,360
I don't know.
78

79
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,570
Level 1 for example or WIPs or main game or any of those sorts of things.
79

80
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,860
Then my string reference in here won't update and it won't know what's going on but I wanted to do it
80

81
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,670
so that we've seen how it is done.
81

82
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,200
OK.
82

83
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:15,350
Next up another public method public void and we will do in here.
83

84
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:18,590
The load game over.
84

85
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,830
Parentheses and then our curly braces again.
85

86
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,060
Seen manager.
86

87
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:32,830
Dot load's seen and I know always my game over it is going to be called Game Over.
87

88
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,620
So I'll put that in my quotations.
88

89
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,020
Very cool.
89

90
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,480
And then the last thing we need in here public voyt Aid.
90

91
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,830
What are we going to call this quits game.
91

92
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:52,640
Parentheses And then my colleague bracers work in a tight application dot quipped.
92

93
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,620
Parentheses semicolon.
93

94
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:02,520
We've got quit game load game over load game and load start menu that's all look pretty good.
94

95
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,770
Now let's go and make ourselves some scenes.
95

96
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:08,810
And I'm going to create my scenes two different ways again to show you two different ways.
96

97
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,500
You might have done at one or you might have done it the other way before I forget.
97

98
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:17,960
I'm going to prefabbed my level game object set sitting in there so everything is blurry That means
98

99
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,310
everything's being prefect.
99

100
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:19,720
OK.
100

101
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:26,200
So within scenes a right click create scene if I find scene there it is scene.
101

102
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,790
We'll call this start menu.
102

103
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:36,870
Start menu Exel want and then with my start menu double click on that save Yeah I'll save whatever we
103

104
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,610
chose we made to game.
104

105
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:43,660
Okay now if I go in a prefabs I should be able to drag all of the relevant prefabs in.
105

106
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:48,450
So I've got a background although this one looks like the background and that one says background but
106

107
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,570
neither of them have my background script on.
107

108
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:51,390
So this is great.
108

109
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:58,740
I think we've forgotten to update our prefabs So let me just go back to my game scene and find the background
109

110
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,950
that's in the game.
110

111
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,560
You can see that there's bold font because I haven't clicked on our.
111

112
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,800
Okay back to start menu.
112

113
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,890
Get rid of the main camera.
113

114
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:15,990
We don't need that because we have our own main camera dropped in drop in the background drop in the
114

115
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:21,470
star field the reason I'm doing this is just so the first scene like the start scene looks interesting.
115

116
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,590
It's got our background.
116

117
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,040
If you don't have to do that you can have something totally totally different.
117

118
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,740
You don't have to have all this game stuff in there.
118

119
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,060
Don't need the player don't need the enemy.
119

120
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,110
Do need the level so we know what we're loading.
120

121
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,010
Blue background.
121

122
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,700
I think that's all yes pretty good.
122

123
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,030
Okay.
123

124
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,760
Next up we're going to need our canvas because we need to be putting text and stuff on there.
124

125
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:46,740
But here's one of those exceptions prefab rule we've gone and prefabbed the canvas from our game.
125

126
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:51,900
But if we go and change and put start like kind of stuff on here we don't want that to be applied to
126

127
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,700
our game canvas.
127

128
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:57,750
So the prefab canvas we have is actually the game canvas.
128

129
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:04,440
And I can start off with the game canvas as inspiration so I drag that into my scene game canvas.
129

130
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,760
I don't want to be applying anything back to it because it'll break the game canvas.
130

131
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,000
But what I do want to do is use that as my base so I know that I'm starting off with the right sort
131

132
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,760
of screen resolution and scaling etc..
132

133
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:20,970
What we can do here is go up to game object and break prefab instance.
133

134
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:27,360
That means that this is no longer linked to that particular prefab it is now its own thing its now its
134

135
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,650
own game object.
135

136
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:35,120
I can rename this from game canvas to start menu Start menu.
136

137
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:36,900
Cambers.
137

138
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,590
Hit enter.
138

139
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,560
And now I can drag that down a prefab that so it adds its own separate prefab.
139

140
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,750
Okay so under Start Menu canvas right click.
140

141
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:55,660
Fine UI text mesh probe using text mesh porro you could just use straight up text if you wanted.
141

142
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:59,280
But I think I'll go a text message broca's the scaling works a little bit better it's a little bit of
142

143
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:05,010
a clean font import if you need to do that you might not need to if your projects already been set up
143

144
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:07,730
with that but it once made it import the essentials.
144

145
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,480
Close that window down.
145

146
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,510
Now we have new tech sitting in the middle.
146

147
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:15,030
Our rename this to be laser d Friend.
147

148
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,740
K. in that voice is very important.
148

149
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,240
Just increase the font size for now to say 120 Okay.
149

150
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:29,830
And I will need to double click on my start menu canvas so I can see the canvas itself.
150

151
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:38,410
Click on the text mesh pro text rename that to be heading text heading text and then click on my ARE
151

152
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,980
told my T all.
152

153
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,590
Drag to the right track to the left.
153

154
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,700
Zoom in a little bit drag it up okay.
154

155
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:50,720
Click on my w-2 all drag it up a little bit about them.
155

156
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,610
Okay so we need to make our font a little bit nicer than it is at the moment.
156

157
00:09:54,780 --> 00:10:00,580
And for me I've gone to duff font and found the what is it best man forever faunt.
157

158
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,980
And I think looks pretty neat.
158

159
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:07,370
Downloaded that and I have that as some fonts that I can unzip just here.
159

160
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,960
A jump Pogo into unity.
160

161
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,600
And I will create a new asset folder.
161

162
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,980
Actually a new folder in assets.
162

163
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,860
Right click create folder called the folder fonts.
163

164
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,620
Within font's open that up.
164

165
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,150
Now if I go to my Windows Explorer I can get my two fonts in drag.
165

166
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:34,590
And so the Batmen man forever font had two fonts one is soldered and one is just the outline which looks
166

167
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:37,150
pretty cool so we can use that to good effect.
167

168
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:41,250
You can use whatever font you want you don't have to use the same font as me jump around we've done
168

169
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:45,420
this a couple of times so it should be a pretty familiar process of finding some fonts.
169

170
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:51,510
So within hitting text actually first of all we need to convert these in a text mesh pro fonts so up
170

171
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:55,320
to window text mesh Perro font asset creator.
171

172
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,790
This might be a little bit different in future editions as these packages become bit more integrated
172

173
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,200
but this is what we do for now.
173

174
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:06,660
Grab the first font drag it into font source Quicken generate font Atlas when it's done.
174

175
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,100
We'll click on save as just on the same fonts folder.
175

176
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,410
So save as it should already be in the right fonts folder save.
176

177
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:16,420
That's all good.
177

178
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,820
And then grab the other font drag that into font source.
178

179
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,180
Generate font Atlas.
179

180
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,470
Wait for a moment waiting waiting.
180

181
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:27,230
Did a little boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo.
181

182
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:33,880
Okay, that's all done. Save as. Same spot. Save. I can close down my window in my front.
182

183
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:36,300
Create a window and we have what we need.
183

184
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,610
Back over into hitting text.
184

185
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:39,880
Scroll down a little bit.
185

186
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,150
Drag trying to.
186

187
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,220
I want and I will drag the first one over.
187

188
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,900
See how that looks okay.
188

189
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,620
That looks pretty awesome.
189

190
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,070
Centre my laser defender Tex.
190

191
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:53,590
Give it a bit of a funky colour by scrolling to colour vertex click on that.
191

192
00:11:53,750 --> 00:12:00,170
Maybe a little bit more of a bright gaudy kind of lazara.
192

193
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:00,670
There we go.
193

194
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,250
Okay nice and bright bright eyes lots of it.
194

195
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,320
That's the point.
195

196
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,450
And now.
196

197
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,470
I think that is cool.
197

198
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:17,820
Going to click on my heading text duplicate make ourselves a sub beheading sub heading and the subheading
198

199
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,960
What shall we say in here.
199

200
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,280
Just move it down underneath the main heading we'll say.
200

201
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:26,490
Protest.
201

202
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,600
Yeah okay.
202

203
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,530
And then make this a smaller font maybe 60.
203

204
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,400
See how that fits.
204

205
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:38,710
Oh it's pretty good move that down a touch and we'll see how it looks with the other font.
205

206
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,150
Protect the earth.
206

207
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:44,420
Okay a little bit the bit harder to read.
207

208
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,470
Maskell gives us some possess I will leave that light.
208

209
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,040
That is I think.
209

210
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,590
Okay now for our buttons so right click again start menu canvas.
210

211
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:59,880
We will create UI and make this our style of making this is a text message pro text and then I'll add
211

212
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,370
a button component to it.
212

213
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,270
Is text message pro text.
213

214
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:07,110
We will name start but 10.
214

215
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:13,490
Change the font to be the solid Batman font.
215

216
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,350
Increase the size to say 100.
216

217
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:24,850
Give ourselves a little bit more space using the teat all drag to the riot drag to the left.
217

218
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,350
Okay that looks pretty good.
218

219
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:32,520
And then this is just going to be straight up Start centre a line.
219

220
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,980
Find alignment Centre.
220

221
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,240
That's pretty good.
221

222
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,470
Doesn't really we'll call centre line though does it.
222

223
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,720
Not compared to that.
223

224
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,220
What have we done wrong here.
224

225
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:46,190
Maybe it just needs to be moved into the actual centre so it looks centred.
225

226
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:51,810
Okay let's be sure this drag out text box all the way to the side all the way it is so I could do some
226

227
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:55,710
anchoring here but I'm going to do a little bit fast and loose.
227

228
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,620
We've gone through ide's.
228

229
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,340
The one above that's not so right.
229

230
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,840
We'll done through this a few times.
230

231
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:04,570
I'm not going to do it the super deliberate careful explain everything why I'm going to do more of the
231

232
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,250
fast reminder way.
232

233
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:08,040
And if you've got any problems at all.
233

234
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,910
Throw me in the Q and A and we can help you out.
234

235
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,170
OK so let's start.
235

236
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:17,050
I'm gonna make start huge because I think it needs to have super duper important So 160.
236

237
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:18,330
There we go start.
237

238
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:22,640
Very clearly what we need to do and then we need to turn this into a button so I'm going to collapse
238

239
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,570
the text message pro text claps my material.
239

240
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,440
A component which is a button.
240

241
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:29,820
Enter now this.
241

242
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,630
But when E is going to be.
242

243
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,060
Where we will keep our functionality so you'll see on click.
243

244
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:36,810
List is empty.
244

245
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:43,590
Click on the little plus symbol there change from runtime only to Ed and run time drag over our level
245

246
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,740
game object into our Says none.
246

247
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:49,700
Object no function game changer from no function to level.
247

248
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:52,050
And what do we want to do on a load the game or find.
248

249
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,900
Load game book.
249

250
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:54,760
There we go.
250

251
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,500
Now it's duplicate stuff.
251

252
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:01,030
Barton changed the name of it from start button to quit button.
252

253
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:07,010
Cook on my debut tour move it down a little bit change the size of the font so I'm going to open up
253

254
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,150
my text mesh pro.
254

255
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:12,880
You g.i. element drop it down to say 80.
255

256
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:15,850
So quick isn't as obvious or as prominent.
256

257
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:19,150
And then maybe change the colour to grey it out a little bit.
257

258
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,870
Gay and then obviously change the font.
258

259
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,490
Sorry change the name so it says quit.
259

260
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:26,940
Okay.
260

261
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,580
Pretty good start and quit.
261

262
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:37,080
Now the quick functionality again collapse my text prush Text mesh pro use G you I can find my button
262

263
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:43,690
and now functionality on click we need to change that from level load gain to level.
263

264
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:44,430
What will this be.
264

265
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,840
Quit application was.
265

266
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,760
Q. Quit game.
266

267
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,570
There you go.
267

268
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,600
Excellent save.
268

269
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,500
Now if this is all worked well there's one more thing we need to do.
269

270
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,840
Actually we need to go up to file build settings and we need to say what the scenes are in our game.
270

271
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:04,980
We've created one new scene which is the start menu drag that up a bar of our game scene so now we have
271

272
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,500
a index of zero an index of 1.
272

273
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,220
Close our build settings click on Play.
273

274
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:14,570
Now when we click on start it should take us to.
274

275
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,460
No where.
275

276
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,730
OK let's have a look at the start button it looks like for some reason our start button has a small
276

277
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,360
footprint on it so I click on my.
277

278
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:31,400
My t tool just drag it and drag it drag it to the extremes.
278

279
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:35,820
Could it be that my hit area has gone and made itself really small for some reason.
279

280
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:39,140
So when I click on Play Now.
280

281
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,170
Click on START.
281

282
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:48,370
It loads is the starter Gatwick of course that worked it was just that our Biton had gone in got nice
282

283
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:52,900
and small and we couldn't see it so if you click on the quick but you can see around the outside we've
283

284
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:59,230
got this area need to make sure that covers all of where your button is going to be.
284

285
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,940
Have it reasonably centred.
285

286
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:04,710
Okay I can see a little circle there and it's lined up with where our middle line is.
286

287
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:10,600
Okay so we've got to start with got quit that's working pretty well and a save all of this now I created
287

288
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,530
the start menu from scratch but there's a lot of the font in the background is gone.
288

289
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,120
Good stuff there.
289

290
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,050
I want to keep some going to duplicate the start menu control deal or kamandi the rename.
290

291
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,810
This is game over.
291

292
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:27,060
Very important that it's game over so it matches whatever we wrote in our string reference here.
292

293
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:27,760
Yes it does.
293

294
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,270
Game over.
294

295
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:31,710
Double click on that looks the same because it's being duplicated.
295

296
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:37,350
We need to change some of the font some of the headings so the heading takes us no longer leza defender.
296

297
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,000
It's going to be game over are okay change the fonts.
297

298
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,240
It's a little bit different.
298

299
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,820
More make a bit on.
299

300
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,840
The orange yellow side of things that's pretty good instead of protect the earth so this is our subheading.
300

301
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,350
Change it to something like.
301

302
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:54,640
Ah.
302

303
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,000
Better luck next time.
303

304
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,960
Cheeky.
304

305
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:02,480
Okay just move that up a little bit.
305

306
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,390
Clicking on my w-2 all up.
306

307
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,160
But pop.
307

308
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:05,890
There we go.
308

309
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:11,400
Better luck next time and change the front of that as well maybe make it a more bright yellow.
309

310
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:12,630
Bright yellow.
310

311
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:18,040
Okay but like next time doesn't quiet fit doesn't look super good blunt going to finesse it too far
311

312
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,070
I just want to show you the structure of what I'm going through here and make sure that you've got the
312

313
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,880
tools you need and we can compare notes like kind of stuff.
313

314
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:31,600
Sorry but next time we have a start button let's change this to play again play again button in our
314

315
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:31,950
text.
315

316
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:34,890
We will change it to play again.
316

317
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,720
Make that a little bit smaller so its on the springing of say 130.
317

318
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,550
That is good.
318

319
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:46,160
And then instead of a quick button I'm going to put into mine a main menu button.
319

320
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:51,340
Change the colour of main menu so it's more of a valid colour.
320

321
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:56,750
If you're just white as well so play again or main menu just a line though so they look a little bit
321

322
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,810
more like actual buttons.
322

323
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,310
Okay that seems decent.
323

324
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:09,390
Now with the functionality of the play again but in the quick but needs to be renamed scrotum main menu
324

325
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:14,520
button cuts have a look at the functionality of the play again button Well that used to be the play
325

326
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:19,040
buttons so load game that's still valid play a game and then play again.
326

327
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:22,590
Main Menu button should instead of being quit game.
327

328
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:26,560
It should be level and low.
328

329
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:27,620
Start menu.
329

330
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,530
Load start menu.
330

331
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:29,440
There we go.
331

332
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,670
Okay save that up.
332

333
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:37,400
Click on play just to check that we've got our play again working.
333

334
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,290
Come play again.
334

335
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,290
Yes that does work.
335

336
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:43,130
I don't have the death hooked up at the moment so it's not going to take me to the game over a screen
336

337
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:48,610
and then click on main menu yet that takes us to start screaming start takes this time there.
337

338
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,200
Okay cool.
338

339
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:49,460
OK.
339

340
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:53,690
There's one more thing to do which is to have our game over screen load when the player dies.
340

341
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:58,820
We've already spent a ton of time on this video so I'll wrap it up now and I will see you in the next
341

342
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,280
video.
