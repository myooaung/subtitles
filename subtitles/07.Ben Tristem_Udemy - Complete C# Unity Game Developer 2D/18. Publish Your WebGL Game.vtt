[MUSIC]
2

2

00:00:03.939  -->  00:00:07.890
Okay, this is super exciting in this
video, we're going to publish our game.
3

3

00:00:07.890  -->  00:00:12.150
You're gonna publish your game to
the Internet using the Unity WebGL build.
4

4

00:00:12.150  -->  00:00:16.168
This is my game currently online,
we're sharing it at ShareMyGame.com.
5

5

00:00:16.168  -->  00:00:18.705
That's a site that we've created for
you so
6

6

00:00:18.705  -->  00:00:23.314
that you can host your game absolutely
free for 30 days on ShareMyGame.com.
7

7

00:00:23.314  -->  00:00:27.879
So this is the game currently working
online, and available to whoever we
8

8

00:00:27.879  -->  00:00:32.161
want to share it with so,
let's get your game published and online.
9

9

00:00:32.161  -->  00:00:34.524
First step,
we need to adjust our aspect ratio.
10

10

00:00:34.524  -->  00:00:35.230
We've been a little bit naughty.
11

11

00:00:35.230  -->  00:00:39.087
We just shoved it at 1080 to make sure
that it didn't move around when we
12

12

00:00:39.087  -->  00:00:39.710
scrolled.
13

13

00:00:39.710  -->  00:00:43.803
But that's not gonna work so well when
we want to get this on the Internet,
14

14

00:00:43.803  -->  00:00:44.604
on a website.
15

15

00:00:44.604  -->  00:00:48.634
So, step one is to change first of all,
our aspect ratio to 169,
16

16

00:00:48.634  -->  00:00:52.594
which is the same as 1080 but
it's saying it can be any 169,
17

17

00:00:52.594  -->  00:00:57.285
it doesn't have to be specifically
1080 P which is 1920 by 1080.
18

18

00:00:57.285  -->  00:00:59.279
You can see that our camera is now tiny,
19

19

00:00:59.279  -->  00:01:03.165
it doesn't quite make sense in the context
of our game, this is what we see.
20

20

00:01:03.165  -->  00:01:06.792
Over on to click on Canvas,
left side over here, click on Canvas.
21

21

00:01:06.792  -->  00:01:09.768
You'll see under canvas scalar,
couple of options.
22

22

00:01:09.768  -->  00:01:13.290
Currently we have UI scale
mode at constant pixel size.
23

23

00:01:13.290  -->  00:01:17.143
We want to click on that and
change it to scale width screen size.
24

24

00:01:17.143  -->  00:01:20.371
Now, our reference resolution
is going to be 1920 by 1080,
25

25

00:01:20.371  -->  00:01:22.775
cuz that's what we've been
building our game at.
26

26

00:01:22.775  -->  00:01:28.716
You can see now our canvas fits
nicely around our 1920 this way and
27

27

00:01:28.716  -->  00:01:30.464
1080 that way.
28

28

00:01:30.464  -->  00:01:35.050
And it fits in lovely, so as we scale
our screen, move it around, no problemo.
29

29

00:01:35.050  -->  00:01:38.931
That's gonna mean it's gonna fit no matter
what size someone is viewing it at, okay.
30

30

00:01:38.931  -->  00:01:44.115
So let's save that, Ctrl + S to save,
now that we've tidied up our aspect ratio.
31

31

00:01:44.115  -->  00:01:49.715
Next step is to jump up top left to File,
and scroll down to Build Settings.
32

32

00:01:49.715  -->  00:01:53.503
Under Build Settings, we see options for
what we can build our game as.
33

33

00:01:53.503  -->  00:01:57.691
If you don't see WebGL as an option,
that means that when you installed Unity,
34

34

00:01:57.691  -->  00:01:59.890
you didn't install WebGL, no problem.
35

35

00:01:59.890  -->  00:02:01.920
Go over to Unity Hub, click on Installs,
36

36

00:02:01.920  -->  00:02:04.186
find the version of
Unity that you're using.
37

37

00:02:04.186  -->  00:02:08.001
Click on the three little buttons
to the right and add Component and
38

38

00:02:08.001  -->  00:02:12.222
then you can see all the installation
options that we previously had, and
39

39

00:02:12.222  -->  00:02:15.450
scroll down, so
you'll see Web GL Build Support.
40

40

00:02:15.450  -->  00:02:19.343
If you don't have that clicked, click on
that and then you'll need to do a little
41

41

00:02:19.343  -->  00:02:23.087
bit of downloading and installing and
possibly restarting Unity I believe.
42

42

00:02:23.087  -->  00:02:26.373
But if you have it installed or once
you have it installed, click on WebGL.
43

43

00:02:26.373  -->  00:02:30.970
You can see that we've got one scene in
our build which is our sample scene here,
44

44

00:02:30.970  -->  00:02:32.417
it's build index zero.
45

45

00:02:32.417  -->  00:02:36.135
We're gonna be doing a lot more, having
a lot more scenes in the upcoming section
46

46

00:02:36.135  -->  00:02:38.393
of the course that is gonna
be excellent as well.
47

47

00:02:38.393  -->  00:02:42.929
For now we've just the one and all we
need to do is click on Build and Run, and
48

48

00:02:42.929  -->  00:02:44.878
we save it to a particular spot.
49

49

00:02:44.878  -->  00:02:47.193
Ignore my folder there,
that's secret stuff,
50

50

00:02:47.193  -->  00:02:49.342
I'm just saving this
to my Download folder.
51

51

00:02:49.342  -->  00:02:51.882
You can save it wherever you want,
52

52

00:02:51.882  -->  00:02:57.762
I'll give myself a New folder I will
call this folder Text 101 Rick Version.
53

53

00:02:57.762  -->  00:02:59.340
Actually that's a pretty
dumb name isn't it?
54

54

00:02:59.340  -->  00:03:04.756
Cuz our game's called The Injured Pilot,
so that is what we should call it.
55

55

00:03:04.756  -->  00:03:09.033
We shouldn't call it the section of a
course, we should call it the actual game.
56

56

00:03:09.033  -->  00:03:12.423
So double click on the Injured Pilot or
whatever you're calling your game.
57

57

00:03:12.423  -->  00:03:15.397
Hopefully you've come up with
a nifty name, select folder and
58

58

00:03:15.397  -->  00:03:17.708
now that is where we are going
to build and run to.
59

59

00:03:17.708  -->  00:03:19.292
Its already been selected,
60

60

00:03:19.292  -->  00:03:22.464
we were just doing the last
step of selecting the folder.
61

61

00:03:22.464  -->  00:03:26.909
This will take awhile, between one or five
minutes depending upon the speed of your
62

62

00:03:26.909  -->  00:03:29.777
computer and
how much stuff you've got in your game.
63

63

00:03:29.777  -->  00:03:31.002
So while this is building,
64

64

00:03:31.002  -->  00:03:34.002
let me take you through a couple
of other things just very briefly.
65

65

00:03:34.002  -->  00:03:38.947
First briefly thing I will show you is, if
at any point you get stuck on building to
66

66

00:03:38.947  -->  00:03:43.489
WebGL, I've given you a link in
the resources to our unit docs for WebGL.
67

67

00:03:43.489  -->  00:03:47.676
Now this process, if you read through,
you can see that there's some caveats,
68

68

00:03:47.676  -->  00:03:50.026
it will work on this,
it won't work on that.
69

69

00:03:50.026  -->  00:03:56.003
It won't work on a lot of mobile devices,
Android and iOS.
70

70

00:03:56.003  -->  00:03:58.093
So there's some rules in here
about what it will work on,
71

71

00:03:58.093  -->  00:04:00.158
some of the later things are supported,
some aren't.
72

72

00:04:00.158  -->  00:04:01.789
But for what we're doing now,
73

73

00:04:01.789  -->  00:04:04.800
which is just getting this game
to be hosted on a website so
74

74

00:04:04.800  -->  00:04:08.713
someone can open their browser and
play it, it will serve us very nicely.
75

75

00:04:08.713  -->  00:04:11.750
The other thing I wanna show you is,
share my game.com.
76

76

00:04:11.750  -->  00:04:15.969
Again I'm giving you a link in the
resources, this is a game dev tv hosting
77

77

00:04:15.969  -->  00:04:20.597
location that we provide for you free of
charge, because we love you being part of
78

78

00:04:20.597  -->  00:04:24.525
our community and want to see your
games and what you've been up to.
79

79

00:04:24.525  -->  00:04:29.116
Sharemygame.com, you can come over
here and host your WebGL build.
80

80

00:04:29.116  -->  00:04:32.535
Pretty straight forward, you make you
build, you zip it, that's important, and
81

81

00:04:32.535  -->  00:04:33.367
then you upload it.
82

82

00:04:33.367  -->  00:04:35.212
So we're in the process of making a build,
83

83

00:04:35.212  -->  00:04:37.479
let's see how my build is
coming along here, okay.
84

84

00:04:37.479  -->  00:04:41.409
A little bit more stalling I need to do,
while I'm stalling, I'll show you our
85

85

00:04:41.409  -->  00:04:44.707
challenge for this lecture,
Publish and Share Your Game Online.
86

86

00:04:44.707  -->  00:04:48.682
And I want you to celebrate if this is
your first ever game you've published
87

87

00:04:48.682  -->  00:04:50.272
online, that is a huge step.
88

88

00:04:50.272  -->  00:04:54.402
This might not be an award winning game,
but this is massive in terms of you taking
89

89

00:04:54.402  -->  00:04:57.804
the steps to creating great games
that people are going to love, so
90

90

00:04:57.804  -->  00:04:59.106
this is super exciting.
91

91

00:04:59.106  -->  00:05:03.642
Create a WebGL build which we have done
already, publish to ShareMyGame.com,
92

92

00:05:03.642  -->  00:05:06.989
which I'll do in a moment when
my build finishes building.
93

93

00:05:06.989  -->  00:05:08.270
Copy the link to your game,
94

94

00:05:08.270  -->  00:05:11.723
super important that you dont accidentally
click away from the link, and
95

95

00:05:11.723  -->  00:05:14.796
I'll take you through that step nice and
slowly when we get to it.
96

96

00:05:14.796  -->  00:05:17.292
But once you've got the link,
you can share that with your friends,
97

97

00:05:17.292  -->  00:05:19.631
take it to your grandmother and
say, hey, check out this link.
98

98

00:05:19.631  -->  00:05:23.551
And she'll look at it and
she'll be amazed, hopefully [LAUGH].
99

99

00:05:23.551  -->  00:05:28.498
Share your game to at least one location,
Facebook, GameDev.tv community site,
100

100

00:05:28.498  -->  00:05:29.590
Discord site.
101

101

00:05:29.590  -->  00:05:33.165
Seriously, honestly,
we love to see what you have created.
102

102

00:05:33.165  -->  00:05:36.600
People in the community love
to see what you've created.
103

103

00:05:36.600  -->  00:05:40.840
It's a great way for you to be
courageous and say, here's what I did,
104

104

00:05:40.840  -->  00:05:44.470
here's my approach,
here's my creativity, and
105

105

00:05:44.470  -->  00:05:47.750
have people give you feedback and
be ready for that feedback.
106

106

00:05:47.750  -->  00:05:50.850
Some people will just say, hey,
good work, and encourage you and
107

107

00:05:50.850  -->  00:05:52.690
support you for just publishing it.
108

108

00:05:52.690  -->  00:05:54.571
Other people will say this is amazing,
109

109

00:05:54.571  -->  00:05:57.080
other people will say this
is a big piece of garbage.
110

110

00:05:57.080  -->  00:05:59.991
And be ready for it,
don't take it personally,
111

111

00:05:59.991  -->  00:06:02.052
listen to what people have to say.
112

112

00:06:02.052  -->  00:06:05.508
And if you're in the early stages
of your development process,
113

113

00:06:05.508  -->  00:06:07.435
just take it as a learning journey.
114

114

00:06:07.435  -->  00:06:11.727
I get people telling me on a daily basis,
this thing I've done is really garbage and
115

115

00:06:11.727  -->  00:06:14.445
crappy, and
I can't believe I married you, Rick.
116

116

00:06:14.445  -->  00:06:16.572
Wait a minute,
little bit too much information.
117

117

00:06:16.572  -->  00:06:18.789
So anyway,
[LAUGH] just be ready for feedback.
118

118

00:06:18.789  -->  00:06:21.190
This is Rick comedy hour today, isn't it?
119

119

00:06:21.190  -->  00:06:23.862
Okay, back to our build,
it's still building.
120

120

00:06:23.862  -->  00:06:26.836
So what I might do is just pause
the video at this point and
121

121

00:06:26.836  -->  00:06:29.952
let the rest of my build do its
building and you do the same.
122

122

00:06:29.952  -->  00:06:34.644
Take a break, have cup of coffee, do some
stretching and when our games have built,
123

123

00:06:34.644  -->  00:06:35.580
we will host it.
124

124

00:06:35.580  -->  00:06:39.566
Now immediately after the build has
built cuz we clicked Build and Run,
125

125

00:06:39.566  -->  00:06:43.356
it is running locally, this is not
hosted online anywhere yet, but
126

126

00:06:43.356  -->  00:06:45.760
it's showing as what we would see.
127

127

00:06:45.760  -->  00:06:50.185
If and when we host it to a website,
we can see that it's our game and
128

128

00:06:50.185  -->  00:06:54.312
I can cycle through my options here and
check everything out.
129

129

00:06:54.312  -->  00:06:56.380
Now I haven't gone through and
looked for bugs,
130

130

00:06:56.380  -->  00:06:59.925
there's gonna be bugs the very first time
you publish something, so expect that.
131

131

00:06:59.925  -->  00:07:03.701
And if you are really passionate about
getting your game to be bug-free then
132

132

00:07:03.701  -->  00:07:07.243
yeah, this is a great chance to dive
in and find those bugs and fix them.
133

133

00:07:07.243  -->  00:07:10.185
But for now in terms of the course,
we've covered what we want to cover for
134

134

00:07:10.185  -->  00:07:10.716
the course.
135

135

00:07:10.716  -->  00:07:14.100
So I'm not gonna go and hunt down all
the bugs, but if you find anything and
136

136

00:07:14.100  -->  00:07:16.896
you find solutions then please
do share with our community.
137

137

00:07:16.896  -->  00:07:21.042
So anyone who's looking to have their
game bug-free can resolve that as well.
138

138

00:07:21.042  -->  00:07:25.496
Now back into Unity,
actually back into my folder structure,
139

139

00:07:25.496  -->  00:07:30.801
back into Windows Explorer or
Apple Explorer, is that what it's called?
140

140

00:07:30.801  -->  00:07:34.580
I don't think it is, I think it's
called something even niftier.
141

141

00:07:34.580  -->  00:07:38.453
But find the folder where you saved
your build and zip that out, so
142

142

00:07:38.453  -->  00:07:39.941
a couple ways to do that.
143

143

00:07:39.941  -->  00:07:41.703
We talked about just dragging it and
144

144

00:07:41.703  -->  00:07:44.179
adding to Archive if you've
got a tool to do that.
145

145

00:07:44.179  -->  00:07:47.846
Or right click and
send to Compressed Zip Folder,
146

146

00:07:47.846  -->  00:07:51.350
that's another way to
zip up your folder here.
147

147

00:07:51.350  -->  00:07:54.108
So we've zipped up that folder,
The Injured Pilot,
148

148

00:07:54.108  -->  00:07:56.020
that's a good name very excellent.
149

149

00:07:56.020  -->  00:08:01.001
Over to ShareMyGame.com, over to here,
you can see our options, option three,
150

150

00:08:01.001  -->  00:08:02.365
options, our steps.
151

151

00:08:02.365  -->  00:08:05.316
Step number three is upload your game,
click on that button,
152

152

00:08:05.316  -->  00:08:07.550
find your zipped file,
your zip folder here.
153

153

00:08:07.550  -->  00:08:11.711
The Injured Pilot, double click on that,
this shouldn't take too long,
154

154

00:08:11.711  -->  00:08:15.887
maybe up to 30 seconds or a minute
depending again on how big your game is.
155

155

00:08:15.887  -->  00:08:20.148
It's gonna upload,
it will process, it will take care
156

156

00:08:20.148  -->  00:08:24.782
of all the inner workings of
getting our game hosted online.
157

157

00:08:24.782  -->  00:08:28.214
And now I mentioned this earlier,
the super important step,
158

158

00:08:28.214  -->  00:08:31.382
there will be a link coming up soon,
don't click away and
159

159

00:08:31.382  -->  00:08:35.860
don't accidentally lose that link,
this is your one chance to grab it.
160

160

00:08:35.860  -->  00:08:39.931
It's not gonna go flying, no need to
stress but just make sure you copy
161

161

00:08:39.931  -->  00:08:43.812
the link when this process finishes so
that you can share the link.
162

162

00:08:43.812  -->  00:08:48.471
Copy it for now and paste it into a file,
into a notepad file if you like or
163

163

00:08:48.471  -->  00:08:53.768
maybe even bookmark the link, that's
probably the smart way to do it isn't it?
164

164

00:08:53.768  -->  00:08:56.494
Okay, again, I'm gonna pause,
give it a moment, and
165

165

00:08:56.494  -->  00:08:58.815
I'll be back when
the processing is finished.
166

166

00:08:58.815  -->  00:09:01.245
And of course, each time I say that and
pause the video,
167

167

00:09:01.245  -->  00:09:04.003
two seconds later it finishes
doing what it's supposed to do.
168

168

00:09:04.003  -->  00:09:08.635
So it's loading into our game, you can
see the link up here, sharemygame.com.
169

169

00:09:08.635  -->  00:09:12.075
Share and then all this stuff,
this is what we want to copy, so
170

170

00:09:12.075  -->  00:09:13.543
I'm gonna copy that now.
171

171

00:09:13.543  -->  00:09:17.033
Hey presto, here is our game, let's
just check that it works in full screen.
172

172

00:09:17.033  -->  00:09:21.990
It does, keys move us forwardm wonderful,
I'm going to escape out of that, great.
173

173

00:09:21.990  -->  00:09:25.394
You can see a couple of easy buttons on
the left here if you wanna share to your
174

174

00:09:25.394  -->  00:09:27.789
Facebook friends to get
some feedback on your game.
175

175

00:09:27.789  -->  00:09:31.159
It's great to get feedback or
even to brag, hey look I made this thing,
176

176

00:09:31.159  -->  00:09:33.697
to Twitter, and
importantly to our community site.
177

177

00:09:33.697  -->  00:09:36.583
If you click on this green
button just here, or
178

178

00:09:36.583  -->  00:09:41.403
I'll also give you a link in the resources
against the lecture discussions.
179

179

00:09:41.403  -->  00:09:44.287
If you click there, that will take
you to the community site, and
180

180

00:09:44.287  -->  00:09:45.720
you can share it straight away.
181

181

00:09:45.720  -->  00:09:52.128
So, here is the link to
my text adventure game,
182

182

00:09:52.128  -->  00:09:58.073
I just uploaded, I'd love your feedback.
183

183

00:09:58.073  -->  00:09:59.945
And then paste the link.
184

184

00:09:59.945  -->  00:10:04.707
And so that is it, that's a process of you
publishing your game, just a reminder of
185

185

00:10:04.707  -->  00:10:08.394
our challenge, let me just [SOUND]
up my screen here a little bit.
186

186

00:10:08.394  -->  00:10:11.551
So we've gone through the process,
build your game, share your game,
187

187

00:10:11.551  -->  00:10:14.831
link to the game, share on at least one
place, please let us know about it.
188

188

00:10:14.831  -->  00:10:17.375
I've also given you a link
to the discord chat server,
189

189

00:10:17.375  -->  00:10:20.432
lots of lovely folks over there
ready to celebrate your success.
190

190

00:10:20.432  -->  00:10:24.788
Be ready for feedback, positive and
negative and give yourself a massive high
191

191

00:10:24.788  -->  00:10:28.820
five, open up your window, yell out
to the world, I published my game.
192

192

00:10:28.820  -->  00:10:33.003
Because this is really very significant
in your journey as a game developer, and
193

193

00:10:33.003  -->  00:10:35.154
it will get better and better and better,
194

194

00:10:35.154  -->  00:10:38.619
but this is a very big first step
in terms of publishing your games.
195

195

00:10:38.619  -->  00:10:42.420
So great work, well done and
I will see you guys in an upcoming video.
