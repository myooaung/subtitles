00:00:00,012  -->  00:00:05,207
[SOUND]
In this video,
2

2

00:00:05,207  -->  00:00:08,837
we're gonna create a SpawnAllWaves
coroutine that will allow us to spawn
3

3

00:00:08,837  -->  00:00:10,920
multiple waves, one, two, three.
4

4

00:00:10,920  -->  00:00:14,250
And we'll have those waves going with
different enemies and different paths.
5

5

00:00:14,250  -->  00:00:16,386
So let's get cracking.
6

6

00:00:16,386  -->  00:00:20,820
Okay, we're gonna be doing a little
bit of coroutine inception.
7

7

00:00:20,820  -->  00:00:22,690
Inception, if you've seen the movie.
8

8

00:00:22,690  -->  00:00:25,940
Leonardo DiCaprio,
it is a very, very good movie.
9

9

00:00:25,940  -->  00:00:28,170
It's all about dreams within
dreams within dreams.
10

10

00:00:28,170  -->  00:00:31,890
We are doing coroutines within coroutines.
11

11

00:00:31,890  -->  00:00:37,074
So we have our coroutine we've created
already, I'll spawn all enemies in wave.
12

12

00:00:37,074  -->  00:00:41,881
What we're looking to do now is
create a new coroutine which is
13

13

00:00:41,881  -->  00:00:44,130
going to be SpawnAllWaves.
14

14

00:00:44,130  -->  00:00:47,160
And within SpawnAllWaves,
15

15

00:00:47,160  -->  00:00:51,250
we have a concept that we'll be hooking
up in our inspector, where we say,
16

16

00:00:51,250  -->  00:00:55,580
here's wave 1, and wave 2, and
wave 3, and 4, and 5, and so on.
17

17

00:00:55,580  -->  00:00:59,830
And we want to spawn the first one,
do what it needs to do,
18

18

00:00:59,830  -->  00:01:03,330
then spawn the second, do what it needs to
do, and spawn the third one, and so on.
19

19

00:01:03,330  -->  00:01:06,840
So within SpawnAllWaves,
we'll be creating ourselves a coroutine.
20

20

00:01:06,840  -->  00:01:11,777
And the yield condition will be once our
21

21

00:01:11,777  -->  00:01:17,500
SpawnAllEnemies in wave has finished,
has completed,
22

22

00:01:17,500  -->  00:01:22,720
so you can see down here how yield
condition is get time between spawns.
23

23

00:01:22,720  -->  00:01:23,550
And I think, at the moment,
24

24

00:01:23,550  -->  00:01:28,520
it's set at something like 0.5,
whatever it's reading from our waveConfig.
25

25

00:01:28,520  -->  00:01:31,040
So it's using a time, WaitForSeconds.
26

26

00:01:31,040  -->  00:01:32,860
But it doesn't always have
to be WaitForSeconds,
27

27

00:01:32,860  -->  00:01:38,040
we can use as our yield condition, we
can say the yield condition is finishing
28

28

00:01:39,520  -->  00:01:43,620
another coroutine.
29

29

00:01:43,620  -->  00:01:48,100
Which is really cool and can blow
your mind a little bit if you're not
30

30

00:01:48,100  -->  00:01:50,430
sitting up straight and paying attention.
31

31

00:01:50,430  -->  00:01:53,171
Okay, so hopefully you are in
a comfortable position and
32

32

00:01:53,171  -->  00:01:55,190
this shall not blow your mind.
33

33

00:01:55,190  -->  00:01:58,940
But this is what we are doing, we're
creating SpawnAllWaves as a coroutine and
34

34

00:01:58,940  -->  00:02:01,600
we will be telling it to spawn a wave, and
35

35

00:02:01,600  -->  00:02:05,250
to yield once the wave has
finished spawning all its enemies.
36

36

00:02:05,250  -->  00:02:08,200
So let me clear all that off the screen.
37

37

00:02:08,200  -->  00:02:13,414
Okay, so what we need to do
is underneath Start, we'll
38

38

00:02:13,414  -->  00:02:18,500
create a new private IEnumerator.
39

39

00:02:19,710  -->  00:02:22,620
And we'll call this SpawnAllWaves.
40

40

00:02:22,620  -->  00:02:25,962
This is going to be,
it's a method of type IEnumerator,
41

41

00:02:25,962  -->  00:02:29,040
which means we've created
ourselves a coroutine.
42

42

00:02:29,040  -->  00:02:32,289
And there'll be two parts in this
similar to the way we were spawning all
43

43

00:02:32,289  -->  00:02:33,200
the enemies.
44

44

00:02:33,200  -->  00:02:34,770
We have our for loop and
45

45

00:02:34,770  -->  00:02:39,090
then we have the content of what we
want it to be doing, and then our yield.
46

46

00:02:39,090  -->  00:02:40,750
I guess that's three parts, isn't it?
47

47

00:02:40,750  -->  00:02:43,230
And then we give ourselves
some curly braces.
48

48

00:02:43,230  -->  00:02:44,980
I'm gonna start off with the for
loop here.
49

49

00:02:44,980  -->  00:02:48,650
If you want a challenge, then see if
you can figure out how to write the for
50

50

00:02:48,650  -->  00:02:50,070
loop for our SpawnAllWaves.
51

51

00:02:50,070  -->  00:02:54,160
So pause the video, and take on that
micro-challenge, if you're interested.
52

52

00:02:54,160  -->  00:02:55,530
Otherwise, we can do this together.
53

53

00:02:55,530  -->  00:02:58,210
I'm gonna type for, open our parentheses.
54

54

00:02:58,210  -->  00:03:02,140
We need to create ourselves an integer,
which will be waveIndex.
55

55

00:03:02,140  -->  00:03:05,140
So we're incrementing
the index as we go along.
56

56

00:03:05,140  -->  00:03:08,230
We'll start that off at startingWave.
57

57

00:03:08,230  -->  00:03:10,110
This is gonna change
a little bit of our concept.
58

58

00:03:10,110  -->  00:03:13,130
We won't be using this current
wave startingWave, but
59

59

00:03:13,130  -->  00:03:14,540
I'll change that in a moment.
60

60

00:03:14,540  -->  00:03:16,180
For now, our startingWave starts at 0.
61

61

00:03:16,180  -->  00:03:18,440
And you know what,
I'm gonna put my semicolon here.
62

62

00:03:18,440  -->  00:03:21,930
I think at some point, I'll remove
my SerializeField from startingWave.
63

63

00:03:21,930  -->  00:03:25,080
I'm gonna put that back at
our startingWave variable at
64

64

00:03:25,080  -->  00:03:26,760
top SerializeField.
65

65

00:03:26,760  -->  00:03:28,520
So that we can change
that in the inspector.
66

66

00:03:28,520  -->  00:03:30,840
If we wanted to start our game from say,
67

67

00:03:30,840  -->  00:03:34,920
wave 82 instead of having to play
the whole way through to get to wave 82,
68

68

00:03:34,920  -->  00:03:37,830
then we could change
that in the inspector.
69

69

00:03:37,830  -->  00:03:39,990
Okay, so back down into our for
70

70

00:03:39,990  -->  00:03:43,900
loop, we've got waveIndex =
startingWave as a starting point.
71

71

00:03:43,900  -->  00:03:47,760
And then waveIndex, what's the check we
need to do here, what's the condition?
72

72

00:03:47,760  -->  00:03:51,722
We continue our four loop if
the wave index is less than what?
73

73

00:03:51,722  -->  00:03:56,340
It's gonna be less than the waveConfigs,
so all of the wave configuration files,
74

74

00:03:56,340  -->  00:04:00,656
this is a list, so remember, we've got our
angle brackets up here, so it's a list.
75

75

00:04:00,656  -->  00:04:05,610
That means, we are looking for count to
see how many items we have in our list.
76

76

00:04:05,610  -->  00:04:11,220
And then semicolon, and finally we
increment waveIndex with waveIndex++.
77

77

00:04:12,931  -->  00:04:16,040
Now we've created our for loop,
what do we do within this?
78

78

00:04:16,040  -->  00:04:18,420
Well, let's give ourselves
a real spacing here.
79

79

00:04:18,420  -->  00:04:21,980
This is where we're going to
shift our currentWave concept.
80

80

00:04:21,980  -->  00:04:26,210
So I'll highlight, and in our Start
method, highlight var currentWave,
81

81

00:04:26,210  -->  00:04:28,810
that whole line, for me it's line 12.
82

82

00:04:28,810  -->  00:04:32,911
Cut, and I'm going to paste that,
83

83

00:04:34,142  -->  00:04:39,160
As the first line within my code block,
that's being looped in the for loop.
84

84

00:04:39,160  -->  00:04:42,164
We've got var currentWave, waveConfigs.
85

85

00:04:42,164  -->  00:04:43,896
And instead of saying startingWave,
86

86

00:04:43,896  -->  00:04:46,924
cuz that's just the first one,
and we've captured that here, we
87

87

00:04:46,924  -->  00:04:50,782
want to say the waveIndex that's gonna be
incrementing as our for loop increments.
88

88

00:04:50,782  -->  00:04:58,130
So we'll say, waveIndex and
then semicolon, here we can yield.
89

89

00:04:58,130  -->  00:05:02,250
So it's done its job, it's basically
just saying what's the currentWave and
90

90

00:05:02,250  -->  00:05:05,770
keep looping until you hit the end,
basically.
91

91

00:05:05,770  -->  00:05:10,150
So yield return, and here's the cool part,
this is the inception part.
92

92

00:05:10,150  -->  00:05:12,880
We don't need to write new,
we're going to put in a coroutine.
93

93

00:05:12,880  -->  00:05:19,130
So we'll type in StartCoroutine, and then
what's the coroutine we want to start?
94

94

00:05:19,130  -->  00:05:21,800
It will be this SpawnAllEnemiesInWave.
95

95

00:05:21,800  -->  00:05:25,035
SpawnAllEnemiesInWave, what
do we need to pass in there?
96

96

00:05:25,035  -->  00:05:28,294
Well, it wants us to give
it the waveConfig, so
97

97

00:05:28,294  -->  00:05:31,555
we will do that by saying
it is the currentWave.
98

98

00:05:33,030  -->  00:05:35,563
And then semicolon at the end,
99

99

00:05:35,563  -->  00:05:40,640
so which waveConfig are we
giving to our SpawnAllEnemies?
100

100

00:05:40,640  -->  00:05:41,850
We're giving it the currentWave.
101

101

00:05:41,850  -->  00:05:43,260
What is the currentWave?
102

102

00:05:43,260  -->  00:05:47,663
It is whatever we have currently
incremented as part of our for loop.
103

103

00:05:47,663  -->  00:05:50,885
And where do we start off, we start
off at startingWave, which is zero.
104

104

00:05:50,885  -->  00:05:52,795
So we've got our content in here.
105

105

00:05:52,795  -->  00:05:55,335
I think this is all looking pretty good,
save this up.
106

106

00:05:55,335  -->  00:05:56,725
Scroll up to the top.
107

107

00:05:56,725  -->  00:06:00,345
Now we're no longer starting
the SpawnAllEnemiesInWave.
108

108

00:06:00,345  -->  00:06:03,345
We want to start the SpawnAllWaves.
109

109

00:06:06,180  -->  00:06:08,930
So that's the start point,
that's the launch point for
110

110

00:06:08,930  -->  00:06:12,170
our nice loops we've got going on here.
111

111

00:06:12,170  -->  00:06:14,850
Great.
We'll save that, jump over into unity and
112

112

00:06:14,850  -->  00:06:17,755
this is where we want to give
ourselves a little bit of a challenge.
113

113

00:06:17,755  -->  00:06:20,615
The challenge is to
create new enemy waves.
114

114

00:06:20,615  -->  00:06:23,795
So first of all, create a second
different looking enemy prefab.
115

115

00:06:23,795  -->  00:06:25,030
We've already got, who is it?
116

116

00:06:25,030  -->  00:06:29,175
Roger, the orange Tie Fighter,
to create something else as well,
117

117

00:06:29,175  -->  00:06:30,590
to go in to our game.
118

118

00:06:30,590  -->  00:06:32,764
And then to create a new enemy path.
119

119

00:06:32,764  -->  00:06:36,060
You can modify one of your existing ones,
but make sure you've got at least two.
120

120

00:06:36,060  -->  00:06:40,707
And then we wanna spawn four waves,
Enemy 1, Path 1, Enemy 1, Path 2,
121

121

00:06:40,707  -->  00:06:43,412
Enemy 2, Path 1, and Enemy 2, Path 2.
122

122

00:06:43,412  -->  00:06:47,846
And a lot of the point I wanna make here
is that when creating just with a couple
123

123

00:06:47,846  -->  00:06:52,370
of different tweaks, we have created
tons and tons of variation in our game.
124

124

00:06:52,370  -->  00:06:54,760
So enough on the preamble,
jump in, take on that challenge.
125

125

00:06:54,760  -->  00:06:55,763
I'll see you here in a moment.
126

126

00:06:58,161  -->  00:07:01,060
Okay, first of all,
I'm gonna make myself a new prefab.
127

127

00:07:01,060  -->  00:07:04,070
Jump over into the Kenney Assets,
find the spritesheet.
128

128

00:07:04,070  -->  00:07:07,250
No, that's not it, find the PNGs.
129

129

00:07:07,250  -->  00:07:10,450
Look for enemies, scroll down,
I'm going to find
130

130

00:07:10,450  -->  00:07:15,200
this kind of weird looking blue guy here
and drag him into the sprite's folder.
131

131

00:07:15,200  -->  00:07:20,260
I'm going to drag him into my scene,
rename it as, what should we call it?
132

132

00:07:20,260  -->  00:07:23,930
We've got Roger,
we'll call this one Bernard.
133

133

00:07:23,930  -->  00:07:28,100
I've been watching Westworld of late, so
that's maybe why I'm thinking of Bernard.
134

134

00:07:28,100  -->  00:07:33,905
And then,
we need to drag Bernard into our prefabs.
135

135

00:07:33,905  -->  00:07:35,382
While we're in here,
136

136

00:07:35,382  -->  00:07:40,280
I'm gonna change boring old
enemy into exciting young Roger.
137

137

00:07:40,280  -->  00:07:41,290
Jolly Roger, there we go.
138

138

00:07:41,290  -->  00:07:43,912
We've got Roger, and we've got Bernard.
139

139

00:07:43,912  -->  00:07:45,684
Bernard, I think he's okay.
140

140

00:07:45,684  -->  00:07:48,052
Blue cool, so
we've got our second enemy prefab.
141

141

00:07:50,153  -->  00:07:51,130
What do we need to add?
142

142

00:07:51,130  -->  00:07:56,858
We need to add a component,
which will be the Enemy Pathing component.
143

143

00:07:56,858  -->  00:08:01,002
Let's just check, so Roger's got an Enemy
Pathing and Bernard's got Enemy Pathing.
144

144

00:08:01,002  -->  00:08:03,034
Excellent, so we've got our two enemies.
145

145

00:08:03,034  -->  00:08:07,110
I will delete Bernard from my scene, we
don't need him in the scene at the moment.
146

146

00:08:07,110  -->  00:08:10,680
Close up my waypoints, okay, what next?
147

147

00:08:10,680  -->  00:08:11,540
Look at our waves.
148

148

00:08:11,540  -->  00:08:14,800
We've got wave one which is
spawning Roger and then Path(0).
149

149

00:08:14,800  -->  00:08:17,100
Move speed is a bit crazy,
put that down to 10.
150

150

00:08:17,100  -->  00:08:20,272
Wave two is Roger and Path(1).
151

151

00:08:20,272  -->  00:08:21,760
Yeah, that's a fine way to do it.
152

152

00:08:21,760  -->  00:08:24,662
I'm going to duplicate both of my waves.
153

153

00:08:24,662  -->  00:08:27,100
So now I'm gonna have a wave three and
a wave four.
154

154

00:08:27,100  -->  00:08:32,863
Wave three is going to be Bernard,
Bernard on Path(0) and
155

155

00:08:32,863  -->  00:08:37,270
then wave four will be Bernard on Path(1).
156

156

00:08:37,270  -->  00:08:41,390
And we'll change his move speed to nine,
just to see how it goes.
157

157

00:08:41,390  -->  00:08:43,889
Number of enemies,
we'll mix them up a little bit three,
158

158

00:08:43,889  -->  00:08:45,679
actually I'll make this nice and clear.
159

159

00:08:45,679  -->  00:08:49,396
So on my first wave, I have one enemy,
second wave I have two enemies,
160

160

00:08:49,396  -->  00:08:50,849
third wave, I have three.
161

161

00:08:50,849  -->  00:08:54,324
You don't have to do it this way,
I'm just change it this way so
162

162

00:08:54,324  -->  00:08:57,490
I know exactly which wave we're on,
and we have four.
163

163

00:08:57,490  -->  00:09:02,470
Okay, so over into Enemy Spawner, I've
gone and put 20 in there, I'll just change
164

164

00:09:02,470  -->  00:09:07,064
this down to 0, and that will allow me
to look my Inspector, click on my Waves.
165

165

00:09:07,064  -->  00:09:10,033
Drag my Waves on top of
the words waveConfig and
166

166

00:09:10,033  -->  00:09:13,620
that is populated my list
with those four configs.
167

167

00:09:13,620  -->  00:09:14,680
Now, it looks pretty good.
168

168

00:09:14,680  -->  00:09:18,010
I said I was gonna move my path a little
bit, so Path(0), we'll mix it up.
169

169

00:09:18,010  -->  00:09:20,260
You can see sometimes the icons disappear.
170

170

00:09:20,260  -->  00:09:25,380
I'm not sure why, if someone out there has
an answer to that, I'd love to hear it.
171

171

00:09:25,380  -->  00:09:27,604
Move this over just
a little bit offscreen.
172

172

00:09:27,604  -->  00:09:32,029
Waypoint(1), Waypoint(2) and
then, also Waypoint(1) and
173

173

00:09:32,029  -->  00:09:35,500
then Waypoint(2) offscreen,
so it does kind of a V.
174

174

00:09:35,500  -->  00:09:40,108
That's for Path(0), and
then Path(1) is gonna be top right,
175

175

00:09:40,108  -->  00:09:43,690
middle, left, and
then hopping offscreen as well.
176

176

00:09:43,690  -->  00:09:45,680
I'll make sure the first one is offscreen.
177

177

00:09:45,680  -->  00:09:47,435
I'm gonna go offscreen to offscreen.
178

178

00:09:47,435  -->  00:09:48,345
That looks pretty good.
179

179

00:09:48,345  -->  00:09:52,115
Let's save this up, click on Play,
see if what we've done works.
180

180

00:09:52,115  -->  00:09:55,355
A quick message from the future, thank you
to those people who pointed out that you
181

181

00:09:55,355  -->  00:09:59,495
need to click Apply to apply
your changes back to the prefab.
182

182

00:09:59,495  -->  00:10:01,205
Yep, goes nice and quick.
183

183

00:10:01,205  -->  00:10:04,610
Spawn, spawn, spawn, one,
two, three, four, okay.
184

184

00:10:04,610  -->  00:10:08,227
And cuz we've got different speeds
that looks a little bit ridiculous and
185

185

00:10:08,227  -->  00:10:11,375
cuz our paths overlapping, not so
great in terms of game play but
186

186

00:10:11,375  -->  00:10:12,909
let's just check that again.
187

187

00:10:12,909  -->  00:10:16,381
The first wave should have one enemy,
it's gonna go really fast,
188

188

00:10:16,381  -->  00:10:20,740
then the next wave it has two, next one it
has three, and then the last one has four.
189

189

00:10:20,740  -->  00:10:23,488
Okay, so we have these paths
coming into our game and
190

190

00:10:23,488  -->  00:10:28,560
we have multiple enemies on multiple paths
and multiple spaces, it's super exciting.
191

191

00:10:28,560  -->  00:10:34,145
In the next lecture, we're going to
tidy up our waves a little bit more and
192

192

00:10:34,145  -->  00:10:39,025
give ourselves a looping component
to our entire waveConfigs.
193

193

00:10:39,025  -->  00:10:40,780
Great work, and
I'll see you in the next video.
