2

00:00:05.141  -->  00:00:07.070
In this video,
we're taking on ladders as a challenge.
3

3

00:00:07.070  -->  00:00:10.490
We're going to have our player climbing up
ladders and climbing back down ladders.
4

4

00:00:10.490  -->  00:00:13.492
And as the player climbs,
transition into his climbing,
5

5

00:00:13.492  -->  00:00:15.461
his [SOUND] climbing animations take.
6

6

00:00:15.461  -->  00:00:17.720
You can see him there,
wiggling his little hands.
7

7

00:00:17.720  -->  00:00:20.420
Well, I have a couple of bugs that
we'll solve in the next video, but for
8

8

00:00:20.420  -->  00:00:22.820
now we'll be climbing up and down ladders.
9

9

00:00:22.820  -->  00:00:23.950
Let's jump in and get started.
10

10

00:00:24.970  -->  00:00:28.180
Against this lecture,
you will see one file to download,
11

11

00:00:28.180  -->  00:00:29.700
which is the ladder sprite.
12

12

00:00:29.700  -->  00:00:32.200
Go ahead and download that,
drag that into your project.
13

13

00:00:32.200  -->  00:00:37.040
You should see SPA_ladder, our nice little
ladder sprite there we'll be using.
14

14

00:00:37.040  -->  00:00:40.790
So with that ladder and with the knowledge
you have of how to have your character
15

15

00:00:40.790  -->  00:00:45.260
move left and right, how to check for
the collision based on a layer.
16

16

00:00:45.260  -->  00:00:47.380
If we're standing on the ground,
then we know how to jump.
17

17

00:00:47.380  -->  00:00:50.660
So, with the knowledge of those things
we've been doing the last few lectures and
18

18

00:00:50.660  -->  00:00:51.930
with your new ladder sprite,
19

19

00:00:51.930  -->  00:00:55.750
you have everything you need to
take on today's mega challenge.
20

20

00:00:55.750  -->  00:00:59.480
The mega challenge is to
implement ladder climbing.
21

21

00:00:59.480  -->  00:01:02.620
So, remember, as you're going through
this process set up your tilemap first.
22

22

00:01:02.620  -->  00:01:07.890
Drag your ladder into the tilemap,
the tilemap pallet that is.
23

23

00:01:07.890  -->  00:01:09.610
Make sure that you have
your layers set up.
24

24

00:01:09.610  -->  00:01:13.510
We have the sorting layer as
well as the collision layer
25

25

00:01:13.510  -->  00:01:16.810
that you need to set up for that process.
26

26

00:01:16.810  -->  00:01:19.300
Also, need to create a ClimbLadder method.
27

27

00:01:19.300  -->  00:01:22.320
Within that method we want to check
that we're touching the ladder.
28

28

00:01:22.320  -->  00:01:26.070
We also want to apply some
climb velocity to the y-axis,
29

29

00:01:26.070  -->  00:01:29.950
that which we did with
the run on the x axis.
30

30

00:01:29.950  -->  00:01:34.480
We had our cross platform input manager
looking in the horizontal axis.
31

31

00:01:34.480  -->  00:01:39.205
Here we will vertical axis, And
also to set the animator to climbing.
32

32

00:01:39.205  -->  00:01:43.935
When you are in that climbing mode,
climbing state, so that's some hints and
33

33

00:01:43.935  -->  00:01:44.945
some information.
34

34

00:01:44.945  -->  00:01:48.655
This process is probably about 20 or
25 little steps you need through.
35

35

00:01:48.655  -->  00:01:51.305
If you get stuck at any point in time,
go back and
36

36

00:01:51.305  -->  00:01:55.065
check the previous lectures where we went
through all of these different processes.
37

37

00:01:55.065  -->  00:01:59.840
The one thing we might not have touched on
is if you find your player's bumping into
38

38

00:01:59.840  -->  00:02:04.210
the ladder, then just make sure that you
have your ladder collision set as trigger
39

39

00:02:04.210  -->  00:02:05.350
and not as collider.
40

40

00:02:05.350  -->  00:02:08.955
That way you can smoothly move through it.
41

41

00:02:08.955  -->  00:02:12.805
Okay, so this is a good one give yourself
a good fifteen minutes to half an hour.
42

42

00:02:12.805  -->  00:02:14.515
Dive in and implement climbing.
43

43

00:02:14.515  -->  00:02:16.335
You might have a bug or two, that's fine.
44

44

00:02:16.335  -->  00:02:20.735
We'll fix that either in this video or the
next video, but get your player moving up
45

45

00:02:20.735  -->  00:02:23.345
and down ladders, and I'll see you back
here when you've had a shot at that.
46

46

00:02:25.500  -->  00:02:26.460
Okay, welcome back.
47

47

00:02:26.460  -->  00:02:27.180
How did you go?
48

48

00:02:27.180  -->  00:02:30.080
I hope you went well, I hope you now have
ladders and you're running up and down.
49

49

00:02:30.080  -->  00:02:33.470
If there's any gaps in your process or
you're not sure about something,
50

50

00:02:33.470  -->  00:02:34.860
then follow through.
51

51

00:02:34.860  -->  00:02:36.430
I'm going to follow with us now.
52

52

00:02:36.430  -->  00:02:41.630
I'm going to first of all start by
creating a new Tilemap, 2D object Tilemap.
53

53

00:02:41.630  -->  00:02:44.610
I will call this Tilemap Climbing, and
54

54

00:02:44.610  -->  00:02:47.430
pretty much name all my things
Climbing at this point in time.
55

55

00:02:47.430  -->  00:02:50.350
So, we have our new climbing
tile up into there,
56

56

00:02:50.350  -->  00:02:53.370
I'm going to drag my
ladder into my tile part.
57

57

00:02:53.370  -->  00:03:00.230
It'll ask me where to save it, I wish to
save it in the tiles folder, save there.
58

58

00:03:00.230  -->  00:03:03.950
You can see that it's tiny, that's because
our script is not 100 pixels per unit.
59

59

00:03:03.950  -->  00:03:09.260
We're going to change that to 32 and
hit Apply, and while we're here,
60

60

00:03:09.260  -->  00:03:14.070
I'm going to make an edit to
the ladder's sprite physics shapes.
61

61

00:03:14.070  -->  00:03:18.630
You can see there's a weird little bit
of non collision in the middle here.
62

62

00:03:18.630  -->  00:03:20.770
It shouldn't be a problem, but
I'm going to delete that anyway.
63

63

00:03:20.770  -->  00:03:24.420
Click on one of these,
these outside gripy things here.
64

64

00:03:24.420  -->  00:03:28.430
Click and delete, just hit the Delete key
on your keyboard, that should delete them.
65

65

00:03:28.430  -->  00:03:31.010
Also, going to move these
in a little bit closer.
66

66

00:03:31.010  -->  00:03:33.820
Unless you're say the guts of the ladder,
the middle of it,
67

67

00:03:33.820  -->  00:03:34.970
you shouldn't be able to climb on it.
68

68

00:03:34.970  -->  00:03:38.410
You shouldn't be able to climb it
with a finger tip on the side there.
69

69

00:03:38.410  -->  00:03:41.520
This is not rock climbing,
this is ladder climbing.
70

70

00:03:41.520  -->  00:03:45.750
Okay, and make sure you keep them
very low on the bottom here.
71

71

00:03:45.750  -->  00:03:47.400
Pressing to the bottom and
pressing to the top,
72

72

00:03:47.400  -->  00:03:49.230
don't accidentally give
yourself a gap in the middle.
73

73

00:03:49.230  -->  00:03:52.650
That could cause some issues when
we do our composite collider.
74

74

00:03:52.650  -->  00:03:56.220
Okay, so hit Apply on that,
jump back over in here.
75

75

00:03:56.220  -->  00:03:59.700
Speaking of composite colliders,
over on to our climbing.
76

76

00:03:59.700  -->  00:04:01.730
Tile map here,
we need to add a couple of things.
77

77

00:04:01.730  -->  00:04:05.700
First of all,
we will add a tilemap collider 2D, and
78

78

00:04:05.700  -->  00:04:10.770
then we will add a composite collider 2D,
as we did before.
79

79

00:04:10.770  -->  00:04:14.670
The tile map collider 2D we
want to use by composite.
80

80

00:04:14.670  -->  00:04:18.550
The rigid body 2D we need to make sure
that we set that to static, otherwise,
81

81

00:04:18.550  -->  00:04:21.900
our ladders will go flying off
down into the nether regions, or
82

82

00:04:21.900  -->  00:04:25.720
nether regions down into
the bottom of tough.
83

83

00:04:25.720  -->  00:04:29.050
It's probably not called the nether
region, it's down down below off screen.
84

84

00:04:29.050  -->  00:04:32.840
There we go, and we're going say
our collider 2D is a trigger.
85

85

00:04:32.840  -->  00:04:35.260
Next, we should go and
paint some lighters into our tarmac.
86

86

00:04:35.260  -->  00:04:38.943
Make sure you're clicked on Climbing,
this one gets me from time to time.
87

87

00:04:38.943  -->  00:04:41.866
Click on your ladder and
the Paint tool, and
88

88

00:04:41.866  -->  00:04:46.930
then we will put a letter along the side,
and all we can see is our collision.
89

89

00:04:46.930  -->  00:04:47.714
Why is that?
Well,
90

90

00:04:47.714  -->  00:04:52.730
we haven't set up our climbing layers yet,
sorry,
91

91

00:04:52.730  -->  00:04:57.974
our climbing tilemap over
to the title map rendering,
92

92

00:04:57.974  -->  00:05:03.337
which we will click on Plus here and
call this climbing.
93

93

00:05:03.337  -->  00:05:04.120
Where's the order for this?
94

94

00:05:04.120  -->  00:05:07.720
Well, it needs to be between
the background and the player I believe.
95

95

00:05:07.720  -->  00:05:08.980
So we'll put it just there.
96

96

00:05:08.980  -->  00:05:12.360
We might need to tweak that later on,
but I think that should be good.
97

97

00:05:12.360  -->  00:05:17.090
Back over into our climbing Tilemap and
we need to find the Tilemap renderer.
98

98

00:05:18.320  -->  00:05:20.400
Sorting Layer should be
now defined as Climbing.
99

99

00:05:20.400  -->  00:05:24.170
Now we can see not just our collision but
also the actual ladder itself.
100

100

00:05:24.170  -->  00:05:27.170
Fantastico, while we're talking about
layers let's jump up into the top
101

101

00:05:27.170  -->  00:05:29.770
right while clicked on the Climbing timer.
102

102

00:05:29.770  -->  00:05:31.120
Select the Layer here.
103

103

00:05:31.120  -->  00:05:33.390
Add Layer.
104

104

00:05:33.390  -->  00:05:34.700
We need to add a new.
105

105

00:05:34.700  -->  00:05:36.200
I'm gonna put this on the User Layer 9.
106

106

00:05:36.200  -->  00:05:39.030
It doesn't matter so much at the moment
with the way we're doing this, but
107

107

00:05:39.030  -->  00:05:40.130
I would call it Climbing.
108

108

00:05:40.130  -->  00:05:43.000
It doesn't matter where we put this,
is what I'm saying.
109

109

00:05:43.000  -->  00:05:44.440
But we'll put it on Climbing.
110

110

00:05:44.440  -->  00:05:46.560
And then that should all be good.
111

111

00:05:46.560  -->  00:05:49.640
That will have clicked into there,
back onto the climbing.
112

112

00:05:49.640  -->  00:05:50.720
There's a lot of clicking in and
113

113

00:05:50.720  -->  00:05:55.390
clicking out, up to the layer at the top
here, and define it as climbing.
114

114

00:05:55.390  -->  00:05:59.010
Now we know that it's our climbing
from a collision perspective, and
115

115

00:05:59.010  -->  00:06:01.910
it is climbing from a sorting perspective.
116

116

00:06:01.910  -->  00:06:04.250
We've turned on a static.
117

117

00:06:04.250  -->  00:06:06.590
We're using by composite,
and we have as a trigger.
118

118

00:06:06.590  -->  00:06:09.470
So most of those aspects in there
should be pretty good to go now.
119

119

00:06:09.470  -->  00:06:11.800
So what we need to do is hop
over into our player script.
120

120

00:06:14.393  -->  00:06:16.100
I have a look what's going on in here.
121

121

00:06:16.100  -->  00:06:18.500
We need to create ourselves a new method.
122

122

00:06:18.500  -->  00:06:21.880
Underneath jump,
I will put a climb ladder.
123

123

00:06:21.880  -->  00:06:23.600
Actually, no,
I'm gonna put this a little bit higher.
124

124

00:06:23.600  -->  00:06:25.630
I'm gonna put it between run an jump,
just so
125

125

00:06:25.630  -->  00:06:27.350
I can see things a little bit more easily.
126

126

00:06:27.350  -->  00:06:28.500
Private void.
127

127

00:06:29.890  -->  00:06:34.390
ClimbLadder so when I say see things a bit
more easily I mean that I can easily
128

128

00:06:34.390  -->  00:06:37.940
scroll up and easily scroll down having
to rather than having it all the way down
129

129

00:06:37.940  -->  00:06:41.950
the bottom here so I put in my brackets
ClimbLadder what do we need to do in here?
130

130

00:06:41.950  -->  00:06:46.810
Well we need to first of all say are we
touching the ladder so very similar to my.
131

131

00:06:46.810  -->  00:06:47.570
Statement down below.
132

132

00:06:47.570  -->  00:06:48.590
We'll do it in the negative.
133

133

00:06:48.590  -->  00:06:50.710
If I'm not doing something then return.
134

134

00:06:50.710  -->  00:06:54.056
So if we are not
135

135

00:06:54.056  -->  00:07:02.046
myCollider2D.IsTouchingLayers very
136

136

00:07:02.046  -->  00:07:09.050
similar (LayerMask) .GetMask and
137

137

00:07:09.050  -->  00:07:13.240
then our mask is going to be let's jump
back over into our scene what's our layer
138

138

00:07:13.240  -->  00:07:19.370
mask up the top here click on Climbing and
it is Climbing so
139

139

00:07:19.370  -->  00:07:24.430
copy that back over into our script
paste in Climbing okay so if.
140

140

00:07:25.450  -->  00:07:30.510
Where not touching the climbing layer,
then what is it that we should do?
141

141

00:07:30.510  -->  00:07:33.690
Well, we should as we've done before,
we should return.
142

142

00:07:35.890  -->  00:07:37.650
Nice and simple there.
143

143

00:07:37.650  -->  00:07:41.080
So we're not touching return, don't do
the stuff, but if we are touching then,
144

144

00:07:41.080  -->  00:07:43.950
let's do some stuff, let's get funky here.
145

145

00:07:45.120  -->  00:07:49.350
And we take out inspiration from the run
where we have a cross platform input
146

146

00:07:49.350  -->  00:07:49.960
manager and
147

147

00:07:49.960  -->  00:07:53.190
we're creating some sort of new velocity
that we're adding to the player.
148

148

00:07:53.190  -->  00:07:57.010
So we will type this up, rather than
just doing a copying and pasting.
149

149

00:07:57.010  -->  00:07:59.510
Type it out so we're practicing this flow.
150

150

00:07:59.510  -->  00:08:04.780
Cross sort of flow control throw equals
cross platform input manager.getaccess.
151

151

00:08:04.780  -->  00:08:07.290
And what is the access gonna be here?
152

152

00:08:07.290  -->  00:08:12.770
Again let's jump back over into
our edit project settings input
153

153

00:08:12.770  -->  00:08:17.130
we can see if we scroll down to
vertical it is called vertical.
154

154

00:08:17.130  -->  00:08:18.220
Nicely named, look at that.
155

155

00:08:18.220  -->  00:08:21.000
Spot on.
Vertical is vertical so paste in vertical
156

156

00:08:22.490  -->  00:08:27.420
and then next line we're going to
say Just saying with run Vector2
157

157

00:08:27.420  -->  00:08:32.680
we'll call this climbvelocity,
not playervelocity this time.
158

158

00:08:32.680  -->  00:08:35.050
The other line could possibly
be called runvelocity,
159

159

00:08:35.050  -->  00:08:37.060
probably a little more accurate,
but it's fine.
160

160

00:08:37.060  -->  00:08:43.070
We'll leave it there for now,
equals new Vector2, this is going to be
161

161

00:08:43.070  -->  00:08:47.330
We need to have the X to be the same as it
currently is and then the Y, we're going
162

162

00:08:47.330  -->  00:08:52.310
to apply our climb velocity so this will
be my rigid body, not my animator again.
163

163

00:08:53.490  -->  00:08:57.550
We'll be quick on
the order of complete here.
164

164

00:08:57.550  -->  00:09:01.940
My rigid body dot velocity dot X comma
165

165

00:09:03.210  -->  00:09:06.890
Control Throw which will be
a value from minus one to plus one
166

166

00:09:08.520  -->  00:09:14.410
times by our what we call this
climbSpeed we'll call this climbSpeed
167

167

00:09:14.410  -->  00:09:19.890
we haven't defined climbSpeed yet so let's
scroll up to the top serialize a field.
168

168

00:09:21.820  -->  00:09:25.980
SerializeField, this will be a type float
just like the other ones we've got her,
169

169

00:09:25.980  -->  00:09:31.830
climbSpeed, and as all good climbSpeed
should be, it will be initialized at 5.
170

170

00:09:31.830  -->  00:09:32.470
Why 5?
171

171

00:09:32.470  -->  00:09:34.960
Don't know, we'll just put it at 5 and
then we can go and
172

172

00:09:34.960  -->  00:09:36.550
change it in the inspector if need be.
173

173

00:09:37.600  -->  00:09:40.110
Now back down to ClimbLadder,
what have we got here?
174

174

00:09:40.110  -->  00:09:45.080
Last step we need in this process is to
say myRigidBody, got it correct this time,
175

175

00:09:45.080  -->  00:09:48.080
velocity = climbVelocity.
176

176

00:09:52.030  -->  00:09:54.370
I don't have my typing fingers on today.
177

177

00:09:54.370  -->  00:09:58.240
There we go, so our climbVelocity
is gonna be myRigidBody.velocity.
178

178

00:09:58.240  -->  00:09:59.220
What is climbVelocity?
179

179

00:09:59.220  -->  00:10:04.060
Well it is this new Vector2, which is
the same as you currently are on the x
180

180

00:10:04.060  -->  00:10:07.700
axis and the controlThrow up or
down, that is.
181

181

00:10:07.700  -->  00:10:10.440
Times by climb speed and
as i was saying is control
182

182

00:10:10.440  -->  00:10:13.290
throat on the vertical axis that's why
it's up or down minus 1, 2 plus 1.
183

183

00:10:13.290  -->  00:10:18.400
So that will all take place
if we are actually touching
184

184

00:10:18.400  -->  00:10:23.530
the the mask or
touching the layer of climbing.
185

185

00:10:23.530  -->  00:10:28.030
Let's save that and see what we've missed
before we do that actually I forget,
186

186

00:10:28.030  -->  00:10:32.410
usually I forget this but this time I
remembered ClimbLadder(), we need to put
187

187

00:10:32.410  -->  00:10:37.720
our method here in Update() so
every frame we're calling ClimbLadder().
188

188

00:10:37.720  -->  00:10:41.960
Now we will go into our scene,
click play, see what's happening here.
189

189

00:10:41.960  -->  00:10:44.890
Run around, yep, jump still works good,
and we can climb the ladder.
190

190

00:10:44.890  -->  00:10:46.500
Cool.
and he drifts back down again.
191

191

00:10:46.500  -->  00:10:50.170
So, that's the starting point of being
able to ClimbLadder, conditionally saying,
192

192

00:10:50.170  -->  00:10:51.830
if you're on a ladder then do that.
193

193

00:10:51.830  -->  00:10:54.830
Push up and
drift into the air anywhere else.
194

194

00:10:54.830  -->  00:10:56.780
And we're actually climbing the ladder.
195

195

00:10:56.780  -->  00:10:59.820
Now that we can move up and
down the ladder, let us go and
196

196

00:10:59.820  -->  00:11:01.370
change our animation state.
197

197

00:11:01.370  -->  00:11:04.000
So back over into our script here,
where do we need to put this?
198

198

00:11:04.000  -->  00:11:08.450
Well, very similar to run, we're gonna
put this underneath the movement.
199

199

00:11:08.450  -->  00:11:15.860
So we'll say we'll make this as a bool
called player Has vertical speed.
200

200

00:11:15.860  -->  00:11:19.150
I think the player would be moving up or
down.
201

201

00:11:19.150  -->  00:11:25.730
And, as with above methf.abs, as in
absolute value, my rigidbody.velocity.
202

202

00:11:25.730  -->  00:11:27.390
What's his son gonna be?
203

203

00:11:27.390  -->  00:11:32.340
It's gonna be y once again
greater than mathf.epsilon.
204

204

00:11:32.340  -->  00:11:34.830
The closer thing we can get
to zero if it's not zero.
205

205

00:11:36.630  -->  00:11:38.800
And then what is it in our animator?
206

206

00:11:38.800  -->  00:11:44.670
Well it's myanimator.setball set ball.
207

207

00:11:44.670  -->  00:11:47.320
We need to know, first of all we
can see here with a signature,
208

208

00:11:47.320  -->  00:11:49.520
it's the,
what signature are we using here?
209

209

00:11:49.520  -->  00:11:54.870
String name, so two of two We are using
string name which is going to be climbing,
210

210

00:11:54.870  -->  00:11:58.570
but we'll go check that and then the bool
value which we will need as true.
211

211

00:11:59.690  -->  00:12:04.170
In this case playerHasVerticalSpeed,
so it's true or false.
212

212

00:12:04.170  -->  00:12:05.280
Let's go and double check.
213

213

00:12:05.280  -->  00:12:06.070
Where do we find that?
214

214

00:12:06.070  -->  00:12:07.130
In our animations.
215

215

00:12:08.210  -->  00:12:11.560
No player,
no animator here we can see climbing.
216

216

00:12:11.560  -->  00:12:12.620
Double click, copy that.
217

217

00:12:12.620  -->  00:12:17.030
This is our transition ball, so
if this is true you're climbing,
218

218

00:12:17.030  -->  00:12:19.440
if it's not true you
should not be climbing.
219

219

00:12:19.440  -->  00:12:20.530
So back to the player script.
220

220

00:12:21.730  -->  00:12:23.690
Set ball climbing.
221

221

00:12:23.690  -->  00:12:26.510
And rather than just saying true,
that will turn it on the whole time or
222

222

00:12:26.510  -->  00:12:28.170
false it will turn it off the whole time.
223

223

00:12:28.170  -->  00:12:30.580
We're saying whether or
not the player has.
224

224

00:12:30.580  -->  00:12:34.220
VerticalSpeed is our ball just in here.
225

225

00:12:35.750  -->  00:12:39.420
Okay, let's hop back over
into playing the game.
226

226

00:12:39.420  -->  00:12:42.210
We'll see if we can climb up and down.
227

227

00:12:42.210  -->  00:12:42.760
Climb up.
228

228

00:12:42.760  -->  00:12:46.490
And got a little runny,
squiggly animation going on there.
229

229

00:12:46.490  -->  00:12:48.550
So there are a few ways
that you can approach this.
230

230

00:12:48.550  -->  00:12:51.320
You can have that your player stops on
the ladder and doesn't float back down.
231

231

00:12:51.320  -->  00:12:53.310
I kinda like the float but
it's not necessary.
232

232

00:12:53.310  -->  00:12:54.580
We can change that.
233

233

00:12:54.580  -->  00:12:58.710
You could have the player
can jump through the ladder.
234

234

00:12:58.710  -->  00:13:00.100
You can have the player
sticks to the ladder.
235

235

00:13:00.100  -->  00:13:04.010
There's a bunch of things that we can do
to have the ladder behavior how we want.
236

236

00:13:04.010  -->  00:13:07.720
This is generally the behavior that
I'm happy with in terms of my design.
237

237

00:13:07.720  -->  00:13:11.660
But feel free to modify it to give it your
own particular flavor of how you want
238

238

00:13:11.660  -->  00:13:13.410
the player to interact with the ladder.
239

239

00:13:13.410  -->  00:13:18.070
One thing you have seen is the bug that if
you're holding up It will cause an issue
240

240

00:13:18.070  -->  00:13:21.930
and the other thing you'll see which
currently I will prefer not to have.
241

241

00:13:21.930  -->  00:13:25.060
I kind of like it, it's the drifting down
but I'm going to change that as well.
242

242

00:13:25.060  -->  00:13:26.950
So those things,
I think we've done enough for this video,
243

243

00:13:26.950  -->  00:13:30.900
in the next video we'll fix that bug and
we'll stop the play at drifting back down.
244

244

00:13:30.900  -->  00:13:32.580
Now we've got ladder movement and
245

245

00:13:32.580  -->  00:13:36.110
we are well in our way to having our cool
gameplay so that we can go ahead and put
246

246

00:13:36.110  -->  00:13:40.010
in some more cool gameplay features and
functionality and start building levels.
247

247

00:13:40.010  -->  00:13:43.820
So well done On having your player
climb up and down the ladder based upon
248

248

00:13:43.820  -->  00:13:48.190
the condition of touching the climb
ladder layer or the climbing layer.
249

249

00:13:48.190  -->  00:13:49.920
And I will see you in the next video.
