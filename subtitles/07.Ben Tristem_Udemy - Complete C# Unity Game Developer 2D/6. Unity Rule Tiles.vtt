2

00:00:03.941  -->  00:00:06.210
In this video we're gonna
do something very exciting.
3

3

00:00:06.210  -->  00:00:10.030
We're gonna invest a chunk of time so that
we can save ourselves a huge amount of
4

4

00:00:10.030  -->  00:00:13.980
time by setting up our
rules on a rule tile.
5

5

00:00:13.980  -->  00:00:17.000
Where when we paint things
down it automagically knows
6

6

00:00:17.000  -->  00:00:20.230
what the tiles should be surrounding it,
and above it, and next to it.
7

7

00:00:20.230  -->  00:00:22.570
So it all fits together nice and
seamlessly.
8

8

00:00:22.570  -->  00:00:25.620
So let's jump in and
make ourselves a rule tile.
9

9

00:00:25.620  -->  00:00:28.560
Future versions of unity I'm sure
will have rule tiles right within
10

10

00:00:28.560  -->  00:00:32.780
the engine itself, but for now we need to
jump over to the Unity GitHub repository.
11

11

00:00:32.780  -->  00:00:35.130
I've given you a link for
this in the resources.
12

12

00:00:35.130  -->  00:00:36.930
And click on the clone or download.
13

13

00:00:36.930  -->  00:00:38.720
From there click on download zip.
14

14

00:00:38.720  -->  00:00:40.820
I've also given you the zip
file against the lecture.
15

15

00:00:40.820  -->  00:00:44.910
If you just want to grab that from
the resources, and not go to the website.
16

16

00:00:44.910  -->  00:00:47.480
After you grab that, jump back into Unity.
17

17

00:00:47.480  -->  00:00:50.220
Unzip your 2D extras master.
18

18

00:00:50.220  -->  00:00:53.940
Drag the folder over into
the assets directory over here.
19

19

00:00:53.940  -->  00:00:56.100
It will do a little bit of importing.
20

20

00:00:56.100  -->  00:00:56.940
Fantastics.
21

21

00:00:56.940  -->  00:00:57.600
All done in there.
22

22

00:00:57.600  -->  00:01:00.108
I'm gonna do a quick bit of tidy
up before I go any further.
23

23

00:01:00.108  -->  00:01:04.270
I'm gonna create a new folder and
put in that new folder, if it appears.
24

24

00:01:04.270  -->  00:01:04.850
There it is.
25

25

00:01:04.850  -->  00:01:06.560
I'm gonna name this sprite.
26

26

00:01:06.560  -->  00:01:10.310
I'm gonna put my sprites in there, so
I've got a distinction between sprites and
27

27

00:01:10.310  -->  00:01:11.430
tiles.
28

28

00:01:11.430  -->  00:01:16.080
Okay, the simple process of bringing in
this folder, the 2D extras master folder
29

29

00:01:16.080  -->  00:01:18.910
that is, means that we're ready
to go with the rule tiles.
30

30

00:01:18.910  -->  00:01:25.730
If you click on the sprites and tiles
folder, right click, create a rule tile.
31

31

00:01:25.730  -->  00:01:27.970
And we'll call this platforms.
32

32

00:01:27.970  -->  00:01:28.680
Cuz that's what we're doing.
33

33

00:01:28.680  -->  00:01:30.780
We're creating extra Platforms in here.
34

34

00:01:30.780  -->  00:01:35.720
You can see over on the right
here our Platforms.asset file has
35

35

00:01:35.720  -->  00:01:40.500
over in the inspector we've got a whole
bunch of rules that we can set up in here.
36

36

00:01:40.500  -->  00:01:45.040
Clicking plus adds a new rule and
minus takes away that rule.
37

37

00:01:45.040  -->  00:01:46.570
And at once a default sprites.
38

38

00:01:46.570  -->  00:01:47.150
So basically,
39

39

00:01:47.150  -->  00:01:51.680
if it can't find a relevant rule then
it will just use the default sprites.
40

40

00:01:51.680  -->  00:01:54.510
That's why we're gonna start with
the default sprite, click select.
41

41

00:01:54.510  -->  00:01:57.960
I'm gonna find this nice
green grass top one here and
42

42

00:01:57.960  -->  00:02:00.965
have that as our default sprite.
43

43

00:02:00.965  -->  00:02:03.205
Okay, next we're gonna set our first rule,
and
44

44

00:02:03.205  -->  00:02:06.395
I'll take you through how
the rules work for our rule task.
45

45

00:02:06.395  -->  00:02:12.041
We click on there, we're gonna find one of
our pretty neutral, in the middle tiles.
46

46

00:02:12.041  -->  00:02:17.095
This one just here,
this dark middle tile, _11 it is.
47

47

00:02:17.095  -->  00:02:19.895
Then we'll click on that and
you can see it's placed it in here.
48

48

00:02:19.895  -->  00:02:24.105
Now this grid, this three by three grid
is where we put in the particular rules.
49

49

00:02:24.105  -->  00:02:29.150
We can also change the overall rules
on how the tile behaves over here,
50

50

00:02:29.150  -->  00:02:30.970
I'll get to those in a moment.
51

51

00:02:30.970  -->  00:02:34.530
But for here, if you click once
in a cell it does a green arrow,
52

52

00:02:34.530  -->  00:02:38.110
if you click a second time it does a X,
and third time it removes it.
53

53

00:02:38.110  -->  00:02:41.770
Basically what that is saying is,
when I scroll in here it's saying,
54

54

00:02:41.770  -->  00:02:47.510
if there is something above then we put
in an x to say, sorry, other way around.
55

55

00:02:47.510  -->  00:02:50.340
If there's something above we put
an arrow saying there is something above.
56

56

00:02:50.340  -->  00:02:54.280
There is another tile next to
me in an upward direction and
57

57

00:02:54.280  -->  00:02:58.470
if we put an x then we say there is
nothing in that particular spot.
58

58

00:02:58.470  -->  00:03:00.470
So it's saying,
is there a tile, yes or no?
59

59

00:03:00.470  -->  00:03:03.520
In this instance you can see
we've got the middle here,
60

60

00:03:03.520  -->  00:03:05.800
that there's something
the whole way around this guy.
61

61

00:03:05.800  -->  00:03:10.430
So we're gonna say a green
arrow in all those directions.
62

62

00:03:10.430  -->  00:03:12.590
Later on when we finesse
this a little bit more,
63

63

00:03:12.590  -->  00:03:15.840
we'll find that we don't
need arrows on the corners.
64

64

00:03:15.840  -->  00:03:18.710
But for now, I'll leave them in so
that we're doing exactly,
65

65

00:03:18.710  -->  00:03:22.310
we're replicating this particular
situation as a starting point.
66

66

00:03:22.310  -->  00:03:24.910
Okay, so now we've got one rule for
our rule tile,
67

67

00:03:24.910  -->  00:03:27.370
we need to be able to use that rule tile.
68

68

00:03:27.370  -->  00:03:31.190
And originally my intention was to say,
let's create a new pallet,
69

69

00:03:31.190  -->  00:03:34.730
because that's what Ben and I went through
in our prototype, to create this section.
70

70

00:03:34.730  -->  00:03:39.840
We had a manual tiles palette and
we had a rule tiles palette.
71

71

00:03:39.840  -->  00:03:42.870
So a rules tiles, a rule tiles, sorry,
72

72

00:03:42.870  -->  00:03:46.630
rule tiles palette, and
we had so two palettes.
73

73

00:03:46.630  -->  00:03:49.660
But I'm not gonna get you to do
that because what I found was
74

74

00:03:49.660  -->  00:03:51.550
toggling between the two and
then painting.
75

75

00:03:51.550  -->  00:03:52.750
So over to manual tiles,
76

76

00:03:52.750  -->  00:03:55.640
paint over to rule tiles paint
was a little bit of a pain.
77

77

00:03:55.640  -->  00:03:58.110
If you don't have a huge amount of
78

78

00:03:58.110  -->  00:04:02.210
assets in your palate I think it's
pretty easy just to have one palate.
79

79

00:04:02.210  -->  00:04:06.270
But remember you do have that option there
if you'd like to have additional palates
80

80

00:04:06.270  -->  00:04:08.890
to help you remember
exactly what is where, and
81

81

00:04:08.890  -->  00:04:10.540
that's a good way to go about doing it.
82

82

00:04:10.540  -->  00:04:14.728
But for me, I'm gonna grab my asset,
my platforms.asset and
83

83

00:04:14.728  -->  00:04:17.809
drag that into this palette
up to the top here,
84

84

00:04:17.809  -->  00:04:21.931
so I know my rule tiles are gonna
be up the top here on their own.
85

85

00:04:21.931  -->  00:04:26.130
And from there I can click on the raw tile
and paint that straight into the world.
86

86

00:04:26.130  -->  00:04:30.500
Because I've only got one rule and by
default they're all coming in as default.
87

87

00:04:30.500  -->  00:04:34.300
But once I make a complete
enclosure around that.
88

88

00:04:34.300  -->  00:04:36.670
You can see that this hound
has now turned to black, so
89

89

00:04:36.670  -->  00:04:40.030
it's automatically created
itself as this particular tile.
90

90

00:04:40.030  -->  00:04:44.260
So that's the starting point for
how we go about creating rule tiles.
91

91

00:04:44.260  -->  00:04:46.610
There's a lot of logic
to consider in here, and
92

92

00:04:46.610  -->  00:04:48.540
I'll give you a couple of rules for
how that works.
93

93

00:04:48.540  -->  00:04:53.530
The first rule is, whatever is on
the top gets considered first.
94

94

00:04:53.530  -->  00:04:55.830
So we'll make our second rule and
95

95

00:04:55.830  -->  00:04:59.070
we'll find one of these corners
up in the top left here.
96

96

00:04:59.070  -->  00:05:03.179
So click on our sprite and
it's this very first one _0.
97

97

00:05:03.179  -->  00:05:11.090
And you can see because the rules of
this is basically it's saying if it's,
98

98

00:05:11.090  -->  00:05:14.580
if there's something next to it or not
something next to it then you can do that.
99

99

00:05:14.580  -->  00:05:19.250
When you first put a tile in it often
hijacks what you've got going on but
100

100

00:05:19.250  -->  00:05:21.080
that's fine, we'll put our rules in now.
101

101

00:05:22.640  -->  00:05:23.890
So what are we looking at here?
102

102

00:05:23.890  -->  00:05:26.840
The behavior is that,
we'll go find it down here.
103

103

00:05:26.840  -->  00:05:30.080
There's nothing to the left and
the upper left and above so
104

104

00:05:30.080  -->  00:05:32.930
that's nothing there,
nothing there, and nothing there.
105

105

00:05:32.930  -->  00:05:37.070
There is something below and
to the right and to the bottom right.
106

106

00:05:37.070  -->  00:05:40.810
Now, again, it might be that we say you
don't have to have something here, and
107

107

00:05:40.810  -->  00:05:45.500
you don't have to have something there,
but for now we'll do it exactly as it is.
108

108

00:05:45.500  -->  00:05:48.297
And we'll finesse as we
go along with our logic.
109

109

00:05:48.297  -->  00:05:49.294
So I've got that in there.
110

110

00:05:49.294  -->  00:05:52.493
We can go one step further here, and
this is where we can create a rule,
111

111

00:05:52.493  -->  00:05:54.173
where instead of it being fixed, and
112

112

00:05:54.173  -->  00:05:57.610
fixed means that there's only one
direction that this is being placed at.
113

113

00:05:57.610  -->  00:06:01.520
We can say we rotate it and
that way we can see it's over here,
114

114

00:06:01.520  -->  00:06:03.580
I'll just turn that off so
you can see the effect.
115

115

00:06:03.580  -->  00:06:07.490
I just had it in the top left corner
because it knows the rule, click rotate.
116

116

00:06:07.490  -->  00:06:10.710
Then basically, it's making four rules.
117

117

00:06:10.710  -->  00:06:13.640
We're only seeing one of it, but
it's saying do this four times.
118

118

00:06:13.640  -->  00:06:18.170
Rotate this entire rule to 90 degrees,
and 90 degrees, and 90 degrees.
119

119

00:06:18.170  -->  00:06:22.120
So it's the equivalent of going in, doing
it a second time, grabbing this tile.
120

120

00:06:22.120  -->  00:06:25.880
Putting, instead of the x's being
over there, the x's are now here.
121

121

00:06:25.880  -->  00:06:27.160
And down there like that.
122

122

00:06:27.160  -->  00:06:31.720
So it's rotated the entire
thing by 90 degrees.
123

123

00:06:31.720  -->  00:06:33.950
But we don't wanna do that cuz then
we'll end up with thousands of tiles.
124

124

00:06:33.950  -->  00:06:37.070
So here we just say we've got this
one tile that gets rotated to become
125

125

00:06:37.070  -->  00:06:38.140
the corners.
126

126

00:06:38.140  -->  00:06:42.720
We've got something slightly more
complicated than that in our tile set.
127

127

00:06:42.720  -->  00:06:46.400
We have tiles for the top, but
we've also got corner tiles.
128

128

00:06:46.400  -->  00:06:48.510
I didn't put any in my mockup from before.
129

129

00:06:48.510  -->  00:06:50.680
We also have corner tiles for
the bottom, so
130

130

00:06:50.680  -->  00:06:53.740
for here we're only going
to say mirror on the x.
131

131

00:06:53.740  -->  00:06:58.990
That says that we have these two
scenarios where we have the top role
132

132

00:06:58.990  -->  00:07:03.630
tile facing to the left and the top role
tile facing to the right for these two.
133

133

00:07:03.630  -->  00:07:07.870
And then if we create a third
rule we'll do the bottom one.
134

134

00:07:07.870  -->  00:07:09.760
This will all become
super clear in a moment.
135

135

00:07:11.330  -->  00:07:13.020
Here we go, okay.
136

136

00:07:13.020  -->  00:07:14.850
So we've got that, added that in there.
137

137

00:07:14.850  -->  00:07:18.670
Now we need to create if there's
nothing to the, sorry, nothing left and
138

138

00:07:18.670  -->  00:07:21.010
nothing below, nothing left,
nothing below.
139

139

00:07:21.010  -->  00:07:23.670
But there is something above and
something to the right.
140

140

00:07:23.670  -->  00:07:26.090
And we also want to mirror
that on the x-axis.
141

141

00:07:26.090  -->  00:07:29.287
So you can see our corners and
now place in there.
142

142

00:07:29.287  -->  00:07:33.539
These bottom corner tiles as slightly
different because they don't have quite as
143

143

00:07:33.539  -->  00:07:36.660
much depth from the top to reflect,
they're underneath.
144

144

00:07:36.660  -->  00:07:38.440
That's why they're a little
bit different there.
145

145

00:07:38.440  -->  00:07:42.520
So we've created three,
rule tiles here, and the next step for
146

146

00:07:42.520  -->  00:07:46.050
us is to create all of the rules that
we need for our rule tiles here.
147

147

00:07:46.050  -->  00:07:49.020
So if we go and paint in here,
we can see the outliers,
148

148

00:07:49.020  -->  00:07:49.990
things that don't makes sense.
149

149

00:07:49.990  -->  00:07:52.010
Basically where we've got all
these place holder things.
150

150

00:07:52.010  -->  00:07:54.400
We need to have what is
gonna happen on the top?
151

151

00:07:54.400  -->  00:07:55.850
We need to have what's
gonna happen in the middle?
152

152

00:07:55.850  -->  00:07:56.699
What happens on the corners?
153

153

00:07:56.699  -->  00:08:02.860
So my challenge to you is to set up your
rule tiles, create a rule tile asset.
154

154

00:08:02.860  -->  00:08:06.140
First of all, set up your rules and
155

155

00:08:06.140  -->  00:08:09.750
then paint another couple of platforms and
they can be off the camera if you want.
156

156

00:08:09.750  -->  00:08:12.100
So what I mean by that is
here's our camera down in here,
157

157

00:08:12.100  -->  00:08:14.861
you can paint them just over off
in the side, make sure they work.
158

158

00:08:14.861  -->  00:08:15.562
Do the edge cases.
159

159

00:08:15.562  -->  00:08:16.728
Pop one up to the front.
160

160

00:08:16.728  -->  00:08:17.242
Pop the middle.
161

161

00:08:17.242  -->  00:08:18.760
Do one on its own.
162

162

00:08:18.760  -->  00:08:21.220
Do three side by side like that.
163

163

00:08:21.220  -->  00:08:23.050
Do three up and down like that.
164

164

00:08:23.050  -->  00:08:24.930
You should have all
the assets that you need.
165

165

00:08:24.930  -->  00:08:28.890
Give that a go, and when you come back
we'll compare notes, it might very well be
166

166

00:08:28.890  -->  00:08:32.000
that you've come up with some better logic
than I have which would be excellent.
167

167

00:08:32.000  -->  00:08:35.366
And we will see, and we will compare
notes, when you've done that and
168

168

00:08:35.366  -->  00:08:35.950
come back.
169

169

00:08:38.224  -->  00:08:39.310
Okay, welcome back.
170

170

00:08:39.310  -->  00:08:42.960
Let me show you what I've created here,
just by painting down random shapes and
171

171

00:08:42.960  -->  00:08:45.340
finding the outliers,
is how I've found what I need to do.
172

172

00:08:45.340  -->  00:08:48.873
There's still one or two things, you can
see all these green tiles in here, and
173

173

00:08:48.873  -->  00:08:52.514
the gaps that I'm gonna go through at the
same time with you because it illustrates
174

174

00:08:52.514  -->  00:08:54.337
a really good rule that I wanna show you.
175

175

00:08:54.337  -->  00:08:57.550
And let me just quickly
illustrate what I've done here.
176

176

00:08:57.550  -->  00:09:00.500
So the first couple that
we went through on camera,
177

177

00:09:00.500  -->  00:09:03.930
I've got my one here that's got no blocks
around it and then our two corners.
178

178

00:09:03.930  -->  00:09:06.360
The upper and the lower corners on there.
179

179

00:09:06.360  -->  00:09:09.560
Just the general upper piece,
if it's bigger, long and flat.
180

180

00:09:09.560  -->  00:09:12.360
So there's nothing above but
stuff down below?
181

181

00:09:12.360  -->  00:09:15.460
Then reversed for if it's underneath.
182

182

00:09:15.460  -->  00:09:18.180
And then we also have the left side.
183

183

00:09:18.180  -->  00:09:20.780
And that is mirrored to
also become the right side.
184

184

00:09:20.780  -->  00:09:24.980
And then my construction for
the top piece on its own and
185

185

00:09:24.980  -->  00:09:29.930
the middle and the bottom piece, in terms
of what we do for the rules for those.
186

186

00:09:29.930  -->  00:09:32.080
And then the left and
right pieces if it's just the left and
187

187

00:09:32.080  -->  00:09:37.110
right piece on it's own and this one
down the end here should be mirroring.
188

188

00:09:37.110  -->  00:09:38.610
And I haven't put that in correctly.
189

189

00:09:38.610  -->  00:09:39.180
There we go.
190

190

00:09:39.180  -->  00:09:43.385
Didn't need to mirror that one and this is
the one that's mirrored on the x-axis so
191

191

00:09:43.385  -->  00:09:47.005
that if I drag along like that the left
tile and the right tiles the same.
192

192

00:09:47.005  -->  00:09:48.915
I didn't do that with the top and
193

193

00:09:48.915  -->  00:09:51.695
bottom because the top tile is slightly
different to the bottom tiles.
194

194

00:09:51.695  -->  00:09:53.905
I had to create these individually.
195

195

00:09:53.905  -->  00:09:56.105
Okay, there's a couple of
things lacking in here.
196

196

00:09:56.105  -->  00:10:00.500
One thing that's lacking is the corner
pieces and we do have a tile for that.
197

197

00:10:00.500  -->  00:10:02.660
I'm gonna just put in one tile for this,
198

198

00:10:02.660  -->  00:10:04.870
rather than putting in all
of the individual ones.
199

199

00:10:04.870  -->  00:10:06.100
So let me show you what I mean by that.
200

200

00:10:06.100  -->  00:10:08.320
We've got this corner piece.
201

201

00:10:08.320  -->  00:10:09.920
You can see a little bit
more clearly down there.
202

202

00:10:09.920  -->  00:10:12.605
That center piece use that
corner piece and so on.
203

203

00:10:12.605  -->  00:10:14.975
I'm just gonna select one of those and
rotate it.
204

204

00:10:14.975  -->  00:10:16.425
I think they're all pretty similar.
205

205

00:10:16.425  -->  00:10:18.865
I don't need to have those
individually created.
206

206

00:10:18.865  -->  00:10:22.805
So this is the piece where, let's see if
we can find the exact place for that one.
207

207

00:10:22.805  -->  00:10:24.375
It's bottom right.
208

208

00:10:24.375  -->  00:10:26.505
So that would be the equivalent
of something down in here.
209

209

00:10:26.505  -->  00:10:30.650
So you can see this one looks accurate,
but all these other ones do not.
210

210

00:10:30.650  -->  00:10:33.870
First of all I'm gonna click on the rotate
to show that we want to rotate this in
211

211

00:10:33.870  -->  00:10:35.090
all the directions.
212

212

00:10:35.090  -->  00:10:38.700
And what is going on here, it is,
there is nothing down in that corner but
213

213

00:10:38.700  -->  00:10:41.710
then there is definitely something
to the right, and something below.
214

214

00:10:41.710  -->  00:10:44.750
And there may or not be something above or
below to the left.
215

215

00:10:44.750  -->  00:10:46.960
So just doing that has worked pretty well.
216

216

00:10:47.980  -->  00:10:49.670
For all of these, good.
217

217

00:10:49.670  -->  00:10:52.450
And because it's got an X in the corner,
218

218

00:10:52.450  -->  00:10:53.950
nothing else really has
an X in the corner.
219

219

00:10:53.950  -->  00:10:55.860
It's okay, but
it's all the way down in the bottom.
220

220

00:10:55.860  -->  00:10:59.140
But if you find you've set up a rule,
and it's just not working at all?
221

221

00:10:59.140  -->  00:11:02.450
Then it could be good to drag
it the whole way to the top.
222

222

00:11:02.450  -->  00:11:06.230
The more specific your tiles,
you have those ones at the top.
223

223

00:11:06.230  -->  00:11:07.930
So if it's very specific,
put it at the top, and
224

224

00:11:07.930  -->  00:11:10.950
if it's very general,
have them at the bottom.
225

225

00:11:10.950  -->  00:11:14.770
That way the specific ones have
a chance to be action first.
226

226

00:11:14.770  -->  00:11:17.620
And I need to go through and do a final
look see to see what's messing up.
227

227

00:11:17.620  -->  00:11:20.500
This one here's messed up,
that should be a corner tile.
228

228

00:11:20.500  -->  00:11:21.050
Why is that?
229

229

00:11:21.050  -->  00:11:25.180
It's because we're saying these
corner pieces have something or
230

230

00:11:25.180  -->  00:11:27.620
not something in them that's not valid.
231

231

00:11:27.620  -->  00:11:29.210
It doesn't matter if there's
something up here or
232

232

00:11:29.210  -->  00:11:32.800
not up here that should
be a corner nonetheless.
233

233

00:11:32.800  -->  00:11:34.890
Okay, what else do we have that?
234

234

00:11:34.890  -->  00:11:36.620
It looks pretty good.
235

235

00:11:36.620  -->  00:11:40.780
Okay, let's just zoom out and have a look,
just do a quick paint of this.
236

236

00:11:40.780  -->  00:11:43.330
That looks fine, all meets up.
237

237

00:11:43.330  -->  00:11:45.405
Okay, it is zooming around,
have a look here.
238

238

00:11:45.405  -->  00:11:46.625
I'm pretty happy with that.
239

239

00:11:46.625  -->  00:11:49.965
The scenarios that don't look so good,
maybe we do have the tiles for it,
240

240

00:11:49.965  -->  00:11:50.835
maybe we don't.
241

241

00:11:50.835  -->  00:11:54.535
Like in there, it looks a little bit
odd having the rock than not the rock.
242

242

00:11:54.535  -->  00:11:56.965
Sometimes you're limited by
the assets that you've got.
243

243

00:11:56.965  -->  00:12:00.495
Maybe just painting a little bit of extra
depth in there makes it all look nice.
244

244

00:12:00.495  -->  00:12:03.065
We don't force it to do
what it doesn't want to do.
245

245

00:12:03.065  -->  00:12:07.360
But generally, I'm thinking that looks
pretty good, and pretty good rules set up.
246

246

00:12:07.360  -->  00:12:09.870
Like I said before,
if you come up with some better logic or
247

247

00:12:09.870  -->  00:12:12.870
a more detailed set-up than what we've
got here, I'd love for you to share it.
248

248

00:12:12.870  -->  00:12:16.520
This by no means is the one and
only way to do it.
249

249

00:12:16.520  -->  00:12:20.492
I'm sure you can find an even more awesome
way to go about setting up your rules.
250

250

00:12:20.492  -->  00:12:23.820
But for now, we have saved ourselves
a massive amount of time in the future.
251

251

00:12:23.820  -->  00:12:27.670
To be able to create super quick
levels without rule tiles.
252

252

00:12:27.670  -->  00:12:28.910
Okay, I'll see you in the next video.
