00:00:04.192  -->  00:00:07.369
This is a quick video for us to set off
some coins that the player can pick up,
2

2

00:00:07.369  -->  00:00:08.894
have them animate and spin around.
3

3

00:00:08.894  -->  00:00:10.313
And when the player jumps and
4

4

00:00:10.313  -->  00:00:14.470
lands on them, we pick up those coins,
starting our process of creating a pickup.
5

5

00:00:14.470  -->  00:00:17.620
So let's jump in and make a coin pick-up.
6

6

00:00:17.620  -->  00:00:19.730
Okay, you should be pretty
familiar with this process now,
7

7

00:00:19.730  -->  00:00:21.210
so I'm gonna go with it quite quickly.
8

8

00:00:21.210  -->  00:00:26.779
The first thing we're going to
do is to download the sprites.
9

9

00:00:26.779  -->  00:00:31.362
I've got against this lecture, unzip that,
drag it into your sprites folder.
10

10

00:00:31.362  -->  00:00:33.310
And then we will find that there.
11

11

00:00:33.310  -->  00:00:35.250
We've got a whole bunch of coins,
have a look at those.
12

12

00:00:35.250  -->  00:00:37.490
Yes, they are coins, we can confirm.
13

13

00:00:37.490  -->  00:00:42.720
Change it to 32 pixels per unit and
what else do we need to do in here?
14

14

00:00:42.720  -->  00:00:45.610
We need to slice it up,
so hit Apply there.
15

15

00:00:45.610  -->  00:00:49.620
And jump over into, there we go,
it's like multiple, click Sprite Editor,
16

16

00:00:49.620  -->  00:00:52.710
apply the multiple change
we did just there.
17

17

00:00:52.710  -->  00:00:57.370
Slice we will slice this, I think
18

18

00:00:57.370  -->  00:01:02.290
by cell size is the right way to do that,
32 by 32 padding as always 6 by 6.
19

19

00:01:02.290  -->  00:01:04.340
We'll see how our splicing ends up there.
20

20

00:01:04.340  -->  00:01:07.390
Zoom in a little bit and see,
hold down control Looks in the middle,
21

21

00:01:07.390  -->  00:01:08.530
looks in the middle.
22

22

00:01:08.530  -->  00:01:10.980
That all looks lovely, click Apply.
23

23

00:01:10.980  -->  00:01:15.790
We now have ourselves some sliced
up coins to put into our scene.
24

24

00:01:15.790  -->  00:01:20.250
We need to next create
ourselves an empty game object.
25

25

00:01:20.250  -->  00:01:21.760
That will be called pickups.
26

26

00:01:22.820  -->  00:01:26.260
Pickups, not just coins, but
any old pickups can go in there.
27

27

00:01:26.260  -->  00:01:28.390
We'll reset the transform on this.
28

28

00:01:28.390  -->  00:01:35.080
And underneath pickups, we will create
a first coin game object, so create empty.
29

29

00:01:35.080  -->  00:01:36.670
We'll call this coin.
30

30

00:01:36.670  -->  00:01:40.910
Could call it pickup, but
we'll call it coin pickup, perhaps.
31

31

00:01:40.910  -->  00:01:43.030
Not, I think just coin is fine.
32

32

00:01:43.030  -->  00:01:45.140
We know what a coin means.
33

33

00:01:45.140  -->  00:01:48.240
If we've played a video game,
we know what coin means,, don't we?
34

34

00:01:48.240  -->  00:01:49.870
Okay so there we have our coin.
35

35

00:01:49.870  -->  00:01:50.720
What do we need to do in there?
36

36

00:01:50.720  -->  00:01:52.260
We need to add a bunch of components.
37

37

00:01:52.260  -->  00:01:55.490
So any point in time,
you want to just go ahead and do this.
38

38

00:01:55.490  -->  00:01:57.180
Like I've said we've done
this a few times before.
39

39

00:01:57.180  -->  00:01:58.280
So just jump in and go forward.
40

40

00:01:58.280  -->  00:02:01.680
We need to add a sprite
renderer as a starting point.
41

41

00:02:01.680  -->  00:02:05.670
Let's add one of those and
then drag one of these coin icons.
42

42

00:02:05.670  -->  00:02:10.732
Into there so we now can visualize
that and it has put it over the 00.
43

43

00:02:10.732  -->  00:02:13.240
Which is a little bit of a pain but
we'll go find where that is.
44

44

00:02:13.240  -->  00:02:14.288
Not too much of a pain.
45

45

00:02:14.288  -->  00:02:19.200
Okay, hit F2,
46

46

00:02:19.200  -->  00:02:22.060
double click on the coin,
actually, to zoom in on it.
47

47

00:02:22.060  -->  00:02:23.300
That's a better way of doing it.
48

48

00:02:23.300  -->  00:02:25.930
Now, we have our layering issues,
sorting layout.
49

49

00:02:25.930  -->  00:02:28.470
We've already created interactive all,
so that's where we'll place this.
50

50

00:02:28.470  -->  00:02:29.960
I think that's pretty good for that.
51

51

00:02:29.960  -->  00:02:33.350
And also in terms of the layer, we will
have this as an Interactables layer.
52

52

00:02:33.350  -->  00:02:37.390
Cuz we've said Interactables can only
collide with the player and nothing else.
53

53

00:02:37.390  -->  00:02:38.520
So that's a really easy step.
54

54

00:02:38.520  -->  00:02:42.690
Any other Interactable we do now is
very easily set up with those two steps.
55

55

00:02:42.690  -->  00:02:48.330
Okay, we need a Box Collider, Box Collider
2D, and we'll make sure this is Trigger.
56

56

00:02:48.330  -->  00:02:50.210
Either that, or
the player needs to be a Trigger, and
57

57

00:02:50.210  -->  00:02:51.970
we'll make sure this is a Trigger.
58

58

00:02:51.970  -->  00:02:53.540
So we have that is a box collider.
59

59

00:02:53.540  -->  00:02:54.550
It's a little bit big at the moment.
60

60

00:02:54.550  -->  00:02:58.150
So we'll do a little bit of editing,
just to make it a bit tighter.
61

61

00:02:58.150  -->  00:03:00.150
And drag this in here.
62

62

00:03:00.150  -->  00:03:02.110
Drag that in there.
63

63

00:03:02.110  -->  00:03:05.290
Drag the bottom to up, and
drag the left to the middle.
64

64

00:03:05.290  -->  00:03:09.020
Okay, there we have a nice tight
box collider surrounding that
65

65

00:03:09.020  -->  00:03:10.600
coin we have there, at the moment.
66

66

00:03:10.600  -->  00:03:11.860
Now what else do we need in here?
67

67

00:03:11.860  -->  00:03:12.900
We need some animation,
68

68

00:03:12.900  -->  00:03:16.600
cuz we've got all these frames of
our sprite that we've imported.
69

69

00:03:16.600  -->  00:03:19.680
So I'll add an Animator, Animator.
70

70

00:03:19.680  -->  00:03:21.360
Hopefully this is all super familiar and
71

71

00:03:21.360  -->  00:03:23.880
you're flying through this at
the same time I'm going through it.
72

72

00:03:23.880  -->  00:03:26.310
Got an Animator, but
we don't have an Animator controller, so
73

73

00:03:26.310  -->  00:03:27.780
we'll go through the process for that.
74

74

00:03:27.780  -->  00:03:32.354
First we'll create our animation by
highlighting our coins, right-click, and
75

75

00:03:32.354  -->  00:03:34.400
Create Animation.
76

76

00:03:34.400  -->  00:03:39.370
I'll call this animation Coin Spin,
that's pretty good,
77

77

00:03:39.370  -->  00:03:41.180
drag that over into Animations.
78

78

00:03:41.180  -->  00:03:42.600
While we're over in the Animations,
79

79

00:03:42.600  -->  00:03:46.030
we will create ourselves,
right-click Create an Animator Controller.
80

80

00:03:46.030  -->  00:03:48.190
In the Animator Controller,
81

81

00:03:48.190  -->  00:03:52.830
we call this Coin It's not really gonna
do anything else except for the spinning.
82

82

00:03:52.830  -->  00:03:53.940
So we'll call this coin.
83

83

00:03:53.940  -->  00:03:58.180
We'll call it coin actually cause
we've got enemy, player, and coin.
84

84

00:03:58.180  -->  00:03:59.360
That makes sense.
85

85

00:03:59.360  -->  00:04:03.510
Now click on coin,
expand out animator window a little bit.
86

86

00:04:03.510  -->  00:04:05.820
We've got entry, any state, and exit.
87

87

00:04:05.820  -->  00:04:07.450
We'll just come from entry.
88

88

00:04:09.040  -->  00:04:12.680
And we'll drag in our
clean animation into here.
89

89

00:04:12.680  -->  00:04:15.340
Sorry.
Our coin spin animation.
90

90

00:04:15.340  -->  00:04:21.760
There we go, make sure that the coin spin
has looping ticked on the coin spin.
91

91

00:04:21.760  -->  00:04:23.720
And we don't need any
transition into that.
92

92

00:04:23.720  -->  00:04:25.730
It's just going to sit there and spin.
93

93

00:04:25.730  -->  00:04:26.500
Let's click play.
94

94

00:04:26.500  -->  00:04:28.900
Make sure that we've got a lot of
components that we need in other for
95

95

00:04:28.900  -->  00:04:30.960
our Coin to sit there and spin.
96

96

00:04:30.960  -->  00:04:32.780
We have not, we have forgotten something.
97

97

00:04:32.780  -->  00:04:38.630
Which is to tell the animator that this
is the animator controller we're using.
98

98

00:04:38.630  -->  00:04:41.060
So grab the coin animator controller.
99

99

00:04:41.060  -->  00:04:43.360
Drag that in, now we'll click Play.
100

100

00:04:43.360  -->  00:04:45.580
Make sure it's all working and
spinning around.
101

101

00:04:46.970  -->  00:04:47.580
Yep, there we go.
102

102

00:04:47.580  -->  00:04:49.600
A little bit of a highlight and
a spin, cool.
103

103

00:04:49.600  -->  00:04:51.110
So we can dump in a thousand of those and
104

104

00:04:51.110  -->  00:04:54.400
they would all do their spinny
animation thing, which is really cool.
105

105

00:04:54.400  -->  00:04:57.990
So we will put this in a logical spot for
the player to collect, maybe down there.
106

106

00:04:57.990  -->  00:04:59.600
We'll just have one for now.
107

107

00:04:59.600  -->  00:05:01.360
Time for us to prefab this, though.
108

108

00:05:01.360  -->  00:05:04.510
Make sure we prefab out coin,
drag that down.
109

109

00:05:04.510  -->  00:05:08.270
We now have a coin prefab, so
we can dump in a couple more.
110

110

00:05:08.270  -->  00:05:09.560
After just saying we'll only do one,
111

111

00:05:09.560  -->  00:05:12.980
let's do a couple more, and
we can put it wherever we like.
112

112

00:05:12.980  -->  00:05:16.200
There we go, we've got three coins
that the player can go and get.
113

113

00:05:16.200  -->  00:05:19.020
So we now have our coins,
they're not gonna do anything just yet.
114

114

00:05:19.020  -->  00:05:21.290
But this video is about
setting them up as a pickup.
115

115

00:05:21.290  -->  00:05:23.800
So, the last thing we
need to do on our coin,
116

116

00:05:23.800  -->  00:05:27.450
is to create ourselves a script
through Add Component.
117

117

00:05:27.450  -->  00:05:35.120
We'll call this, coin pickup and
open up that script.
118

118

00:05:37.180  -->  00:05:40.350
Now in our coin pickup script we're
not going to need start or update.
119

119

00:05:40.350  -->  00:05:45.250
What we are going to need to do is our
thing, and our thing is destroy the coin.
120

120

00:05:45.250  -->  00:05:47.000
Now this is a simple one.
121

121

00:05:47.000  -->  00:05:49.060
When the player picks up the coin,
destroy it.
122

122

00:05:49.060  -->  00:05:51.080
So it can simulate the pick up atness.
123

123

00:05:51.080  -->  00:05:53.750
Feel free to add some sound effects
if you're ready to do that.
124

124

00:05:53.750  -->  00:05:57.186
But we will be covering that next because
there's a couple of gotchas that we're
125

125

00:05:57.186  -->  00:05:59.471
gonna have an architect conversation,
architect?
126

126

00:05:59.471  -->  00:06:03.114
Architectural conversation about it
in terms of how we structure our
127

127

00:06:03.114  -->  00:06:05.890
sound effects on something
that we are destroying.
128

128

00:06:05.890  -->  00:06:07.820
So, don't spend too much
time on the sound effects.
129

129

00:06:07.820  -->  00:06:10.470
But it's okay if you're ready
to solve that puzzle and
130

130

00:06:10.470  -->  00:06:12.180
get a little bit ahead of the game.
131

131

00:06:12.180  -->  00:06:13.640
We will be covering that
in the next video too.
132

132

00:06:13.640  -->  00:06:17.283
But for now, jump in and
have it when the player picks up the coin,
133

133

00:06:17.283  -->  00:06:18.549
the coin disappears.
134

134

00:06:21.145  -->  00:06:22.180
How did you get along with that?
135

135

00:06:22.180  -->  00:06:22.880
Hopefully pretty well.
136

136

00:06:22.880  -->  00:06:24.050
We've done this sort of
thing a few times now.
137

137

00:06:24.050  -->  00:06:29.615
We're gonna start by creating a method
private void on trigger enter.
138

138

00:06:29.615  -->  00:06:36.070
[INAUDIBLE] enter 2D and then very simply
we say destroy, what are we destroying?
139

139

00:06:36.070  -->  00:06:38.980
Well we're destroying this
particular gameObject.
140

140

00:06:41.140  -->  00:06:46.270
Okay, save that back into Unity,
click play but
141

141

00:06:46.270  -->  00:06:49.650
make sure we've got that applied so
we did that for one of our coins.
142

142

00:06:49.650  -->  00:06:52.280
And so
we've applied that back to the prefab, or
143

143

00:06:52.280  -->  00:06:54.510
we could have been working
directly in the prefab.
144

144

00:06:54.510  -->  00:06:56.510
Which is a sensible way to do it.
145

145

00:06:56.510  -->  00:07:00.370
Got it to work straight into the prefab,
and
146

146

00:07:00.370  -->  00:07:02.380
got one, got another one and
got another one.
147

147

00:07:02.380  -->  00:07:05.168
There we go, so as we jumped into
those coins they disappeared,
148

148

00:07:05.168  -->  00:07:06.936
we technically got ourselves a pickup.
149

149

00:07:06.936  -->  00:07:09.315
Because we just pick those things up,
no impact on the game yet,
150

150

00:07:09.315  -->  00:07:10.480
no impact on the player.
151

151

00:07:10.480  -->  00:07:12.810
But we've started our
process of having a pick up.
152

152

00:07:12.810  -->  00:07:16.320
In the next video or two, we're gonna
get a little bit meaty in terms of
153

153

00:07:16.320  -->  00:07:19.180
how we have our pick
ups play sound effects.
154

154

00:07:19.180  -->  00:07:23.630
And how we have them persist from scene to
scene, or not persist from scene to scene,
155

155

00:07:23.630  -->  00:07:25.550
depending on what it is we need.
156

156

00:07:25.550  -->  00:07:27.250
So I'll see you in the next video.
