00:00:04,112  -->  00:00:06,190
Congratulations on finishing this section.
2

2

00:00:06,190  -->  00:00:08,442
Well done,
you've been putting a lot of hard work.
3

3

00:00:08,442  -->  00:00:11,740
Here is Ben hanging out with this again,
and we're gonna talk a little bit about
4

4

00:00:11,740  -->  00:00:15,540
what to do next in your journey.
&gt;&gt; Hey guys, okay, so the reason firstly
5

5

00:00:15,540  -->  00:00:18,360
that Ricky is doing this part of the
course is cuz over in our other partner
6

6

00:00:18,360  -->  00:00:22,500
course, the 3D version of the course, I
cover basically exactly the same content.
7

7

00:00:22,500  -->  00:00:25,930
So for a bit of variety, two different
ways of looking at the same thing.
8

8

00:00:25,930  -->  00:00:27,170
Now, what is the purpose of this content?
9

9

00:00:27,170  -->  00:00:29,250
It is not to understand Unity.
10

10

00:00:29,250  -->  00:00:33,680
That is why we have purposely glossed over
Unity is to understand the basics of C#.
11

11

00:00:33,680  -->  00:00:37,060
By the end of the section, what we want
you to take away is just how to write
12

12

00:00:37,060  -->  00:00:40,040
single statements in a format
that the computer understands.
13

13

00:00:40,040  -->  00:00:43,480
Where to put your whitespace, where to put
your semicolons, where to put your code,
14

14

00:00:43,480  -->  00:00:45,090
that's all you need to take from this.
15

15

00:00:45,090  -->  00:00:49,080
The rest of it will come clear, later we
will come back round to the topic and
16

16

00:00:49,080  -->  00:00:51,910
revisit it, and
build on it layer after layer.
17

17

00:00:51,910  -->  00:00:53,740
So awesome, congratulations.
18

18

00:00:53,740  -->  00:00:54,760
Rick, what's next?
&gt;&gt; Well,
19

19

00:00:54,760  -->  00:00:57,060
next up we are getting our
hands dirty with Unity,
20

20

00:00:57,060  -->  00:01:01,140
getting into the engine and playing
around with it and understanding it.
21

21

00:01:01,140  -->  00:01:05,573
Wherever you are in your journey at
the moment, whatever you know with coding,
22

22

00:01:05,573  -->  00:01:08,633
if you're finding it awkward and
uncomfortable, not a problem.
23

23

00:01:08,633  -->  00:01:10,663
When you're starting out,
things might not make sense.
24

24

00:01:10,663  -->  00:01:14,863
But now is the time to keep pushing
forward, keep going, and really,
25

25

00:01:14,863  -->  00:01:17,363
absorb it and have good fun doing it.
&gt;&gt; See you guys.
