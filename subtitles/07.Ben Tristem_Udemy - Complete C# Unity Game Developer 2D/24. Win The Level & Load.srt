[MUSIC]

2

00:00:04,207  -->  00:00:08,093
In this video we're going to hook it up so
that when all the blocks are destroyed,
3

3

00:00:08,093  -->  00:00:09,245
we load our next scene.
4

4

00:00:09,245  -->  00:00:12,005
Super exciting, so let's get started.
5

5

00:00:12,005  -->  00:00:15,990
One thing I didn't talk about fully in the
previous video that I'll touch on now is
6

6

00:00:15,990  -->  00:00:20,177
each of these blocks, you've got one, two,
three, all the way down to ten blocks.
7

7

00:00:20,177  -->  00:00:23,932
Each of these blocks
contains the script block.
8

8

00:00:23,932  -->  00:00:28,914
And on that script block we have,
we're saying, we're calling the method,
9

9

00:00:28,914  -->  00:00:34,288
CountBreakableBlock which basically just
increments the number of blocks by one.
10

10

00:00:34,288  -->  00:00:38,123
And the reason that adds up the total
number of blocks is when we start
11

11

00:00:38,123  -->  00:00:42,365
the game, every single one of these
instances, these are instances of our
12

12

00:00:42,365  -->  00:00:46,365
prefab, every instance says,
do the thing that is on my script.
13

13

00:00:46,365  -->  00:00:47,785
So count me as a block.
14

14

00:00:47,785  -->  00:00:49,718
And then this one says, add another block.
15

15

00:00:49,718  -->  00:00:53,532
And this one says, add another block,
add another block.
16

16

00:00:53,532  -->  00:00:55,566
So each of these are saying
add another block.
17

17

00:00:55,566  -->  00:00:57,732
And so they're doing that ten times.
18

18

00:00:57,732  -->  00:01:00,449
That's why it's adding up in our level.
19

19

00:01:00,449  -->  00:01:02,532
It's adding up all the breakable blocks.
20

20

00:01:02,532  -->  00:01:06,379
Each of them have said count me,
and that adds up to ten.
21

21

00:01:06,379  -->  00:01:09,767
Okay, so just wanted to be super
clear with what's going on there.
22

22

00:01:09,767  -->  00:01:12,556
Now we're gonna jump into level.cs.
23

23

00:01:12,556  -->  00:01:16,099
Again, we need to create
ourselves our next public method.
24

24

00:01:16,099  -->  00:01:19,732
Cuz if we look at our flow we can
see that we have gone through,
25

25

00:01:19,732  -->  00:01:24,298
we've created a level object,
we're keeping track of breakable blocks,
26

26

00:01:24,298  -->  00:01:26,103
we're adding up the blocks.
27

27

00:01:26,103  -->  00:01:28,989
Now we need a method to signal
that a block was broken,
28

28

00:01:28,989  -->  00:01:32,388
an if statement to load the next
level if the blocks is zero, and
29

29

00:01:32,388  -->  00:01:36,072
then also to tell each block to
remove itself when it's destroyed.
30

30

00:01:36,072  -->  00:01:39,581
Remove itself from the total
number of breakable blocks, and
31

31

00:01:39,581  -->  00:01:41,884
that's what we're up to at the moment.
32

32

00:01:41,884  -->  00:01:45,904
The first thing we'll do is create
a public method, public void, and
33

33

00:01:45,904  -->  00:01:48,163
we'll call this one block destroyed.
34

34

00:01:48,163  -->  00:01:49,945
Block destroyed.
35

35

00:01:49,945  -->  00:01:54,086
I have an enclosed parenthesis,
I have enclosed curly braces brackets,
36

36

00:01:54,086  -->  00:01:56,087
and then within here we want to say,
37

37

00:01:56,087  -->  00:02:00,396
well I'm gonna basically say the opposite
to what's happening up in here.
38

38

00:02:00,396  -->  00:02:05,836
When a block is destroyed we want
it to say hey, decrease the number
39

39

00:02:05,836  -->  00:02:12,653
of breakable blocks by saying breakable
blocks minus minus, and then semicolon.
40

40

00:02:12,653  -->  00:02:13,872
Now what else do we need to do?
41

41

00:02:13,872  -->  00:02:18,554
Well, within here as well, at the same
time that a block is destroyed,
42

42

00:02:18,554  -->  00:02:23,096
we want to say right now hey,
have the number of blocks reached zero?
43

43

00:02:23,096  -->  00:02:27,969
So put in an if statement, if,
and then our parenthesis we
44

44

00:02:27,969  -->  00:02:32,346
wanna say if the (breakableBlocks)
is less than or
45

45

00:02:32,346  -->  00:02:36,435
equal to 0,
then what do we want to have happen?
46

46

00:02:36,435  -->  00:02:41,090
Well, what we wanna have happen
is to load the next level.
47

47

00:02:41,090  -->  00:02:46,254
So we know from our ScreenLoader,
so we have a ScreenLoader class.
48

48

00:02:46,254  -->  00:02:50,752
We've already created a load next
level method, so we wanna call that.
49

49

00:02:50,752  -->  00:02:54,651
If you remember,
I'll find object of thought.
50

50

00:02:54,651  -->  00:02:57,599
And once again,
I will cache this as a reference just so
51

51

00:02:57,599  -->  00:03:01,075
that we don't have to find the object
of type every single time.
52

52

00:03:01,075  -->  00:03:05,415
And so to do that we will say SceneLoader,
53

53

00:03:05,415  -->  00:03:10,754
capital S, SceneLoader,
and then sceneloader.
54

54

00:03:10,754  -->  00:03:13,526
So this is just a way of
saying we now have a variable,
55

55

00:03:13,526  -->  00:03:16,308
sceneloader variable that
have type SceneLoader.
56

56

00:03:16,308  -->  00:03:20,734
And again I'll just make a note in here,
cached reference, so
57

57

00:03:20,734  -->  00:03:24,491
that we know this is our cache
not the thought we have,
58

58

00:03:24,491  -->  00:03:28,849
our parameters, parameters,
that we need to keep track of.
59

59

00:03:28,849  -->  00:03:32,427
Just helping you guys see that this is
the structure we have at the top of our
60

60

00:03:32,427  -->  00:03:36,085
script, so you can get into the habit
of putting things in the right place.
61

61

00:03:36,085  -->  00:03:38,953
You don't have to write in
your comments each time,
62

62

00:03:38,953  -->  00:03:42,613
I'm just doing that to make it clear
from a teaching point of view.
63

63

00:03:42,613  -->  00:03:47,045
Okay, so we have our scene loader,
now if breakableBlocks is less than,
64

64

00:03:47,045  -->  00:03:48,912
sorry in our start method now.
65

65

00:03:48,912  -->  00:03:50,014
I've jumped a step ahead.
66

66

00:03:50,014  -->  00:03:51,004
What do we need to do next?
67

67

00:03:51,004  -->  00:03:51,773
This is a question for you.
68

68

00:03:51,773  -->  00:03:53,345
Many challenge for you.
69

69

00:03:53,345  -->  00:03:56,779
How do we get access to our sceneloader?
70

70

00:03:56,779  -->  00:03:59,469
How do we cache that?
71

71

00:03:59,469  -->  00:04:01,945
Well, we say Start.
72

72

00:04:01,945  -->  00:04:08,479
Hit Tab to autocomplete, and
then we will say sceneloader = what?
73

73

00:04:08,479  -->  00:04:12,520
Another mini challenge for
you, complete that sentence.
74

74

00:04:12,520  -->  00:04:16,538
sceneloader = FindObjectOfType.
75

75

00:04:16,538  -->  00:04:21,258
Angle brackets, and within here we're
finding capital s breaks Sceneloader.
76

76

00:04:21,258  -->  00:04:23,924
Open and close parenthesis, semicolon.
77

77

00:04:23,924  -->  00:04:28,422
So now we know that SceneLoader is
a cash reference to the class or
78

78

00:04:28,422  -->  00:04:30,854
the objective type SceneLoader.
79

79

00:04:30,854  -->  00:04:36,397
Now in our if statement down here, we can
say, cuz we need to access sceneloader.
80

80

00:04:36,397  -->  00:04:37,414
What are we accessing in there?
81

81

00:04:37,414  -->  00:04:39,460
We're accessing load next scene.
82

82

00:04:39,460  -->  00:04:42,330
So, here's another mini challenge for you.
83

83

00:04:42,330  -->  00:04:45,162
Let's load the next level.
84

84

00:04:45,162  -->  00:04:47,284
Okay, you're just waiting for
me to continue,
85

85

00:04:47,284  -->  00:04:49,373
are you actually doing
these mini challenges?
86

86

00:04:49,373  -->  00:04:52,846
It's okay if you're not but this is how
you really get better at these things.
87

87

00:04:52,846  -->  00:04:56,183
If you push yourself and pause and
try to figure it out on your own.
88

88

00:04:56,183  -->  00:04:58,386
That's how this really embeds.
89

89

00:04:58,386  -->  00:05:00,652
It's cool if you're not, but
it's even better if you are.
90

90

00:05:00,652  -->  00:05:07,858
So we'll say in here
sceneloader.LoadNextScene.
91

91

00:05:07,858  -->  00:05:10,065
Open and closed brackets and semi-colon.
92

92

00:05:10,065  -->  00:05:14,583
So now we've created our, when a block
is destroyed, we want to yell hey,
93

93

00:05:14,583  -->  00:05:15,890
block is destroyed.
94

94

00:05:15,890  -->  00:05:19,501
We decrease the number of blocks
by one that are breakable, and
95

95

00:05:19,501  -->  00:05:22,852
then we say if it's reached 0,
then load the next scene.
96

96

00:05:22,852  -->  00:05:25,360
I'm gonna save that hop over into block,
and
97

97

00:05:25,360  -->  00:05:28,676
this is where I'll give you
your proper full on challenge.
98

98

00:05:28,676  -->  00:05:30,095
That was our last level.
99

99

00:05:30,095  -->  00:05:32,042
It's our last lecturer.
100

100

00:05:32,042  -->  00:05:32,745
That's what I'm after.
101

101

00:05:32,745  -->  00:05:34,086
Update Block.cs.
102

102

00:05:34,086  -->  00:05:35,204
So here is the challenge.
103

103

00:05:35,204  -->  00:05:40,504
Call our method for decreasing the number
of blocks when a block is destroyed.
104

104

00:05:40,504  -->  00:05:44,693
Update Block.cs, and ensure that you
have your build settings correct.
105

105

00:05:44,693  -->  00:05:46,736
We haven't done that yet for this scene.
106

106

00:05:46,736  -->  00:05:48,610
You might have done it but
I haven't done it yet.
107

107

00:05:48,610  -->  00:05:50,956
And to test and rejoice that it works.
108

108

00:05:50,956  -->  00:05:52,336
And another little hint for
109

109

00:05:52,336  -->  00:05:56,416
you, you might wanna decrease the number
of blocks in your scene to one just so you
110

110

00:05:56,416  -->  00:06:00,565
don't have to get rid of all of the blocks
you can text it a little bit more quickly.
111

111

00:06:00,565  -->  00:06:04,047
Okay, so as your challenge jump in and
get started.
112

112

00:06:04,047  -->  00:06:07,702
Okay, so within Block.cs,
we need to find our OnCollisionEnter,
113

113

00:06:07,702  -->  00:06:10,103
this is where things
are getting destroyed.
114

114

00:06:10,103  -->  00:06:13,902
Underneath Destroy, we want to
give an update in here that says,
115

115

00:06:13,902  -->  00:06:17,234
well not an update, but
we wanna call our method in here.
116

116

00:06:17,234  -->  00:06:21,327
I'm thinking that it's updating the
situation but it's not the update method.
117

117

00:06:21,327  -->  00:06:26,990
We're saying level, we've already created
ourselves a cash reference to the level.
118

118

00:06:26,990  -->  00:06:30,892
So level., and what do we have in here?
119

119

00:06:30,892  -->  00:06:37,029
It's gonna be BlockDestroyed );.
120

120

00:06:37,029  -->  00:06:42,311
So we're saying access the level class
that we're doing and lock is destroyed.
121

121

00:06:42,311  -->  00:06:43,581
Pretty straightforward.
122

122

00:06:43,581  -->  00:06:46,716
Now I'm gonna do one more step while I'm
in here which is just to factor this out
123

123

00:06:46,716  -->  00:06:47,344
to clean it up.
124

124

00:06:47,344  -->  00:06:49,006
This is a refactor, it's not critical.
125

125

00:06:49,006  -->  00:06:51,965
Things will still work without it,
but this is just for readability.
126

126

00:06:51,965  -->  00:06:55,143
Not to do too many things
under this OnCollisionEnter.
127

127

00:06:55,143  -->  00:06:58,561
So I'm gonna highlight my
three lines here, right-click.
128

128

00:06:58,561  -->  00:07:00,085
Slightly different on the Mac, you'll see.
129

129

00:07:00,085  -->  00:07:02,525
Quick Fix and then Extract Method.
130

130

00:07:02,525  -->  00:07:07,893
On a PC, Quick Actions and
Refactorings, and then Extract Method.
131

131

00:07:07,893  -->  00:07:14,740
We'll call this method DestroyBlock,
and then hit Enter.
132

132

00:07:14,740  -->  00:07:23,132
So basically, Whenever we collide with the
block, then we want to destroy the block.
133

133

00:07:23,132  -->  00:07:26,295
Okay, I'll call DestroyBlock or,
yeah, that's good for now.
134

134

00:07:26,295  -->  00:07:29,389
It'll change a little bit later on, but
for now, this is what we've got, so
135

135

00:07:29,389  -->  00:07:30,729
this is the best thing to call it.
136

136

00:07:30,729  -->  00:07:33,227
Save that, jump over into our game.
137

137

00:07:33,227  -->  00:07:36,614
Now, I mentioned about Build Settings,
Edit.
138

138

00:07:36,614  -->  00:07:40,678
Sorry, File &gt; Build Settings.
139

139

00:07:40,678  -->  00:07:44,388
And one thing you'll notice with our Build
Settings is that we don't have any level
140

140

00:07:44,388  -->  00:07:45,289
two sitting there.
141

141

00:07:45,289  -->  00:07:49,166
So I'll just click Add Open Scenes,
cuz level two is open at the moment.
142

142

00:07:49,166  -->  00:07:53,542
Now I'm gonna cheat a little bit and drag
this above level one so that when we win
143

143

00:07:53,542  -->  00:07:58,076
level two it'll take us to level one,
just to make it easy for testing purposes.
144

144

00:07:58,076  -->  00:08:02,667
And as I mentioned before I'm gonna
select all of my blocks except for one.
145

145

00:08:02,667  -->  00:08:07,014
Delete those, click Play,
we should see if I click on level,
146

146

00:08:07,014  -->  00:08:11,698
we should see that there are one
breakable blocks, yes there are,
147

147

00:08:11,698  -->  00:08:16,490
click back in my game window,
[SOUND] and then plonk, and Game Over.
148

148

00:08:16,490  -->  00:08:19,227
Didn't work, okay,
what have we not done in here?
149

149

00:08:19,227  -->  00:08:25,386
We're looking for in our level, we didn't
go through this quite in enough detail.
150

150

00:08:25,386  -->  00:08:30,120
We have SceneLoader, I've forgotten that
we don't have SceneLoader in our scene at
151

151

00:08:30,120  -->  00:08:31,247
the moment, do we?
152

152

00:08:31,247  -->  00:08:35,801
That was an assumption that I made was
incorrect, so on level I'm going to drag
153

153

00:08:35,801  -->  00:08:39,674
in SceneLoader, so drag SceneLoader
as a component on level now.
154

154

00:08:39,674  -->  00:08:44,143
When we're saying fine object of type,
here it is right here sceneloaded.cs
155

155

00:08:44,143  -->  00:08:47,257
is another way of saying
it's the SceneLoader class,
156

156

00:08:47,257  -->  00:08:51,203
and it's in our scene because we
have it sitting right here on level.
157

157

00:08:51,203  -->  00:08:55,153
Make sure on level we can click Apply, so
it applies all these back to the prefab,
158

158

00:08:55,153  -->  00:08:58,600
so when we drop in level and
future levels, it knows what's going on.
159

159

00:08:58,600  -->  00:09:01,643
So just a reminder,
why I was doing that is we're looking for
160

160

00:09:01,643  -->  00:09:03,556
FindObjectOfType SceneLoader, but
161

161

00:09:03,556  -->  00:09:07,573
we didn't actually have any SceneLoaders
in our scene just yet, and now we do.
162

162

00:09:07,573  -->  00:09:12,399
So save everything up, click on Play,
look to see if there's any errors.
163

163

00:09:12,399  -->  00:09:14,808
I don't know how long that errors
been there but it's now gone.
164

164

00:09:14,808  -->  00:09:16,856
So there is no error, fantastic.
165

165

00:09:16,856  -->  00:09:20,557
And we click and it should,
plonk, load into the other scene.
166

166

00:09:20,557  -->  00:09:23,367
That's great, very excited to see that.
167

167

00:09:23,367  -->  00:09:27,071
So excellent work,
we now have a fully functioning game.
168

168

00:09:27,071  -->  00:09:29,545
You can add a couple of these
blocks back if you want.
169

169

00:09:29,545  -->  00:09:32,162
I'm just gonna add one more,
so we've got two sets.
170

170

00:09:32,162  -->  00:09:33,964
It looks a little bit more like a game.
171

171

00:09:33,964  -->  00:09:37,468
And so when we complete this scene,
it will load the next scene.
172

172

00:09:37,468  -->  00:09:39,898
That area has reappeared down
the bottom of the screen but
173

173

00:09:39,898  -->  00:09:41,578
that should go away when we click Play.
174

174

00:09:41,578  -->  00:09:45,858
We can now play fully through a full
game loop where the player can start,
175

175

00:09:45,858  -->  00:09:47,974
win, lose, and restart the game.
176

176

00:09:47,974  -->  00:09:50,350
So great work, and
I'll see you in the next lecture.
