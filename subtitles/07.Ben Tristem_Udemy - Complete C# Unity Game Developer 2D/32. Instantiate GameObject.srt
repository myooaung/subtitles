1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:10,460
In this lecture are we going to create some particle effects so that when the ball hits block it triggers

2
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:16,070
this neat little particle effect in the process we will learn about instead of through code.

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,340
Somebody gets started.

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:23,180
We've already learnt that we can instantiate more game objects from a prefab for example our block here

5
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,700
is a prefab Flem we find the prefect folders in C Block.

6
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:33,520
If I drag that into my scene then we instantiate or create an instance of a second block.

7
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,790
I can also do that by creating into my hierarchy.

8
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,240
If I just go and put these blocks where this post to be so there's a look underneath blocks and one

9
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,750
more block underneath a block there.

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,710
I can also click in here and control D or komenda from a hierarchy that will create another block in

11
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:49,960
exactly the same place.

12
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:55,670
And then I can move it to a different position and I can grab all of these go comen or control de angry

13
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,300
create a whole bunch then move them up.

14
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,820
Now I've got four of them.

15
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,900
So now we're going to do the same thing that we did just there but we're going to do it in code so that

16
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:07,230
we can instantiate something at a very specific point in time.

17
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:11,060
What we do is create a particle effect when we Clower block or destroy our block.

18
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:15,620
The particle effect is instantiated and then after a short amount of time we destroy it so that it's

19
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,660
not hanging around in a hierarchy.

20
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:24,140
So what I've created for you is a little simple particle effect called Impact VFX and it's as a package

21
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:30,470
if you can download that now it's against this lecture unzipped that and then drag it into your prefab

22
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,170
area.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,730
And you'll get the dialogue that says you want it import this.

24
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:35,240
Yes we do.

25
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,760
We click on the import button that might be right there on the bottom for you.

26
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:45,920
We import it for that important then you should see impact the effects in your assets folder down the

27
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,370
bottom.

28
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:51,830
Now if I drag this into the scene just any old place you can see that it's going to play straight away

29
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,850
in a fire.

30
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,750
I now have this little particle effect dialogue box that pops on and click play and plays it again a

31
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,450
little bit odd because there's some orange outlines around it if you're finding that got to gizmo's

32
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,470
and then let's see what that is.

33
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,820
It is the selection outline I believe.

34
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,190
Let's see if that works for play.

35
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:09,530
OK.

36
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,430
Now we don't have that selection outline around it so it's just a really simple particle effect that

37
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,630
I've created for you.

38
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:19,130
Just that all stars that are going sparkle and will do a whole bunch more particle conversation later

39
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:24,230
on and we've created this particle system there's a whole bunch of knobs and dials and levers to twiddle

40
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,360
here if you're excited about that you can jump in and start playing around with it.

41
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:32,300
Otherwise in later lectures will spend a lot more time explaining what particle effects are and how

42
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:37,160
you can create your own finalities using the one that I've created that looks like blob like that will

43
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,140
trigger that when a block is destroyed.

44
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:45,860
Now if we just drop that into our scene we don't need it in the scene so I'm going to delete that effect

45
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:50,330
that I just dropped in my scene the way that from the scene where we only create this as part of our

46
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,720
code but we do need to have it in our prefab area right here.

47
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:59,720
So let's go ahead and open up our script we need to open up the blocks block script and said blocked

48
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,360
script.

49
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,430
Now it's just one it's just block lock script.

50
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:08,920
Let's start at the top here we need to say what is the particle effects or what serialise field and

51
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:15,090
there's B of type game object because our particle prefab is a game object and we will call it block

52
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:22,580
what we call block Sparkle's can like Sparkle's the f x visual effects it stands for right sort of serialise

53
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,990
that will hook that up when we go back into unity back in the inspector and under destroy.

54
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:32,450
BLOCK This is what's happening when things get destroyed or create a new method under here that's going

55
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,520
to be private void.

56
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:39,050
What we want to be doing here is saying it's triggering this is when we treat our particle effects so

57
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:42,390
we'll call this trigger Sparkle's.

58
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,530
F X.

59
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,580
Right now in trigga particles VFX What do we want to do.

60
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,270
I've got some unity docs for us to have a quick look at.

61
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,640
I've given you the link against this lecture as always.

62
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:01,050
And this is our instantiates function satiate method that we can call with a little description down

63
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:05,850
here that says the function makes a copy of an object in a similar way to duplicate in the edit.

64
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:12,000
This happens at runtime runtime is when we click play the game is running and that's at run time.

65
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,920
So these things happen at run time and there's a few things that we can specify about what we want our

66
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,560
instantiated object to do.

67
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:25,020
If we scroll way at the top you can see there's one two three four five or so lines.

68
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:32,280
Sign that we have a few different options for how we call this method or call this function the very

69
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,630
first one to say instantiate and then object original.

70
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:40,980
Basically they're saying instantiate or create something and then what is the name of the object of

71
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,240
the game object or the prefab in our case that we want to create and that's it.

72
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,370
You can do that if you want to but we have some other options if we want to say where thing where it's

73
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:56,550
going to be are instantiated and these are called overloads these having multiple different options

74
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,770
or multiple different signatures.

75
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,550
This is a signature here.

76
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:06,350
This is a signature signature means what parameters are we going to put into our function.

77
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,780
So it's the same function essentially.

78
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,540
But it has a few different ways that you can do it so well it just once again these are overloads and

79
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:17,340
these overloads are having different signatures because we have different signatures they do slightly

80
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,620
different things.

81
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:24,510
So we start off by typing game object and this is a variable of type game object we'll call Sparkle's

82
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,090
and this will be instantiate.

83
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,290
Okay this is our our method here.

84
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,010
Instantiate.

85
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:35,960
When I do my open parentheses you can see all this stuff coming up on our screen here.

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,070
This is showing us that there's 10 different overloads 10 different signatures that we could use for

87
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:41,730
instance shape.

88
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:46,550
The most simple is just to say what's the name of our particle we created.

89
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,710
BLOCK Sparkle's of the f x.

90
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,440
Sorry say block Sparkle's VFX and that's it.

91
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,250
Semicolon.

92
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:59,730
So that's the simplest of our insentient you can just instantiate something and just say make this.

93
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,730
That's all we're doing.

94
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,710
So that's one of our signatures we can do.

95
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:09,960
The problem with this is that if we instantiate this into our scene now it will the position it will

96
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,500
insentient it will be wherever our particle effects think that it should be.

97
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,320
So our prefab just going to very quickly dropped this in though.

98
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,060
Undo it.

99
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,030
It looks like it wants to be roughly there on the screen.

100
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:26,610
And that's based upon wherever it was created or wherever the prefabs thinks that it's prefabbed position

101
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:27,480
should be.

102
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:33,660
Now the way that we get control is let's just go back briefly to the unity doxey we look at saying the

103
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:40,680
instantiate but also feeding in passing in the position of the object and the position the way we're

104
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:46,080
going to do this here is to say comma transform dot position.

105
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:52,860
And now also wants transform Dort rotation to a saying transformed composition position is basically

106
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,890
saying here where you are at the moment and here where you're rotated at the moment.

107
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,430
Nice simple straightforward.

108
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:02,880
If I save that I now have your first challenge.

109
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,980
That challenge is to connect the particle prefabbed the block prefabbed so to make sure that the block

110
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,170
knows when it gets destroyed.

111
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:14,520
This is the particle that we should be spawning and they call our method which instantiates the particle

112
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,900
effects whenever the block is being destroyed.

113
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,390
That is when we want to call our particle effect.

114
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,090
So jump in and take on that challenge.

115
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,340
Now this is challenge one of two for this lecture.

116
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,530
So take that on and be back with you in a moment.

117
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,140
First of all ever into unity.

118
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:38,270
Let's connect up now because where we have a block in our block E is spawning a particle that is a prefab.

119
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:44,360
Then we can go straight to our block prefab whereas our block pretty heavy block prefab and we can say

120
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:50,860
the block sparkles VFX is going to be our impact VFX and drag that on over.

121
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,610
So that means this prefab is spawning that prefab.

122
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,230
So wherever we place this block It knows it's pointing to this particular prefab particle effect down

123
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:00,590
here.

124
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,400
Excellent.

125
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:08,390
Now the other step we need to do is actually call owl trigga Sparkle's VFX and do that just in destroy

126
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,370
block here so where shall we do this.

127
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,570
So are going to say trigger Sparkle's the effect not passing anything in semicolon.

128
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,310
Now as I mentioned this is getting a little bit unwieldy so let's see what we can group together here

129
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:24,650
we've got something to do with audio something to audio and then destroying so I will highlight all

130
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:27,320
of these click extract method.

131
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,510
This is the p.c way I showed in a previous video how to do the Mac way it's very very similar.

132
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:32,330
What are we doing here.

133
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,630
We're finding audio.

134
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:42,230
So this is playing playing brake sound so play a block destroy.

135
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,100
SFX sound effects.

136
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:51,090
Okay that is nice and clean now just getting rid of all of this heavier looking code.

137
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,670
Now we can see we can read through.

138
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,320
We can do our human readings to see what's going on there.

139
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,130
Let's save.

140
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,310
Make sure this all works.

141
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,060
Come back over.

142
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:58,560
Ok.

143
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,070
Click on Play.

144
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:04,690
Make sure that wherever on our game screen I just spent the last minute or two wondering why am I seen

145
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,490
view wouldn't play the game properly.

146
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,690
Okay there we go.

147
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,300
Pretty quick.

148
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,170
OK one more time let's make sure that the particles are spawning right on top of the blocks will see

149
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,610
if I can actually accomplish.

150
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:14,930
They're right on top of the blocks.

151
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,880
Now I'm going to play for a moment.

152
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:23,030
As you can see over here in the hierarchy we've got all of these impact VFX starting to be spawned something

153
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,890
to be instantiated but we're not ever getting rid of them.

154
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:30,320
It's okay in our game I don't think it's going to become a huge issue but in a bigger game we don't

155
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,160
have all of these things filling up our how our hierarchy becomes a bit of a mess.

156
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,500
We can't see what's going on and it's a little bit less efficient.

157
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,390
So what we'll do.

158
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:46,130
E is your second challenge and that is to destroy our effect so destroy the panicle instance after two

159
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:46,730
seconds.

160
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:51,740
We've done the story a couple times we've done destroy with a delay a couple times so that should be

161
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,970
fairly straightforward for you.

162
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:55,930
So jump in and destroy our effect after two seconds.

163
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,170
OK.

164
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,930
So underneath trigger Sparkle's VFX where instantiating we also want to destroy down here so we type

165
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:11,440
destroy put in the name of the variable of the game object which is Sparkle's in this instance colmar

166
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:19,200
an arm you're say one if so two are destroyed after one second can save back over into unity.

167
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:26,040
So look to see if they're created over on the right here and also destroyed after an amount of time

168
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,590
like they are.

169
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:34,100
Okay call me having a hard time playing in the screen at the same time but it looks all good.

170
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:39,240
Okay so we've now got ourselves in a situation where we can instantiate and also destroy objects that

171
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,780
we've created in our hierarchy through our code.

172
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,020
Very excellent good work.

173
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,300
I'll see you in the next video.
