[MUSIC]
2

2

00:00:03,938  -->  00:00:07,580
Okay, let's have a quick conversation
about the game design for Glitch Garden so
3

3

00:00:07,580  -->  00:00:10,395
we know exactly so we know exactly
what it is that we're doing.
4

4

00:00:10,395  -->  00:00:15,137
You can see as always I love to have
a Gameplay Screen for my game design.
5

5

00:00:15,137  -->  00:00:18,557
You have a massive document,
but a picture tells 1000 words.
6

6

00:00:18,557  -->  00:00:22,363
So what's going on here we've
got attackers spawning and
7

7

00:00:22,363  -->  00:00:26,410
moving along a line,
we've got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 lines.
8

8

00:00:26,410  -->  00:00:29,900
They start off off screen and
then, [SOUND] get down to here and
9

9

00:00:29,900  -->  00:00:32,786
then we'll have some sort
of volume down the end.
10

10

00:00:32,786  -->  00:00:36,194
When the attacker touches the volume,
then it triggers some sort of,
11

11

00:00:36,194  -->  00:00:39,218
either you could decrease points
if you want to do it that way.
12

12

00:00:39,218  -->  00:00:42,486
For me, I'm gonna do it when any
attacker gets down to the end,
13

13

00:00:42,486  -->  00:00:44,036
[NOISE] it's It's game over.
14

14

00:00:44,036  -->  00:00:45,541
Okay, so we've got our attackers.
15

15

00:00:45,541  -->  00:00:49,157
We also need to have defenders, and
we buy and place the defenders.
16

16

00:00:49,157  -->  00:00:51,629
Now, we need to have our
defenders fitting within our grid.
17

17

00:00:51,629  -->  00:00:55,783
That's why our grass has these grid lines
here to say this is where a defender can
18

18

00:00:55,783  -->  00:00:56,533
or cannot go.
19

19

00:00:56,533  -->  00:01:00,423
I haven't marked it on here, but
I think I'll have a dead space up the end.
20

20

00:01:00,423  -->  00:01:03,335
So you can't just go and put your
defenders right at every start and
21

21

00:01:03,335  -->  00:01:05,837
block the start,
that will be a little bit too dominant.
22

22

00:01:05,837  -->  00:01:10,782
So you can only fill out from this point
onwards with your defenders in that
23

23

00:01:10,782  -->  00:01:11,669
area there.
24

24

00:01:11,669  -->  00:01:15,841
Okay, and we need a way of clicking
a button that says I want to place this
25

25

00:01:15,841  -->  00:01:18,362
defender and it's clearly highlighted.
26

26

00:01:18,362  -->  00:01:20,470
You can place it down on the grid, and
27

27

00:01:20,470  -->  00:01:24,148
you can also click on the other
spot to get a different defender.
28

28

00:01:24,148  -->  00:01:28,095
We need at the top of our game,
you can yours down the bottom.
29

29

00:01:28,095  -->  00:01:30,346
If you wanna put your user
interface down the bottom,
30

30

00:01:30,346  -->  00:01:32,348
you can shuffle it around
however you like, but
31

31

00:01:32,348  -->  00:01:35,268
I wanna make sure I've got space for
at least half a dozen defenders.
32

32

00:01:35,268  -->  00:01:37,914
And it looks like there's space
up the top here to do that,
33

33

00:01:37,914  -->  00:01:40,021
we also need to indicate
our resource system.
34

34

00:01:40,021  -->  00:01:43,969
So, we need a resource system that
allows us to earn and to spend points.
35

35

00:01:43,969  -->  00:01:48,132
So this is a currency, this is a resource,
this is, you know what, they see this as
36

36

00:01:48,132  -->  00:01:52,181
well, I know some people have been asking
for how do I implement a shop mechanic?
37

37

00:01:52,181  -->  00:01:55,491
In many ways, this is a shop mechanic
because you're getting points or
38

38

00:01:55,491  -->  00:01:59,089
this could be coins, it could be dollars,
or it could be wagers or whatever.
39

39

00:01:59,089  -->  00:02:02,551
And then you spend it on particular things
which will decrease the amount of points
40

40

00:02:02,551  -->  00:02:03,971
that the player has.access to.
41

41

00:02:03,971  -->  00:02:06,789
So this is a little bit of a shop in
a way and in a tower defense game,
42

42

00:02:06,789  -->  00:02:07,779
you know how it works.
43

43

00:02:07,779  -->  00:02:09,391
You have certain number of points and
44

44

00:02:09,391  -->  00:02:11,950
then each of these things cost
a certain amount of points.
45

45

00:02:11,950  -->  00:02:16,722
And also, we need defenders which
can generate points in our game.
46

46

00:02:16,722  -->  00:02:21,515
So we've got this star kind of trophy
dude here, and after a certain amount of
47

47

00:02:21,515  -->  00:02:25,126
time that we will need to be
able to tune the amount of time,
48

48

00:02:25,126  -->  00:02:29,740
it generates a new star, and that star
gives us extra points to our score.
49

49

00:02:29,740  -->  00:02:32,195
Not to our score, sorry, to our resources.
50

50

00:02:32,195  -->  00:02:35,388
That's not our score,
it's our resources, Rick, dunderhead!
51

51

00:02:35,388  -->  00:02:38,164
Okay, so here are the different enemies,
and for different enemies,
52

52

00:02:38,164  -->  00:02:41,005
not just that they look different,
but they have different behaviors.
53

53

00:02:41,005  -->  00:02:43,440
I've called out the fox here,
in the previous video.
54

54

00:02:43,440  -->  00:02:46,398
I was mentioning that when
a fox comes up to a gravestone,
55

55

00:02:46,398  -->  00:02:48,322
it can jump over it and keep running.
56

56

00:02:48,322  -->  00:02:51,538
So we'll need to tune the fox so
it's fast, and nimble,
57

57

00:02:51,538  -->  00:02:56,165
can jump over these blocking defender
things, but probably doesn't have as many
58

58

00:02:56,165  -->  00:03:00,475
hit points as the big old chunky lizard,
which will get blocked by this guy.
59

59

00:03:00,475  -->  00:03:03,647
He's gonna get blocked by the gravestone
and sit there and munch on it for
60

60

00:03:03,647  -->  00:03:07,391
a while while the cactus can shoot at him,
but he's probably got more hit points, and
61

61

00:03:07,391  -->  00:03:08,234
he's more solid.
62

62

00:03:08,234  -->  00:03:14,946
So thinking about enemy archetypes,
big and chunky and slow, fast and nimble.
63

63

00:03:14,946  -->  00:03:16,697
And then also we're gonna
have a level timer.
64

64

00:03:16,697  -->  00:03:19,905
This will be the main mechanics for
completing the level.
65

65

00:03:19,905  -->  00:03:22,946
Is that, we will spawn enemies,
spawn enemies, spawn enemies.
66

66

00:03:22,946  -->  00:03:26,572
Then we now code to say,
when our level timer reaches the end for
67

67

00:03:26,572  -->  00:03:28,361
whatever you've tuned it to.
68

68

00:03:28,361  -->  00:03:33,470
That is when we stop spawning out enemies,
and then when the last enemy is killed,
69

69

00:03:33,470  -->  00:03:36,372
that is when we can
progress to the next level.
70

70

00:03:36,372  -->  00:03:38,505
Speaking of the next level,
we need a Quit button here.
71

71

00:03:38,505  -->  00:03:41,700
Well, it's not actually a next level,
it's taking you back to the start menu.
72

72

00:03:41,700  -->  00:03:45,459
And that's so that we've got a system
that's not relying on someone pushing for
73

73

00:03:45,459  -->  00:03:46,464
example the Esc key.
74

74

00:03:46,464  -->  00:03:49,690
We've got something on
the screen that says stop,
75

75

00:03:49,690  -->  00:03:52,026
take me back to the start of the game.
76

76

00:03:52,026  -->  00:03:54,468
Or you could fashion into to
pause menu if you wanted,
77

77

00:03:54,468  -->  00:03:56,597
if you wanna have that
sort of functionality.
78

78

00:03:56,597  -->  00:03:59,444
You probably won't have a pause menu
in this section of the course, but
79

79

00:03:59,444  -->  00:04:02,291
we're definitely willing other
sections of the course, but for now,
80

80

00:04:02,291  -->  00:04:04,247
I think this'll just take
you back to the start.
81

81

00:04:04,247  -->  00:04:07,028
Okay, and
a quick recap of our core game design.
82

82

00:04:07,028  -->  00:04:10,481
Player experience, always, always,
know your player experience, or
83

83

00:04:10,481  -->  00:04:13,057
else you end up with just a mushy,
random sort of game.
84

84

00:04:13,057  -->  00:04:17,098
Strategic thinking, it's a tower defense
game, so we want strategic thinking.
85

85

00:04:17,098  -->  00:04:19,460
Where do I place them, and
how many points do I use?
86

86

00:04:19,460  -->  00:04:23,064
Our core mechanic is place
defenders to stop attackers.
87

87

00:04:23,064  -->  00:04:27,108
The Theme is a Garden kind of theme,
animals and plants and stuff.
88

88

00:04:27,108  -->  00:04:29,804
Kind of like Plants vs Zombies but
without the zombies.
89

89

00:04:29,804  -->  00:04:34,221
So therefore, we're taking inspiration but
we're not doing exactly the same as that.
90

90

00:04:34,221  -->  00:04:37,624
And our cool game loop, kill all the
attackers to progress to the next level.
91

91

00:04:37,624  -->  00:04:40,700
And I always point this out when
we go through the screen here,
92

92

00:04:40,700  -->  00:04:43,954
is it's a little bit duh,
that's all obvious but it's very good
93

93

00:04:43,954  -->  00:04:47,353
to write down these very obvious stuff and
then not deviate from it.
94

94

00:04:47,353  -->  00:04:50,281
The temptation halfway through is to say,
95

95

00:04:50,281  -->  00:04:55,095
instead of strategic thinking let's
make this about slow patience.
96

96

00:04:55,095  -->  00:04:58,011
It's like, maybe, it's not quite the same.
97

97

00:04:58,011  -->  00:04:59,700
So you wanna stick to these.
98

98

00:04:59,700  -->  00:05:02,899
You wanna be very confident after you've
done your prototyping this is exactly what
99

99

00:05:02,899  -->  00:05:03,450
I'm making.
100

100

00:05:03,450  -->  00:05:06,222
These are the things that
you stick to religiously.
101

101

00:05:06,222  -->  00:05:08,522
Okay, and again your challenge is to,
102

102

00:05:08,522  -->  00:05:13,139
if you would like to use the assets
that I'm using, by all means, fantastic.
103

103

00:05:13,139  -->  00:05:14,188
I will provide them to you.
104

104

00:05:14,188  -->  00:05:15,982
You can you that, no problem,
105

105

00:05:15,982  -->  00:05:19,436
if you want to flex your muscles
you can use your own assets.
106

106

00:05:19,436  -->  00:05:22,547
If you are using your own you'll need
to come up with a background for
107

107

00:05:22,547  -->  00:05:23,758
our battle to take place.
108

108

00:05:23,758  -->  00:05:25,776
I've got my gardening kind of thing and
109

109

00:05:25,776  -->  00:05:28,235
you should probably some
grids on that as well.
110

110

00:05:28,235  -->  00:05:30,909
Some defenders with sprite
sheet animations, so
111

111

00:05:30,909  -->  00:05:34,293
we've using sprite sheets for
our animation in this section.
112

112

00:05:34,293  -->  00:05:37,093
And you'll need at least and
idle and an attack animation,
113

113

00:05:37,093  -->  00:05:40,509
you could probably get away with just
I don't know, with just the idle or
114

114

00:05:40,509  -->  00:05:44,373
just the attacker and just loop over and
over and pretend it's the same thing, but
115

115

00:05:44,373  -->  00:05:46,791
it's good idle and
an attack to make it different.
116

116

00:05:46,791  -->  00:05:50,553
And the attackers with sprite sheet
animation as well and a couple of my
117

117

00:05:50,553  -->  00:05:54,522
attacker I'll be doing jump, sort of
just added there as an extra thing.
118

118

00:05:54,522  -->  00:05:58,124
So there's your challenge from this
lecture, there's your challenge.
119

119

00:05:58,124  -->  00:06:01,659
If you wanna go ahead and grab some assets
to have it look different to what I
120

120

00:06:01,659  -->  00:06:05,439
have created or what we will create
together, the assets I'm providing you.
121

121

00:06:05,439  -->  00:06:09,102
And this is a good time for those of
you who want to use this project for
122

122

00:06:09,102  -->  00:06:12,573
a portfolio piece if you can make
it look a little bit different,
123

123

00:06:12,573  -->  00:06:17,096
people won't recognize it as, yeah,
that's just the same out of that course.
124

124

00:06:17,096  -->  00:06:20,608
You want it to look a little bit different
so that when it's in your portfolio people
125

125

00:06:20,608  -->  00:06:22,775
say, this is interesting,
tell me about it.
126

126

00:06:22,775  -->  00:06:26,687
So that's why I often challenge you at
the state of our section to say, hey,
127

127

00:06:26,687  -->  00:06:30,784
maybe you can go get your own assets from
the assets store or make them yourself or
128

128

00:06:30,784  -->  00:06:32,587
get a friend to help you make them.
129

129

00:06:32,587  -->  00:06:36,365
Okay, so there it, let's jump in
in the next lecture get ourselves
130

130

00:06:36,365  -->  00:06:38,505
up with our project and get cracking.
