1

00:00:00.025  -->  00:00:05.227
[SOUND] G'day and how you going?
2

2

00:00:05.227  -->  00:00:09.610
That's how we say hello in Australia,
speaking Australian.
3

3

00:00:09.610  -->  00:00:10.820
So how are you doing?
4

4

00:00:10.820  -->  00:00:15.060
I hope you are doing well and fired up for
a good, quick lecture in this one.
5

5

00:00:15.060  -->  00:00:18.635
This will be a very quick conversation
where we're going to find a problem and
6

6

00:00:18.635  -->  00:00:22.260
then come up with a solution and
I'm going to give you a cool challenge.
7

7

00:00:22.260  -->  00:00:25.388
So here's the problem,
when we shoot our laser beam,
8

8

00:00:25.388  -->  00:00:29.060
[SOUND] it goes flying off into
the distance forever and ever, our
9

9

00:00:29.060  -->  00:00:33.752
hierarchy fills up with a gazillion clones
of the instantiated game object and our
10

10

00:00:33.752  -->  00:00:38.597
world has these lasers going off into the
distance for infinity distance, way off.
11

11

00:00:38.597  -->  00:00:40.408
So this is not a good situation to be in.
12

12

00:00:40.408  -->  00:00:44.586
We want to make sure that our laser beams
don't stick around beyond their use.
13

13

00:00:44.586  -->  00:00:47.819
We wanna destroy them once
they get past the play area.
14

14

00:00:47.819  -->  00:00:51.295
So that's the problem,
here's the challenge I have for you,
15

15

00:00:51.295  -->  00:00:53.009
is to create a laser shredder.
16

16

00:00:53.009  -->  00:00:56.304
So something that we put up here,
an object,
17

17

00:00:56.304  -->  00:01:01.170
a collision that we put up here
that can shred our lasers.
18

18

00:01:01.170  -->  00:01:04.770
So, before I show you that, I'll say, if
that makes sense, if you know what to do,
19

19

00:01:04.770  -->  00:01:07.266
if you know how to go about doing this,
then pause the video and
20

20

00:01:07.266  -->  00:01:09.290
jump into the challenge now.
21

21

00:01:09.290  -->  00:01:11.660
Now if you want some hints,
here they are, here are the clues.
22

22

00:01:11.660  -->  00:01:15.370
First of all, create an empty
GameObject that's called Shredder,
23

23

00:01:15.370  -->  00:01:20.060
that has a trigger box collider on it,
it's important to make sure it's trigger.
24

24

00:01:20.060  -->  00:01:25.070
And then to create shredder.cs and
attach that to the Shredder GameObject.
25

25

00:01:25.070  -->  00:01:29.860
And when something collides with Shredder,
destroy that GameObject.
26

26

00:01:29.860  -->  00:01:32.810
And so, here's the last hint,
I kinda gave it to you a little bit early.
27

27

00:01:32.810  -->  00:01:35.670
If you know what's going on from all that,
then dive in and
28

28

00:01:35.670  -->  00:01:37.390
take this challenge on now.
29

29

00:01:37.390  -->  00:01:40.160
If you still want a little bit
more information, then here it is.
30

30

00:01:40.160  -->  00:01:46.110
The hint I've got for you is the use
OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D collider) and
31

31

00:01:46.110  -->  00:01:50.160
then this collider here, we can use that
32

32

00:01:50.160  -->  00:01:54.840
to destroy the GameObject
that has bumped into us.
33

33

00:01:54.840  -->  00:01:58.610
And then if you want one more last
little hint, this is a sneaky hint.
34

34

00:01:58.610  -->  00:02:02.500
There's one more thing needed for
our laser itself.
35

35

00:02:02.500  -->  00:02:07.020
If you're like me, then you'll potentially
forget that and look at your code and
36

36

00:02:07.020  -->  00:02:08.460
look at everything for five minutes and
37

37

00:02:08.460  -->  00:02:10.700
then go like uh-huh,
I forgot to do a thing for my laser.
38

38

00:02:10.700  -->  00:02:13.230
So, there's your challenge,
jump in and take that on now.
39

39

00:02:13.230  -->  00:02:13.861
I'll see you back here when you're done.
40

40

00:02:17.549  -->  00:02:20.290
Right-e-o, let's go through
the steps in our hierarchy.
41

41

00:02:20.290  -->  00:02:22.080
Right click Create Empty.
42

42

00:02:22.080  -->  00:02:24.790
I will call this Shredder.
43

43

00:02:24.790  -->  00:02:26.650
And then on our Transform, you just reset.
44

44

00:02:26.650  -->  00:02:28.930
It's good to have it to
reset the transform,
45

45

00:02:28.930  -->  00:02:30.800
right clicking on Transform there.
46

46

00:02:30.800  -->  00:02:34.830
Now, we need to add a component,
this will be a box collider 2D.
47

47

00:02:34.830  -->  00:02:38.910
The box collide 2D, at the moment, you can
see it's quite in the middle of our screen
48

48

00:02:38.910  -->  00:02:42.620
over here, I would drag it up,
so it's above our place space.
49

49

00:02:42.620  -->  00:02:45.780
And then I'm going to
click on Edit Collider,
50

50

00:02:45.780  -->  00:02:50.816
drag the handles to the right and
to the left, make it a little bit bigger.
51

51

00:02:50.816  -->  00:02:54.877
The height of it doesn't matter so much,
we just neet to make sure we catch any
52

52

00:02:54.877  -->  00:02:58.884
of our lasers that are being shot up
above the screen here in the y direction.
53

53

00:02:58.884  -->  00:03:02.760
Okay, next thing add component,
we'll call this shredder and
54

54

00:03:02.760  -->  00:03:05.130
this will be a new script.
55

55

00:03:05.130  -->  00:03:07.010
Click and create and add.
56

56

00:03:07.010  -->  00:03:09.690
Now you probably have this already but
I want to anchor this and
57

57

00:03:09.690  -->  00:03:13.540
reinforce this just in case you haven't,
is we are creating a script and
58

58

00:03:13.540  -->  00:03:17.160
adding it straight away to this game
object which is the shredder game object.
59

59

00:03:17.160  -->  00:03:20.740
But that doesn't mean that this
script lives on the game object and
60

60

00:03:20.740  -->  00:03:22.430
that's the only place we can use it.
61

61

00:03:22.430  -->  00:03:26.050
As you know, it's over here in our assets
directory, this is the script right here,
62

62

00:03:26.050  -->  00:03:28.270
which I'm gonna drag
into my scripts folder.
63

63

00:03:29.350  -->  00:03:34.855
And we know that on our shredder because
we created it as a component over here,
64

64

00:03:34.855  -->  00:03:39.415
it's already added it, so it's added
this as a component to this game object.
65

65

00:03:39.415  -->  00:03:43.365
But it is this script just here that
we're going to open up and if we want,
66

66

00:03:43.365  -->  00:03:45.475
we can put that script,
we could attach that or
67

67

00:03:45.475  -->  00:03:49.560
add it to any other game objects
that we wanted in the game.
68

68

00:03:49.560  -->  00:03:52.360
Okay, visual studio opened up my
other monitor for some reason.
69

69

00:03:52.360  -->  00:03:56.100
Here we go, this is our Shredder.cs,
I'm gonna highlight our Start method and
70

70

00:03:56.100  -->  00:03:56.810
Update method.
71

71

00:03:56.810  -->  00:03:57.680
Delete those, we don't need them.
72

72

00:03:57.680  -->  00:04:01.830
We will start off by saying
void OnTrigger, OnTrigger,
73

73

00:04:01.830  -->  00:04:07.189
this is the important thing to not
make the mistake OnTriggerEnter2D and
74

74

00:04:07.189  -->  00:04:10.915
that autofills for
me Collider2D and collision.
75

75

00:04:10.915  -->  00:04:13.885
This Collision will give us some
information about whatever has
76

76

00:04:13.885  -->  00:04:15.098
collided with Shredder.
77

77

00:04:15.098  -->  00:04:17.275
So we can say he destroy,
what will we destroy?
78

78

00:04:17.275  -->  00:04:22.882
Well we'll destroy collision to get
the information about the thing
79

79

00:04:22.882  -->  00:04:28.790
that bumped into us, .gameObject,
so destroy the whole game object.
80

80

00:04:28.790  -->  00:04:31.031
So we don't wanna destroy
just the collider,
81

81

00:04:31.031  -->  00:04:34.260
we wanna destroy the whole
instance of the game object.
82

82

00:04:34.260  -->  00:04:37.020
Click save back over into unity.
83

83

00:04:37.020  -->  00:04:40.510
Now if we try to do this, it won't
work because there is one more step,
84

84

00:04:40.510  -->  00:04:42.870
that's the sneaky hint that I gave you.
85

85

00:04:42.870  -->  00:04:45.673
We have a look at our prefabs,
find out play a lazer.
86

86

00:04:45.673  -->  00:04:50.633
What are we missing on our play a laser,
we are missing collision,
87

87

00:04:50.633  -->  00:04:53.036
so we need to add a box collider.
88

88

00:04:53.036  -->  00:04:58.514
I'm gonna make a capsule collider 2D
because it's kinda capsuley shape.
89

89

00:04:58.514  -->  00:05:00.342
So capsule collider 2D,
90

90

00:05:00.342  -->  00:05:05.950
drag one of these into the scene to
make sure it worked okay, play a laser.
91

91

00:05:05.950  -->  00:05:08.380
There it is,
double-click on that to zoom in.
92

92

00:05:08.380  -->  00:05:12.760
Okay, it looks like a nice,
neat, tidy collider around.
93

93

00:05:12.760  -->  00:05:15.700
No need to change that, so I'll delete the
player laser cuz we don't want it sitting
94

94

00:05:15.700  -->  00:05:17.050
in the middle of our scene.
95

95

00:05:17.050  -->  00:05:18.250
And where are we?
96

96

00:05:18.250  -->  00:05:19.240
Back onto our player.
97

97

00:05:21.740  -->  00:05:24.868
Okay, so we have our player,
we have our laser, we have our shredder,
98

98

00:05:24.868  -->  00:05:26.605
let's see if it works, click on Play.
99

99

00:05:29.179  -->  00:05:32.101
Shoot a few times and
then yes, there they are.
100

100

00:05:32.101  -->  00:05:33.423
Okay, well this is really cool.
101

101

00:05:33.423  -->  00:05:35.445
Boing, they kinda hit and then go flying.
102

102

00:05:35.445  -->  00:05:37.686
That could be a cool effect but
not what we're going for.
103

103

00:05:37.686  -->  00:05:38.709
What have we missed?
104

104

00:05:38.709  -->  00:05:43.930
One last step that we've missed in here
on our shredder, our box collider 2D.
105

105

00:05:43.930  -->  00:05:44.719
We haven't made it a trigger.
106

106

00:05:44.719  -->  00:05:47.839
And this is one of those things,
if you know things stop or bounce,
107

107

00:05:47.839  -->  00:05:51.374
then it's because it's a collider,
not a trigger, so click on trigger.
108

108

00:05:51.374  -->  00:05:57.250
Now, when we pass through that,
the lasers won't be bounced away.
109

109

00:05:57.250  -->  00:06:01.760
They'll actually be able to be
triggered by that trigger volume.
110

110

00:06:01.760  -->  00:06:03.105
So again, we shoot a bunch of times,
111

111

00:06:03.105  -->  00:06:05.760
I don't know if you can see it on my
screen but I'll zoom in a little bit.
112

112

00:06:05.760  -->  00:06:07.950
You can see over there,
they're being instantiated and
113

113

00:06:07.950  -->  00:06:10.470
then they're being destroyed and removed.
114

114

00:06:10.470  -->  00:06:12.700
Excellent, so
we've created ourselves a shredder.
115

115

00:06:12.700  -->  00:06:15.330
Hopefully, that all made sense to
you in this quick little video and
116

116

00:06:15.330  -->  00:06:17.560
we'll jump in straight away for
the next content.
117

117

00:06:17.560  -->  00:06:18.060
See you soon.
