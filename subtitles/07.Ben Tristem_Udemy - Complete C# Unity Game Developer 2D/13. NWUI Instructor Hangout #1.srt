00:00:04,323  -->  00:00:07,360
Hello, and welcome to another
instructor hangout with Rick and Ben.
3

3

00:00:07,360  -->  00:00:08,830
Hello, Ben, how are you today?
4

4

00:00:08,830  -->  00:00:10,772
&gt;&gt; Awesome, Rick, how are you doing buddy?
5

5

00:00:10,772  -->  00:00:12,894
&gt;&gt; I am very excellent as well, thank you.
6

6

00:00:12,894  -->  00:00:15,578
A couple of things we wanted
to go through first, and
7

7

00:00:15,578  -->  00:00:19,302
then we've got our big topic we're
gonna be talking about namespaces.
8

8

00:00:19,302  -->  00:00:23,396
First couple of things, I've seen
a lot of people in the Q&amp;A section
9

9

00:00:23,396  -->  00:00:27,502
recently helping other people
answer their technical challenges.
10

10

00:00:27,502  -->  00:00:29,462
And I forget where I saw it, but
11

11

00:00:29,462  -->  00:00:32,940
someone was saying this is
a really great way to learn.
12

12

00:00:32,940  -->  00:00:35,635
They're very active in there,
cuz they like to help other people but
13

13

00:00:35,635  -->  00:00:36,243
learn as well.
14

14

00:00:36,243  -->  00:00:41,092
Just a tip, if you want to really
enhance your skills, jump into the Q&amp;A.
15

15

00:00:41,092  -->  00:00:44,143
See if you can figure out what's
going on with other people's code.
16

16

00:00:44,143  -->  00:00:45,798
That's a really good way for
you to learn and
17

17

00:00:45,798  -->  00:00:48,191
cement those things that you've
been learning in the course.
18

18

00:00:48,191  -->  00:00:50,400
Just a little tip for
you on that one there.
19

19

00:00:50,400  -->  00:00:54,018
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, you really have to think
about it from a different perspective when
20

20

00:00:54,018  -->  00:00:56,851
you're trying to help somebody else out,
so good tip, Rick.
21

21

00:00:56,851  -->  00:00:57,912
&gt;&gt; Totally, thank you, Ben.
22

22

00:00:57,912  -->  00:00:59,609
And I can't take full credit.
23

23

00:00:59,609  -->  00:01:02,556
I stole that from somebody in
the community raised that as a tip.
24

24

00:01:02,556  -->  00:01:04,444
Also, I had a very direct question for
25

25

00:01:04,444  -->  00:01:06,989
you watching right now in
terms of the challenges.
26

26

00:01:06,989  -->  00:01:10,192
I haven't had a lot of feedback on
the challenges up until this point.
27

27

00:01:10,192  -->  00:01:13,279
In terms of, are they too easy,
too hard, or just right,
28

28

00:01:13,279  -->  00:01:15,737
do you understand what's
going on with them?
29

29

00:01:15,737  -->  00:01:20,307
So against this video, as with all
the videos, there's a button, or
30

30

00:01:20,307  -->  00:01:23,568
a link,
that will lead you to our community site.
31

31

00:01:23,568  -->  00:01:25,582
If you can go into there,
or in the Q&amp;A section,
32

32

00:01:25,582  -->  00:01:27,809
just let us know what you
think about the challenges.
33

33

00:01:27,809  -->  00:01:29,008
Are they okay?
Are they too easy?
34

34

00:01:29,008  -->  00:01:30,117
Are they too hard?
35

35

00:01:30,117  -->  00:01:34,112
In particular, if you have a challenge so
far that you thought was perfect, and
36

36

00:01:34,112  -->  00:01:36,925
we know what you think is
the current sort of challenge.
37

37

00:01:36,925  -->  00:01:40,303
That would make a huge difference to us,
that would be very excellent.
38

38

00:01:40,303  -->  00:01:43,934
And I think, next topic, that's banging
through these topics, that's two topics.
39

39

00:01:43,934  -->  00:01:47,787
Here we go, Ben,
your chance to say some words.
40

40

00:01:47,787  -->  00:01:51,867
If you have on your screen, I believe,
showing some of the screenshots that
41

41

00:01:51,867  -->  00:01:54,503
people have been sharing
from number wizard UI.
42

42

00:01:54,503  -->  00:01:57,088
Not as many as the text 101.
43

43

00:01:57,088  -->  00:02:00,138
You guys were super,
duper active with text 101.
44

44

00:02:00,138  -->  00:02:02,070
Lots of great sharing.
45

45

00:02:02,070  -->  00:02:05,152
Coming up with some great screens and
looking things.
46

46

00:02:05,152  -->  00:02:06,201
&gt;&gt; It's awesome variety here.
47

47

00:02:06,201  -->  00:02:08,173
Thank you, Rick, for
including me with a wizard hat on.
48

48

00:02:08,173  -->  00:02:11,577
I look fantastic there, of course.
49

49

00:02:11,577  -->  00:02:13,552
&gt;&gt; Excellent, I can't see what
you're sharing at the moment-
50

50

00:02:13,552  -->  00:02:15,552
&gt;&gt; I'm just scrolling through them, Rick,
51

51

00:02:15,552  -->  00:02:16,224
that's all.
52

52

00:02:16,224  -->  00:02:17,600
&gt;&gt; Yep, there's a handful in there.
53

53

00:02:17,600  -->  00:02:21,335
So I know sometimes you think,
well, I won't bother to share.
54

54

00:02:21,335  -->  00:02:26,383
But it really helps I think, for your
own flow and your own progress, to put
55

55

00:02:26,383  -->  00:02:31,692
something out there and have people look
at it and not be too precious about it.
56

56

00:02:31,692  -->  00:02:33,608
That's how you get better
at these things as well.
57

57

00:02:33,608  -->  00:02:34,212
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.
58

58

00:02:34,212  -->  00:02:36,155
&gt;&gt; Is a little bit of theme
of this conversation.
59

59

00:02:36,155  -->  00:02:38,764
And now for
the big thing I wanna talk about.
60

60

00:02:38,764  -->  00:02:40,778
Yeah, [LAUGH] sorry to interrupt, Ben.
61

61

00:02:40,778  -->  00:02:43,276
The big thing I wanna talk about
has to do with namespaces.
62

62

00:02:43,276  -->  00:02:44,128
We haven't talked about it a lot.
63

63

00:02:44,128  -->  00:02:45,181
We've touched on it a little bit.
64

64

00:02:45,181  -->  00:02:49,521
You need to use this namespace cuz it
gives you access to particular classes or
65

65

00:02:49,521  -->  00:02:50,132
methods.
66

66

00:02:50,132  -->  00:02:52,399
I'm gonna throw it over to you Ben,
67

67

00:02:52,399  -->  00:02:58,180
just to give us a deeper understanding of
namespaces, to demystify it a little bit.
68

68

00:02:58,180  -->  00:03:00,082
In terms of-
&gt;&gt; What's going on, yeah, okay.
69

69

00:03:00,082  -->  00:03:01,792
So it's just including
other people's code.
70

70

00:03:01,792  -->  00:03:02,514
It's as easy as that.
71

71

00:03:02,514  -->  00:03:06,760
So where you say using Namespace Unity
Engine, that gives you access to all sorts
72

72

00:03:06,760  -->  00:03:10,882
of things like the concept of a mono
behavior, the concept of a game object, or
73

73

00:03:10,882  -->  00:03:13,087
the concept of most of the stuff you type.
74

74

00:03:13,087  -->  00:03:15,833
If you just comment out that
line using Unity Engine,
75

75

00:03:15,833  -->  00:03:20,045
you'll soon see Visual Studio will show
you all the things it doesn't understand
76

76

00:03:20,045  -->  00:03:22,442
if it doesn't have access
to that namespace.
77

77

00:03:22,442  -->  00:03:24,461
So a namespace is a collection of classes.
78

78

00:03:24,461  -->  00:03:28,181
It's a collection of things like your
rigid bodies and your sprites and
79

79

00:03:28,181  -->  00:03:31,042
all the other stuff you've
been messing around with.
80

80

00:03:31,042  -->  00:03:34,831
You can think of using namespace as a bit
like Dropbox and selective sync, for
81

81

00:03:34,831  -->  00:03:35,423
instance.
82

82

00:03:35,423  -->  00:03:37,382
So they're folders is one
way of looking at it.
83

83

00:03:37,382  -->  00:03:39,273
It's like why do you use
folders on your computer?
84

84

00:03:39,273  -->  00:03:42,572
Well, we have all our courses,
RPG and then Unity and then Unreal.
85

85

00:03:42,572  -->  00:03:45,123
And in there we might
have the images folder.
86

86

00:03:45,123  -->  00:03:48,918
Images, images, images again and again,
and we don't get a clash between Unity
87

87

00:03:48,918  -->  00:03:52,012
images and Unreal images because
they're in different folders.
88

88

00:03:52,012  -->  00:03:53,326
They are still images, but
they are in different folders.
89

89

00:03:53,326  -->  00:03:56,748
So it let's you have two methods like
on collision enter in both the Unity
90

90

00:03:56,748  -->  00:03:59,456
namespace and maybe somewhere else,
or Ran for Random.
91

91

00:03:59,456  -->  00:04:02,656
It could be Unity's to random,
it would be Matheft.rand or
92

92

00:04:02,656  -->  00:04:05,432
it could be unity.engine.random,
for example.
93

93

00:04:05,432  -->  00:04:09,530
So it allows you to use the same name
in multiple places like folders do.
94

94

00:04:09,530  -->  00:04:12,152
It also allows you to selective
sync in Dropbox terms.
95

95

00:04:12,152  -->  00:04:15,592
Which is to say I only want
this library available.
96

96

00:04:15,592  -->  00:04:19,190
This Unity engine library,
this maths library, this whatever,
97

97

00:04:19,190  -->  00:04:20,743
I don't need the rest of it.
98

98

00:04:20,743  -->  00:04:23,613
And the third thing it does is segregate,
conceptually, these different things.
99

99

00:04:23,613  -->  00:04:26,770
So in the RPG course,
a more advanced Unity course that we have,
100

100

00:04:26,770  -->  00:04:28,824
we focus on using namespaces ourselves.
101

101

00:04:28,824  -->  00:04:32,511
We create our own name spaces like
combat and weapons and stuff like that.
102

102

00:04:32,511  -->  00:04:36,609
So the one piece of our code cannot
accidentally talk to another bit without
103

103

00:04:36,609  -->  00:04:38,701
us talking about it carefully first.
104

104

00:04:38,701  -->  00:04:43,131
We can't just have a player talking to
the camera, for example, or talking to
105

105

00:04:43,131  -->  00:04:48,050
some other part of the game unless we say
using namespace RBG.camera or RBG.player.
106

106

00:04:48,050  -->  00:04:49,267
So three things in recap.
107

107

00:04:49,267  -->  00:04:53,931
Number one, we actually rename
class names, and method names.
108

108

00:04:53,931  -->  00:04:57,679
It allows you to selectively choose what
you're gonna import and what you're not,
109

109

00:04:57,679  -->  00:04:59,331
import other people's libraries.
110

110

00:04:59,331  -->  00:05:01,854
And number three, as I just said,
111

111

00:05:01,854  -->  00:05:05,692
it allows you to purposefully
segregate your code.
112

112

00:05:05,692  -->  00:05:09,096
&gt;&gt; So [COUGH] most of the namespaces
we're using in Unity or
113

113

00:05:09,096  -->  00:05:12,652
most of the content from those
extra namespaces we go to.
114

114

00:05:12,652  -->  00:05:16,722
Every now and again we'll go to
the scene management namespace or
115

115

00:05:16,722  -->  00:05:21,237
the UI namespace, that was all created
by the good folks at Unity, yes?
116

116

00:05:21,237  -->  00:05:23,858
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; That's the Unity namespace,
117

117

00:05:23,858  -->  00:05:26,736
their particular classes and methods.
118

118

00:05:26,736  -->  00:05:27,397
That's not C#.
119

119

00:05:27,397  -->  00:05:32,366
So if we're out of Unity and
we're into just working straight up in C#,
120

120

00:05:32,366  -->  00:05:37,010
in another area or not in an engine,
how do we know then what it is that
121

121

00:05:37,010  -->  00:05:41,642
we'll still be able to use that's not-
&gt;&gt; We'll just comment out using anything
122

122

00:05:41,642  -->  00:05:44,386
that starts using Unity Engine or
using Unity Engine dot,
123

123

00:05:44,386  -->  00:05:46,122
by the way dot is just a sub-folder.
124

124

00:05:46,122  -->  00:05:48,092
So using Unity Engine
gives you the top level,
125

125

00:05:48,092  -->  00:05:50,222
the root of the Unity Engine folder,
if you like.
126

126

00:05:50,222  -->  00:05:54,705
Using unityengine.ui uses stuff
in the UI folder and so on.
127

127

00:05:54,705  -->  00:05:55,803
it doesn't recurse down.
128

128

00:05:55,803  -->  00:05:59,404
So using Unity Engine doesn't
pick up UI that's underneath it,
129

129

00:05:59,404  -->  00:06:01,442
you have to explicitly use each one.
130

130

00:06:01,442  -->  00:06:03,387
If you do a double forward slash,
131

131

00:06:03,387  -->  00:06:07,209
a comment in front of everything
that starts using unityengine,
132

132

00:06:07,209  -->  00:06:11,670
then the code that won't run is the stuff
that's using Unity Engine stuff.
133

133

00:06:11,670  -->  00:06:13,784
Using system.collections or
134

134

00:06:13,784  -->  00:06:18,344
system that you'll see at the top as well,
that is C# stuff, so.
135

135

00:06:18,344  -->  00:06:23,144
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and within the namespaces,
would you say that it's classes and
136

136

00:06:23,144  -->  00:06:28,592
methods and parameters like this is what
is contained within those namespaces?
137

137

00:06:28,592  -->  00:06:31,515
&gt;&gt; Yeah so-
&gt;&gt; Is there anything that we haven't,
138

138

00:06:31,515  -->  00:06:35,919
any kind of magical tools in a namespace,
that we haven't seen?
139

139

00:06:35,919  -->  00:06:39,665
&gt;&gt; I'm gonna grab a book,
give me a second we might cut this,
140

140

00:06:39,665  -->  00:06:42,174
we can cut this bit out-
&gt;&gt; I don't think we will cut this.
141

141

00:06:42,174  -->  00:06:46,389
I think we'll leave it in and people
will be wondering, where's Ben going?
142

142

00:06:46,389  -->  00:06:47,239
Well, he's saw a squirrel.
143

143

00:06:47,239  -->  00:06:49,989
He's off having a look at it,
there's a pretty squirrel.
144

144

00:06:49,989  -->  00:06:54,821
&gt;&gt; Wandered off, I've actually
got the answer right here just to
145

145

00:06:54,821  -->  00:06:57,565
be slightly more complete with it.
146

146

00:06:59,977  -->  00:07:03,789
About what else can be in a namespace.
147

147

00:07:03,789  -->  00:07:06,571
I think we are gonna need
to cut this down, Rick.
148

148

00:07:06,571  -->  00:07:08,348
&gt;&gt; Okay, can do.
149

149

00:07:20,732  -->  00:07:24,410
&gt;&gt; It's basically all
just type declarations.
150

150

00:07:24,410  -->  00:07:26,889
So have they done enums and
structs and stuff yet?
151

151

00:07:26,889  -->  00:07:28,749
Not structs, enums?
152

152

00:07:28,749  -->  00:07:30,451
&gt;&gt; No.
153

153

00:07:30,451  -->  00:07:32,519
&gt;&gt; Haven't even done enums.
154

154

00:07:32,519  -->  00:07:33,616
&gt;&gt; No.
155

155

00:07:33,616  -->  00:07:37,500
&gt;&gt; No, not in Techs 101,
I guess they haven't.
156

156

00:07:37,500  -->  00:07:39,089
Okay, so we're just going to this.
157

157

00:07:39,089  -->  00:07:42,689
So, the other things that can be in
namespaces, it's mainly classes.
158

158

00:07:42,689  -->  00:07:45,480
You could also have in there
things like enums and structs, but
159

159

00:07:45,480  -->  00:07:47,282
we haven't met those yet in the course.
160

160

00:07:47,282  -->  00:07:52,052
So for these purposes, for
this stage, it's a way of grouping
161

161

00:07:52,052  -->  00:07:54,260
classes together and-
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
162

162

00:07:54,260  -->  00:07:57,165
&gt;&gt; The thing that you need to
think about is if for instance,
163

163

00:07:57,165  -->  00:08:01,278
you get to a point in the course where you
wanna access a text element, like text or
164

164

00:08:01,278  -->  00:08:02,753
type Text with at capital T.
165

165

00:08:02,753  -->  00:08:06,100
That is in the unityengine.ui namespace,
for example.
166

166

00:08:06,100  -->  00:08:08,849
So you need to have that
namespace imported for
167

167

00:08:08,849  -->  00:08:11,604
you to even be able to
recognize the type text.
168

168

00:08:11,604  -->  00:08:16,371
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, and what I've seen a lot
of is that it avoids us having conflict.
169

169

00:08:16,371  -->  00:08:19,420
And you said this in the point
that you were saying before.
170

170

00:08:19,420  -->  00:08:22,630
If we say we're only able to
use these particular things,
171

171

00:08:22,630  -->  00:08:25,197
then we know those things
work well together.
172

172

00:08:25,197  -->  00:08:28,640
And we're not accidentally using something
else or conflicting with something else.
173

173

00:08:28,640  -->  00:08:29,900
So it's flicking the switch.
174

174

00:08:29,900  -->  00:08:32,430
And there's I don't know how many
namespaces, I haven't looked into this.
175

175

00:08:32,430  -->  00:08:35,881
Would there be dozens,
hundreds of namespaces in Unity?
176

176

00:08:35,881  -->  00:08:37,420
Like, lots and lots of them?
177

177

00:08:37,420  -->  00:08:41,111
&gt;&gt; Of the order of 100,
yeah, more than dozens.
178

178

00:08:41,111  -->  00:08:42,972
&gt;&gt; Okay, more than dozens,
in the order of 100.
179

179

00:08:42,972  -->  00:08:47,272
And within each of those, there's
anywhere from a handful to dozens and
180

180

00:08:47,272  -->  00:08:51,093
dozens of classes and
methods within each of those namespaces.
181

181

00:08:51,093  -->  00:08:54,001
So there's a lot of content,
and it'll be a little bit of
182

182

00:08:54,001  -->  00:08:58,256
drinking from the firehose, I think, if
we can access all of those straightaway.
183

183

00:08:58,256  -->  00:08:59,025
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.
184

184

00:08:59,025  -->  00:08:59,578
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
185

185

00:08:59,578  -->  00:09:01,451
&gt;&gt; Awesome.
&gt;&gt; Cool, cool, all right, excellent.
186

186

00:09:01,451  -->  00:09:04,871
Just one last one on that,
you mentioned the word libraries.
187

187

00:09:04,871  -->  00:09:08,312
I've seen online people talking about
what's the difference between a namespace
188

188

00:09:08,312  -->  00:09:08,908
and library?
189

189

00:09:08,908  -->  00:09:11,090
Conceptually, they seem pretty similar.
190

190

00:09:11,090  -->  00:09:15,082
Is there anything we need to know at this
stage about namespaces versus libraries,
191

191

00:09:15,082  -->  00:09:16,688
or is that not really important?
192

192

00:09:16,688  -->  00:09:18,910
&gt;&gt; Not really at this stage, no,
I wouldn't get confused about it.
193

193

00:09:18,910  -->  00:09:22,719
A library is something where you're
using somebody else's code and
194

194

00:09:22,719  -->  00:09:24,632
you're calling out to that code.
195

195

00:09:24,632  -->  00:09:28,530
They're often namespace,
they're independent concepts really.
196

196

00:09:28,530  -->  00:09:30,440
But you can namespace within a library.
197

197

00:09:30,440  -->  00:09:32,765
You can have multiple
namespaces in one library.
198

198

00:09:32,765  -->  00:09:37,476
You could potentially have multiple
libraries all under the same namespace or
199

199

00:09:37,476  -->  00:09:38,841
sharing a namespace.
200

200

00:09:38,841  -->  00:09:40,768
So they're not necessarily related.
201

201

00:09:40,768  -->  00:09:44,280
Namespacing is about folders and
libraries going in, but
202

202

00:09:44,280  -->  00:09:49,311
getting a whole new program installed on
your machine that you could get access to.
203

203

00:09:49,311  -->  00:09:49,837
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
204

204

00:09:49,837  -->  00:09:54,231
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're just using built-in
libraries in Unity for the moment.
205

205

00:09:54,231  -->  00:09:57,906
&gt;&gt; Fantastic, cool, thanks for that Ben,
thanks for your expert wisdom insights,
206

206

00:09:57,906  -->  00:09:58,652
appreciate it.
207

207

00:09:58,652  -->  00:09:59,219
&gt;&gt; No worries.
208

208

00:09:59,219  -->  00:10:01,182
&gt;&gt; And that's good, I think,
for this instructor hangout.
209

209

00:10:01,182  -->  00:10:02,212
Anything else from you?
210

210

00:10:02,212  -->  00:10:04,725
&gt;&gt; Nope, that's it, enjoy the course guys,
hope you're enjoying Rick's instruction,
211

211

00:10:04,725  -->  00:10:05,660
and I'll see you in the next one.
