2

00:00:04,048  -->  00:00:07,250
This video is gonna be another one
of our problem solution videos.
3

3

00:00:07,250  -->  00:00:09,780
So let's have a look at the problem or
problems that we've got.
4

4

00:00:09,780  -->  00:00:13,850
The first problem is that as the enemies
are coming in, they shoot and
5

5

00:00:13,850  -->  00:00:16,360
then they destroy themselves,
that's one problem.
6

6

00:00:16,360  -->  00:00:19,330
And they destroy each other,
it's all crazy stuff.
7

7

00:00:19,330  -->  00:00:23,390
Another problem that we have is that when
the player shoots, it destroys itself.
8

8

00:00:23,390  -->  00:00:25,020
That's not so good either.
9

9

00:00:25,020  -->  00:00:28,066
And then another problem,
I'll show you here when I click on play,
10

10

00:00:28,066  -->  00:00:31,495
is when I shoot you'll see that may laser
goes all the way through the enemy.
11

11

00:00:31,495  -->  00:00:34,636
It doesn't actually stop and
the laser isn't being destroyed,
12

12

00:00:34,636  -->  00:00:37,789
despite the fact that we've already
created a method to do that.
13

13

00:00:37,789  -->  00:00:38,674
So to summarize,
14

14

00:00:38,674  -->  00:00:42,760
this is going to be the challenge slide
as well as our what are we doing slide.
15

15

00:00:42,760  -->  00:00:45,300
If you're feeling a bit more advance and
you wanna dive in and
16

16

00:00:45,300  -->  00:00:47,610
take these on yourself,
then that is excellent.
17

17

00:00:47,610  -->  00:00:52,110
We're gonna be creating collision
layers and assign to our game objects.
18

18

00:00:52,110  -->  00:00:57,120
Also, we need to destroy the projectiles
and the enemy as well, when they collide
19

19

00:00:57,120  -->  00:01:00,360
with something that they're doing damage
to, we need to add damage to our enemy.
20

20

00:01:00,360  -->  00:01:05,140
And we also need to protect against null
reference with our Damage Dealer collision
21

21

00:01:05,140  -->  00:01:09,850
object, so we can't get in a situation
where we're assuming that something that
22

22

00:01:09,850  -->  00:01:11,365
is colliding has damage.
23

23

00:01:11,365  -->  00:01:13,764
So there are the three main
things that we'll be doing.
24

24

00:01:13,764  -->  00:01:17,220
First off, let's talk about collision.
25

25

00:01:17,220  -->  00:01:19,820
So you can see that when our
enemies are disappearing,
26

26

00:01:19,820  -->  00:01:24,600
that is because the laser is
colliding with the enemy.
27

27

00:01:24,600  -->  00:01:25,370
Okay that's fine.
28

28

00:01:25,370  -->  00:01:27,610
I was gonna say, quick get out of the way,
but that's fine.
29

29

00:01:27,610  -->  00:01:31,080
You'll see that when they shoot
the laser has this power,
30

30

00:01:31,080  -->  00:01:33,630
saying whatever it collides with,
destroy it.
31

31

00:01:33,630  -->  00:01:35,660
We wanna say, well, ignore the enemy.
32

32

00:01:35,660  -->  00:01:38,390
You don't actually wanna
distroy the enemy now do you?
33

33

00:01:38,390  -->  00:01:41,528
And I'll summarize this in
a little slide I've got over here.
34

34

00:01:41,528  -->  00:01:43,248
Here with the layer of collisions, so
35

35

00:01:43,248  -->  00:01:46,364
if we've got the enemy projectile
in the player, we want to say yes,
36

36

00:01:46,364  -->  00:01:49,400
the enemy projectile,
yes should collide with the player.
37

37

00:01:49,400  -->  00:01:51,500
But if we've got the enemy
projectile on the enemy,
38

38

00:01:51,500  -->  00:01:56,210
we say no, the enemy projectile
should not collide with the enemy.
39

39

00:01:56,210  -->  00:01:59,618
Where do we find this
information in Unity?
40

40

00:01:59,618  -->  00:02:04,109
If you go to Edit, Project Settings,
and then Physics 2D, you'll see,
41

41

00:02:04,109  -->  00:02:08,839
right down the bottom in our Inspector,
we've got a Layer Collision Matrix.
42

42

00:02:08,839  -->  00:02:13,813
At the moment, we've got five layers,
Default, TransparentFX, Ignore Raycast,
43

43

00:02:13,813  -->  00:02:18,482
Water, and UI, so these are the default
layers that Unity provides for us.
44

44

00:02:18,482  -->  00:02:21,900
We’re gonna create an extra couple of
layers that have meaning for us, and
45

45

00:02:21,900  -->  00:02:25,120
then we’ll assign what collides with what.
46

46

00:02:25,120  -->  00:02:28,010
So it doesn’t really matter what you
click on, but we’ll click on player and
47

47

00:02:28,010  -->  00:02:31,470
then up in the Inspector, the top-right,
you'll see there's Layer, and next to it,
48

48

00:02:31,470  -->  00:02:32,190
Default.
49

49

00:02:32,190  -->  00:02:35,550
Click on Default, and
then there's the option to Add Layer.
50

50

00:02:35,550  -->  00:02:39,706
You can see that the 0 through to 7 are
taken up, so I'm gonna start from Layer 8.
51

51

00:02:39,706  -->  00:02:41,855
The layer number doesn't matter so much.
52

52

00:02:41,855  -->  00:02:45,080
It's just what we're putting in
here that is going to matter.
53

53

00:02:45,080  -->  00:02:47,690
So we'll say Player for Layer 8.
54

54

00:02:47,690  -->  00:02:51,970
Layer 9, I'll say Enemy, I'll type Enemy.
55

55

00:02:51,970  -->  00:02:55,251
Layer 10 we will use,
what should we use in here?
56

56

00:02:55,251  -->  00:02:59,601
We'll say, Player Projectile.
57

57

00:02:59,601  -->  00:03:04,490
And layer 11, we'll say Enemy Projectile.
58

58

00:03:04,490  -->  00:03:08,320
I think that's the main things
that we want to have crushing or
59

59

00:03:08,320  -->  00:03:10,290
not crushing into each other.
60

60

00:03:10,290  -->  00:03:15,610
That's cool, then we can exit out of that,
let me click on our player one more time,
61

61

00:03:15,610  -->  00:03:17,110
take us back to the players inspector.
62

62

00:03:17,110  -->  00:03:21,670
Now when we click on layer, you'll see we
have the option of assigning that as you
63

63

00:03:21,670  -->  00:03:25,600
are on the player layer, and
I love that it rhymes, the player layer.
64

64

00:03:25,600  -->  00:03:28,030
So the player is now a player
on the player layer,
65

65

00:03:28,030  -->  00:03:31,780
we'll apply that back to the prefab
as we do and click on Roger.
66

66

00:03:31,780  -->  00:03:32,900
Roger is an enemy.
67

67

00:03:32,900  -->  00:03:37,040
So up in the top right, we'll assign
Roger to be on the enemy layer.
68

68

00:03:37,040  -->  00:03:39,100
We'll assign Bernard to
be on the enemy layer.
69

69

00:03:39,100  -->  00:03:41,120
Any other enemies you
might have in your game,
70

70

00:03:41,120  -->  00:03:43,210
make sure you assign
them to the enemy layer.
71

71

00:03:43,210  -->  00:03:46,800
Find our enemy prefabs, right,
enemy laser prefab, and
72

72

00:03:46,800  -->  00:03:49,750
we'll assign that to be
an enemy projectile.
73

73

00:03:49,750  -->  00:03:55,390
And then the player laser will define
that as player projectile, okay.
74

74

00:03:55,390  -->  00:03:57,560
You can add a bunch more of
these as they come up, but
75

75

00:03:57,560  -->  00:04:00,060
I think these are the ones
that we've got at the moment.
76

76

00:04:00,060  -->  00:04:04,370
Now back over into Edit, Project Settings,
77

77

00:04:04,370  -->  00:04:08,930
Physics 2D and our Collision Matrix
has a whole bunch more things on it.
78

78

00:04:08,930  -->  00:04:12,780
And you can see that they're all ticked
as yes, you will collide by default.
79

79

00:04:12,780  -->  00:04:16,090
Everything by default collides
with everything else.
80

80

00:04:16,090  -->  00:04:18,970
So let's go through and say what should,
or shouldn't collide with stuff.
81

81

00:04:18,970  -->  00:04:24,120
Just looking at the left hand column here,
I'm going to say Default, that's cool.
82

82

00:04:24,120  -->  00:04:26,365
Things automatically
get defined as Default.
83

83

00:04:26,365  -->  00:04:29,830
Don't worry about Transparent, down to
what, okay, the first one is Player.
84

84

00:04:29,830  -->  00:04:31,700
What should the Player collide with and
not?
85

85

00:04:31,700  -->  00:04:34,610
You can see it's chopped off a little bit,
but this says Enemy Projectile.
86

86

00:04:34,610  -->  00:04:36,830
So Player and Enemy Projectile, yes.
87

87

00:04:36,830  -->  00:04:38,650
Player and Player Projectile, no.
88

88

00:04:38,650  -->  00:04:41,140
That's why we were disappearing
when we shot ourselves.
89

89

00:04:41,140  -->  00:04:43,260
Player and Enemy, yes.
90

90

00:04:43,260  -->  00:04:43,860
Player and Player?
91

91

00:04:43,860  -->  00:04:48,470
Well, that's not really gonna happen,
but we'll say no for now just in case.
92

92

00:04:48,470  -->  00:04:50,540
And then Enemy and Enemy Projectile?
93

93

00:04:50,540  -->  00:04:53,280
No, we don't want the enemies
to be able to shoot themselves.
94

94

00:04:53,280  -->  00:04:55,610
And then Enemy and Player Projectile, yes.
95

95

00:04:55,610  -->  00:04:56,610
And Enemy and Enemy?
96

96

00:04:56,610  -->  00:04:59,040
No, we don't want them to
be bumping into each other.
97

97

00:04:59,040  -->  00:05:01,350
Player, player projectile and
enemy projectile.
98

98

00:05:01,350  -->  00:05:04,410
No, I don't really want to be
shooting down enemy projectiles,
99

99

00:05:04,410  -->  00:05:05,630
although you might want to have that.
100

100

00:05:05,630  -->  00:05:07,030
That could be cool.
101

101

00:05:07,030  -->  00:05:09,570
And player projectile and
player projectile, no.
102

102

00:05:09,570  -->  00:05:12,320
And enemy projectile and
enemy projectile, no as well.
103

103

00:05:12,320  -->  00:05:13,910
Okay, so there's that collision matrix.
104

104

00:05:13,910  -->  00:05:16,240
If we save this up, click on Play.
105

105

00:05:16,240  -->  00:05:20,090
Let's see if that has fixed
our problem straight away.
106

106

00:05:21,210  -->  00:05:23,410
Shooting, okay,
they're not destroying themselves.
107

107

00:05:23,410  -->  00:05:25,660
We've got a whole bunch
of lasers coming down.
108

108

00:05:25,660  -->  00:05:27,340
Great, the player died.
109

109

00:05:27,340  -->  00:05:32,071
One more check I'll do is the player needs
to be able to shoot without destroying
110

110

00:05:32,071  -->  00:05:33,090
themselves.
111

111

00:05:33,090  -->  00:05:33,890
And shoot, shoot, shoot.
112

112

00:05:33,890  -->  00:05:34,740
Yep, good.
113

113

00:05:34,740  -->  00:05:39,100
And the player is destroying the enemies,
except for, yep got him.
114

114

00:05:39,100  -->  00:05:41,520
Okay, what was next on our
list of things to tidy up?
115

115

00:05:41,520  -->  00:05:44,320
We want to make sure
the missile destroys itself.
116

116

00:05:44,320  -->  00:05:47,310
So over into our do damage script in here.
117

117

00:05:47,310  -->  00:05:50,954
We created previously this Hit method
which destroys the game object when
118

118

00:05:50,954  -->  00:05:51,960
it hits something.
119

119

00:05:51,960  -->  00:05:54,689
And again, this is where we
need to put it into two places,
120

120

00:05:54,689  -->  00:05:56,043
which is a little bit messy.
121

121

00:05:56,043  -->  00:06:00,771
And ideally, we would have just one
health component that we would add in
122

122

00:06:00,771  -->  00:06:03,340
a couple of places, one health class.
123

123

00:06:03,340  -->  00:06:07,184
But for now, we're gonna leave it like
this so in a way, it's good to feel
124

124

00:06:07,184  -->  00:06:10,780
the pain a little bit and to think
about how we could factor it out, but
125

125

00:06:10,780  -->  00:06:12,890
we are going to put this in, let's see.
126

126

00:06:12,890  -->  00:06:16,580
Where do we want to have
the bullet actually be destroyed?
127

127

00:06:16,580  -->  00:06:18,890
I think after we do the health minus,
128

128

00:06:18,890  -->  00:06:21,650
after we reduce the health of
the thing you smacked into.
129

129

00:06:21,650  -->  00:06:29,028
That is where we'll say
damageDealer.Hit();.
130

130

00:06:29,028  -->  00:06:33,735
Okay, save this over into enemy
where we're doing exactly the same
131

131

00:06:33,735  -->  00:06:36,640
thing underneath health being reduced.
132

132

00:06:36,640  -->  00:06:40,442
We will say damageDealer.Hit(); save and
133

133

00:06:40,442  -->  00:06:45,511
that should successfully be
destroying the player laser when
134

134

00:06:45,511  -->  00:06:50,587
it hits an enemy, and
the enemy laser when it hits the player.
135

135

00:06:50,587  -->  00:06:54,510
But you can see that in
both situations that works.
136

136

00:06:54,510  -->  00:06:55,060
Okay, cool.
And
137

137

00:06:55,060  -->  00:06:57,170
then the last thing I wanna
do in this video is for
138

138

00:06:57,170  -->  00:07:01,610
us to protect against null situations,
so null reference.
139

139

00:07:01,610  -->  00:07:03,960
And we had this a couple of
lectures ago where Roger,
140

140

00:07:03,960  -->  00:07:06,410
the Roger we've just dumped
into our scene here.
141

141

00:07:06,410  -->  00:07:10,988
We're sitting there with an enemy pathing
script and the enemy pathing script
142

142

00:07:10,988  -->  00:07:15,770
assumes a whole bunch of things, and
if you have a look at our player script.
143

143

00:07:15,770  -->  00:07:20,264
At the moment, we're assuming when
anything collides with the player,
144

144

00:07:20,264  -->  00:07:23,960
we're assuming that it has this
damageDealer component and
145

145

00:07:23,960  -->  00:07:26,576
then when processing with damageDealer.
146

146

00:07:26,576  -->  00:07:32,063
And it could potentially get to the point,
if we're clever with our collision matrix,
147

147

00:07:32,063  -->  00:07:36,460
then this isn't going to happen but
it's good to protect against it.
148

148

00:07:36,460  -->  00:07:38,470
I just want to show you how
we go about doing this.
149

149

00:07:38,470  -->  00:07:43,300
So we can say at this point we're getting
it, we're saying GetComponent and
150

150

00:07:43,300  -->  00:07:47,105
then here, we're using the object
that has the component.
151

151

00:07:47,105  -->  00:07:49,484
But if the object doesn't
have the component,
152

152

00:07:49,484  -->  00:07:52,050
then this process here is
potentially gonna fail.
153

153

00:07:52,050  -->  00:07:56,890
So in here we'll say,
if naught or none or no, so
154

154

00:07:56,890  -->  00:08:03,880
if naught which is the !damageDealer and
that's in parentheses.
155

155

00:08:03,880  -->  00:08:07,230
Open our curly brackets,
we could do this on a separate line, but
156

156

00:08:07,230  -->  00:08:09,690
it works here and
it's a little bit tidier this way.
157

157

00:08:09,690  -->  00:08:16,360
Then we type return;, and
then it will close the curly braces.
158

158

00:08:16,360  -->  00:08:21,590
And what this is saying is if there is no
damageDealer, if it's not damageDealer,
159

159

00:08:21,590  -->  00:08:22,470
then return.
160

160

00:08:22,470  -->  00:08:24,110
End what we're doing,
161

161

00:08:24,110  -->  00:08:29,860
don't do anything further down
the chain and exit out of this method.
162

162

00:08:29,860  -->  00:08:32,720
So return, and we do the exact same line.
163

163

00:08:32,720  -->  00:08:36,580
I'm just gonna copy the exact
same line over an enemy.
164

164

00:08:36,580  -->  00:08:38,747
And again,
you can see if we had this in one place,
165

165

00:08:38,747  -->  00:08:40,254
I wouldn't have to type it twice.
166

166

00:08:40,254  -->  00:08:44,057
And potentially make mistakes,
but if damageDealer, so
167

167

00:08:44,057  -->  00:08:46,392
if !damageDealer, then return.
168

168

00:08:46,392  -->  00:08:49,195
And that is protecting us against null.
169

169

00:08:49,195  -->  00:08:53,790
Protecting us against a situation where
we're trying to do something, but
170

170

00:08:53,790  -->  00:08:56,534
the information, the data doesn't exist.
171

171

00:08:59,086  -->  00:09:00,331
And we'll save that up, okay.
172

172

00:09:00,331  -->  00:09:03,855
So in this video,
we've done a couple of tidies ups.
173

173

00:09:03,855  -->  00:09:07,765
I think the end result is pretty neat
where our game is working quite nicely.
174

174

00:09:07,765  -->  00:09:11,073
We can fly around, we can shoot,
we can kill enemies, they can kill us.
175

175

00:09:11,073  -->  00:09:13,087
The bullets smack into the enemies.
176

176

00:09:13,087  -->  00:09:15,597
We'll be able to do some really
cool particle effects on
177

177

00:09:15,597  -->  00:09:17,467
collision in the future.
178

178

00:09:17,467  -->  00:09:18,687
We have health.
179

179

00:09:18,687  -->  00:09:22,540
We need to do a whole bunch more, but this
is really starting to feel like a game.
180

180

00:09:22,540  -->  00:09:26,753
And this is an awesome point, if you've
created something that you're particularly
181

181

00:09:26,753  -->  00:09:30,387
proud of and happy with, or even if
you're just a little bit happy with it,
182

182

00:09:30,387  -->  00:09:34,164
then please, please share a video,
share a screenshot in the discussions.
183

183

00:09:34,164  -->  00:09:35,642
We'd love to see what you're up to.
184

184

00:09:35,642  -->  00:09:37,163
This is a great time to do some sharing.
185

185

00:09:37,163  -->  00:09:39,369
So, well done and
I'll see you in the next lecture.
