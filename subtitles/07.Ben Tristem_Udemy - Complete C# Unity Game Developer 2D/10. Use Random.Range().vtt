2

2

00:00:03.832  -->  00:00:07.539
In this video we are going to create
randomness where our guess starts off
3

3

00:00:07.539  -->  00:00:12.130
random and when we click lower it's gonna
be random between a minimum and a maximum.
4

4

00:00:12.130  -->  00:00:15.270
Likewise, higher,
a random between a minimum and a maximum.
5

5

00:00:15.270  -->  00:00:18.150
At the moment in our game,
our first guess is always 500.
6

6

00:00:18.150  -->  00:00:20.720
If we click higher,
the next guess is always 750,
7

7

00:00:20.720  -->  00:00:23.590
higher again it's always 875 and so on.
8

8

00:00:23.590  -->  00:00:26.720
And this predictability in
some circumstances is good.
9

9

00:00:26.720  -->  00:00:29.330
But we wanna create some
randomness in our game so
10

10

00:00:29.330  -->  00:00:31.000
it's not the same thing over and over.
11

11

00:00:31.000  -->  00:00:35.610
And we can create some randomness
by using Random.Range.
12

12

00:00:35.610  -->  00:00:38.380
So I've given you a link in
the resources to the unity docs.
13

13

00:00:38.380  -->  00:00:42.440
I'm just looking at Random.Range here and
the rules are slightly different if your
14

14

00:00:42.440  -->  00:00:47.300
using a float, if we scroll down
compared with if we're using an integer.
15

15

00:00:47.300  -->  00:00:52.260
So when we're using an integer using
random.range will return a value
16

16

00:00:52.260  -->  00:00:54.520
between the minimum and the maximum.
17

17

00:00:54.520  -->  00:00:57.530
And an important point here is
that minimum is inclusive and
18

18

00:00:57.530  -->  00:00:59.330
the maximum is exclusive.
19

19

00:00:59.330  -->  00:01:02.800
So if we're returning between one and ten.
20

20

00:01:02.800  -->  00:01:04.860
It will give us a value anywhere.
21

21

00:01:04.860  -->  00:01:06.770
Including one all the way up to nine.
22

22

00:01:06.770  -->  00:01:08.620
Because it's exclusive
it doesn't include 10.
23

23

00:01:08.620  -->  00:01:11.850
It will give us the integer
that is just below that.
24

24

00:01:11.850  -->  00:01:15.470
So I've given you this link and
I'm going to give you a challenge.
25

25

00:01:15.470  -->  00:01:19.180
The challenge is to
make your guess random.
26

26

00:01:19.180  -->  00:01:23.350
Use Random.Range to make a random
guess between max and min.
27

27

00:01:23.350  -->  00:01:25.210
So, have a look at the doc,
this is a little bit of a,
28

28

00:01:25.210  -->  00:01:28.690
I'm gonna give you the problem,
and give you a lot of clues.
29

29

00:01:28.690  -->  00:01:30.950
I want you to go and solve this yourself.
30

30

00:01:30.950  -->  00:01:33.140
I really want you to pause the video.
31

31

00:01:33.140  -->  00:01:33.970
Take on the challenge.
32

32

00:01:33.970  -->  00:01:35.710
You have everything you
need to do this one.
33

33

00:01:35.710  -->  00:01:38.450
So don't sit there and
just be like, I'm waiting for
34

34

00:01:38.450  -->  00:01:40.160
Rick to show me the answer to this.
35

35

00:01:40.160  -->  00:01:41.270
Actually dive in and do it.
36

36

00:01:41.270  -->  00:01:45.490
That is how you learn, that is how you
improve, that's how you get better.
37

37

00:01:45.490  -->  00:01:47.820
Okay, I'm gonna give you
some bonus points here for
38

38

00:01:47.820  -->  00:01:49.810
a couple of other things we need to do.
39

39

00:01:49.810  -->  00:01:52.490
If you refactor, hit bonus points four,
40

40

00:01:52.490  -->  00:01:57.270
refactoring our guess calculation
code to only one place.
41

41

00:01:57.270  -->  00:01:59.820
We currently have the same
code in two places,
42

42

00:01:59.820  -->  00:02:02.040
let me just very quickly
show you what I mean there.
43

43

00:02:02.040  -->  00:02:04.663
We currently have our code here and
44

44

00:02:04.663  -->  00:02:09.461
our code here, so
we're running exactly the same code twice.
45

45

00:02:09.461  -->  00:02:13.653
So there's a challenge is to refactor
our guess calculation to only
46

46

00:02:13.653  -->  00:02:18.283
have the code in one place, and also for
bonus points stop the computer from
47

47

00:02:18.283  -->  00:02:21.979
being able to guess something
that it has already guessed.
48

48

00:02:21.979  -->  00:02:27.832
So, if it guesses 500, then we want to
make sure that it doesn't guess 500 again.
49

49

00:02:27.832  -->  00:02:30.862
And that will be slight tweak,
just a couple of little,
50

50

00:02:30.862  -->  00:02:35.375
little additions to our code, to make
sure that when we're using Random.Range,
51

51

00:02:35.375  -->  00:02:39.380
we don't allow the computer to guess
something we've already guessed.
52

52

00:02:39.380  -->  00:02:42.000
So that's maybe a little bit
of a stretch goal, there.
53

53

00:02:42.000  -->  00:02:43.810
It's pretty simple, code-wise, but
54

54

00:02:43.810  -->  00:02:46.270
this requires you to really
think about what's going on, and
55

55

00:02:46.270  -->  00:02:50.140
have a look at your logic, and figure
out a way to stop that from happening.
56

56

00:02:50.140  -->  00:02:54.820
So there is the challenge, I really,
really, really want you to jump in and
57

57

00:02:54.820  -->  00:02:55.930
take on this challenge.
58

58

00:02:55.930  -->  00:02:57.700
And I'll see you back here,
when you've that done.
59

59

00:02:59.790  -->  00:03:01.230
Okay, you might be
sitting there waiting for
60

60

00:03:01.230  -->  00:03:02.770
me to come back and give you the answer.
61

61

00:03:02.770  -->  00:03:05.899
If you're doing that I want you
to really pause the video and
62

62

00:03:05.899  -->  00:03:07.784
jump in and take on this challenge.
63

63

00:03:10.148  -->  00:03:13.318
Okay this time I am going back to
the code, I'm not gonna sit there for
64

64

00:03:13.318  -->  00:03:15.789
five minutes saying are you
doing the challenge yet?
65

65

00:03:16.960  -->  00:03:18.330
Okay, so what do we need to do?
66

66

00:03:18.330  -->  00:03:21.370
First off we need to,
I'll start by refactoring.
67

67

00:03:21.370  -->  00:03:24.390
So I've mentioned that we've got
this code is the same as this code,
68

68

00:03:24.390  -->  00:03:25.590
but what is this code?
69

69

00:03:25.590  -->  00:03:27.330
This code here is NextGuess.
70

70

00:03:27.330  -->  00:03:30.520
NextGuess is saying, have our guess and
then display it on the screen.
71

71

00:03:30.520  -->  00:03:37.368
So instead of writing all of this up here,
we can just call NextGuess.
72

72

00:03:37.368  -->  00:03:41.070
That will do the same thing as those
two lines and it cleans it up.
73

73

00:03:41.070  -->  00:03:42.000
We don't have to do this.
74

74

00:03:42.000  -->  00:03:44.010
Our code will work just fine but
75

75

00:03:44.010  -->  00:03:49.860
this is a good habit to get into because
if we go and change our logic in here and
76

76

00:03:49.860  -->  00:03:54.770
we forget to do it up in where we had it
just here, if we forget to do it up in.
77

77

00:03:54.770  -->  00:03:55.510
Let me undo this.
78

78

00:03:55.510  -->  00:03:58.540
If we forget to do it here, then we've
got something different here and
79

79

00:03:58.540  -->  00:03:59.372
different there.
80

80

00:03:59.372  -->  00:04:01.370
So wherever we can,
we try to have it consistent.
81

81

00:04:01.370  -->  00:04:05.365
I'll just redo,
my change back to the NextGuess.
82

82

00:04:05.365  -->  00:04:08.915
Okay, we didn't startgame method,
we have NextGuess.
83

83

00:04:08.915  -->  00:04:12.155
Now let's look at our
randomness down to NextGuess,
84

84

00:04:12.155  -->  00:04:15.042
we have guess equals max
plus min divided by 2.
85

85

00:04:15.042  -->  00:04:22.042
Well, instead of that I'm going to
use random, rangom, random dot range.
86

86

00:04:22.042  -->  00:04:26.901
And then parentheses, and you can see
after we talked about first parentheses it
87

87

00:04:26.901  -->  00:04:30.687
gives us the clue here,
it's looking for min and then max, and
88

88

00:04:30.687  -->  00:04:34.640
cool is that we've actually named
to have variables min and max.
89

89

00:04:34.640  -->  00:04:39.417
It didn't know that, it just happen to
be we were clever when we named it, so
90

90

00:04:39.417  -->  00:04:44.641
we can say min, max, that's gonna choose
a random value that is inclusive of min,
91

91

00:04:44.641  -->  00:04:48.399
so at the moment it would be
1 up to max which is 1,000.
92

92

00:04:48.399  -->  00:04:52.440
Let's save, back into Unity.
93

93

00:04:52.440  -->  00:04:52.982
I was already on play.
94

94

00:04:52.982  -->  00:04:54.544
Click on play again.
95

95

00:04:57.674  -->  00:05:02.520
Now the first guess is 719,
that is definitely random.
96

96

00:05:02.520  -->  00:05:06.730
And then if we click on higher,
it's random 970, lower 852,
97

97

00:05:06.730  -->  00:05:11.330
so we can't see an obvious
pattern here now which is great.
98

98

00:05:11.330  -->  00:05:14.290
We've introduced randomness into our game,
very cool.
99

99

00:05:14.290  -->  00:05:16.727
So I mentioned that we had
another part of our bonus points,
100

100

00:05:16.727  -->  00:05:20.169
which was to stop the computer from being
able to guess an already guessed a number.
101

101

00:05:20.169  -->  00:05:23.694
I'm going to click on game play
which shows us our max and
102

102

00:05:23.694  -->  00:05:27.149
min variables that are exposed
in the inspector here.
103

103

00:05:27.149  -->  00:05:31.601
When I click play,
we see that we start off with
104

104

00:05:31.601  -->  00:05:35.608
a guess of 535 my maximum is 1001.
105

105

00:05:35.608  -->  00:05:36.715
Well, that's an issue as well,
106

106

00:05:36.715  -->  00:05:38.500
that's something we'll need
to change in a moment.
107

107

00:05:38.500  -->  00:05:39.600
It should be 1000.
108

108

00:05:39.600  -->  00:05:47.014
If I click Higher, then my minimum is 535
and you see my guess here now is 562.
109

109

00:05:47.014  -->  00:05:52.210
If I click Higher, then our minimum is
562 just as our code is asking it to do.
110

110

00:05:52.210  -->  00:05:54.460
But our minimum shouldn't be 562.
111

111

00:05:54.460  -->  00:05:55.496
It should be what?
112

112

00:05:55.496  -->  00:06:02.162
563 because we've already guessed 562.
113

113

00:06:02.162  -->  00:06:05.986
That was our guess, so
it shouldn't be the minimum and
114

114

00:06:05.986  -->  00:06:11.061
because minimum and maximum as part
of our Random.Range is inclusive,
115

115

00:06:11.061  -->  00:06:15.080
it's saying I will include
this as part of my guess.
116

116

00:06:15.080  -->  00:06:19.570
It could now guess 562, so if I go Lower,
Lower, Lower, Lower, Lower.
117

117

00:06:19.570  -->  00:06:22.530
It's guessing 562, but
it's guessed that already.
118

118

00:06:22.530  -->  00:06:24.222
So, hopefully you jumped in and
119

119

00:06:24.222  -->  00:06:26.988
had a look to see what you
can do with your logic here.
120

120

00:06:26.988  -->  00:06:28.952
It's pretty straightforward I think.
121

121

00:06:28.952  -->  00:06:35.160
If we look at our OnPressHigher,
our minimum is going to be our guess.
122

122

00:06:35.160  -->  00:06:38.979
So if we say it's higher,
our minimum is now changed to our guess.
123

123

00:06:38.979  -->  00:06:43.199
Let's have a look and see, so,
if we click Higher, it's currently 407.
124

124

00:06:43.199  -->  00:06:45.700
We click Higher, our minimum becomes 407.
125

125

00:06:45.700  -->  00:06:47.840
We want it to be one more than that.
126

126

00:06:47.840  -->  00:06:51.477
So we want our minimum to be guess + 1.
127

127

00:06:51.477  -->  00:06:58.957
And likewise, when we're pressing lower,
we want our maximum to be our guess- 1.
128

128

00:06:58.957  -->  00:07:02.110
So that we don't go all
the way up to our guess.
129

129

00:07:02.110  -->  00:07:07.976
Save back into unity, click on play.
130

130

00:07:07.976  -->  00:07:12.596
Now our first guess is 382,
when I click Higher,
131

131

00:07:12.596  -->  00:07:16.481
the minimum is now 383 that's great, so
132

132

00:07:16.481  -->  00:07:20.786
the lowest we gonna get down to is 383,
cool.
133

133

00:07:20.786  -->  00:07:23.940
And the last thing to do is
to check out our edge cases.
134

134

00:07:23.940  -->  00:07:27.250
If we click on Higher
what can we go up to?
135

135

00:07:27.250  -->  00:07:29.210
Well our maximum is 1001.
136

136

00:07:29.210  -->  00:07:30.530
We don't want that.
137

137

00:07:30.530  -->  00:07:32.330
Let's see what happens
if we can go down lower.
138

138

00:07:32.330  -->  00:07:33.240
Our minimum is one.
139

139

00:07:33.240  -->  00:07:38.040
So we know at the start, that would be
the lowest we can get down to is one.
140

140

00:07:38.040  -->  00:07:41.600
So let's just go and
have a look at our logic here and

141

00:07:41.600  -->  00:07:45.280
finally we get to get rid of this
somewhat messy: max = max +1.
142

142

00:07:45.280  -->  00:07:48.050
If we just delete that, save.
143

143

00:07:48.050  -->  00:07:54.150
Now, I believe when we play our game,
the maximum will be 1,000.
144

144

00:07:54.150  -->  00:07:56.210
Yes and the minimum is one cool.
145

145

00:07:56.210  -->  00:07:59.100
So guess all the way out to 1000,
excellent.
146

146

00:07:59.100  -->  00:08:04.150
And as a final point, a big thank you to
Tiago who pointed out that because min
147

147

00:08:04.150  -->  00:08:09.800
is inclusive and max is exclusive,
we need to have our guess max plus one,
148

148

00:08:09.800  -->  00:08:13.650
so that we can still go all the way
up to whatever our max value is.
149

149

00:08:13.650  -->  00:08:15.200
Thanks for pointing that out, Tiago.
150

150

00:08:15.200  -->  00:08:18.260
And thanks for everyone who points
out problems and issues and
151

151

00:08:18.260  -->  00:08:20.080
mistakes I make in my videos.
152

152

00:08:20.080  -->  00:08:23.250
It really helps make the course
much better, so thank you for that.
153

153

00:08:23.250  -->  00:08:25.550
Great work,
that's all of our code taken care of.
154

154

00:08:25.550  -->  00:08:28.850
In the next video we'll just do a last
little bit of polishing our game and
155

155

00:08:28.850  -->  00:08:30.170
then I think we're done.
156

156

00:08:30.170  -->  00:08:31.510
Great work, and see you in the next video.
