00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:04,062
[MUSIC]
2

2

00:00:04,062  -->  00:00:06,853
We left the last video with
a null reference exception.
3

3

00:00:06,853  -->  00:00:08,560
So let's have a look at
what's going on there, and
4

4

00:00:08,560  -->  00:00:10,080
let's have a look at how
we can address that.
5

5

00:00:10,080  -->  00:00:14,420
So I've given you a link to the Unity
documentation about what is a null
6

6

00:00:14,420  -->  00:00:15,770
reference exception.
7

7

00:00:15,770  -->  00:00:19,100
Literally it happens when you try
to access a reference variable
8

8

00:00:19,100  -->  00:00:21,650
that isn't referencing any object.
9

9

00:00:21,650  -->  00:00:25,540
So it's when we're trying to be too clever
and say, hey, go to this thing, but
10

10

00:00:25,540  -->  00:00:29,735
that thing doesn't exist, we thought it
existed, maybe it doesn't exist anymore.
11

11

00:00:29,735  -->  00:00:33,299
So let's have a look and dig into that
in the context of our own code and
12

12

00:00:33,299  -->  00:00:34,665
see what that means.
13

13

00:00:34,665  -->  00:00:37,255
So I'll see if I can replicate this and
get this error again.
14

14

00:00:37,255  -->  00:00:41,552
Sometimes it's there, sometimes it's not,
which to me says it's something to do with
15

15

00:00:41,552  -->  00:00:45,276
our execution order when certain things
might be happening at the same time,
16

16

00:00:45,276  -->  00:00:47,587
might nearly be happening,
or not happening.
17

17

00:00:47,587  -->  00:00:51,563
Gets to the end, you lost,
we'll click try again.
18

18

00:00:51,563  -->  00:00:53,384
Didn't happen that time.
19

19

00:00:53,384  -->  00:00:55,130
We'll click again.
20

20

00:00:55,130  -->  00:00:57,470
No, main menu, we got it that time.
21

21

00:00:57,470  -->  00:01:01,950
Okay, so NullReferenceException,
if you have a look at it,
22

22

00:01:01,950  -->  00:01:06,590
it's talking about object references,
not set to an instance of an object, and
23

23

00:01:06,590  -->  00:01:08,840
we're looking at attacker.OnDestroy.
24

24

00:01:08,840  -->  00:01:11,930
So if I open that up,
double-click on that, first place to go.
25

25

00:01:11,930  -->  00:01:15,100
It's got an issue with this, and
this in and of itself looks fine.
26

26

00:01:15,100  -->  00:01:16,620
This has been working okay.
27

27

00:01:16,620  -->  00:01:19,770
This is how we're keeping
track of how many enemies,
28

28

00:01:19,770  -->  00:01:21,270
how many attackers we've got in our scene.
29

29

00:01:21,270  -->  00:01:24,340
But there's something interesting,
cuz we're using OnDestroy.
30

30

00:01:24,340  -->  00:01:26,470
Remember when we looked at
the execution order of this,
31

31

00:01:26,470  -->  00:01:28,390
this happens right at the very, very end.
32

32

00:01:28,390  -->  00:01:33,720
So it could be something else is happening
before this and then this is happening.
33

33

00:01:33,720  -->  00:01:36,305
So it could be something to
do with a level controller.
34

34

00:01:36,305  -->  00:01:40,600
Let's have a look at where
this method is created over in
35

35

00:01:40,600  -->  00:01:42,570
level controller I believe.
36

36

00:01:44,085  -->  00:01:46,320
AttackerKilled, yeah just in here.
37

37

00:01:46,320  -->  00:01:50,220
So it's looking for in here,
when we call that method it's saying
38

38

00:01:50,220  -->  00:01:52,690
I want to do something
with numberOfAttackers.
39

39

00:01:52,690  -->  00:01:58,235
However, if we've ended our level and
LevelController no longer exists,
40

40

00:01:58,235  -->  00:02:01,690
then numberOfAttackers no longer exists.
41

41

00:02:01,690  -->  00:02:05,990
This method might no longer exist,
there could be a muddle going on in there.
42

42

00:02:05,990  -->  00:02:13,180
So it might be that to do a destroying
is happening at the end of our level.
43

43

00:02:13,180  -->  00:02:15,230
Not just when we think
we've won the level, but
44

44

00:02:15,230  -->  00:02:20,410
they're also being destroyed when
the level is destroyed and loaded.
45

45

00:02:20,410  -->  00:02:22,860
So everything gets destroyed
when we load a new level,
46

46

00:02:22,860  -->  00:02:25,890
everything from the existing level, so
that could be what's going on there.
47

47

00:02:25,890  -->  00:02:28,290
Let's see if we can implement a fix for
this that works.
48

48

00:02:28,290  -->  00:02:29,890
We'll go back into attacker.
49

49

00:02:29,890  -->  00:02:35,990
Now what we wanna say is look for
LevelController, but if this is null
50

50

00:02:35,990  -->  00:02:40,780
then don't do anything, don't go and
try to call AttackerKilled.
51

51

00:02:40,780  -->  00:02:42,877
So let's just rewrite this a little bit.
52

52

00:02:42,877  -->  00:02:47,490
I'm in my Attacker script here,
we'll say LevelController.
53

53

00:02:47,490  -->  00:02:53,006
So type LevelController, we'll call it
LevelController =, and now we'll find,
54

54

00:02:53,006  -->  00:02:58,240
so I'm just bringing this line up and
removing the method call from the end.
55

55

00:02:58,240  -->  00:03:01,080
So find object of type LevelController.
56

56

00:03:01,080  -->  00:03:02,980
So first of all, we are defining this.
57

57

00:03:02,980  -->  00:03:10,540
Now let us say if LevelController!=
58

58

00:03:10,540  -->  00:03:15,740
which means is not null then continue
on with what we are going to do.
59

59

00:03:15,740  -->  00:03:20,670
So this is a way of saying if
it's not null, execute this code.
60

60

00:03:20,670  -->  00:03:23,360
If it is null, then just stop here.
61

61

00:03:23,360  -->  00:03:25,472
We can write it the other way around and
say,
62

62

00:03:25,472  -->  00:03:27,720
if LevelController is null then return.
63

63

00:03:27,720  -->  00:03:31,250
But we'll write it this way to say
only do this code if it's not null.
64

64

00:03:31,250  -->  00:03:31,910
What's the code?
65

65

00:03:31,910  -->  00:03:40,280
Well, it's gonna be
LevelController.AttackerKilled();.
66

66

00:03:40,280  -->  00:03:41,590
Okay, save that up.
67

67

00:03:41,590  -->  00:03:45,350
So that's just protecting
against our null condition.
68

68

00:03:45,350  -->  00:03:48,804
Save that and then,
let's play the game a couple times now,
69

69

00:03:48,804  -->  00:03:50,508
see if we can replicate this.
70

70

00:03:50,508  -->  00:03:54,441
We'll do the same as we did last time,
put down a couple of defenders,
71

71

00:03:54,441  -->  00:03:56,320
get to the end, click main menu.
72

72

00:03:57,950  -->  00:04:02,153
And we have a different error, but
not the error that we had just before.
73

73

00:04:02,153  -->  00:04:05,461
Let's do it one more time, it's always
good when we get a different error.
74

74

00:04:05,461  -->  00:04:07,332
Gotta track these things
down when we find them.
75

75

00:04:07,332  -->  00:04:10,795
Click on Play, we'll just make
sure that our try again works.
76

76

00:04:10,795  -->  00:04:15,542
[SOUND] Okay, and then try again.
77

77

00:04:15,542  -->  00:04:19,660
We're not getting any errors,
that all looks pretty good, and try again.
78

78

00:04:19,660  -->  00:04:21,580
Okay, so
I think we've addressed that error.
79

79

00:04:21,580  -->  00:04:25,060
It might come up again places but
you can only stomp it when you find it.
80

80

00:04:25,060  -->  00:04:26,570
Do your best with these errors.
81

81

00:04:26,570  -->  00:04:29,890
Don't drive yourself crazy trying
to find absolute perfection.
82

82

00:04:29,890  -->  00:04:33,550
Address it when you find
it is usually my approach.
83

83

00:04:33,550  -->  00:04:37,140
So we had another one that came up
in there that was to do with the win
84

84

00:04:37,140  -->  00:04:38,410
condition and lose condition.
85

85

00:04:38,410  -->  00:04:40,706
Let me just play, lose,
and then go to Main Menu,
86

86

00:04:40,706  -->  00:04:42,424
so we can find that other one as well.
87

87

00:04:46,214  -->  00:04:49,540
Okay, Main Menu, okay,
let's have a look at what's going on here.
88

88

00:04:49,540  -->  00:04:54,430
This is the variable winLevel of
LevelController has not been assigned.
89

89

00:04:54,430  -->  00:04:57,910
Okay, so this one is a very common one
as well, this is what you'll see a lot.
90

90

00:04:57,910  -->  00:05:00,850
So what's going on here,
in LevelController we're looking for
91

91

00:05:00,850  -->  00:05:03,180
our GameObject of winLabel.
92

92

00:05:03,180  -->  00:05:05,680
And then at some point,
we're turning the winLabel on, and
93

93

00:05:05,680  -->  00:05:07,420
we're turning the winLabel off.
94

94

00:05:07,420  -->  00:05:11,390
However, in our LevelController
in our start screen,
95

95

00:05:11,390  -->  00:05:14,850
we don't have or
need this win, loss condition.
96

96

00:05:14,850  -->  00:05:17,587
So that's something that
I hadn't considered,
97

97

00:05:17,587  -->  00:05:21,833
I hadn't thought about when I just went
and dragged that in to my start scene.
98

98

00:05:21,833  -->  00:05:28,080
So let's go to our start scene, or
now scenes, start screen in here.
99

99

00:05:28,080  -->  00:05:30,930
So here's my challenge for you,
what is the best way for us to fix this?
100

100

00:05:30,930  -->  00:05:35,461
How do we resolve our issue with the fact
that the LevelController is looking for
101

101

00:05:35,461  -->  00:05:37,363
our win label and our lose label?
102

102

00:05:37,363  -->  00:05:40,107
This, if you're understanding what
we're talking about this should be
103

103

00:05:40,107  -->  00:05:40,822
a pretty easy fix.
104

104

00:05:40,822  -->  00:05:44,060
But just take a moment to have
a think about how we can resolve this.
105

105

00:05:45,611  -->  00:05:49,251
Okay, well, the best way to resolve this
is to not have the LevelController script
106

106

00:05:49,251  -->  00:05:51,130
at all because I don't think we need that.
107

107

00:05:51,130  -->  00:05:54,850
We're just needing to load the levels,
not control the levels.
108

108

00:05:54,850  -->  00:05:57,013
This is not game play.
109

109

00:05:57,013  -->  00:06:01,524
So I think what we can do here,
instead of using the LevelController,
110

110

00:06:01,524  -->  00:06:04,974
let's say we've already
prefabbed a LevelLoader.
111

111

00:06:04,974  -->  00:06:06,814
We have already prefabbed a LevelLoader,
112

112

00:06:06,814  -->  00:06:09,530
which is just a game object that
has a LevelLoader script on it.
113

113

00:06:09,530  -->  00:06:13,831
So I'm gonna drag that into my stat scene
and just delete the LevelController.
114

114

00:06:13,831  -->  00:06:17,321
Now we need to get back to our canvas, the
start text is going to be a bit broken.
115

115

00:06:17,321  -->  00:06:22,273
So we need to drag in the LevelLoader
into the missing object, and
116

116

00:06:22,273  -->  00:06:27,690
change this to be LevelLoader,
change this to be start, where are we?
117

117

00:06:27,690  -->  00:06:33,203
LoadNextScene, and then the quick text,
once again, drag in the LevelLoader,
118

118

00:06:33,203  -->  00:06:38,420
MissingObject, and LevelLoader,
this is going to be QuitGame.
119

119

00:06:38,420  -->  00:06:41,683
Okay, so I'm not gonna pretend
that I did that deliberately,
120

120

00:06:41,683  -->  00:06:44,650
put in the LevelController
instead of the LevelLoader.
121

121

00:06:44,650  -->  00:06:47,730
I did that accidentally, but
the console let me know, hey, Rick,
122

122

00:06:47,730  -->  00:06:52,540
you've made a mistake because we don't
know what to assign the win label as.
123

123

00:06:52,540  -->  00:06:55,793
So now when I save this up, click on play.
124

124

00:06:58,970  -->  00:07:01,572
We should no longer be getting that
particular error, which is great.

125

00:07:01,572  -->  00:07:03,404
Start the game, play it a little bit,
126

126

00:07:03,404  -->  00:07:06,400
make sure we don't get any other
errors going on, try again.
127

127

00:07:06,400  -->  00:07:11,120
Okay, and it's clear of errors, and
clear of warnings as well at the moment.
128

128

00:07:11,120  -->  00:07:14,335
That should give you a big [SOUND]
state of feeling good about that
129

129

00:07:14,335  -->  00:07:16,892
when you don't have any errors and
any warnings.
130

130

00:07:16,892  -->  00:07:19,662
I recommend you try to smash
them as soon as you are able to.
131

131

00:07:19,662  -->  00:07:22,166
Don't drop everything if you
are in the middle of a feature,
132

132

00:07:22,166  -->  00:07:23,890
in the middle of something heavy.
133

133

00:07:23,890  -->  00:07:29,120
Don't go and chase bugs and warnings and
errors until it's the right time for you.
134

134

00:07:29,120  -->  00:07:32,350
But don't leave them more than
a very short amount of time before
135

135

00:07:32,350  -->  00:07:33,510
you go and address them.
136

136

00:07:33,510  -->  00:07:36,410
So we've talked a little bit
about null reference exceptions.
137

137

00:07:36,410  -->  00:07:40,440
It's because Unity is trying to find
a reference to something which it cannot.
138

138

00:07:40,440  -->  00:07:45,410
So reference to a variable that you're
saying should exist, but it does not.
139

139

00:07:45,410  -->  00:07:48,710
It's saying it's null and
that null can cause warnings and issues.
140

140

00:07:48,710  -->  00:07:51,330
So great work, well done, and
I'll see you in the next video.
