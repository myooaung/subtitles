[MUSIC]

2

00:00:04,792  -->  00:00:06,203
Now that we've got our title map set out,
3

3

00:00:06,203  -->  00:00:08,191
we need to turn our attention
to game play functionality.
4

4

00:00:08,191  -->  00:00:12,531
We need to have our player run around,
to jump, to climb ladders,
5

5

00:00:12,531  -->  00:00:16,740
to collide with things and
possibly die, lose health.
6

6

00:00:16,740  -->  00:00:19,066
We need to have coin pickups
that increase score.
7

7

00:00:19,066  -->  00:00:21,204
Need to think about enemies,
having them move around,
8

8

00:00:21,204  -->  00:00:23,280
how do we have them
stay on their platform?
9

9

00:00:23,280  -->  00:00:27,088
And in particular, to have a look at what
happens when the player reaches the next
10

10

00:00:27,088  -->  00:00:28,883
level, or has to load the next scene.
11

11

00:00:28,883  -->  00:00:29,953
What is persisted?
12

12

00:00:29,953  -->  00:00:30,736
What do we destroy?
13

13

00:00:30,736  -->  00:00:32,278
What do we not destroy?
14

14

00:00:32,278  -->  00:00:35,575
And look at how the code
architecture all fits together.
15

15

00:00:35,575  -->  00:00:39,989
Together in a way which is very readable
and very usable and very scalable.
16

16

00:00:39,989  -->  00:00:43,729
And so Ben and I have been prototyping a
lot of that and have come up with a lot of
17

17

00:00:43,729  -->  00:00:47,647
really good answers after going through
two or three or four ways of doing that to
18

18

00:00:47,647  -->  00:00:51,265
give you the cleanest outcome for
our particular solution to that.
19

19

00:00:51,265  -->  00:00:55,827
And what I wanted to challenge you in
this video was to make sure you stop and
20

20

00:00:55,827  -->  00:00:59,524
try to figure things out yourself,
and make the mistakes.
21

21

00:00:59,524  -->  00:01:02,511
And to do things differently
to the way that we do them, so
22

22

00:01:02,511  -->  00:01:06,618
that when we come up with the solution,
you can look at it and say, how does that
23

23

00:01:06,618  -->  00:01:11,300
differ to what I was going to do, which is
better to have an opinion on these things.
24

24

00:01:11,300  -->  00:01:14,749
And this is what's gonna really
strengthen you as a programmer and
25

25

00:01:14,749  -->  00:01:15,865
as a game developer.
26

26

00:01:15,865  -->  00:01:19,980
Don't just follow what we're doing or
else you won't get the learning.
27

27

00:01:19,980  -->  00:01:21,418
It won't embed in there.
28

28

00:01:21,418  -->  00:01:24,450
You won't get to the point where you
can create this yourself independently.
29

29

00:01:24,450  -->  00:01:29,073
We've talked about a spiral syllabus a
number of times where we start off simple
30

30

00:01:29,073  -->  00:01:33,489
and then we layer on top of that but
we keep doing those early principles, and
31

31

00:01:33,489  -->  00:01:36,803
keep adding those early
lessons into what we're doing.
32

32

00:01:36,803  -->  00:01:39,689
And in this section there's gonna be
a lot of things that you've done already,
33

33

00:01:39,689  -->  00:01:42,330
you've seen already we've done it once or
we've done it twice.
34

34

00:01:42,330  -->  00:01:46,228
And I'm gonna be challenging you to do
it yourself independently before seeing
35

35

00:01:46,228  -->  00:01:46,877
the answer.
36

36

00:01:46,877  -->  00:01:51,014
So if you're like me, and here's
a confession time, if you're like me,
37

37

00:01:51,014  -->  00:01:53,410
you tend to go through these courses.
38

38

00:01:53,410  -->  00:01:56,400
And someone says, here's a challenge for
you, you have a quick think about it and
39

39

00:01:56,400  -->  00:01:59,107
if you know how to do it, you think,
yeah, I'll do that, not a problem.
40

40

00:01:59,107  -->  00:02:02,674
If its a little bit challenging
you say well, I want a learning so
41

41

00:02:02,674  -->  00:02:04,259
I just wanna see the answer,
42

42

00:02:04,259  -->  00:02:09,290
once I've got the answer that would make
me smarter because I have that knowledge.
43

43

00:02:09,290  -->  00:02:11,988
And it is more complex
than that if you just get
44

44

00:02:11,988  -->  00:02:16,110
the answer you don't go through
process the good learning process.
45

45

00:02:16,110  -->  00:02:20,274
The structured discipline practice
of trying to figure it out yourself,
46

46

00:02:20,274  -->  00:02:22,570
which is where you really really learn.
47

47

00:02:22,570  -->  00:02:26,106
So if you've been cruising through
the challenges, if you've been cruising
48

48

00:02:26,106  -->  00:02:29,171
through the course, if you've
just been watching and observing.
49

49

00:02:29,171  -->  00:02:33,260
Now is the time for you to step it up and
to take on the challenges.
50

50

00:02:33,260  -->  00:02:37,644
And really push yourself to try to figure
it out before we give you the answer.
51

51

00:02:37,644  -->  00:02:40,640
And on top of all that,
I'm super excited by this section.
52

52

00:02:40,640  -->  00:02:41,886
We're gonna make a really fun game.
53

53

00:02:41,886  -->  00:02:44,886
We'll have some really tight code
architecture by the end of it.
54

54

00:02:44,886  -->  00:02:47,870
So let's keep pushing on and
let's get our player moving.
