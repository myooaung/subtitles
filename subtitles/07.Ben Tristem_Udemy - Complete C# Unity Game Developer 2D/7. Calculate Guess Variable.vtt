00:00:04.110  -->  00:00:07.070
Hello again, in this video we're
going to be accurately calculating
2

2

00:00:07.070  -->  00:00:10.840
our guess when we push up, up, up, up,
you'll see that it's heading up and
3

3

00:00:10.840  -->  00:00:12.720
down, down, down,
it heads back down again.
4

4

00:00:12.720  -->  00:00:16.170
We'll fix a bug to do with the guesses
not going all the way up to the 1,000.
5

5

00:00:16.170  -->  00:00:20.200
And we'll tidy up the way that we're
greeting our player, and the text that we
6

6

00:00:20.200  -->  00:00:24.897
have in relation to the guest, we make
sure that the text all makes sense.
7

7

00:00:24.897  -->  00:00:26.592
So, let's get cracking.
8

8

00:00:26.592  -->  00:00:30.986
I'm starting to see a few more questions
in our Q &amp; A sections about how codes and
9

9

00:00:30.986  -->  00:00:33.873
people are missing their
braces not knowing exactly
10

10

00:00:33.873  -->  00:00:37.840
where to put the semi colons and
looking for a point of comparison.
11

11

00:00:37.840  -->  00:00:42.040
So I'll remind you again about our
GitHub repo that we have available.
12

12

00:00:42.040  -->  00:00:46.560
If you are in any of our lectures, and let
me just go grab the previous lecture that
13

13

00:00:46.560  -->  00:00:51.010
we just had, up on the top left,
you'll see the three little lines up here.
14

14

00:00:51.010  -->  00:00:53.430
You click on that,
it gives every single one of our lectures.
15

15

00:00:53.430  -->  00:00:56.240
You'll see something called
lecture project changes.
16

16

00:00:56.240  -->  00:01:00.250
If you click on that,
it will take you to our GitHub repository.
17

17

00:01:00.250  -->  00:01:01.020
This is all free.
18

18

00:01:01.020  -->  00:01:02.100
You don't need to log in.
19

19

00:01:02.100  -->  00:01:05.860
It's all public and it's where we
put our code and our code changes.
20

20

00:01:05.860  -->  00:01:09.920
So the lecture that we're going through,
Scope And Context Of Variables,
21

21

00:01:09.920  -->  00:01:13.920
you can see there's a Scope And
Context Of Variables and
22

22

00:01:13.920  -->  00:01:17.240
then all of the changes that we've
made in our various documents.
23

23

00:01:17.240  -->  00:01:20.724
So the document here, we're looking at
the first one, is our numberwizard.cs,
24

24

00:01:20.724  -->  00:01:22.039
the script we're working in.
25

25

00:01:22.039  -->  00:01:25.500
Anything that's in red has been changed or
deleted.
26

26

00:01:25.500  -->  00:01:27.500
Anything that is in green has been added.
27

27

00:01:27.500  -->  00:01:30.130
So you can see,
that's exactly what rick or
28

28

00:01:30.130  -->  00:01:32.898
bin has updated in that particular video.
29

29

00:01:32.898  -->  00:01:34.316
They added max = guess.
30

30

00:01:34.316  -->  00:01:35.707
I thought it was something else.
31

31

00:01:35.707  -->  00:01:38.050
So you can see exactly what we added or
removed.
32

32

00:01:38.050  -->  00:01:39.960
And then also you can see
the changes we might have,
33

33

00:01:39.960  -->  00:01:44.380
readme file down here in each video,
also has a readme that we put against it.
34

34

00:01:44.380  -->  00:01:47.120
You can navigate around a little bit more
if you come back up to the top click on
35

35

00:01:47.120  -->  00:01:49.220
browse files.
36

36

00:01:49.220  -->  00:01:52.240
This is where you see our project
state right at the moment,
37

37

00:01:52.240  -->  00:01:55.150
right as it is for
this particular lecture.
38

38

00:01:55.150  -->  00:01:59.720
So every lecture, it takes a snap
shot of the state of our project.
39

39

00:01:59.720  -->  00:02:02.860
If we click on number wizard console,
that's the name of our project.
40

40

00:02:02.860  -->  00:02:05.840
Assets, that's the directory
that we're working in.
41

41

00:02:05.840  -->  00:02:09.220
Just jump back over to Unity for a second,
so we're now at assets folder here.
42

42

00:02:11.470  -->  00:02:13.400
And we're working a number of wizard dots,
so
43

43

00:02:13.400  -->  00:02:17.380
if you click on that then you'll
see the script in its entirety
44

44

00:02:17.380  -->  00:02:20.730
as it is right at that point in
time as we finish the lecture.
45

45

00:02:20.730  -->  00:02:25.210
So if you get completely lost like nothing
is working at all here, you could totally
46

46

00:02:25.210  -->  00:02:31.340
go and copy out entire script here and
then paste that into your script and
47

47

00:02:31.340  -->  00:02:34.270
you would have exactly what we
had if you wanted to do that.
48

48

00:02:34.270  -->  00:02:36.030
Or you can describe
a certain part of it and
49

49

00:02:36.030  -->  00:02:39.000
compare how say our start
method to your stop method.
50

50

00:02:39.000  -->  00:02:41.690
So that's how you can catch up if
there is any issues or problems or
51

51

00:02:41.690  -->  00:02:46.230
you wanna know exactly what we're working
on, we give you absolutely everything or
52

52

00:02:46.230  -->  00:02:50.540
as much everything as we can get
away with through our GitHub reaper.
53

53

00:02:50.540  -->  00:02:55.300
Now for our mission in this video
we're going to be calculating
54

54

00:02:55.300  -->  00:02:58.490
the guess by using our
min plus max divided
55

55

00:02:58.490  -->  00:03:00.880
by two that we talked about
a bunch in the previous video.
56

56

00:03:00.880  -->  00:03:03.470
So I've now done an update method, update.
57

57

00:03:03.470  -->  00:03:05.650
It's probably an update, not update.
58

58

00:03:05.650  -->  00:03:07.080
Update method down here.
59

59

00:03:07.080  -->  00:03:10.720
And we say that min = guess
cuz we establish the fact that
60

60

00:03:10.720  -->  00:03:14.660
when a player makes a guess,
if they've pushed up, they're saying.
61

61

00:03:14.660  -->  00:03:16.970
Sorry, when the player makes a guess,
but when we've made a guess and
62

62

00:03:16.970  -->  00:03:19.890
the player is saying whether it's
correct or not, if the player pushes
63

63

00:03:19.890  -->  00:03:24.820
up it says that, our guess was too low so
that now becomes our minimum.
64

64

00:03:24.820  -->  00:03:28.480
If we've guessed it 500 and the place
was wow, it was higher than that,
65

65

00:03:28.480  -->  00:03:31.820
now our minimum is 500 as per our guess.
66

66

00:03:31.820  -->  00:03:37.639
We can add another line after
67

67

00:03:37.639  -->  00:03:42.730
this where we say guess =
68

68

00:03:42.730  -->  00:03:47.588
(max + min) / 2;.
69

69

00:03:47.588  -->  00:03:51.236
So, what we're saying here is that our
guess is the maximum plus the minimum
70

70

00:03:51.236  -->  00:03:51.985
divided by 2.
71

71

00:03:51.985  -->  00:03:53.015
We've talked about that a bunch,
72

72

00:03:53.015  -->  00:03:56.745
that's the mid point we're intersecting
in-between our potential guesses.
73

73

00:03:56.745  -->  00:03:57.505
So what's going on here?
74

74

00:03:57.505  -->  00:04:01.445
We're saying that minimum equals guess but
guess equals something else,
75

75

00:04:01.445  -->  00:04:02.245
can we do that?
76

76

00:04:02.245  -->  00:04:06.685
Yes, we can because within
our if statement here,
77

77

00:04:06.685  -->  00:04:11.735
our lines, our statements are going
to be executed one at a time and
78

78

00:04:11.735  -->  00:04:13.960
unity is gonna look at it and
say, okay, I'll do that.
79

79

00:04:13.960  -->  00:04:15.490
Then I'll do this, then I'll do this,
80

80

00:04:15.490  -->  00:04:18.230
then I'll do this,
going through this if statement.
81

81

00:04:18.230  -->  00:04:19.890
So min is going to store.
82

82

00:04:19.890  -->  00:04:21.880
Remember, it's variable, it's like a box.
83

83

00:04:21.880  -->  00:04:24.790
It's going to store what we tell it,
which is guess.
84

84

00:04:24.790  -->  00:04:28.760
We know the value for
guess is 500 and then, we say, okay.
85

85

00:04:28.760  -->  00:04:30.500
Now there's a new guess.
86

86

00:04:30.500  -->  00:04:33.240
There's a new value we
want to give to guess.
87

87

00:04:33.240  -->  00:04:37.700
So whatever is on the right is
going to be assigned to guess.
88

88

00:04:37.700  -->  00:04:39.190
And on the right is the max + min.
89

89

00:04:39.190  -->  00:04:42.910
The maximum is whatever it was currently.
90

90

00:04:42.910  -->  00:04:45.740
Currently it's 1000 plus minimum.
91

91

00:04:45.740  -->  00:04:49.290
We've just defined that minimum
here is 500 divided by 2.
92

92

00:04:49.290  -->  00:04:52.470
So our next guess would be 750.
93

93

00:04:52.470  -->  00:04:55.970
Okay, so that's our logic there for
updating what the guess is.
94

94

00:04:55.970  -->  00:05:01.958
We can do exactly the same down in our
down arrow between max = guess and
95

95

00:05:01.958  -->  00:05:03.185
debug.log.
96

96

00:05:03.185  -->  00:05:08.790
We're going to say guess
= (max + min) / 2,
97

97

00:05:08.790  -->  00:05:13.576
we could have just copied and
pasted it but
98

98

00:05:13.576  -->  00:05:18.520
it's good to practice that typing there.
99

99

00:05:18.520  -->  00:05:22.590
So we've got the same situation
were we're recalculating the guess.
100

100

00:05:22.590  -->  00:05:24.860
In this case we're redefining what min is,
101

101

00:05:24.860  -->  00:05:27.930
in this case we're redefining what
max is based on what was pressed.
102

102

00:05:27.930  -->  00:05:31.990
Let's save that and back into unity and
see what we get from doing that.
103

103

00:05:31.990  -->  00:05:36.782
Lets click on play and
we can see if we push up,
104

104

00:05:36.782  -->  00:05:41.587
it says 750, 875, 937, 968.
105

105

00:05:41.587  -->  00:05:47.470
If we push down, 976, 972, 970, 969, 968,
and it's settled on 968 as the guess.
106

106

00:05:49.110  -->  00:05:51.670
Very cool.
107

107

00:05:51.670  -->  00:05:55.482
Get out of player and click play again
which will clear this on it's load and
108

108

00:05:55.482  -->  00:05:58.463
we'll just see the edge cases
will push up, up, up, up.
109

109

00:05:58.463  -->  00:06:03.019
And it might [LAUGH] be going into up,
up, up, up, up and to 999, we'll get to
110

110

00:06:03.019  -->  00:06:07.570
that in a moment, that's our first bug,
very exciting for our first bug.
111

111

00:06:07.570  -->  00:06:11.840
And if we stop and then push play again.
112

112

00:06:11.840  -->  00:06:15.688
Remember to click in the game window if
you've clicked out of it pushing down go
113

113

00:06:15.688  -->  00:06:18.037
down down down down down
all the way down to one.
114

114

00:06:18.037  -->  00:06:21.862
Ok, so it's working on the down, it's not
working on the up, so it's working in
115

115

00:06:21.862  -->  00:06:25.311
general which is fantastic, we do have
a bug let's go in and fix that bug.
116

116

00:06:25.311  -->  00:06:31.133
So the problem is that it's not
making all the way up to 1,000 so
117

117

00:06:31.133  -->  00:06:38.100
all we need to do down here in our start
method, max = max + 1, to a space there.
118

118

00:06:38.100  -->  00:06:42.767
And this is another cool thing that we
can assign a variable as itself plus 1.
119

119

00:06:42.767  -->  00:06:47.798
So at this current point in time,
max is 1000,
120

120

00:06:47.798  -->  00:06:51.620
so saying you are going to be 1000 plus 1,
121

121

00:06:51.620  -->  00:06:56.130
so your new assignment is 1001.
122

122

00:06:56.130  -->  00:06:59.700
Okay, so we've said max = max
+ 1 in our start method here.
123

123

00:06:59.700  -->  00:07:03.060
Save this, back over into unity,
we'll see how well this worked.
124

124

00:07:03.060  -->  00:07:07.533
Click on play, if we can push this up, up,
up all the way and make it up to 1,000.
125

125

00:07:07.533  -->  00:07:11.189
[SOUND] There we go,
we've made it up to 1,000.
126

126

00:07:11.189  -->  00:07:13.320
There's one thing that I want
you to do as a challenge.
127

127

00:07:13.320  -->  00:07:15.880
It's not a code challenge
in this particular video,
128

128

00:07:15.880  -->  00:07:19.560
it is a tidy up your text challenge.
129

129

00:07:19.560  -->  00:07:21.430
So update your text to have it make sense.
130

130

00:07:21.430  -->  00:07:24.080
Be creative, let me just remind
you what I'm talking about here.
131

131

00:07:24.080  -->  00:07:28.630
So instead of saying up arrow was pressed
we wanna say, is your guess higher or
132

132

00:07:28.630  -->  00:07:30.770
lower than such and such a thing.
133

133

00:07:30.770  -->  00:07:34.130
Also in here we wanna say,
is it lower than and
134

134

00:07:34.130  -->  00:07:37.990
pass in this variable here
as we did with min and max.
135

135

00:07:37.990  -->  00:07:41.706
Also what I'm really looking for
is you to put a little bit more flavor
136

136

00:07:41.706  -->  00:07:45.057
into the way that you,
as a player what to do and to greet them.
137

137

00:07:45.057  -->  00:07:49.319
And to make sure that everything makes
sense and as a final step on our community
138

138

00:07:49.319  -->  00:07:52.300
share, I would like you to
share your local greeting.
139

139

00:07:52.300  -->  00:07:53.480
What do I mean by that?
140

140

00:07:53.480  -->  00:07:59.099
Well, I'm gonna come up here right at the
very start for, Welcome to number wizard,
141

141

00:07:59.099  -->  00:08:03.860
yo, that's not really how I speak
being Australians, I'm gonna say,
142

142

00:08:03.860  -->  00:08:08.309
G'day mate, welcome to numba,
[LAUGH] that's kinda how we say it,
143

143

00:08:08.309  -->  00:08:12.850
wiz-ud, that how we say it as well,
that's pretty good.
144

144

00:08:12.850  -->  00:08:14.780
G'day mate, welcome to numba wiz-ud.
145

145

00:08:14.780  -->  00:08:18.497
So if you're from France, maybe you'll put
a bit of a bonjour in there, if you're
146

146

00:08:18.497  -->  00:08:22.287
from England, you'll say something
particularly charming and witty, no doubt.
147

147

00:08:22.287  -->  00:08:24.737
And, to just do something with
a little bit of flavor and
148

148

00:08:24.737  -->  00:08:26.020
a little bit of character.
149

149

00:08:26.020  -->  00:08:30.080
And then, as I showed you before when
we're looking at the top left up
150

150

00:08:30.080  -->  00:08:33.090
here about any of our videos,
any of the lectures,
151

151

00:08:33.090  -->  00:08:35.680
you'll see this lecture's discussions.
152

152

00:08:35.680  -->  00:08:39.871
If you click on that, that will take you
to the link where people are discussing
153

153

00:08:39.871  -->  00:08:41.900
about this particular lecture.
154

154

00:08:41.900  -->  00:08:44.820
So it will take you to the link for the
lecture we're currently on at the moment.
155

155

00:08:44.820  -->  00:08:46.890
Throw in there what do you like to say.
156

156

00:08:46.890  -->  00:08:47.760
Show us your greeting.
157

157

00:08:47.760  -->  00:08:50.110
Be it a little bit witty or
not is up to you.
158

158

00:08:50.110  -->  00:08:53.160
And I look forward to ring that and
seeing how you would say hello and
159

159

00:08:53.160  -->  00:08:54.900
good day in your local greeting.
160

160

00:08:54.900  -->  00:08:56.970
So this is your challenge
a couple of steps to,
161

161

00:08:56.970  -->  00:08:58.450
I've given you a lot to work through.
162

162

00:08:58.450  -->  00:08:59.450
Give it your best shot and
163

163

00:08:59.450  -->  00:09:02.180
I'll see you back in here in a moment and
I'll show you what I've done.
164

164

00:09:04.495  -->  00:09:06.590
G'day and welcome back.
165

165

00:09:06.590  -->  00:09:09.570
I'm gonna start by,
I've already put in my good day up here,
166

166

00:09:09.570  -->  00:09:11.290
this all looks not too bad.
167

167

00:09:11.290  -->  00:09:14.740
I'm going to change this here higher or
lower than.
168

168

00:09:14.740  -->  00:09:17.300
This will be our first time
of saying to the player,
169

169

00:09:17.300  -->  00:09:21.010
then leave a space add a plus there.
170

170

00:09:21.010  -->  00:09:22.050
Then what are we doing?
171

171

00:09:22.050  -->  00:09:24.660
We're doing guess, okay,
higher or lower than guess.
172

172

00:09:24.660  -->  00:09:28.630
We initialize guess at 500, so
this first time it should say 500.
173

173

00:09:28.630  -->  00:09:30.110
Just gonna save that.
174

174

00:09:30.110  -->  00:09:33.020
Okay, so
there are our initial instructions.
175

175

00:09:33.020  -->  00:09:35.890
Then when we are pushing up,
we want to say,
176

176

00:09:35.890  -->  00:09:38.950
I don't think we need to have this debug
anymore of Up Arrow was pressed, but
177

177

00:09:38.950  -->  00:09:44.154
I'm gonna cut that, put it down below my
guess calculations, paste it in here.
178

178

00:09:44.154  -->  00:09:47.160
And say again,
179

179

00:09:47.160  -->  00:09:52.248
let see ("Is it higher or
180

180

00:09:52.248  -->  00:09:58.740
lower than..." + guess).
181

181

00:09:58.740  -->  00:10:00.230
Why did I not put it above?
182

182

00:10:00.230  -->  00:10:05.910
Well, so we put out text here at the top
of our if statement then it will be
183

183

00:10:05.910  -->  00:10:10.220
using whatever value of guess it currently
has before we do this calculation.
184

184

00:10:10.220  -->  00:10:12.980
We wanted to do this calculation and
then say, is it higher or
185

185

00:10:12.980  -->  00:10:14.520
lower than this thing here.
186

186

00:10:14.520  -->  00:10:19.150
So it's important to know that all
that matters in this context, so
187

187

00:10:19.150  -->  00:10:22.089
I've got min=guess and then plus guess.
188

188

00:10:22.089  -->  00:10:25.153
I don't this second debug now cuz
we are saying guest just here,
189

189

00:10:25.153  -->  00:10:26.410
tidy that up a little bit.
190

190

00:10:26.410  -->  00:10:31.507
I will copy this cuz it's gonna be
exactly the same copy that put it down,
191

191

00:10:31.507  -->  00:10:36.375
replace my Debug.log down here, so
I just pasted that over the top.
192

192

00:10:36.375  -->  00:10:40.744
We don't need this press the arrow or
you push the up arrow key,
193

193

00:10:40.744  -->  00:10:46.020
I have min = guess, guess equals this and
then debug, is this correct?
194

194

00:10:46.020  -->  00:10:48.560
Max, guess, and then the same again.
195

195

00:10:48.560  -->  00:10:52.150
Excellent so and
down here I'll put in the text now.
196

196

00:10:52.150  -->  00:10:54.070
We haven't got to the point
where this is working nice and
197

197

00:10:54.070  -->  00:10:58.040
cleanly but I'll say you know,
it's about me, isn't it?
198

198

00:10:58.040  -->  00:10:59.270
I am a genius.
199

199

00:10:59.270  -->  00:11:02.410
If you get it correct, then I'm a genius.
200

200

00:11:02.410  -->  00:11:04.120
So our game is coming
together really well.
201

201

00:11:04.120  -->  00:11:07.250
In this video we have added
a tighter calculation for
202

202

00:11:07.250  -->  00:11:11.950
guess, we've talked a little bit about the
execution order of statements within our
203

203

00:11:11.950  -->  00:11:16.140
code block here, and we have spent some
time just making our text a little
204

204

00:11:16.140  -->  00:11:18.670
bit nicer making our game
a little bit more structured.
205

205

00:11:18.670  -->  00:11:21.010
In the next video we will
be talking about methods or
206

206

00:11:21.010  -->  00:11:25.680
functions and making out game have a game
loop on it so that we can replay it.
207

207

00:11:25.680  -->  00:11:29.030
Right, we will work on this video and
I will see you in the next one.
