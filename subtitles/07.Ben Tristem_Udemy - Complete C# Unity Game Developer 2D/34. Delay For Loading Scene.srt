1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:06,797
[SOUND] In this lecture,
we're gonna be implementing a delay.
2

2

00:00:06,797  -->  00:00:10,913
So that when the player happens to
die by crashing in to an enemy or
3

3

00:00:10,913  -->  00:00:15,429
any other way, we have a delay,
then we trigger our Game Over screen.
4

4

00:00:15,429  -->  00:00:19,410
So let's jump in and
make a little bit of Game Over magic.
5

5

00:00:19,410  -->  00:00:22,800
Before we do that, I'm first gonna tidy
up my enemy spawning a little bit.
6

6

00:00:22,800  -->  00:00:26,260
And have that the enemy do damage
the player when the collide.
7

7

00:00:26,260  -->  00:00:27,870
First of all,
I have to look at my spawner.
8

8

00:00:27,870  -->  00:00:31,865
So I'm over in my game scene,
enemy spawner have two waves.
9

9

00:00:31,865  -->  00:00:36,670
I'm gonna change this to four, cuz I've
created four waves at the moment, four.
10

10

00:00:36,670  -->  00:00:42,550
And then Wave 1, Wave 2,
I'll make Wave 3, and Wave 4.
11

11

00:00:42,550  -->  00:00:44,370
Just so
I've got a little bit more variation.
12

12

00:00:44,370  -->  00:00:48,750
And then Wave 3 and
4 I think are triggering Bernard.
13

13

00:00:48,750  -->  00:00:52,584
So you know what I'm gonna do, I'll just
switch this up, Wave 3, and then Wave 2.
14

14

00:00:52,584  -->  00:00:53,460
Do it however you like.
15

15

00:00:53,460  -->  00:00:57,460
I'm just, I know that my Wave 1 is
Roger and Wave 3 is Bernard and
16

16

00:00:57,460  -->  00:00:59,380
Wave 2 is Roger and so on.
17

17

00:00:59,380  -->  00:01:03,090
So if I show you that just very briefly,
Wave 1 is Roger, and
18

18

00:01:03,090  -->  00:01:08,915
Wave 2 is also Roger, Wave 3 is Bernard,
and Wave 4 is Bernard, okay.
19

19

00:01:08,915  -->  00:01:10,966
Just so I've got some variation there.
20

20

00:01:10,966  -->  00:01:15,102
Now what I wanna do is have a look
at my prefabs for my enemies and
21

21

00:01:15,102  -->  00:01:17,101
we'll see what's going on.
22

22

00:01:17,101  -->  00:01:19,515
We're currently just passing
straight through the enemy.
23

23

00:01:19,515  -->  00:01:22,331
So I need to change it so
that we bump into them.
24

24

00:01:22,331  -->  00:01:23,572
To do that we need two things.
25

25

00:01:23,572  -->  00:01:27,189
So I'm gonna highlight both of my enemies,
Roger and Bernard.
26

26

00:01:27,189  -->  00:01:29,390
So I've control clicked on both of them.
27

27

00:01:29,390  -->  00:01:30,854
So I've got the two selected at once.
28

28

00:01:30,854  -->  00:01:33,808
Just gonna close up the enemy scripts so
I've got a bit of room here.
29

29

00:01:33,808  -->  00:01:35,901
And I'll add components at the same time.
30

30

00:01:35,901  -->  00:01:39,270
So if you've got two things selected
you can click add component.
31

31

00:01:39,270  -->  00:01:45,650
And then what I want to
do is add a rigid body 2D
32

32

00:01:45,650  -->  00:01:50,720
to both of these and then change
the rigid body 2D to be kinematic.
33

33

00:01:50,720  -->  00:01:53,830
Okay, and then the last thing I
need to do in here I believe,
34

34

00:01:53,830  -->  00:01:57,735
who am I selected on, if I select
Roger I can see Roger has a collider.
35

35

00:01:57,735  -->  00:02:00,890
I'll make that collider a trigger,
the circle collider is a trigger.
36

36

00:02:00,890  -->  00:02:04,160
I'm gonna right click on the circle
collider copy component.
37

37

00:02:04,160  -->  00:02:07,260
Jump over to Bernard because I
realize that Bernard doesn't even have
38

38

00:02:07,260  -->  00:02:08,430
a collider on him.
39

39

00:02:08,430  -->  00:02:11,350
So what we can do now that we've
copied the component just right click
40

40

00:02:11,350  -->  00:02:13,980
on any of the components,
paste component as new.
41

41

00:02:13,980  -->  00:02:18,360
And that will paste in this circle
collider component from before.
42

42

00:02:18,360  -->  00:02:22,650
Let's click on Play, just see now
if we can bump into the Rogers and
43

43

00:02:22,650  -->  00:02:23,680
Bernards of the world.
44

44

00:02:23,680  -->  00:02:27,520
Okay, so we've got this, it's a little bit
boring, what I've set up for my things.
45

45

00:02:27,520  -->  00:02:29,640
Okay, we're not bumping into them,
why is that?
46

46

00:02:29,640  -->  00:02:32,750
That's because we haven't
added the script or
47

47

00:02:32,750  -->  00:02:35,870
the component as the script,
that allows us to do damage.
48

48

00:02:35,870  -->  00:02:40,240
So again select Bernard,
select Roger, and then Add Component.
49

49

00:02:41,280  -->  00:02:44,260
We need to add,
what is this, Damage Dealer.
50

50

00:02:44,260  -->  00:02:47,280
Okay, Damage Dealer, and
now they should be doing damage.
51

51

00:02:47,280  -->  00:02:49,803
I'll add this, I'll increase this to 200.
52

52

00:02:49,803  -->  00:02:51,986
I think, so if you bump into an enemy,
you die instantly.
53

53

00:02:51,986  -->  00:02:52,980
The player's got 200 health.
54

54

00:02:52,980  -->  00:02:55,110
Right now I can see we've got
an error down the bottom.
55

55

00:02:55,110  -->  00:02:56,490
We should always have a look at those.
56

56

00:02:56,490  -->  00:02:59,110
Variable projectile of enemy
has not been assigned,
57

57

00:02:59,110  -->  00:03:02,290
that's because Bernard we haven't really
set Bernard up with anything, have we?
58

58

00:03:02,290  -->  00:03:05,137
If we go and
open up Bernard's enemy script.
59

59

00:03:05,137  -->  00:03:07,657
I can see that we need to say
what the projectile is, so
60

60

00:03:07,657  -->  00:03:09,845
I'll click on my select there,
Enemy Laser.
61

61

00:03:09,845  -->  00:03:14,375
Need to see what the Death VFX are, so
I'm gonna say the Explosion Particle.
62

62

00:03:14,375  -->  00:03:19,111
And what is the Death Sound,
I'll say Death Effect.
63

63

00:03:19,111  -->  00:03:21,795
And then I'll say what's
the Shoot Sound We'll say, I don't know,
64

64

00:03:21,795  -->  00:03:23,950
laser6, we'll do something,
we'll be different.
65

65

00:03:23,950  -->  00:03:26,070
Don't know what that sounds like,
but we'll give it a shot.
66

66

00:03:26,070  -->  00:03:27,710
So that should all be reasonably good.
67

67

00:03:27,710  -->  00:03:32,000
The last thing I'll do in here is, I think
I have my Waves a little bit boring.
68

68

00:03:32,000  -->  00:03:35,977
So I'm gonna just change these
back to Wave 1, Wave 2, Wave 3,
69

69

00:03:35,977  -->  00:03:38,335
Wave 4, and we'll see how that goes.
70

70

00:03:38,335  -->  00:03:39,974
Doesn't really matter at the moment,
71

71

00:03:39,974  -->  00:03:42,918
I'm nowhere near the point where
I'm polishing and tuning my waves.
72

72

00:03:42,918  -->  00:03:45,314
I'm just making sure that it
gives a little bit of variety.
73

73

00:03:45,314  -->  00:03:48,325
So we're not doing the same over and
over in our game.
74

74

00:03:48,325  -->  00:03:50,268
Okay, and out they come [SOUND].
75

75

00:03:50,268  -->  00:03:52,100
Yes, I can crash into to Bernard.
76

76

00:03:52,100  -->  00:03:54,998
And I'm guessing I can
also crash into Roger.
77

77

00:03:54,998  -->  00:03:59,881
I'm really curious, if you wanna
leave a comment in the discussion,
78

78

00:03:59,881  -->  00:04:02,630
what have you named your enemies?
79

79

00:04:02,630  -->  00:04:04,702
Have you just gone with Bernard and
Roger as I have, or
80

80

00:04:04,702  -->  00:04:07,854
have you done something more interesting,
have you come up with your own names?
81

81

00:04:07,854  -->  00:04:10,900
I'm just gonna clear this in the console,
cuz that error is not happening anymore.
82

82

00:04:10,900  -->  00:04:11,830
I just wanna clear it away.
83

83

00:04:11,830  -->  00:04:16,758
Okay, so yeah, let me know, let us all
know what are you naming your enemies,
84

84

00:04:16,758  -->  00:04:17,663
if anything.
85

85

00:04:17,663  -->  00:04:19,956
Okay, now let's introduce a delay and
86

86

00:04:19,956  -->  00:04:24,001
we'll load from this screen into
the game over when the player dies.
87

87

00:04:24,001  -->  00:04:26,434
So I need to go and
find my script for player.
88

88

00:04:26,434  -->  00:04:30,389
We'll be working in the player script and
the level script in this video.
89

89

00:04:30,389  -->  00:04:33,306
First of all, we'll start off with
player and see what we need to do and
90

90

00:04:33,306  -->  00:04:34,252
where we need to do it.
91

91

00:04:34,252  -->  00:04:38,081
So that when the player dies,
we trigger the game over.
92

92

00:04:38,081  -->  00:04:39,600
So let's see, scrolling down.
93

93

00:04:39,600  -->  00:04:43,740
Well right in the middle here, we've got
die, we're destroying the game object.
94

94

00:04:43,740  -->  00:04:48,379
So destroy the player that they disappear
and then we are playing a particular sound
95

95

00:04:48,379  -->  00:04:51,040
within this die method
we're calling in here.
96

96

00:04:51,040  -->  00:04:55,800
So I'm just gonna put in right in
here right now to say, let's say,
97

97

00:04:55,800  -->  00:04:59,180
we need to load from the level,
we need to call the method.
98

98

00:04:59,180  -->  00:05:03,040
So we need to LoadGameOver as a method,
public method.
99

99

00:05:03,040  -->  00:05:06,064
How do we do that,
well first of all we need to say go and
100

100

00:05:06,064  -->  00:05:07,830
point yourself to Level.cs.
101

101

00:05:07,830  -->  00:05:11,940
And we know there's only gonna be one
level in our game at any point in time.
102

102

00:05:11,940  -->  00:05:15,260
So then we can say, findObjectOfType.
103

103

00:05:15,260  -->  00:05:15,960
What's the type?
104

104

00:05:15,960  -->  00:05:17,300
The type is going to be Level.
105

105

00:05:17,300  -->  00:05:20,180
That's how we go and
point ourselves to that other script.
106

106

00:05:20,180  -->  00:05:26,858
And then we need parentheses, cuz it's a
method, dot, and we can call LoadGameOver,
107

107

00:05:26,858  -->  00:05:31,926
which is contained within our
Level script, and then semicolon.
108

108

00:05:31,926  -->  00:05:35,156
So we'll do that, save up,
jump back over into Unity.
109

109

00:05:35,156  -->  00:05:38,956
And then I'll just kill the player, and
see if that triggers the Game Over screen,
110

110

00:05:38,956  -->  00:05:39,781
which it should.
111

111

00:05:39,781  -->  00:05:41,296
Actually, you know what?
112

112

00:05:41,296  -->  00:05:45,218
It's not going to because we
haven't done one critical step,
113

113

00:05:45,218  -->  00:05:48,970
which is go into our Build Settings and
to add our scenes.
114

114

00:05:48,970  -->  00:05:51,710
And you can see see we're getting
that nice error down at the bottom.
115

115

00:05:51,710  -->  00:05:52,821
I'll hop on the console here.
116

116

00:05:52,821  -->  00:05:56,638
We can see that the scene Game Over could
not be loaded because it's, basically,
117

117

00:05:56,638  -->  00:05:58,311
it hasn't been added to the build.
118

118

00:05:58,311  -->  00:06:00,993
So thank you console,
thanks for the cool error.
119

119

00:06:00,993  -->  00:06:05,691
And then we will go over the project,
go to project, grab Game Over,
120

120

00:06:05,691  -->  00:06:07,930
drop that into our build.
121

121

00:06:07,930  -->  00:06:11,050
Now it should all be nicely in place,
so that when the player gets shot or
122

122

00:06:11,050  -->  00:06:15,160
bumps into an enemy,
they have the appropriate death happening.
123

123

00:06:15,160  -->  00:06:16,977
Boink, and Game Over, great!
124

124

00:06:16,977  -->  00:06:19,917
That's really cool, but
we need a little bit of a delay, cuz we
125

125

00:06:19,917  -->  00:06:23,705
wanna be able to play our sound effect and
we want to trigger some visual effects.
126

126

00:06:23,705  -->  00:06:26,769
And we also want the player to have
a moment to yell at the screen and
127

127

00:06:26,769  -->  00:06:29,411
curse and, you know,
[SOUND] before Game Over comes up.
128

128

00:06:29,411  -->  00:06:33,005
So to do that, I'm going to do
that in a reasonably simple way.
129

129

00:06:33,005  -->  00:06:38,171
I'm gonna go into my Level.cs and
implement a coroutine.
130

130

00:06:38,171  -->  00:06:41,260
And this is where I'm gonna give you
a challenge, to delay level load.
131

131

00:06:41,260  -->  00:06:42,420
And it's a good challenge,
132

132

00:06:42,420  -->  00:06:46,010
because you've already implemented
coroutines a couple of times.
133

133

00:06:46,010  -->  00:06:47,500
So you should know how to do it.
134

134

00:06:47,500  -->  00:06:52,530
But here it is, implement a Coroutine
with our LoadGameOver method when
135

135

00:06:52,530  -->  00:06:57,690
the player dies, so that we have a short
delay before loading the Game Over scene.
136

136

00:06:57,690  -->  00:07:00,470
That is your mission if
you choose to accept it.
137

137

00:07:00,470  -->  00:07:05,540
And just a couple of reminders with our
Coroutine, we need to use StartCoroutine.
138

138

00:07:05,540  -->  00:07:09,390
We need to have an IEnumerator
as the type of the method that
139

139

00:07:09,390  -->  00:07:11,490
we are going to be calling and returning.
140

140

00:07:11,490  -->  00:07:16,960
And then we need to use yield return
new and have some sort of condition.
141

141

00:07:16,960  -->  00:07:21,690
And then after the condition has been met
then we will load the Game Over scene.
142

142

00:07:21,690  -->  00:07:23,423
So jump in, take on that challenge and
143

143

00:07:23,423  -->  00:07:26,034
I'll see you back here when you
have given it a red hot go.
144

144

00:07:28,415  -->  00:07:33,985
Okay, so we're within the public void
GameOver in our Level.cs script.
145

145

00:07:33,985  -->  00:07:38,158
What we need to do first within here
is to have a StartCoroutine, so
146

146

00:07:38,158  -->  00:07:40,178
we're calling the coroutine.
147

147

00:07:40,178  -->  00:07:44,134
We're not gonna turn
this into a coroutine.
148

148

00:07:44,134  -->  00:07:49,572
We're gonna say that when LoadGameOver is
called, then when we start a coroutine,
149

149

00:07:49,572  -->  00:07:53,494
so the StartCoroutine, and
we'll call this WaitAndLoad.
150

150

00:07:53,494  -->  00:07:59,937
That's our method and
then parenthesis, semicolon.
151

151

00:07:59,937  -->  00:08:05,640
It hasn't been created yet, so
let's down underneath LoadGameOver method,
152

152

00:08:05,640  -->  00:08:08,032
we will start with IEnumerator.
153

153

00:08:08,032  -->  00:08:09,660
IEnumerator what are we going to do here.
154

154

00:08:09,660  -->  00:08:14,359
Well we are going to call it WaitAndLoad,
parenthesis.
155

155

00:08:14,359  -->  00:08:16,290
And then we put in our curly braces.
156

156

00:08:16,290  -->  00:08:17,033
That's all looking pretty good.
157

157

00:08:17,033  -->  00:08:21,265
Red squiggly line, that's because we
haven't yet told it the yield conditions.
158

158

00:08:21,265  -->  00:08:24,364
I'm gonna grab the SceneManager.LoadScene,
cut that out,
159

159

00:08:24,364  -->  00:08:27,930
paste it in there cuz that's one
of the key things we're doing.
160

160

00:08:27,930  -->  00:08:32,197
We are loading the scene but
we need to load the scene after our delay.
161

161

00:08:32,197  -->  00:08:36,853
So we'll do our delay by saying yield
return new and then what are we doing?
162

162

00:08:36,853  -->  00:08:39,670
WaitForSeconds, how many seconds?
163

163

00:08:39,670  -->  00:08:41,540
Well we need it to be a variable.
164

164

00:08:41,540  -->  00:08:47,896
We don't wanna have this baked
right within our code so
165

165

00:08:47,896  -->  00:08:54,126
we'll say, delayInSeconds,
and then semicolon.
166

166

00:08:54,126  -->  00:08:56,054
Delay in seconds hasn't been created yet,
so
167

167

00:08:56,054  -->  00:08:58,040
I'm gonna copy that up to
the top of the script.
168

168

00:08:58,040  -->  00:09:00,040
A little bit of space.
169

169

00:09:00,040  -->  00:09:02,040
This will be a what, a float.
170

170

00:09:02,040  -->  00:09:04,913
So float,
we need to serialize this actually.
171

171

00:09:04,913  -->  00:09:08,278
SerializeField and
then float delayInSeconds,
172

172

00:09:08,278  -->  00:09:11,329
and we'll initialize this at, what, 2f.
173

173

00:09:11,329  -->  00:09:16,227
Okay, save that, I'll just have
a little look at our logic here.
174

174

00:09:16,227  -->  00:09:19,360
We've created delayInSeconds that
we can change in the inspector.
175

175

00:09:19,360  -->  00:09:23,200
And when we call LoadGame over, we're
gonna start our coroutine WaitAndLoad.
176

176

00:09:23,200  -->  00:09:27,330
WaitAndLoad is basically saying,
wait for a certain number of seconds and
177

177

00:09:27,330  -->  00:09:28,780
then trigger the Game Over.
178

178

00:09:28,780  -->  00:09:33,420
Let's see if that works, it should be
okay if we've hooked it up correctly.
179

179

00:09:33,420  -->  00:09:38,146
Let's click on Play, as our game compiles.
180

180

00:09:38,146  -->  00:09:40,201
Here we go, fly our plane.
181

181

00:09:40,201  -->  00:09:42,382
[SOUND] Crash into Bernard,
now it's Roger.
182

182

00:09:42,382  -->  00:09:46,240
Crash into Roger, two seconds later,
badoom, there we go, that is very cool.
183

183

00:09:46,240  -->  00:09:48,310
Now, let's just check the game loop,
play again.
184

184

00:09:48,310  -->  00:09:52,030
Make sure that there's nothing crazy
going on, make sure we've got no errors.
185

185

00:09:52,030  -->  00:09:56,916
Two seconds, main menu, Start,
and it's all looking pretty good.
186

186

00:09:56,916  -->  00:09:59,070
Okay, you have a whole
bunch of Bernards coming.
187

187

00:09:59,070  -->  00:10:00,750
Holy, that's, holy bullets!
188

188

00:10:00,750  -->  00:10:02,358
[LAUGH] Bullet holes.
189

189

00:10:02,358  -->  00:10:04,805
Awesome, okay, our game's really
starting to come together, isn't it?
190

190

00:10:04,805  -->  00:10:05,957
This is very neat.
191

191

00:10:05,957  -->  00:10:11,036
So there we go, we've implemented
our delay when we die, and
192

192

00:10:11,036  -->  00:10:16,324
our loading Game Over scene so
that our game has a full game loop.
193

193

00:10:16,324  -->  00:10:18,083
Great work, and
I'll see you in the next video.
