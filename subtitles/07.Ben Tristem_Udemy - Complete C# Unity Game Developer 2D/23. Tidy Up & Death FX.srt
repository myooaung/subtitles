00:00:03,917  -->  00:00:08,083
Hello again, in this video, we're gonna do
a little bit of tidying up of our code,
3

3

00:00:08,083  -->  00:00:12,428
and we're gonna implement a death particle
effect when the attackers are smashed into
4

4

00:00:12,428  -->  00:00:13,040
oblivion.
5

5

00:00:13,040  -->  00:00:16,510
So let's start by opening
our projectile script.
6

6

00:00:16,510  -->  00:00:19,660
We can see in here that we've
got a variable for health, and
7

7

00:00:19,660  -->  00:00:21,430
we've got our health dealing damage.
8

8

00:00:21,430  -->  00:00:26,970
What I'm going to do is create another
variable that allows us to have
9

9

00:00:26,970  -->  00:00:31,110
a mechanism to say what is the health,
sorry, what is the attacker, I was looking
10

10

00:00:31,110  -->  00:00:34,540
at the one above, we've already got
the health, Rick, what are you thinking?
11

11

00:00:34,540  -->  00:00:38,550
We want to be able to
reference the attacker, and
12

12

00:00:38,550  -->  00:00:42,460
that's going to equal
otherCollider.GetComponent&lt; &gt;,
13

13

00:00:42,460  -->  00:00:46,350
and what do we put within
our angle brackets here?
14

14

00:00:46,350  -->  00:00:48,688
We put &lt;Attacker&gt;.
15

15

00:00:48,688  -->  00:00:49,738
You guessed it.
16

16

00:00:49,738  -->  00:00:50,860
Hopefully you guessed it.
17

17

00:00:50,860  -->  00:00:54,104
Yelling out at the screen randomly,
attacker.
18

18

00:00:54,104  -->  00:00:58,793
Okay, so now that we have those two
I'm gonna create an if statement
19

19

00:00:58,793  -->  00:01:03,073
here where I say if(attacker &amp;&amp;),
so double ampersand,
20

20

00:01:03,073  -->  00:01:07,490
that's what that thingy is,
the and sign is an ampersand.
21

21

00:01:07,490  -->  00:01:12,688
So &amp;&amp;, say that fast ten times, health.
22

22

00:01:12,688  -->  00:01:16,425
So that's saying that when
we're colliding with something,
23

23

00:01:16,425  -->  00:01:20,442
if it has the attacker component,
and it has the health component,
24

24

00:01:20,442  -->  00:01:23,767
if both of those are true,
then we want to do something.
25

25

00:01:23,767  -->  00:01:24,930
What is it that we wanna do?
26

26

00:01:24,930  -->  00:01:28,470
Well, we want to do our health.DealDamage.
27

27

00:01:28,470  -->  00:01:33,359
That would be the first thing, and
then also, I think what we want to do is
28

28

00:01:33,359  -->  00:01:37,298
destroy the projectile so
that it's not hanging around.
29

29

00:01:37,298  -->  00:01:39,998
You could have it that
when your enemy shoots,
30

30

00:01:39,998  -->  00:01:44,293
you have a slow projectile that goes
through and does damage to everyone,
31

31

00:01:44,293  -->  00:01:48,378
one of those like rockets that cannot
be destroyed, but for us, or for
32

32

00:01:48,378  -->  00:01:52,980
the zucchini I want it to hit and then to
go away, I think that makes more sense.
33

33

00:01:52,980  -->  00:01:57,320
So, what do we type in here if we
want to destroy the projectile?
34

34

00:01:57,320  -->  00:01:59,910
We type in Destroy(gameObject).
35

35

00:02:02,150  -->  00:02:05,026
So destroy our cell, save that up.
36

36

00:02:05,026  -->  00:02:07,412
So now, it should only be
colliding with the correct things.
37

37

00:02:07,412  -->  00:02:11,164
We probably won't see much of a change,
cuz it's not passing through any of
38

38

00:02:11,164  -->  00:02:15,208
the incorrect things, but we know that if
there was another cactus in front of it,
39

39

00:02:15,208  -->  00:02:17,219
then it wouldn't bump into that point.
40

40

00:02:17,219  -->  00:02:21,510
Boink, there we go, we hit once, and
we hit twice, and it's disappearing.
41

41

00:02:21,510  -->  00:02:22,870
Excelente!
42

42

00:02:22,870  -->  00:02:27,358
The moment of disappearing where the
attacker is killed is a little bit bland,
43

43

00:02:27,358  -->  00:02:31,647
so we're gonna spruce that up a little
bit by putting in a particle effect.
44

44

00:02:31,647  -->  00:02:36,178
And this where I've got a challenge for
you is to create a nifty
45

45

00:02:36,178  -->  00:02:40,984
particle effect and to trigger
that when the attacker is killed.
46

46

00:02:40,984  -->  00:02:42,743
So this is code that we've done before.
47

47

00:02:42,743  -->  00:02:47,114
It should be pretty straightforward for
you to find where to put that code and
48

48

00:02:47,114  -->  00:02:50,938
say, how do I trigger this particle
effect so that it happens, and
49

49

00:02:50,938  -->  00:02:55,677
if you don't wanna create a particle
effect, then I've got one that I'm using.
50

50

00:02:55,677  -->  00:02:59,213
Just one of our other projects in
this course that I can give to you as
51

51

00:02:59,213  -->  00:03:01,243
downloadable against this lecture.
52

52

00:03:01,243  -->  00:03:06,527
So you can grab that, if you like,
as a asset pack or you can make your own.
53

53

00:03:06,527  -->  00:03:08,320
So jump in, take on that challenge.
54

54

00:03:08,320  -->  00:03:10,211
I'll see you back here when
you've given it your best shot.
55

55

00:03:12,490  -->  00:03:14,474
Okay, let's go and grab that asset.
56

56

00:03:14,474  -->  00:03:17,110
So I've got ExplosionVFX.
57

57

00:03:17,110  -->  00:03:21,977
When I drag it in anywhere into my Assets
folder it asks me whether I'd like
58

58

00:03:21,977  -->  00:03:22,768
to import.
59

59

00:03:22,768  -->  00:03:26,038
Yes, I import, and it brings in
the folder structure as well, so
60

60

00:03:26,038  -->  00:03:29,010
I've got this VFX folder down
here with the Explosion VFX,
61

61

00:03:29,010  -->  00:03:32,890
[LAUGH] which you might recognize from
one of the other sections of the course.
62

62

00:03:32,890  -->  00:03:33,809
I've just gone and grabbed it.
63

63

00:03:33,809  -->  00:03:37,634
You can take plenty of time to
finesse with your particle effect but
64

64

00:03:37,634  -->  00:03:41,030
I'm not gonna go through
that in too much detail.
65

65

00:03:41,030  -->  00:03:44,544
I just wanted to get something
that we could use for now.
66

66

00:03:44,544  -->  00:03:45,941
Let's just have a look,
make sure it works.
67

67

00:03:45,941  -->  00:03:46,624
Boink, there we go.
68

68

00:03:46,624  -->  00:03:48,720
It's kind of stars going a bit crazy.
69

69

00:03:48,720  -->  00:03:49,559
Good enough.
70

70

00:03:49,559  -->  00:03:51,042
Job done.
71

71

00:03:51,042  -->  00:03:58,120
Okay, so
let's go over into our health script.
72

72

00:03:58,120  -->  00:04:02,200
Above Destroy,
we need a notion of calling a method where
73

73

00:04:02,200  -->  00:04:07,196
we're going to say TriggerDeathVFX().
74

74

00:04:07,196  -->  00:04:11,694
Okay, we wanna trigger the VFX and
then we want to destroy it ourselves,
75

75

00:04:11,694  -->  00:04:14,571
in this case it's destroying the lizard,
and
76

76

00:04:14,571  -->  00:04:18,578
we want to make sure that
the DeathVFX isn't destroyed as well.
77

77

00:04:18,578  -->  00:04:20,410
So that's a little bit trickier.
78

78

00:04:20,410  -->  00:04:25,510
This is why we need to instantiate,
rather than just playing a VFX,
79

79

00:04:25,510  -->  00:04:29,990
rather than just playing a particle effect
on, where's one of my lizards here?
80

80

00:04:29,990  -->  00:04:34,280
Prefab &gt; Lizard, drag them into
the scene so we put him there.
81

81

00:04:34,280  -->  00:04:39,420
So we could have as a child, we could
have a particle effect under the lizard.
82

82

00:04:39,420  -->  00:04:42,770
But then when we destroy the lizard,
we're also destroying the child,
83

83

00:04:42,770  -->  00:04:44,610
the particle effect underneath that.
84

84

00:04:44,610  -->  00:04:52,633
So we're create ourselves
a private void TriggerDeathVFX.
85

85

00:04:52,633  -->  00:04:53,783
What do we want to do in here?
86

86

00:04:53,783  -->  00:04:57,931
Well, first of all I'm gonna say, if we
don't have any VFX, then just return,
87

87

00:04:57,931  -->  00:05:00,433
just in case we forget to
put something on there,
88

88

00:05:00,433  -->  00:05:03,240
we don't want something to
break where it says, hey,
89

89

00:05:03,240  -->  00:05:06,803
trigger a particular particle effect and
we've kind of forgotten.
90

90

00:05:06,803  -->  00:05:09,026
I know that you would never
forget to do that, but
91

91

00:05:09,026  -->  00:05:10,825
I forget to do these things sometimes.
92

92

00:05:10,825  -->  00:05:13,810
So say, if there is no,
what are we going to call this?
93

93

00:05:13,810  -->  00:05:18,482
We'll call this deathvfx, we're going
to make that variable in a moment,
94

94

00:05:18,482  -->  00:05:19,655
then just return.
95

95

00:05:19,655  -->  00:05:22,800
Just go about your business,
don't worry, don'tdon't stress about it.
96

96

00:05:22,800  -->  00:05:24,566
Unity, everything will be fine.
97

97

00:05:24,566  -->  00:05:28,269
So let's go and
serialize ourselves a variable,
98

98

00:05:28,269  -->  00:05:32,591
[SerializeField] GameObject,
cuz we want to be able to
99

99

00:05:32,591  -->  00:05:37,371
reference it as a GameObject in a moment,
and it's a deathVFX.
100

100

00:05:37,371  -->  00:05:42,239
Okay, so now we have this notion of
we're gonna drag in our deathVFX,
101

101

00:05:42,239  -->  00:05:46,390
that we just brought in,
the explosion thing I had before.
102

102

00:05:46,390  -->  00:05:49,685
If it doesn't exist, if you don't have
one of these then don't worry about it,
103

103

00:05:49,685  -->  00:05:50,369
just return it.
104

104

00:05:50,369  -->  00:05:51,860
Otherwise, what are we gonna do?
105

105

00:05:51,860  -->  00:05:55,324
Well, we'll start off just by saying,
instantiate.
106

106

00:05:55,324  -->  00:05:58,590
Instantiate, what do we need to do here?
107

107

00:05:58,590  -->  00:06:00,660
Well, we're gonna instantiate(deathVFX, ).
108

108

00:06:00,660  -->  00:06:02,970
We've done this a bunch of
times when instantiating.
109

109

00:06:02,970  -->  00:06:04,717
It should be pretty natural by now.
110

110

00:06:04,717  -->  00:06:05,790
And then where is it?
111

111

00:06:05,790  -->  00:06:12,630
It's transform.position.
112

112

00:06:12,630  -->  00:06:13,772
Had to think for a moment there.
113

113

00:06:13,772  -->  00:06:19,511
And then we can do transform.rotation,
or we can do the quotidian.identity.
114

114

00:06:19,511  -->  00:06:24,184
I just like doing transform.rotation
when it doesn't really matter what our
115

115

00:06:24,184  -->  00:06:28,926
rotation is, we're just putting it in
there so that this instantiates happy,
116

116

00:06:28,926  -->  00:06:32,350
it's not confused saying
what's the rotation, Rick?
117

117

00:06:32,350  -->  00:06:34,204
Okay, let's see how this goes,
if this works.
118

118

00:06:34,204  -->  00:06:36,540
Jump back over,
we need to create that reference.
119

119

00:06:36,540  -->  00:06:43,230
So on Lizard, we should now see,
on our health script,
120

120

00:06:43,230  -->  00:06:47,590
we can see it's looking for
deathVFX whereas my VFX,
121

121

00:06:47,590  -->  00:06:52,570
I will grab Explosion VFX,
drag it on over into there.
122

122

00:06:52,570  -->  00:06:57,153
Click on play just to make
sure that this works.
123

123

00:06:57,153  -->  00:07:03,004
He jumps out, shoot, bang, and
one more time, shoot, bang, [SOUND].
124

124

00:07:03,004  -->  00:07:05,084
Okay, we didn't get a VFX, why is that?
125

125

00:07:05,084  -->  00:07:08,362
Well let's go to our Explosion VFX,
it's probably,
126

126

00:07:08,362  -->  00:07:12,920
if we scroll down down down to the
renderer, we can see, if we look closely,
127

127

00:07:12,920  -->  00:07:16,650
the Order in Layer is 0, so
we've gone through that before.
128

128

00:07:16,650  -->  00:07:19,281
I'll put this at 6 so
it sits over the top of everything.
129

129

00:07:19,281  -->  00:07:24,620
That's right on the prefab, so that
should be applied to what we're calling.
130

130

00:07:24,620  -->  00:07:28,387
Okay, we'll try this again.
131

131

00:07:28,387  -->  00:07:29,510
Okay, it's jumps out.
132

132

00:07:29,510  -->  00:07:30,397
[SOUND] You know what I'm gonna do?
133

133

00:07:30,397  -->  00:07:31,988
This has [LAUGH] been bugging me for
awhile.
134

134

00:07:31,988  -->  00:07:33,110
I don't know, I haven't done this.
135

135

00:07:33,110  -->  00:07:34,620
I'm gonna click on my lizard.
136

136

00:07:34,620  -->  00:07:37,940
Go down, instead of 100 health,
I'm gonna give you 30 health, so
137

137

00:07:37,940  -->  00:07:39,960
you get shot and killed.
138

138

00:07:39,960  -->  00:07:43,170
I'm gonna click apply,
shot and killed with one shot.
139

139

00:07:43,170  -->  00:07:47,820
Now if we want to see how it works with
multiple shots then we'll put that back up
140

140

00:07:47,820  -->  00:07:49,100
again, but for now.
141

141

00:07:49,100  -->  00:07:53,203
Kaboom, there we go, nice, and
it created a particle effect.
142

142

00:07:53,203  -->  00:07:54,450
Let's have a look in here.
143

143

00:07:54,450  -->  00:07:57,421
We've got this Explosion VFX,
now that's gonna
144

144

00:07:57,421  -->  00:08:02,102
stick around forever if we don't take
care of it, so let's go take care of it.
145

145

00:08:02,102  -->  00:08:03,100
How do we take care of it?
146

146

00:08:03,100  -->  00:08:05,808
Well, we need to destroy
the particle effect and
147

147

00:08:05,808  -->  00:08:07,797
this is why we're instantiating.
148

148

00:08:07,797  -->  00:08:10,989
Sorry, we're instantiating because
the lizard gets destroyed,
149

149

00:08:10,989  -->  00:08:14,573
and this creates this whole new game
object here, but we need a handle to it,
150

150

00:08:14,573  -->  00:08:16,760
we need a way of referring
to this game object.
151

151

00:08:16,760  -->  00:08:23,050
So we'll create ourselves a GameObject
type called deathVFXObject,
152

152

00:08:23,050  -->  00:08:27,780
and that's equal to what
we've just instantiated.
153

153

00:08:27,780  -->  00:08:33,958
So now we have this notion
of there's a deathVFXObject,
154

154

00:08:33,958  -->  00:08:40,395
so on our next line we can
say Destroy(deathVFXObject),
155

155

00:08:40,395  -->  00:08:45,560
and we have the option of
saying after how long.
156

156

00:08:45,560  -->  00:08:48,170
We don't wanna destroy it straight away,
because we need to actually see
157

157

00:08:48,170  -->  00:08:50,980
the particle effects, so
we'll say after a second.
158

158

00:08:50,980  -->  00:08:54,280
This is a little bit of a magic number
in here, but I'm okay with that.
159

159

00:08:54,280  -->  00:08:59,470
We could put it to 10 and
be super safe, but I'll leave it at 1.
160

160

00:08:59,470  -->  00:09:03,380
I'm pretty sure my particle
effect is gonna be come and
161

161

00:09:03,380  -->  00:09:06,300
gone in one second no problem.
162

162

00:09:06,300  -->  00:09:10,291
So we'll make sure all that works and
is hunky dory.
163

163

00:09:10,291  -->  00:09:14,893
Click on play, watch our hierarchy,
lizard's being spawned, blump,
164

164

00:09:14,893  -->  00:09:17,877
explosion, and
then the explosion went away.
165

165

00:09:17,877  -->  00:09:23,577
Now, if you look at it closely,
I think, here we go, when it hits,
166

166

00:09:23,577  -->  00:09:29,880
when it strikes, boink, the particle
effect is a little bit to the right.
167

167

00:09:29,880  -->  00:09:31,387
It looks a little bit off.
168

168

00:09:31,387  -->  00:09:34,479
It's all going pretty quick so
you don't really notice it, but
169

169

00:09:34,479  -->  00:09:36,150
there's a few ways to solve this.
170

170

00:09:36,150  -->  00:09:39,700
For now, I'm going to be a little bit
cheeky, okay, and for the [LAUGH]
171

171

00:09:39,700  -->  00:09:42,370
experienced programmers out there you're
gonna be like,what are you doing?
172

172

00:09:42,370  -->  00:09:45,130
I'm gonna be a little bit cheeky and
173

173

00:09:45,130  -->  00:09:50,190
show you how I will move the particle
effect as opposed to trying to
174

174

00:09:50,190  -->  00:09:55,078
reposition it on the lizard, or
on the lizard's pivot point.
175

175

00:09:55,078  -->  00:09:57,530
So you see the pivot point there.
176

176

00:09:57,530  -->  00:10:01,041
Instead of trying to change where we
instantiate it I'm just gonna change
177

177

00:10:01,041  -->  00:10:02,694
the particle effect a little bit.
178

178

00:10:02,694  -->  00:10:07,634
So forgive me on this that it's not
perfect, but sometimes I think it's good
179

179

00:10:07,634  -->  00:10:11,130
to do these little tweaks so
that we can keep on moving.
180

180

00:10:11,130  -->  00:10:16,790
So let's find our VFX &gt; Explosion VFX,
Drag one of those into the scene.
181

181

00:10:16,790  -->  00:10:19,303
You can see here is the particle effect.
182

182

00:10:19,303  -->  00:10:22,144
If we zoom in,
this little symbol is showing it, and
183

183

00:10:22,144  -->  00:10:25,450
that represents where the middle
of the particle effect is.
184

184

00:10:25,450  -->  00:10:31,050
If I scroll down on my particle effect,
and find let's see, Shape, and on Shape,
185

185

00:10:31,050  -->  00:10:35,850
I've got position on my X coordinate,
if I drag that over a little bit,
186

186

00:10:35,850  -->  00:10:40,490
you can see that this is where the origin,
or the basis of the particle
187

187

00:10:40,490  -->  00:10:45,131
effect is gonna be, and this is
where spawning the actual particle.
188

188

00:10:45,131  -->  00:10:47,860
So, if I click play,
that's a little bit to the left.
189

189

00:10:47,860  -->  00:10:51,840
I know this is a little bit hacky, but
I think this is a great quick solution to
190

190

00:10:51,840  -->  00:10:54,960
the fact that it's not quite lining
up the way we want it to line up.
191

191

00:10:54,960  -->  00:10:57,390
Instead of having to go and
mess around with the lizard,
192

192

00:10:57,390  -->  00:10:59,250
and the lizards animation
we can do that later on.
193

193

00:10:59,250  -->  00:11:01,610
We'll tidy that later on,
but this is just a quickie.
194

194

00:11:01,610  -->  00:11:04,463
We'll apply this back to the prefab.
195

195

00:11:04,463  -->  00:11:06,660
Just remove that from our scene.
196

196

00:11:06,660  -->  00:11:11,016
Let's have our lizard come walking in,
walk, walk, walk, walk, and boink,
197

197

00:11:11,016  -->  00:11:14,880
that looked like it landed right
over the top, so that's pretty good.
198

198

00:11:14,880  -->  00:11:16,773
Okay, as I said,
it's not the best particle effect.
199

199

00:11:16,773  -->  00:11:20,052
Hopefully you've done something a little
bit sharper than that, and also,
200

200

00:11:20,052  -->  00:11:22,876
if you've found that it's not
spawning quite in the right place,
201

201

00:11:22,876  -->  00:11:26,166
I've given you a bit of a hint there on
how you can tweak your particle effect.
202

202

00:11:26,166  -->  00:11:29,792
Okay, so that's all I wanted to do in
this video, just tidying thing up and
203

203

00:11:29,792  -->  00:11:32,455
getting a little bit of
a particle effect triggering.
204

204

00:11:32,455  -->  00:11:37,234
In the next video, we'll do,
I'm not sure yet, something cool [LAUGH].
205

205

00:11:37,234  -->  00:11:38,940
I'll see you in the next video.
