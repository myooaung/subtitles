1

00:00:03.972  -->  00:00:08.626
In this video we will be downloading
Unity Hub, Unity 2018 or later, and
2

2

00:00:08.626  -->  00:00:09.640
Visual Studio.
3

3

00:00:09.640  -->  00:00:11.605
If you already have those
things downloaded and
4

4

00:00:11.605  -->  00:00:15.120
ready to go then you can jump to the next
video, otherwise let's get started.
5

5

00:00:15.120  -->  00:00:18.910
Okay the very first step in the process
is to open up your web browser and
6

6

00:00:18.910  -->  00:00:21.170
search for get unity.
7

7

00:00:21.170  -->  00:00:25.250
So I'll take you to a list of things where
Unity download should be at the very top
8

8

00:00:25.250  -->  00:00:27.440
or somewhere around the top,
have a look for it.
9

9

00:00:27.440  -->  00:00:30.670
Now on the download Unity page we can
click on the big green button that says,
10

10

00:00:30.670  -->  00:00:32.530
choose your Unity and download.
11

11

00:00:32.530  -->  00:00:37.350
That'll allow you to go and do things,
what I'll call the old way, cuz recently
12

12

00:00:37.350  -->  00:00:40.810
we now have the option of downloading
Unity Hub which is what we're going to do.
13

13

00:00:40.810  -->  00:00:44.150
If you land on this page and things have
changed cuz Unity's always changing and
14

14

00:00:44.150  -->  00:00:45.460
upgrading and iterating.
15

15

00:00:45.460  -->  00:00:50.390
No problem, just follow the approach
of finding the Unity that you want to
16

16

00:00:50.390  -->  00:00:55.096
download, and if the Hub is available,
click on download Unity Hub.
17

17

00:00:55.096  -->  00:00:58.183
I expect it's gonna be around for
a long time, because it is awesome.
18

18

00:00:58.183  -->  00:00:59.903
It allows us to manage
all of our downloads,
19

19

00:00:59.903  -->  00:01:01.430
in all of our different versions.
20

20

00:01:01.430  -->  00:01:04.630
So that's gonna download, it might take
you a little bit longer than me, but for
21

21

00:01:04.630  -->  00:01:08.330
me it's gonna be about a I don't know,
I think a 20 second download.
22

22

00:01:08.330  -->  00:01:10.960
Once that downloads,
we can get into the next step.
23

23

00:01:10.960  -->  00:01:12.950
So click on that to open it up.
24

24

00:01:14.510  -->  00:01:16.180
It'll ask you if you wanna do this, yep.
25

25

00:01:16.180  -->  00:01:18.314
And this is on PC as you can see.
26

26

00:01:18.314  -->  00:01:21.828
Ben's gonna take you through some of the
PC Mac differences in a couple of videos
27

27

00:01:21.828  -->  00:01:23.777
time, but everything's pretty similar.
28

28

00:01:23.777  -->  00:01:27.726
If you're a Mac user, you're gonna know
how to respond when the dialog pops up,
29

29

00:01:27.726  -->  00:01:31.790
and here we need to scroll through,
read it very closely and in close detail.
30

30

00:01:31.790  -->  00:01:33.980
When you get to the end, click I agree.
31

31

00:01:33.980  -->  00:01:37.740
You can see I didn't quite read it, I was
being a little bit facetious on that one.
32

32

00:01:37.740  -->  00:01:42.380
But I'm sure it said lots of good stuff
and it wasn't asking me to give them my
33

33

00:01:42.380  -->  00:01:48.140
kidneys or my first born or any of those
kind of scary things, all safe and good.
34

34

00:01:48.140  -->  00:01:50.710
Okay, so it's doing a little bit
of behind the scenes thinking,
35

35

00:01:50.710  -->  00:01:54.230
now we've installed Unity Hub and
this thing is delightful.
36

36

00:01:54.230  -->  00:01:55.830
If you've used Unity before and
37

37

00:01:55.830  -->  00:01:59.640
you haven't used Unity Hub, then it's
not gonna be too much of a stretch,
38

38

00:01:59.640  -->  00:02:04.460
basically it's allowing us to manage
multiple versions of Unity in one place.
39

39

00:02:04.460  -->  00:02:05.360
Why would you do that?
40

40

00:02:05.360  -->  00:02:09.700
Well sometimes you've created
a project and say Unity 2017, and
41

41

00:02:09.700  -->  00:02:13.310
you're worried there's compatibilities
in Unity 2018 or vice versa, so
42

42

00:02:13.310  -->  00:02:15.040
it allows us to manage that.
43

43

00:02:15.040  -->  00:02:17.590
See I have no versions
available at the moment.
44

44

00:02:17.590  -->  00:02:18.800
I click on,
45

45

00:02:18.800  -->  00:02:22.230
if you do have something installed already
you can click on locate a version.
46

46

00:02:22.230  -->  00:02:25.685
If this is your first ever installation
of Unity click on download, and
47

47

00:02:25.685  -->  00:02:28.346
then it's gonna ask for
some options in here and here.
48

48

00:02:28.346  -->  00:02:32.465
Your list should have at
the very least 2018.1.
49

49

00:02:32.465  -->  00:02:36.120
If you're looking at this in the future
it might be 2019, it might be 2020.
50

50

00:02:36.120  -->  00:02:37.030
Not a problem,
51

51

00:02:37.030  -->  00:02:41.300
we recommend getting the most recent
version of Unity that's stable.
52

52

00:02:41.300  -->  00:02:44.443
And you can tell that's the stable if
you can see here Official Releases,
53

53

00:02:44.443  -->  00:02:46.430
the only thing on here
are Official Releases.
54

54

00:02:46.430  -->  00:02:47.660
It's only gonna show you the good stuff.
55

55

00:02:47.660  -->  00:02:49.072
If you click on the beta releases,
56

56

00:02:49.072  -->  00:02:52.054
then it will show you something that's
a little bit more experimental.
57

57

00:02:52.054  -->  00:02:56.539
Normally they're pretty stable by the time
they get here, but we often find bugs so
58

58

00:02:56.539  -->  00:03:00.920
we tend not to use the beta version and
we wait until it becomes official release.
59

59

00:03:00.920  -->  00:03:06.822
So, for me you can see the latest
option I have is 2018.1.0f2.
60

60

00:03:06.822  -->  00:03:10.860
Yours might be 2018.2 or
2018.3, not a problem.
61

61

00:03:10.860  -->  00:03:14.711
Click to download the most recent stable
version, and then we have the option of
62

62

00:03:14.711  -->  00:03:17.931
the components we wish to install,
obviously we need the editor,
63

63

00:03:17.931  -->  00:03:21.784
the documentation, yes, standard assets,
absolutely, example project,
64

64

00:03:21.784  -->  00:03:25.577
that's up to you, you don't have to
download that, you could turn that off to
65

65

00:03:25.577  -->  00:03:28.995
save a little bit of the download,
I'm just gonna leave it on for now.
66

66

00:03:28.995  -->  00:03:33.373
And then development tools, very super
massively important that yes you
67

67

00:03:33.373  -->  00:03:37.963
have Microsoft Visual Studio Community
2017 or 18 or whatever it is for
68

68

00:03:37.963  -->  00:03:40.980
you when you're going
through this process.
69

69

00:03:40.980  -->  00:03:42.710
Yes you need to download that,
70

70

00:03:42.710  -->  00:03:45.550
because that's the environment
we're gonna be using.
71

71

00:03:45.550  -->  00:03:47.310
Okay platforms, that's up to you.
72

72

00:03:47.310  -->  00:03:51.020
You can come back and manage this again in
the future, you can surf through to this,
73

73

00:03:51.020  -->  00:03:52.700
you don't have to get this for now.
74

74

00:03:52.700  -->  00:03:55.930
The one thing we will get
is WebGL Build Support,
75

75

00:03:55.930  -->  00:03:58.540
that allows us to build to websites.
76

76

00:03:58.540  -->  00:04:01.360
We might do a little bit of that in
the early sections of this course.
77

77

00:04:01.360  -->  00:04:04.002
So that's it for
the selecting your components.
78

78

00:04:04.002  -->  00:04:08.845
Click done, and then it is going
to ask if we want to make changes?
79

79

00:04:08.845  -->  00:04:13.723
Yes, and then we need to sit back, and
relax, and enjoy the ride as it does
80

80

00:04:13.723  -->  00:04:17.650
all of the downloading and
installing in this mechanism.
81

81

00:04:17.650  -->  00:04:19.970
So that's mostly it for this video,
82

82

00:04:19.970  -->  00:04:23.530
I'm gonna give you your challenge which
is downloading Unity Hub and Unity.
83

83

00:04:24.540  -->  00:04:26.220
Start off my downloading Hub.
84

84

00:04:26.220  -->  00:04:30.563
Download the latest Unity release, and as
I mentioned, if you have any problems at
85

85

00:04:30.563  -->  00:04:35.104
all, then have a look at the version
we're using, at the moment it's 2018.1.
86

86

00:04:35.104  -->  00:04:40.108
And as we go through the course,
as the sections become stable, we'll be
87

87

00:04:40.108  -->  00:04:45.370
updating to the stable versions of Unity,
so as the versions become stable.
88

88

00:04:45.370  -->  00:04:49.718
And if Unity is downloading quickly for
you, and you have Unity downloaded pretty
89

89

00:04:49.718  -->  00:04:53.939
soon, then continue to the very next video
which is called Your First Code, and
90

90

00:04:53.939  -->  00:04:57.105
jump straight in,
cuz we'll be using Unity in that video.
91

91

00:04:57.105  -->  00:05:00.507
If it's taking a while, or
you've got a slow internet, then, and
92

92

00:05:00.507  -->  00:05:03.732
it's not downloaded,
then you can jump forward two videos, so
93

93

00:05:03.732  -->  00:05:07.853
skip the next two videos and we have a
video that's titled Community and Support,
94

94

00:05:07.853  -->  00:05:11.554
where we talk about how to get the most
out of this course, how to lean on our
95

95

00:05:11.554  -->  00:05:15.235
community and how to use all the tools and
support that we provide to you.
96

96

00:05:15.235  -->  00:05:17.644
And then when you finish
watching that video,
97

97

00:05:17.644  -->  00:05:20.920
hopefully Unity will have been
downloaded and installed, and
98

98

00:05:20.920  -->  00:05:24.154
then you can come back and
jump into the Your First Code Video.
99

99

00:05:24.154  -->  00:05:29.033
So that's a simple flow, whatever the case
please do jump straight away into the next
100

100

00:05:29.033  -->  00:05:32.380
video and keep moving forward and
I will see you very soon.
