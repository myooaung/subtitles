00:00:00,058  -->  00:00:04,030
[MUSIC]
2

2

00:00:04,030  -->  00:00:06,557
In this video we're implementing score for
our games so
3

3

00:00:06,557  -->  00:00:09,040
that when we shoot enemies
our score goes up, up, up.
4

4

00:00:09,040  -->  00:00:14,250
And then when we die we have that same
score presented on our game over screen.
5

5

00:00:14,250  -->  00:00:17,050
So what I wanna do is start off
with a challenge in this video and
6

6

00:00:17,050  -->  00:00:19,130
the challenge is to add
score to your game.
7

7

00:00:19,130  -->  00:00:20,770
Killing enemies increases your score.
8

8

00:00:20,770  -->  00:00:24,040
And I wanna give you a reminder of
what's required by showing you what
9

9

00:00:24,040  -->  00:00:25,780
I've just gone and implemented.
10

10

00:00:25,780  -->  00:00:29,530
I've come back in the future,
back to the future, back from the past.
11

11

00:00:29,530  -->  00:00:32,789
Anyway, I've just recorded it, and
I'm recording the start of the video now.
12

12

00:00:32,789  -->  00:00:34,026
I wanna show you what I've done so
13

13

00:00:34,026  -->  00:00:36,202
that if you want some reminders
you know what's going on.
14

14

00:00:36,202  -->  00:00:40,568
I've created a game session game object
out of the game session script of that.
15

15

00:00:40,568  -->  00:00:44,941
Within the game session script
I'm doing a couple of things,
16

16

00:00:44,941  -->  00:00:49,986
I'm creating a singleton pattern,
I'm creating a score variable and
17

17

00:00:49,986  -->  00:00:55,217
then three public methods to GetScore,
to AddToScore and to ResetGame.
18

18

00:00:55,217  -->  00:00:56,618
I'm showing you these very quickly,
19

19

00:00:56,618  -->  00:00:58,734
I'm going to go through them
in super detail in a moment.
20

20

00:00:58,734  -->  00:01:02,815
But I'm showing you if you wanna go and
do this challenge yourself,
21

21

00:01:02,815  -->  00:01:08,055
I'm also creating a score display which is
getting the text component that our score.
22

22

00:01:08,055  -->  00:01:13,319
So main canvas that our score text is
on as well as the game object of game
23

23

00:01:13,319  -->  00:01:18,815
session To be out of called the public
method of getting the score.
24

24

00:01:18,815  -->  00:01:25,112
And then we are updating on every frame,
the score by using the ToString method.
25

25

00:01:25,112  -->  00:01:30,211
Finally, when we kill an enemy, we need
to have a score value and when we die,
26

26

00:01:30,211  -->  00:01:35,481
when the enemy dies, we are calling
the AddToScore and passing in scoreValue.
27

27

00:01:35,481  -->  00:01:38,166
So that's just a really quick rundown,
if you wanted to go and
28

28

00:01:38,166  -->  00:01:41,215
do this as a challenge yourself and
have some reminders and pointers,
29

29

00:01:41,215  -->  00:01:42,262
that is the challenge.
30

30

00:01:42,262  -->  00:01:45,374
So jump in, take on that challenge now,
give it your best shot.
31

31

00:01:45,374  -->  00:01:48,728
And I'll see you here when you're done,
we'll go through it together in detail.
32

32

00:01:51,432  -->  00:01:53,150
Okay, let's get shifty.
33

33

00:01:53,150  -->  00:01:56,160
First thing I'm gonna do is free up
a little bit of space in my hierarchy,
34

34

00:01:56,160  -->  00:01:57,760
right click Create Empty.
35

35

00:01:57,760  -->  00:02:02,380
I'm gonna call this Game Elements, and I'm
just gonna shove anything in here that I
36

36

00:02:02,380  -->  00:02:04,970
don't need have a look
at reset that transform.
37

37

00:02:04,970  -->  00:02:08,980
So I'm gonna grab the background star
field, star field, shredder shredder.
38

38

00:02:08,980  -->  00:02:12,020
Drop those into the game elements,
the path and the other path,
39

39

00:02:12,020  -->  00:02:13,720
drop those in there.
40

40

00:02:13,720  -->  00:02:17,040
That's pretty good, and
then just close up game elements,
41

41

00:02:17,040  -->  00:02:20,950
drag it up to the very top so
it's tucked neatly out of the way.
42

42

00:02:20,950  -->  00:02:25,910
Excellent, next I'm gonna right click and
Create Empty, create a game session.
43

43

00:02:27,410  -->  00:02:30,090
Game session, game object.
44

44

00:02:30,090  -->  00:02:33,740
Within the Game Session game object,
we're going to create ourselves a script.
45

45

00:02:33,740  -->  00:02:38,469
Which I will click on my script folder,
right click, click C# script.
46

46

00:02:38,469  -->  00:02:42,770
I'm gonna call this,
you guessed it, GameSession.
47

47

00:02:42,770  -->  00:02:45,616
Okay, and
then drag the GameSession script onto,
48

48

00:02:45,616  -->  00:02:49,454
when it finishes figuring out that
it's alive, okay you are alive,
49

49

00:02:49,454  -->  00:02:53,445
great, the game session,
script under the Game Session game object.
50

50

00:02:53,445  -->  00:02:56,264
And then while we're here for
due diligence,
51

51

00:02:56,264  -->  00:03:01,263
drag the Game Session game object into our
prefers folder so it is now prefer core.
52

52

00:03:01,263  -->  00:03:04,415
You might have noticed that my assets
folder here has changed a little bit.
53

53

00:03:04,415  -->  00:03:07,302
I've just gone and drag my slider
from folders down in to lists,
54

54

00:03:07,302  -->  00:03:10,970
because that's making it a little bit
neater and tidier to see what's going on.
55

55

00:03:10,970  -->  00:03:12,950
Okay, we're going to need one
more script in this video.
56

56

00:03:12,950  -->  00:03:15,987
So script folder,
right click, create c sharp.
57

57

00:03:15,987  -->  00:03:20,845
I'm gonna call this particular
script ScoreDisplay so
58

58

00:03:20,845  -->  00:03:23,455
that we can be displaying our score.
59

59

00:03:23,455  -->  00:03:24,765
So this is our script building block.
60

60

00:03:24,765  -->  00:03:27,480
So next stop I'm gonna add my
score UI element to the screen.
61

61

00:03:27,480  -->  00:03:32,086
So find the game canvas,
right click create a UI text.
62

62

00:03:32,086  -->  00:03:35,480
Now, we could do TextMeshPro-Text we
could do text we tend to do a lot
63

63

00:03:35,480  -->  00:03:36,359
of TextMeshPro,
64

64

00:03:36,359  -->  00:03:40,070
cuz I think it gives us a little bit
more control looks a little bit crisper.
65

65

00:03:40,070  -->  00:03:44,405
But in this video I'm gonna be doing score
using just tick so that we've done the way
66

66

00:03:44,405  -->  00:03:47,705
so you can see it is wanting to
do text you know how to do text.
67

67

00:03:47,705  -->  00:03:49,265
So were covering a few different bases,
68

68

00:03:49,265  -->  00:03:52,840
but in general you'd probably
just do one or the other.
69

69

00:03:52,840  -->  00:03:56,515
Okay our text we'll rename
to be score text and
70

70

00:03:56,515  -->  00:04:00,860
then let's see click,
if you click on your game canvas,
71

71

00:04:00,860  -->  00:04:03,370
that'll zoom you can see
score text on your screen.
72

72

00:04:03,370  -->  00:04:04,950
So right size is tiny at the moment.
73

73

00:04:04,950  -->  00:04:08,618
So let's click on Score Text,
change our font to 100.
74

74

00:04:08,618  -->  00:04:13,800
Change the color to be, for now,
white until I have a better idea.
75

75

00:04:13,800  -->  00:04:19,843
Change from the New Text in the text field
to 000000, that's kind of six 0s I think.
76

76

00:04:19,843  -->  00:04:22,841
And then w, whoops, not a w there!
77

77

00:04:22,841  -->  00:04:24,186
Click on Score Text.
78

78

00:04:24,186  -->  00:04:29,569
W tall move it roughly up to
the top right of my screen.
79

79

00:04:29,569  -->  00:04:31,346
I need to zoom in a little bit.
80

80

00:04:31,346  -->  00:04:33,700
I'm gonna click on my T-tool.
81

81

00:04:33,700  -->  00:04:36,045
And make it bigger so
we can actually see it.
82

82

00:04:36,045  -->  00:04:39,529
There it goes, it pops into existence,
make it nice and large.
83

83

00:04:39,529  -->  00:04:45,390
Right click or right align and
I like to center line things.
84

84

00:04:45,390  -->  00:04:49,210
Now, change the font so font, select that,
whatever you've selected for your game,
85

85

00:04:49,210  -->  00:04:52,380
I've got batman FA just here,
looks pretty crisp over there,
86

86

00:04:52,380  -->  00:04:55,750
I like it gonna move it up just
a little bit more and very important,
87

87

00:04:55,750  -->  00:04:58,510
click on the anchor and
then right click on the anchor.
88

88

00:04:58,510  -->  00:05:03,138
So no matter whatever screen resolution
and aspect ratio we have our score,
89

89

00:05:03,138  -->  00:05:05,975
we anchored up to the top
right of your screen.
90

90

00:05:05,975  -->  00:05:08,451
Okay, now we have score,
it called Score Text, perfect,
91

91

00:05:08,451  -->  00:05:09,745
that all looking pretty good.
92

92

00:05:09,745  -->  00:05:15,110
Our script we just made,
which was the ScoreDisplay.
93

93

00:05:15,110  -->  00:05:17,540
We're gonna drag that over onto score.
94

94

00:05:18,705  -->  00:05:21,510
Excellent, or you can add component and
search for it, either of those ways.
95

95

00:05:21,510  -->  00:05:23,940
Now we have our score
display on our score.
96

96

00:05:23,940  -->  00:05:26,330
Our last thing we're gonna do is change
the color just to make it a little bit
97

97

00:05:26,330  -->  00:05:34,240
more of a bright blue spacey, fluorescent
kind of, there we go, wonderful.
98

98

00:05:34,240  -->  00:05:35,490
Okay, so I've got score,
99

99

00:05:35,490  -->  00:05:39,120
I've got my scripts,
we're ready to jump into the scripts.
100

100

00:05:39,120  -->  00:05:44,330
Find our game session, double click on
that, open it up, jump into Visual Studio.
101

101

00:05:44,330  -->  00:05:48,160
First thing I need to do is
create a notion of score.
102

102

00:05:48,160  -->  00:05:55,628
So score a little s, score initialize
that 0; so you have your score.
103

103

00:05:55,628  -->  00:06:00,556
Next, I'm gonna implement a singleton, so
that our game session there is only one of
104

104

00:06:00,556  -->  00:06:05,218
them and we can reuse our score in our
game overscreen because it's a singleton.
105

105

00:06:05,218  -->  00:06:10,133
So I'm gonna create Awake, so
it's the very very first thing it does
106

106

00:06:10,133  -->  00:06:14,371
when it wakes up it will
SetUpSingleton(); as a method,
107

107

00:06:14,371  -->  00:06:19,969
right click on SetUpSingleton quick
actions and refactors generate method or
108

108

00:06:19,969  -->  00:06:23,732
you can just type it out
yourself if you like typing.
109

109

00:06:23,732  -->  00:06:26,486
And then, I'm gonna delete
the default line that's in there.
110

110

00:06:26,486  -->  00:06:27,252
What do we need to do?
111

111

00:06:27,252  -->  00:06:32,382
Well, we need the integer, which is how
many game sessions we have already.
112

112

00:06:32,382  -->  00:06:39,370
So int numberGameSessions and
what does that equal?
113

113

00:06:39,370  -->  00:06:41,510
Well, we need to find how
many sessions there are.
114

114

00:06:41,510  -->  00:06:47,065
So I say FindObjectsOfType and again,
I'm gonna do the s a few different times.
115

115

00:06:47,065  -->  00:06:49,170
So you're like, there's an s in there,
don't forget that.
116

116

00:06:49,170  -->  00:06:51,897
That's the most common thing,
if this line of code's not going well,
117

117

00:06:51,897  -->  00:06:53,223
it's cuz we've forgotten the s.
118

118

00:06:53,223  -->  00:06:55,067
It's game objects of type.
119

119

00:06:55,067  -->  00:06:59,247
We're looking for GameSession().
120

120

00:06:59,247  -->  00:07:00,895
How do we know how long it is?
121

121

00:07:00,895  -->  00:07:03,879
Well, we type in length, okay?
122

122

00:07:06,271  -->  00:07:10,058
Now we need to do our if, so
123

123

00:07:10,058  -->  00:07:15,746
if (numberGameSessions &gt; 1) curly
124

124

00:07:15,746  -->  00:07:22,470
brace space we will Destroy(gameObject);
125

125

00:07:22,470  -->  00:07:29,211
else DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject);.
126

126

00:07:29,211  -->  00:07:32,780
Save that looking good except we
don't have our colored braces.
127

127

00:07:32,780  -->  00:07:34,430
Being a little bit hasty here,
128

128

00:07:34,430  -->  00:07:37,955
curly braces that wrap around our
code block of DontdestroyOnLoad.
129

129

00:07:37,955  -->  00:07:39,070
Okay, that's looking pretty good,
130

130

00:07:39,070  -->  00:07:41,320
we've got our single term
we're running it on Awake.
131

131

00:07:41,320  -->  00:07:42,640
We're calling it on Awake.
132

132

00:07:42,640  -->  00:07:46,490
Next up we want to add three public
133

133

00:07:46,490  -->  00:07:49,770
methods that we can call from
other scripts or other areas and
134

134

00:07:49,770  -->  00:07:54,390
we get rid of start, don't need that,
also don't need update so clear those out.
135

135

00:07:54,390  -->  00:07:57,500
Public method number one is gonna be for
getting the score, so
136

136

00:07:57,500  -->  00:08:00,470
public int GetScore().
137

137

00:08:00,470  -->  00:08:02,460
Why is it an int I ask you?
138

138

00:08:02,460  -->  00:08:07,680
It's an int because we have to return
a value, and that value is score, and
139

139

00:08:07,680  -->  00:08:12,630
the score is an int, so whenever we call
that it will return score which is an int.
140

140

00:08:12,630  -->  00:08:16,723
Next public method, public,
this will be void, there's no return type.
141

141

00:08:16,723  -->  00:08:22,168
We'll call this AddToScore, this is
where another class or another moment in
142

142

00:08:22,168  -->  00:08:27,375
our game can say, hey, game session,
please add something to the score.
143

143

00:08:27,375  -->  00:08:28,320
What's the something?
144

144

00:08:28,320  -->  00:08:30,930
Well we need to know how many
points to add to the score.
145

145

00:08:30,930  -->  00:08:33,656
This is where we'll have a requirement
in here, we'll have a parameter.
146

146

00:08:33,656  -->  00:08:38,094
Which we will make it an int,
and we'll look for a score value.
147

147

00:08:38,094  -->  00:08:39,999
So if you want to call AddToScore,
148

148

00:08:39,999  -->  00:08:42,903
you need to tell me the score
value that I'm adding.
149

149

00:08:42,903  -->  00:08:47,626
And then within our method, within our
code block here we take out current score
150

150

00:08:47,626  -->  00:08:49,895
+=, what's it gonna plus equals?
151

151

00:08:49,895  -->  00:08:54,484
It's gonna plus equal ScoreValue, so
it is taking our current score and
152

152

00:08:54,484  -->  00:08:55,687
then adding to it,
153

153

00:08:55,687  -->  00:09:00,903
where the scoreValue is that was passed to
us by the thing that called add to score.
154

154

00:09:00,903  -->  00:09:02,953
We will make one more
Public Method while we are here.
155

155

00:09:02,953  -->  00:09:09,779
Public V=void ResetGame() and then {.
156

156

00:09:09,779  -->  00:09:10,624
What are we doing here?
157

157

00:09:10,624  -->  00:09:14,455
Well this is just simply destroying
this game session objects.
158

158

00:09:14,455  -->  00:09:19,168
So, Destroy(gameObject);.
159

159

00:09:19,168  -->  00:09:22,577
Okay, so there's game session all created,
looking pretty good,
160

160

00:09:22,577  -->  00:09:26,460
no functionality we can see in the game
just yet but that is pretty tight.
161

161

00:09:26,460  -->  00:09:32,060
Next up we need to find our score text and
specifically our score display.
162

162

00:09:32,060  -->  00:09:34,143
So we've already opened that I believe,
163

163

00:09:34,143  -->  00:09:36,413
score display here we go just nice and
empty.
164

164

00:09:36,413  -->  00:09:41,343
We're working in UI so
we want to start off by
165

165

00:09:41,343  -->  00:09:46,422
adding a namespace using UnityEngine.UI.
166

166

00:09:46,422  -->  00:09:50,850
And remember if you are using TextMeshPro
instead of just the text component,
167

167

00:09:50,850  -->  00:09:54,002
you'll need to add the TextMesh Pro
namespace in here or
168

168

00:09:54,002  -->  00:09:57,450
else things won't go as
you're expecting them.
169

169

00:09:57,450  -->  00:09:59,430
Now, what do we need to
do in our score display?
170

170

00:09:59,430  -->  00:10:04,110
First of all, we need to get the component
where we want to display the score.
171

171

00:10:04,110  -->  00:10:05,330
So if you have a look on your text,
172

172

00:10:05,330  -->  00:10:08,800
score text,
we have the text component just in here.
173

173

00:10:08,800  -->  00:10:12,240
So we need to get this, and
then within that we have the text field.
174

174

00:10:12,240  -->  00:10:15,174
So there's a lot of texts, I know we've
dealt with this in previous sections,
175

175

00:10:15,174  -->  00:10:20,430
text.text.text it feels like there's 70
text, but this is the text component and
176

176

00:10:20,430  -->  00:10:24,130
this is the text value of the text
field that is within that.
177

177

00:10:24,130  -->  00:10:29,270
So to get access to that text component we
start off by creating ourselves a variable
178

178

00:10:29,270  -->  00:10:34,740
to store that in which will be a text
type variable called scoreText;.
179

179

00:10:34,740  -->  00:10:36,051
And in the scoreText;.
180

180

00:10:36,051  -->  00:10:39,955
And then when we start our game,
we need to give scoreText a value,
181

181

00:10:39,955  -->  00:10:42,064
which is going to be the component.
182

182

00:10:42,064  -->  00:10:49,980
So GetComponent&lt;Text&gt;();.
183

183

00:10:49,980  -->  00:10:54,030
Okay, so get the component text
stored as this scoreText variable,
184

184

00:10:54,030  -->  00:10:57,720
which we've declared as a type of text,
excellent.
185

185

00:10:57,720  -->  00:11:02,610
Next, we need to do similar for
finding where the score is coming from and
186

186

00:11:02,610  -->  00:11:05,580
we know the score is going to
be stored in game session.
187

187

00:11:05,580  -->  00:11:09,970
So let's create a type GameSession.
188

188

00:11:09,970  -->  00:11:14,250
We'll call this gameSession
with a small g, semi-colon.
189

189

00:11:14,250  -->  00:11:19,700
Now also on the start when our
score display comes into existence,
190

190

00:11:19,700  -->  00:11:23,040
we need to go and find the game session.
191

191

00:11:23,040  -->  00:11:27,945
So we need to define gameSession that
we've just created as a variable as, well,
192

192

00:11:27,945  -->  00:11:30,803
we need to define it as
this gameSession class.
193

193

00:11:30,803  -->  00:11:34,931
So that's a type, we need to
194

194

00:11:34,931  -->  00:11:41,645
FindObjectOfType &lt;GameSession&gt;();.
195

195

00:11:41,645  -->  00:11:44,427
So we've gone and got ourselves
a reference to the component,
196

196

00:11:44,427  -->  00:11:47,745
and we've gone and got ourselves
a reference to the GameSession.
197

197

00:11:47,745  -->  00:11:50,820
Now on update, all we need to do is to say
198

198

00:11:50,820  -->  00:11:58,650
scoreText.text=gameSession.
199

199

00:11:58,650  -->  00:12:04,858
What's our method that we've created
in game session, we're looking for
200

200

00:12:04,858  -->  00:12:11,083
get score because we need to know
the score so gamesession.GetScore().
201

201

00:12:11,083  -->  00:12:15,804
And then we need to be converting
this into a string because we
202

202

00:12:15,804  -->  00:12:18,221
have an integer at the moment.
203

203

00:12:18,221  -->  00:12:22,496
The score itself is a integer and
our text field is a string.
204

204

00:12:22,496  -->  00:12:29,850
So to convert out integer into
a string we say ToString();.
205

205

00:12:29,850  -->  00:12:32,202
Sets are looking pretty good,
let's jump over to Unity,
206

206

00:12:32,202  -->  00:12:34,554
see if we've got any sort of
different behavior going on.
207

207

00:12:34,554  -->  00:12:38,910
We should have, yes, it goes from allow
placeholder zeros to just one zero.
208

208

00:12:38,910  -->  00:12:44,028
And then no score going up,
but so far, so good.
209

209

00:12:44,028  -->  00:12:46,380
Okay, so how do we make our score go up?
210

210

00:12:46,380  -->  00:12:49,070
Where is it happening that
our score should go up?
211

211

00:12:49,070  -->  00:12:51,970
Well, at the moment, we've only
got enemies in our game, that's,
212

212

00:12:51,970  -->  00:12:53,080
we shoot them, we get points.
213

213

00:12:53,080  -->  00:12:57,920
So let's go on find out enemy script,
without enemy script we need to start off
214

214

00:12:57,920  -->  00:13:00,975
by creating a concept that
the enemies give us points.
215

215

00:13:00,975  -->  00:13:04,490
And I've been putting this off for
awhile but I can't put it off any longer.
216

216

00:13:04,490  -->  00:13:07,885
Let's tidy up our variables so
it's tidy in our inspector and
217

217

00:13:07,885  -->  00:13:10,901
tidy in our script cause this
is a big old blob of stuff.
218

218

00:13:10,901  -->  00:13:18,541
So I'm gonna create a [Header("")].
219

219

00:13:18,541  -->  00:13:19,460
What are we gonna say in here.
220

220

00:13:19,460  -->  00:13:22,843
Well, first up we've got enemy stats,
this looks like.
221

221

00:13:22,843  -->  00:13:24,285
We've got some enemy stats.
222

222

00:13:24,285  -->  00:13:28,176
I'm gonna go and
create a new enemy stat which will be
223

223

00:13:28,176  -->  00:13:33,470
SerializeField of integer type
that I will call scoreValue.
224

224

00:13:33,470  -->  00:13:37,290
That'll be the scoreValue of
this particular enemy, and
225

225

00:13:37,290  -->  00:13:39,730
that will equal 150;.
226

226

00:13:39,730  -->  00:13:45,130
Cool, next up, let's see,
copy my header code and then paste
227

227

00:13:45,130  -->  00:13:50,690
that above the next blob of code this blob
of code is all about shooting, I believe.
228

228

00:13:50,690  -->  00:13:54,000
Shooting, we have counter shot projectile,
projectile.
229

229

00:13:54,000  -->  00:13:56,590
Okay, after my last projectile,
a couple of spaces.
230

230

00:13:56,590  -->  00:13:58,600
Paste in our header again.
231

231

00:13:59,710  -->  00:14:00,500
What are these all about?
232

232

00:14:00,500  -->  00:14:01,790
This is all about sound effects.
233

233

00:14:01,790  -->  00:14:03,560
Sound effects.
234

234

00:14:03,560  -->  00:14:05,510
Okay, so much tardier.
235

235

00:14:05,510  -->  00:14:07,570
I'm much happier with that.
236

236

00:14:07,570  -->  00:14:09,087
Now, we've created score value.
237

237

00:14:09,087  -->  00:14:12,604
Let's go and find where we
will make our score increase.
238

238

00:14:12,604  -->  00:14:16,335
I think when the enemy dies,
that's a good place to increase the score.
239

239

00:14:16,335  -->  00:14:17,755
So what are we doing here?
240

240

00:14:17,755  -->  00:14:20,803
Let's just go remind ourselves
over in game session,
241

241

00:14:20,803  -->  00:14:22,802
we've got our AddToScore method.
242

242

00:14:22,802  -->  00:14:25,904
How do we call add to score
method from another script?
243

243

00:14:25,904  -->  00:14:30,277
Well, we say FindObjectOfType,
244

244

00:14:30,277  -->  00:14:35,715
we're looking for the GameSession().
245

245

00:14:35,715  -->  00:14:41,597
This is what we call our AddToScore();.
246

246

00:14:41,597  -->  00:14:45,820
Semi-colon is not working because,
can you guess why not?
247

247

00:14:45,820  -->  00:14:47,965
Because we need to give it a value.
248

248

00:14:47,965  -->  00:14:51,100
A reminder,
over here we need the value of scoreValue,
249

249

00:14:51,100  -->  00:14:54,760
you need to tell it how many points you're
worth, you can't just let it guess.
250

250

00:14:54,760  -->  00:14:56,860
So in here, it's gonna be nice and simple.
251

251

00:14:56,860  -->  00:15:01,170
We have our scoreValue and
we've named it the same, clever us.
252

252

00:15:01,170  -->  00:15:04,650
ScoreValue, so back down into AddToScore.
253

253

00:15:04,650  -->  00:15:06,990
Score value blank.
254

254

00:15:08,230  -->  00:15:09,500
Okay, let's save all that up.
255

255

00:15:09,500  -->  00:15:12,030
I think we have implemented everything.
256

256

00:15:12,030  -->  00:15:12,870
Click on play.
257

257

00:15:12,870  -->  00:15:14,050
What's gonna go on here?
258

258

00:15:14,050  -->  00:15:15,715
We will from zero [INAUDIBLE].
259

259

00:15:15,715  -->  00:15:17,602
Okay, score's going up 300, 600.
260

260

00:15:17,602  -->  00:15:19,600
Excellent, success.
261

261

00:15:19,600  -->  00:15:23,460
But when we die we get a moment
to look at the score but
262

262

00:15:23,460  -->  00:15:27,080
there's no real moment on here where I can
look at the score, call my friend over.
263

263

00:15:27,080  -->  00:15:29,480
Hey, look, I beat your score,
whatever it might be,
264

264

00:15:29,480  -->  00:15:32,210
so let's have the score
display on the screen as well.
265

265

00:15:32,210  -->  00:15:36,600
And we've set ourselves up with our
game session is a singleton, so
266

266

00:15:36,600  -->  00:15:37,680
it will continue.
267

267

00:15:37,680  -->  00:15:39,930
It will exist and
live into the next screen,
268

268

00:15:39,930  -->  00:15:42,300
which is very important, the next scene.
269

269

00:15:42,300  -->  00:15:45,220
So I've prefabbed that good stuff.
270

270

00:15:45,220  -->  00:15:47,270
The game canvas, here's a little thing.
271

271

00:15:47,270  -->  00:15:50,820
I wasn't planning on doing this, but
just spur of the moment, I think I will.
272

272

00:15:50,820  -->  00:15:53,650
See how we currently have
our game canvas prefab, and
273

273

00:15:53,650  -->  00:15:55,560
there's only one element
here the score text.
274

274

00:15:55,560  -->  00:15:58,900
So I'll click on apply, so
now our game canvas and
275

275

00:15:58,900  -->  00:16:03,350
score text have been updated
in terms of the prefab.
276

276

00:16:03,350  -->  00:16:09,245
So if we say all this up, jump over
into [SOUND] where are we, the scene.
277

277

00:16:09,245  -->  00:16:10,697
Game Over scene.
278

278

00:16:10,697  -->  00:16:16,297
If I find my prefab and
drag the Game Canvas
279

279

00:16:16,297  -->  00:16:21,424
into this scene, it adds it in there.
280

280

00:16:21,424  -->  00:16:22,982
We can have multiple canvases,
281

281

00:16:22,982  -->  00:16:25,929
you can have a whole ton of
canvases doing different things.
282

282

00:16:25,929  -->  00:16:28,877
That's something that we haven't
talked about much because we've
283

283

00:16:28,877  -->  00:16:31,469
been putting everything under
the one particular canvas but
284

284

00:16:31,469  -->  00:16:33,565
you could turn our particular
canvas on and off.
285

285

00:16:33,565  -->  00:16:35,418
You can move the canvases around.
286

286

00:16:35,418  -->  00:16:40,329
So this game canvas, I'm gonna change
the position of it, of the score text.
287

287

00:16:40,329  -->  00:16:46,091
I'm gonna change the score text position
to be, let's see in the middle just there.
288

288

00:16:46,091  -->  00:16:47,971
So the score goes form
being up in the top right,
289

289

00:16:47,971  -->  00:16:50,803
when it's game over you get the score
right in the middle of the screen.
290

290

00:16:50,803  -->  00:16:54,415
Do a couple of things in here,
I will just drag it to the right, and
291

291

00:16:54,415  -->  00:16:55,970
drag it to the left so.
292

292

00:16:55,970  -->  00:16:58,110
And then center align so
I know it's right in the middle.
293

293

00:16:58,110  -->  00:17:01,640
And then we need to
change the anchor point,
294

294

00:17:01,640  -->  00:17:03,640
rather than the anchor point
being up in the top right.
295

295

00:17:03,640  -->  00:17:06,490
That's gonna be a little bit messy
if our resolution or our pixel,
296

296

00:17:06,490  -->  00:17:08,130
aspect ratio changes.
297

297

00:17:08,130  -->  00:17:11,400
Let's anchor this right into
the very middle of our screen.
298

298

00:17:13,080  -->  00:17:15,670
Okay, there might be a little bit
of tidy up of anchoring our other
299

299

00:17:15,670  -->  00:17:16,460
elements in the scene.
300

300

00:17:16,460  -->  00:17:17,340
I'm not gonna go through that.
301

301

00:17:17,340  -->  00:17:20,090
You know how to do that now in terms
of anchoring things into a particular
302

302

00:17:20,090  -->  00:17:22,260
position if the aspect ratio is changing,
303

303

00:17:22,260  -->  00:17:24,680
but this is all looking pretty cool for
now.
304

304

00:17:24,680  -->  00:17:26,770
We're getting an error down the bottom,
assertion failed.
305

305

00:17:26,770  -->  00:17:29,210
I think that might have just been
cuz I was playing around and
306

306

00:17:29,210  -->  00:17:29,950
moving things around.
307

307

00:17:29,950  -->  00:17:32,020
We'll clear it and we'll see if it
comes up again and then we'll go and
308

308

00:17:32,020  -->  00:17:34,220
dive in and
see what needs to happen to fix it.
309

309

00:17:34,220  -->  00:17:38,740
But let's go back to start, we'll go
back to the very start of our game,
310

310

00:17:38,740  -->  00:17:41,682
very start start, click on START menu.
311

311

00:17:41,682  -->  00:17:46,768
Okay, so click on START, and then sorry,
click on Play, and then START.
312

312

00:17:46,768  -->  00:17:48,810
We will [SOUND] start our start.
313

313

00:17:48,810  -->  00:17:51,824
Okay, score is going up,
excellent, we crash into someone.
314

314

00:17:51,824  -->  00:17:53,333
[SOUND] 1050.
315

315

00:17:53,333  -->  00:17:54,538
Is 1050 retained?
316

316

00:17:54,538  -->  00:17:55,962
Yes, it is, all the way here.
317

317

00:17:55,962  -->  00:18:00,124
What happens when we play again,
goes to zero, and, okay, so
318

318

00:18:00,124  -->  00:18:01,942
our score's not going up.
319

319

00:18:01,942  -->  00:18:02,667
Why is that?
320

320

00:18:02,667  -->  00:18:10,142
I suspect because we are not properly
resetting our level loading.
321

321

00:18:10,142  -->  00:18:13,702
So let's have a look at
our gamesession in here.
322

322

00:18:13,702  -->  00:18:16,158
We've created ResetGame,
which was clever of us, but
323

323

00:18:16,158  -->  00:18:17,943
we're not actually calling it any way.
324

324

00:18:17,943  -->  00:18:20,283
Where would we reset our game?
325

325

00:18:20,283  -->  00:18:22,008
I think that's gonna be in level,
isn't it?
326

326

00:18:22,008  -->  00:18:25,144
When the player says load the game,
so load the game scene,
327

327

00:18:25,144  -->  00:18:26,857
that's where we need to reset.
328

328

00:18:26,857  -->  00:18:30,122
So once again, how do we find
this particular public method?
329

329

00:18:30,122  -->  00:18:34,703
We will say FindObjectOfType and
330

330

00:18:34,703  -->  00:18:38,957
it is type GameSession() and
331

331

00:18:38,957  -->  00:18:44,450
we're calling ResetGame();.
332

332

00:18:44,450  -->  00:18:46,450
Okay, resetting game, so save this.
333

333

00:18:46,450  -->  00:18:48,440
I'll jump back over into Unity,
click on play.
334

334

00:18:48,440  -->  00:18:50,410
See what we can do with
the full loop now if we can,
335

335

00:18:50,410  -->  00:18:52,380
then we'll declare this success.
336

336

00:18:52,380  -->  00:18:54,190
Click on start, shoot, shoot, shoot.
337

337

00:18:54,190  -->  00:18:57,170
Get some points, shoot, shoot, die.
338

338

00:18:57,170  -->  00:18:59,880
600 should be retained in here,
you can put an extra
339

339

00:18:59,880  -->  00:19:04,010
text run here saying you scored or
your score is 600, if you like.
340

340

00:19:04,010  -->  00:19:07,892
Back to main menu,
click on Start, start at 0,
341

341

00:19:07,892  -->  00:19:11,890
scores goes up and
then [SOUND] back into Game Over.
342

342

00:19:11,890  -->  00:19:13,670
One more thing we need to try play again.
343

343

00:19:13,670  -->  00:19:15,060
Yeah, and the score does go up.
344

344

00:19:15,060  -->  00:19:16,290
Okay, just a quick side note here,
345

345

00:19:16,290  -->  00:19:19,280
I had a couple of errors on my screen
here, I just went and cleared them,
346

346

00:19:19,280  -->  00:19:22,090
played the game through a couple of time
and the errors don't come back again.
347

347

00:19:22,090  -->  00:19:25,100
So I forgot to mention that
before I pause the video,
348

348

00:19:25,100  -->  00:19:28,410
but I've cleared out all the errors
just in case you're wondering.
349

349

00:19:28,410  -->  00:19:31,860
So great work in this lecture,
great work with your progress.
350

350

00:19:31,860  -->  00:19:34,260
Pretty excited to see score in our game.
351

351

00:19:34,260  -->  00:19:36,780
We can implement it in so
many more places now.
352

352

00:19:36,780  -->  00:19:38,690
We can have it when you shoot an enemy,
353

353

00:19:38,690  -->  00:19:41,540
the enemy spawns a whole bunch of
little coins that you go pick up.
354

354

00:19:41,540  -->  00:19:43,080
Like little pickups for points.
355

355

00:19:43,080  -->  00:19:45,950
It could be that you just
have super mega point
356

356

00:19:45,950  -->  00:19:48,030
things floating down your
screen that you can pick up.
357

357

00:19:48,030  -->  00:19:51,670
Lots of places you can do it above and
beyond I just shoot an enemy and
358

358

00:19:51,670  -->  00:19:52,480
I get points.
359

359

00:19:52,480  -->  00:19:55,844
So great work with this lecture,
great work with your progress, and
360

360

00:19:55,844  -->  00:19:57,420
I'll see you in the next video.
