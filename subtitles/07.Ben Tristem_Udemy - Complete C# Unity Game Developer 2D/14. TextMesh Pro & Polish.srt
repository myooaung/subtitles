00:00:00,205  -->  00:00:05,055
[SOUND]
In
2

2

00:00:05,055  -->  00:00:07,908
this video we're gonna take a moment to
just finish off the polish for our game.
3

3

00:00:07,908  -->  00:00:11,150
We'll update our title using TextMesh Pro,
4

4

00:00:11,150  -->  00:00:14,100
I'll take you through the process
on how to use that and we'll just
5

5

00:00:14,100  -->  00:00:17,760
put a little bit of flair into our color
to try to get it to match our fame.
6

6

00:00:17,760  -->  00:00:20,870
So let's do some polishing of our game.
7

7

00:00:20,870  -->  00:00:24,280
Unity has a lot of goodies that we
can find in our Package Manager.
8

8

00:00:24,280  -->  00:00:28,780
So let's go out to Window, and
then scroll down and see Package Manager.
9

9

00:00:28,780  -->  00:00:32,020
Click on Package Manager, and you'll
see the first button here, In Project.
10

10

00:00:32,020  -->  00:00:34,480
These are the things that we
currently have in our project.
11

11

00:00:34,480  -->  00:00:39,330
Click on All, it will show you all of
the available packages that we can access
12

12

00:00:39,330  -->  00:00:42,300
to add more functionality to Unity.
13

13

00:00:42,300  -->  00:00:46,320
I'm gonna look all the way down the bottom
here I can see TextMesh Pro, click on
14

14

00:00:46,320  -->  00:00:50,620
Install, whatever number it says for you
that should be the latest install that.
15

15

00:00:50,620  -->  00:00:52,610
Click on that, wait for
it to work its magic.
16

16

00:00:52,610  -->  00:00:57,460
It will probably do some importing and
some compiling and
17

17

00:00:57,460  -->  00:01:01,510
some just general thinking and
grinding behind the scenes.
18

18

00:01:01,510  -->  00:01:06,720
When it's finished doing that, you will
see In Project you'll see TextMesh Pro.
19

19

00:01:06,720  -->  00:01:10,370
After you have TextMesh Pro installed,
close the Packet Manager,
20

20

00:01:10,370  -->  00:01:14,760
head up to Window, scroll down and
find TextMesh Pro.
21

21

00:01:14,760  -->  00:01:17,780
Now, if like me,
it doesn't exist, it's not there,
22

22

00:01:17,780  -->  00:01:22,400
it's not down the bottom of your Window
list here, what I had to just now was
23

23

00:01:22,400  -->  00:01:26,290
close Unity and restart Unity and
there it is, TextMesh Pro.
24

24

00:01:26,290  -->  00:01:29,250
So if you're not finding it there,
you might need to do a restart.
25

25

00:01:29,250  -->  00:01:34,290
So if you've got TextMeshPro,
click on the Font Asset Creator.
26

26

00:01:34,290  -->  00:01:36,550
And again we'll have another
set of importing to do.
27

27

00:01:36,550  -->  00:01:40,140
It asks us to import the TMP,
TextMesh Pro, essentials.
28

28

00:01:40,140  -->  00:01:41,440
Click on Import.
29

29

00:01:41,440  -->  00:01:43,120
Again, wait for it to work its magic.
30

30

00:01:43,120  -->  00:01:45,870
This is all stuff that's useful but
takes a little bit of time to do.
31

31

00:01:45,870  -->  00:01:47,200
Little bit of time to set up.
32

32

00:01:47,200  -->  00:01:49,898
Once we've done it once on our project,
we won't need to do it again.
33

33

00:01:49,898  -->  00:01:55,520
And just to be thorough and complete
we'll import the other examples and
34

34

00:01:55,520  -->  00:01:58,940
extras just in case you want to play
around some more in TextMesh Pro
35

35

00:01:58,940  -->  00:02:02,170
will have those imported just so
everything, we've got it all.
36

36

00:02:02,170  -->  00:02:04,160
We've got all the things that
we have access to at the moment.
37

37

00:02:06,500  -->  00:02:11,903
After that, you can close this
TMP importer window, close that.
38

38

00:02:11,903  -->  00:02:15,088
Now we have the Font Creator
window in front of us.
39

39

00:02:15,088  -->  00:02:18,468
Now the first thing we need
to do is create some font.
40

40

00:02:18,468  -->  00:02:20,143
TextMesh Pro needs to take in font and
41

41

00:02:20,143  -->  00:02:22,450
then generate its own
font atlas from that.
42

42

00:02:22,450  -->  00:02:24,570
So, let's go find a font to use.
43

43

00:02:24,570  -->  00:02:28,320
I've given you a link in the resource
is to dafront and you can search for
44

44

00:02:28,320  -->  00:02:29,720
whatever seems to make sense to you.
45

45

00:02:29,720  -->  00:02:33,720
So I could search for steam punk for
example cuz that's what I'm using.
46

46

00:02:33,720  -->  00:02:36,470
I know that when I search for steam punk
I'm not gonna get a lot of hits, so,
47

47

00:02:36,470  -->  00:02:37,880
I just search for punk.
48

48

00:02:37,880  -->  00:02:41,016
And I've searched this search
earlier after I searched for punk,
49

49

00:02:41,016  -->  00:02:42,920
I found there are a whole
bunch of them and
50

50

00:02:42,920  -->  00:02:45,835
I scrolled all the way down the bottom and
found this one.
51

51

00:02:45,835  -->  00:02:49,170
It's called the TC Fuzzy punky slippers.
52

52

00:02:49,170  -->  00:02:52,470
So, font is a very personal thing.
53

53

00:02:52,470  -->  00:02:55,530
Search for what you want, have a look
at what you want, see if it works.
54

54

00:02:55,530  -->  00:02:58,230
Try to match it to the theme of your game,
that's pretty important.
55

55

00:02:58,230  -->  00:03:00,250
But at the end of the day, it's up to you.
56

56

00:03:00,250  -->  00:03:03,560
One thing I will say is that I'm
looking for 100% free fonts.
57

57

00:03:03,560  -->  00:03:07,720
Under font, you can see it says 100%
free or free for personal use, or
58

58

00:03:07,720  -->  00:03:10,260
donation ware, or you have to pay for it.
59

59

00:03:10,260  -->  00:03:12,330
For now I'm just looking for 100% free.
60

60

00:03:12,330  -->  00:03:17,310
Make sure you always know the licensing
agreement before you go and
61

61

00:03:17,310  -->  00:03:19,040
put your font into your game.
62

62

00:03:19,040  -->  00:03:22,080
Make sure you're fair to
the person who created it and
63

63

00:03:22,080  -->  00:03:24,820
abide by whatever licensing they ask for.
64

64

00:03:24,820  -->  00:03:26,600
So once you found your font,
click on Download.
65

65

00:03:26,600  -->  00:03:29,072
That will download your font file.
66

66

00:03:31,600  -->  00:03:33,880
Go and find that in the folder
where it's downloaded.
67

67

00:03:33,880  -->  00:03:35,960
It's for me, it's over here.
68

68

00:03:35,960  -->  00:03:38,710
It will provide a zip file so
we'll unzip that.
69

69

00:03:38,710  -->  00:03:42,590
I'm just right click dragging and
saying extract here.
70

70

00:03:42,590  -->  00:03:44,230
And if you don't have
a way of unzipping or
71

71

00:03:44,230  -->  00:03:47,530
you're not sure how to unzip then that
might be a quick google search for you,
72

72

00:03:47,530  -->  00:03:50,840
how to unzip on what particular
platform you're using.
73

73

00:03:50,840  -->  00:03:53,887
It's gonna be different on Mac, different
on Windows, you might have something
74

74

00:03:53,887  -->  00:03:56,770
installed already so I'm not gonna dig
in to all the different ways to unzip.
75

75

00:03:56,770  -->  00:03:58,967
That might be a google
search if you don't.
76

76

00:03:58,967  -->  00:04:00,996
If it's not as easy for you as it was for
77

77

00:04:00,996  -->  00:04:05,410
me just right clicking it then having
Extract Here or Unzip Here as an option.
78

78

00:04:05,410  -->  00:04:10,220
Now that we have our font file,
you can see here our VTC fuzzy
79

79

00:04:10,220  -->  00:04:13,820
punky snippets or
whatever your particular font is.
80

80

00:04:13,820  -->  00:04:16,070
I'm gonna head back over into Unity.
81

81

00:04:16,070  -->  00:04:20,870
Just pop this window out of the way for
a moment and I will find, I'll make a new
82

82

00:04:20,870  -->  00:04:24,720
folder actually, new folder,
Create Folder I'll call this fonts.
83

83

00:04:25,780  -->  00:04:27,970
Double click on that so
I'm within the fonts folder.
84

84

00:04:27,970  -->  00:04:31,760
Jump back to my Windows
where I have the font file.
85

85

00:04:31,760  -->  00:04:33,840
I can drag the font into Unity.
86

86

00:04:33,840  -->  00:04:35,660
And you can see it's sitting there.
87

87

00:04:35,660  -->  00:04:38,460
It knows that it's a font file, wonderful.
88

88

00:04:38,460  -->  00:04:41,200
Bring back my Font Creator window here.
89

89

00:04:41,200  -->  00:04:42,670
We can navigate to Window,
90

90

00:04:42,670  -->  00:04:47,070
TextMeshPro, Font Asset Creator
if you happen to misplace it.
91

91

00:04:47,070  -->  00:04:47,820
Here we go.
92

92

00:04:47,820  -->  00:04:51,960
Now, I drag in the font that I found
into where it says Font Source.
93

93

00:04:51,960  -->  00:04:54,350
Or I could have clicked
the selector as we usually do.
94

94

00:04:54,350  -->  00:04:57,720
And I will leave everything default,
generate font atlas.
95

95

00:04:57,720  -->  00:04:58,870
Again, a little bit more thinking.
96

96

00:04:58,870  -->  00:05:00,420
There’s a lot of thinking [LAUGH].
97

97

00:05:00,420  -->  00:05:04,160
Thinking, importing, and
creation in this process.
98

98

00:05:04,160  -->  00:05:05,490
But once we’ve got it done,
99

99

00:05:05,490  -->  00:05:07,620
we won’t have to do any more
of this thinking and creating.
100

100

00:05:07,620  -->  00:05:08,460
It will be done.
101

101

00:05:09,480  -->  00:05:11,420
Okay, there we go we've
created our font atlas.
102

102

00:05:11,420  -->  00:05:12,550
Now we can do a save.
103

103

00:05:12,550  -->  00:05:14,852
It will ask us where we want it to save.
104

104

00:05:14,852  -->  00:05:19,250
I'm gonna save it into
fonts just as it is, Save.
105

105

00:05:19,250  -->  00:05:24,276
Wonderful, now we have a font atlas
that is a .asset file that has all
106

106

00:05:24,276  -->  00:05:29,836
of the information in it that TextMesh Pro
needs to be able to work its magic.
107

107

00:05:29,836  -->  00:05:34,035
Back over into our canvas,
I am going to right-click and
108

108

00:05:34,035  -->  00:05:39,120
create UI &gt; TextMesh Pro text,
that will give us a new piece of text.
109

109

00:05:39,120  -->  00:05:44,410
I will just resize my windows a little
bit here so I can see it nice and easily.
110

110

00:05:44,410  -->  00:05:47,660
Drag it up over to where we
currently say My Name Game.
111

111

00:05:47,660  -->  00:05:50,540
What if we called
My Game Name here Title Text.
112

112

00:05:50,540  -->  00:05:54,050
I'm going to delete Title Text, we don't
need that anymore, thank you very much.
113

113

00:05:54,050  -->  00:05:58,580
And our TextMesh Pro Text I'm
gonna rename that to Title Text.
114

114

00:05:58,580  -->  00:06:03,335
You are now the champion of Title Text,
you've ousted the pretender.
115

115

00:06:03,335  -->  00:06:05,320
[LAUGH] Here it it.
116

116

00:06:05,320  -->  00:06:09,675
And once again we can type
into the box just in here.
117

117

00:06:09,675  -->  00:06:13,468
We can type in whatever our
game is gonna be called.
118

118

00:06:13,468  -->  00:06:14,777
For now I'm still waiting for
119

119

00:06:14,777  -->  00:06:17,510
you guys to let me know what you
think my game should be called.
120

120

00:06:17,510  -->  00:06:21,570
For now I'll call it steam,
121

121

00:06:21,570  -->  00:06:25,300
no that's a little bit too obvious,
we'll call it air ship.
122

122

00:06:26,300  -->  00:06:30,810
No, I'm gonna call it the injured pilot,
there we go.
123

123

00:06:30,810  -->  00:06:32,820
That was part of what I
had in my design document.
124

124

00:06:32,820  -->  00:06:33,840
The injured pilot, why not.
125

125

00:06:33,840  -->  00:06:36,980
It doesn't really tell us anything
about the steam punkiness of it.
126

126

00:06:36,980  -->  00:06:39,610
But for now that shall be my placeholder.
127

127

00:06:39,610  -->  00:06:41,610
A lot of things,
when you're making a game.
128

128

00:06:41,610  -->  00:06:44,770
You'll have these titles and
you'll have the name of your project.
129

129

00:06:44,770  -->  00:06:47,006
Don't get too attached to it at the start.
130

130

00:06:47,006  -->  00:06:51,660
Wait until you've had people play your
game and you get a feel for it and
131

131

00:06:51,660  -->  00:06:53,700
then you can do your name later on.
132

132

00:06:53,700  -->  00:06:56,770
Name something I find you don't
really lock in until the very end.
133

133

00:06:56,770  -->  00:06:57,800
Okay, same with before.
134

134

00:06:57,800  -->  00:06:59,870
We've got our usual kind
of font settings in here.
135

135

00:06:59,870  -->  00:07:03,250
We can send for
a line by finding our alignment button.
136

136

00:07:03,250  -->  00:07:05,722
We can align within the middle of the box.
137

137

00:07:05,722  -->  00:07:07,870
I'm gonna make a little bit more
room right now [INAUDIBLE] so
138

138

00:07:07,870  -->  00:07:09,570
you can see it all.
139

139

00:07:09,570  -->  00:07:12,822
We can select the middle,
change the font size.
140

140

00:07:12,822  -->  00:07:15,981
We'll make the font size here what, 80?
141

141

00:07:15,981  -->  00:07:19,215
You know what I should do is select the
font that we just took all that time to
142

142

00:07:19,215  -->  00:07:20,700
bring into our project.
143

143

00:07:20,700  -->  00:07:24,280
Going to drop down our properties
down here so it's not in the way.
144

144

00:07:24,280  -->  00:07:26,080
Let's see, where do we find our font.
145

145

00:07:26,080  -->  00:07:28,190
It's right in here, Font Asset.
146

146

00:07:28,190  -->  00:07:30,105
Click on our Button selector.
147

147

00:07:30,105  -->  00:07:32,645
We’re looking for
VTC Fuzzy Punky Slippers or
148

148

00:07:32,645  -->  00:07:34,505
whatever your font was
that you just brought in.
149

149

00:07:34,505  -->  00:07:35,689
Double-click on that and
150

150

00:07:35,689  -->  00:07:38,716
then you can see a much more
interesting font than we’ve got here.
151

151

00:07:38,716  -->  00:07:41,994
I think again it needs to be a little
bit larger so I’ll pop mine up to 120.
152

152

00:07:41,994  -->  00:07:43,809
Okay, there we go.
153

153

00:07:43,809  -->  00:07:47,295
I’m not gonna finesse too much on
camera cuz you can finesse yours.
154

154

00:07:47,295  -->  00:07:49,860
It doesn’t need to look
exactly the same as mine.
155

155

00:07:49,860  -->  00:07:50,470
But there we go.
156

156

00:07:50,470  -->  00:07:51,526
We've got some interesting font.
157

157

00:07:51,526  -->  00:07:54,108
You could do the same
thing with your text font,
158

158

00:07:54,108  -->  00:07:58,195
I'd recommend not doing the same heading
font as you do for your text font.
159

159

00:07:58,195  -->  00:08:01,335
You wanna have it a little bit different,
this needs to be a lot more readable,
160

160

00:08:01,335  -->  00:08:04,150
this is more sort of for
the theme and the style of it.
161

161

00:08:04,150  -->  00:08:07,340
Before we jump off TextMesh Pro, I should
show you a couple of other things in here.
162

162

00:08:07,340  -->  00:08:10,410
There's a whole lot of,
if I'm clicked on title text,
163

163

00:08:10,410  -->  00:08:14,840
there's a whole lot of other options in
here so we can change the color of it.
164

164

00:08:14,840  -->  00:08:18,152
I can change the color
to maybe a dark red.
165

165

00:08:18,152  -->  00:08:20,360
I'm gonna get to colors in
this video in a moment.
166

166

00:08:20,360  -->  00:08:24,170
We can have an outline on our font here.
167

167

00:08:24,170  -->  00:08:27,290
I'm going to change the thickness of it,
so it's nice and thick.
168

168

00:08:27,290  -->  00:08:30,320
We can have and underlay,
a bevel, lighting.
169

169

00:08:30,320  -->  00:08:33,120
So, that lighting will give
a little bit of a sheen to it and
170

170

00:08:33,120  -->  00:08:34,560
change where the lighting is coming from.
171

171

00:08:34,560  -->  00:08:39,750
Maybe a yellow and
we'll do the light angle over this way.
172

172

00:08:39,750  -->  00:08:43,004
And then what we need to do, which I
often forget to do is click the Enable.
173

173

00:08:43,004  -->  00:08:47,195
When you click enable then that will
allow this particular setting to
174

174

00:08:47,195  -->  00:08:48,361
actually be used.
175

175

00:08:48,361  -->  00:08:51,369
And so when you move things around you
might see a little bit of difference,
176

176

00:08:51,369  -->  00:08:54,758
there we go, now I'm seeing a little bit,
not a lot using this lighting setting with
177

177

00:08:54,758  -->  00:08:56,602
the way that I've got
my other things set up.
178

178

00:08:56,602  -->  00:08:58,897
And bump map we're not gonna dig
into too much at the moment,
179

179

00:08:58,897  -->  00:09:01,113
Glow is the other thing that I
find actually has an impact.
180

180

00:09:01,113  -->  00:09:04,960
So we click the Enable and
scroll in a little bit here.
181

181

00:09:04,960  -->  00:09:08,190
You can see that there is a little bit of
this green glow if I offset it a little
182

182

00:09:08,190  -->  00:09:09,592
bit, then it's moved around.
183

183

00:09:09,592  -->  00:09:12,645
So, I'm not really going for something
that I think will look good just at
184

184

00:09:12,645  -->  00:09:16,045
the moment, I'm just showing you some of
the functionality and how to enable it by
185

185

00:09:16,045  -->  00:09:18,928
clicking on the box and then just
twiddling around with the sliders.
186

186

00:09:18,928  -->  00:09:23,236
So this is an introduction to TextMesh
Pro, as opposed to an intermediate, or
187

187

00:09:23,236  -->  00:09:26,390
advanced, how do we make our text look,
award winning.
188

188

00:09:26,390  -->  00:09:29,240
We're just getting to the point
where we know how to use the tool.
189

189

00:09:29,240  -->  00:09:30,390
So this is my font for now.
190

190

00:09:30,390  -->  00:09:34,020
What I need to do next is figure out
how I'm gonna manage all my colors.
191

191

00:09:34,020  -->  00:09:37,980
So I know it shouldn't have a bright
green outline, probably not.
192

192

00:09:37,980  -->  00:09:41,270
And let's talk about colors
a little bit for a moment.
193

193

00:09:41,270  -->  00:09:44,820
First thing I'm going to do is show you
where I get some inspiration for colors,
194

194

00:09:44,820  -->  00:09:50,740
so jumping over to the Adobe Color Picker.
195

195

00:09:50,740  -->  00:09:51,960
I call it the Adobe Color Picker.
196

196

00:09:51,960  -->  00:09:55,060
I don't think it's its official name,
but Adobe Color CC.
197

197

00:09:55,060  -->  00:09:58,700
I've given you the link for
this in the resources as always.
198

198

00:09:58,700  -->  00:10:02,008
You can see in here it shows some
harmonious color relationships, so
199

199

00:10:02,008  -->  00:10:04,801
we've got these five colors
as Imove the sliders around,
200

200

00:10:04,801  -->  00:10:07,266
we kind of get this sort
of feel that I'm going for.
201

201

00:10:07,266  -->  00:10:11,069
If we select it on Complementary,
it will show me complementary.
202

202

00:10:11,069  -->  00:10:15,603
If I select on say Monochromatic, it will
show me all of the similar kind of color.
203

203

00:10:15,603  -->  00:10:17,211
And there as we move this around and
204

204

00:10:17,211  -->  00:10:21,400
then you can see below is where we capture
the information for each of these.
205

205

00:10:21,400  -->  00:10:25,280
What I'm gonna do is search for a color
scheme cuz I'm not much of a color wizard.
206

206

00:10:25,280  -->  00:10:28,350
So I'm gonna come out to Explore,
you see a search box up here,
207

207

00:10:28,350  -->  00:10:32,950
I'm gonna type is steam punk and stand on
the shoulders of giants as they say and
208

208

00:10:32,950  -->  00:10:35,070
I like this particular theme over there.
209

209

00:10:35,070  -->  00:10:36,490
These colors are like those colors.
210

210

00:10:36,490  -->  00:10:38,920
So if you click on Edit Copy
you can come in here,
211

211

00:10:38,920  -->  00:10:40,630
see the colors that have been selected.
212

212

00:10:40,630  -->  00:10:41,910
Click on a particular one.
213

213

00:10:41,910  -->  00:10:43,735
We're after the hex value.
214

214

00:10:43,735  -->  00:10:47,250
Highlight the hex value,
copy that, jump back into Unity.
215

215

00:10:47,250  -->  00:10:49,570
What shall we have is that dark green.
216

216

00:10:49,570  -->  00:10:51,980
Maybe we will have our
camera background that.
217

217

00:10:51,980  -->  00:10:54,740
So my main camera,
click on the background.
218

218

00:10:54,740  -->  00:10:58,500
And down the bottom of our color
selector we have our hex of decimal,
219

219

00:10:58,500  -->  00:10:59,400
blink, there we go.
220

220

00:10:59,400  -->  00:11:01,610
We've got a greeny color.
221

221

00:11:01,610  -->  00:11:04,580
And back over into hue, what shall
we have is some of our other colors.
222

222

00:11:04,580  -->  00:11:06,910
We'll go with this other
different greeny color.
223

223

00:11:06,910  -->  00:11:12,850
Grab that, copy, back over into Unity,
we'll do that for maybe for our heading.
224

224

00:11:12,850  -->  00:11:17,050
Find the story back note,
the title background.
225

225

00:11:17,050  -->  00:11:18,790
Well named, thank you.
226

226

00:11:18,790  -->  00:11:23,490
And paste in there for our hex value and
that looks pretty gross but
227

227

00:11:23,490  -->  00:11:26,830
we haven't changed the color
on our heading just yet.
228

228

00:11:26,830  -->  00:11:29,450
So I'm gonna finesse mine a little bit,
play around with it.
229

229

00:11:29,450  -->  00:11:31,640
You don't need to see the exact
values that I'm using,
230

230

00:11:31,640  -->  00:11:33,910
cuz I don't want you
to match mine exactly.
231

231

00:11:33,910  -->  00:11:35,790
I want you to play around
with your own colors and
232

232

00:11:35,790  -->  00:11:37,270
do something that you think that works.
233

233

00:11:37,270  -->  00:11:39,755
But I'm gonna take a couple of
minutes to play around with my values.
234

234

00:11:39,755  -->  00:11:41,180
I'd like you to do the same.
235

235

00:11:41,180  -->  00:11:43,865
I've got a challenge for
you which is Polish The Look of your Game.
236

236

00:11:43,865  -->  00:11:46,483
Consider colors, consider your theme.
237

237

00:11:46,483  -->  00:11:48,882
If it's a steampunk theme,
you might wanna search for
238

238

00:11:48,882  -->  00:11:50,561
steampunk colors as I've just done.
239

239

00:11:50,561  -->  00:11:56,950
Use TextMesh Pro, at least for the title,
also for the main font if you would like.
240

240

00:11:56,950  -->  00:11:58,710
And then any other details you would like.
241

241

00:11:58,710  -->  00:11:59,430
Play around with it.
242

242

00:11:59,430  -->  00:12:01,590
Add some flares, add some finess, and
243

243

00:12:01,590  -->  00:12:05,820
then please I beg of you share
a screenshot in our Facebook group or
244

244

00:12:05,820  -->  00:12:09,870
our GameDev.tv community site cuz I
would love to see what you've come up.
245

245

00:12:09,870  -->  00:12:12,092
I would love to see your creation.
246

246

00:12:12,092  -->  00:12:15,900
So post a video, jump in,
do a bit of finessing with that.
247

247

00:12:15,900  -->  00:12:18,800
When you come back I'll just briefly
show you what I've done, and so
248

248

00:12:18,800  -->  00:12:20,510
you can see the conclusion of my polish.
249

249

00:12:20,510  -->  00:12:21,550
See you in a moment.
250

250

00:12:22,920  -->  00:12:23,920
Okay, welcome back.
251

251

00:12:23,920  -->  00:12:25,730
I've gone for a bit of a brown theme here.
252

252

00:12:25,730  -->  00:12:28,892
I've added these rectangles at the back.
253

253

00:12:28,892  -->  00:12:31,164
I've just called them story backgrounds,
stripe 1 and 2.
254

254

00:12:31,164  -->  00:12:33,100
Just to put a little flair back there.
255

255

00:12:33,100  -->  00:12:35,810
Click on the Play button
to show you full screen.
256

256

00:12:35,810  -->  00:12:38,088
And this is how my game looks.
257

257

00:12:38,088  -->  00:12:42,360
Played around with TextMesh Pro it takes,
so the colors aren't critical, you don't
258

258

00:12:42,360  -->  00:12:46,417
need to copy the colors that I have used,
use whatever colors your heart desires.
259

259

00:12:46,417  -->  00:12:50,140
I'm deliberately not showing them
to you to force you to go ahead and
260

260

00:12:50,140  -->  00:12:54,122
pick your own colors and create this
the way that you want it to look rather
261

261

00:12:54,122  -->  00:12:57,370
than just doing a copy and
paste of what I have done.
262

262

00:12:57,370  -->  00:13:00,610
So now that we finished polishing
our colors and putting a little bit
263

263

00:13:00,610  -->  00:13:04,795
of detail on our text, that concludes
the functionality aspect of this section.
264

264

00:13:04,795  -->  00:13:06,920
So great work,
you’ve made yourself a game engine.
265

265

00:13:06,920  -->  00:13:09,960
It looks pretty good, and
you can give this to people to play so
266

266

00:13:09,960  -->  00:13:12,060
they’ve got a full game experience.
267

267

00:13:12,060  -->  00:13:13,670
Well done, and
I’ll see you in the next video.
