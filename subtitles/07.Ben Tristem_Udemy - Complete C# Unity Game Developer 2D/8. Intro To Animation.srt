[MUSIC]

2

00:00:04,380  -->  00:00:08,634
In this video we're gonna talk about the
two main types of 2D animation that we'll
3

3

00:00:08,634  -->  00:00:09,557
be working with.
4

4

00:00:09,557  -->  00:00:12,581
Sprite sheet animation and
bone-based animation, and
5

5

00:00:12,581  -->  00:00:15,424
also importing a sprite sheet and
then slicing it up.
6

6

00:00:15,424  -->  00:00:20,540
So that we have a walk that we can use
to animate in our game in coming videos.
7

7

00:00:20,540  -->  00:00:22,610
So let's jump in and get started.
8

8

00:00:22,610  -->  00:00:26,770
Okay, so there's two types of
animation that we'll be implementing.
9

9

00:00:26,770  -->  00:00:31,200
Mostly sprite sheet animation but also
a little bit of bone-based animation so
10

10

00:00:31,200  -->  00:00:32,590
you can see what it's all about.
11

11

00:00:32,590  -->  00:00:35,950
Now before I get started and show you
a little explanation of the difference
12

12

00:00:35,950  -->  00:00:39,510
between the two, you might want to get
started downloading the resources.
13

13

00:00:39,510  -->  00:00:42,950
If you want to go and
get all of the Glitch resources,
14

14

00:00:42,950  -->  00:00:46,680
all of the images, and the characters and
stuff, there's a ton of it.
15

15

00:00:46,680  -->  00:00:50,000
You can go to the link that
I'll give you in the resources,
16

16

00:00:50,000  -->  00:00:51,020
that's the best way to do this.
17

17

00:00:51,020  -->  00:00:53,910
Find the downloads and
see all sprite sheets,
18

18

00:00:53,910  -->  00:00:57,570
and there's a zip file there and
if I show you.
19

19

00:00:57,570  -->  00:01:01,180
Here we go,
let's just have a look in here.
20

20

00:01:01,180  -->  00:01:03,040
This is what I've downloaded already.
21

21

00:01:04,490  -->  00:01:07,330
There it is, there are folders
after folders after folders,
22

22

00:01:07,330  -->  00:01:10,572
there is so much content in here,
it is incredible.
23

23

00:01:10,572  -->  00:01:14,431
So it's great stuff to get your hands
on and within here you can see there's
24

24

00:01:14,431  -->  00:01:18,825
sprite sheets like this one and
there's a whole bunch of stuff going on.
25

25

00:01:18,825  -->  00:01:22,645
Let's talk a little bit about what that
means with sprite sheets in a moment.
26

26

00:01:22,645  -->  00:01:25,395
If this no longer exists or
if you don't wanna grab all of that,
27

27

00:01:25,395  -->  00:01:27,565
then I've given you the resource.
28

28

00:01:27,565  -->  00:01:28,495
I guess resources,
29

29

00:01:28,495  -->  00:01:32,055
I've given you exactly what I'm
using in this section of the course.
30

30

00:01:32,055  -->  00:01:35,755
So it's way less size and
there's less stuff in it.
31

31

00:01:35,755  -->  00:01:38,874
But you can just go and download the stuff
that I've given you if you want,
32

32

00:01:38,874  -->  00:01:39,793
that I'll be using.
33

33

00:01:39,793  -->  00:01:42,700
Okay, now what are these
two types of animation?
34

34

00:01:42,700  -->  00:01:46,000
Let me give you an example,
this is from my prototype.
35

35

00:01:46,000  -->  00:01:49,580
So your Unity's not gonna look
like this at all at the moment.
36

36

00:01:49,580  -->  00:01:50,617
We'll get to this point,
37

37

00:01:50,617  -->  00:01:53,839
so don't worry if you see a bunch of stuff
on here that doesn't quite make sense.
38

38

00:01:53,839  -->  00:01:59,190
What I wanna show you, that in my game
I have a sprite sheet-based animation,
39

39

00:01:59,190  -->  00:02:03,017
so that when this lizard comes
walking onto the screen.
40

40

00:02:03,017  -->  00:02:05,817
There as they continue walking,
I'm gonna pause and
41

41

00:02:05,817  -->  00:02:08,255
then just progress my
game one frame at a time.
42

42

00:02:08,255  -->  00:02:12,046
Frame, frame, frame and
you can see that each frame,
43

43

00:02:12,046  -->  00:02:16,785
there is a slight difference in
what this character looks like.
44

44

00:02:16,785  -->  00:02:19,407
That's because it's coming
from a sprite sheet.
45

45

00:02:19,407  -->  00:02:25,843
A sprite sheet is a single image,
this is just one image with about 16 or
46

46

00:02:25,843  -->  00:02:31,347
so images that an artist has painted,
or crafted that image.
47

47

00:02:31,347  -->  00:02:33,293
And they've moved it slightly that image,
48

48

00:02:33,293  -->  00:02:35,192
I've got a bit of
a zoomed in version here.
49

49

00:02:35,192  -->  00:02:38,372
So you can see, drawn that then
moved the hand a little bit.
50

50

00:02:38,372  -->  00:02:40,482
Moved the legs a little bit,
and then moved the hands and
51

51

00:02:40,482  -->  00:02:41,062
legs a little bit more.
52

52

00:02:41,062  -->  00:02:43,672
So drawn this, drawn this,
drawn this, and not from scratch.
53

53

00:02:43,672  -->  00:02:47,329
They're gonna be doing a bit of copy and
pasting, and maybe delete that hand, and
54

54

00:02:47,329  -->  00:02:48,501
then move it a little bit.
55

55

00:02:48,501  -->  00:02:53,313
But these are individual images, like
each of these are individual images on
56

56

00:02:53,313  -->  00:02:56,805
a sprite sheet, so
these are sprites on a sprite sheet.
57

57

00:02:56,805  -->  00:03:00,116
And you can see when I zoom out you
can see all of it in context and
58

58

00:03:00,116  -->  00:03:01,860
then this will be one png image.
59

59

00:03:01,860  -->  00:03:05,225
This is a single image and
what we need to do is slice it up and
60

60

00:03:05,225  -->  00:03:09,760
say this is one image, now this is frame
number one, this is frame number two,
61

61

00:03:09,760  -->  00:03:11,444
this is frame number three.
62

62

00:03:11,444  -->  00:03:15,776
And then, when Unity combines them and
says play frame one, then two, then three,
63

63

00:03:15,776  -->  00:03:20,008
then four, we get this sort of effect
where it's playing them one after another.
64

64

00:03:20,008  -->  00:03:24,684
And of course this in my prototype build
where I'm also telling this lizard to move
65

65

00:03:24,684  -->  00:03:25,836
across the screen so
66

66

00:03:25,836  -->  00:03:29,760
it gives the impression that it
is walking across the screen.
67

67

00:03:29,760  -->  00:03:32,967
Okay so that is using a spite sheet
to do sprite sheet animation, okay,
68

68

00:03:32,967  -->  00:03:35,620
let me show you a little bit
about bone-based animation.
69

69

00:03:35,620  -->  00:03:39,900
I've gone and grabbed from the Asset Store
this fantasy 2D character free,
70

70

00:03:39,900  -->  00:03:41,400
as you can see it's free.
71

71

00:03:41,400  -->  00:03:43,770
And just set that up, just very quickly,
72

72

00:03:43,770  -->  00:03:46,130
we're not gonna be using
this at all in our game.
73

73

00:03:46,130  -->  00:03:49,970
I just wanted to show you an example of
bone-based animation and this was a nice,
74

74

00:03:49,970  -->  00:03:51,860
quick, easy way to do that.
75

75

00:03:51,860  -->  00:03:55,780
Okay so this is a little demo game and the
point is we've got this character here.
76

76

00:03:55,780  -->  00:03:59,399
Character is comprised of a whole
bunch of individual elements,
77

77

00:03:59,399  -->  00:04:03,232
as opposed to sprite sheet where this
would be all drawn as one thing.
78

78

00:04:03,232  -->  00:04:06,350
There's a head that is separate
to a sword, separate to an arms.
79

79

00:04:06,350  -->  00:04:10,060
There's all these little pieces
that can get combined together.
80

80

00:04:10,060  -->  00:04:13,990
If I can drill into this arm,
I can move it off and move it around, so
81

81

00:04:13,990  -->  00:04:15,190
it's a separate piece.
82

82

00:04:15,190  -->  00:04:19,262
And then I can rotate this arm and
say like [NOISE], I'm walking along,
83

83

00:04:19,262  -->  00:04:20,861
walking along the street.
84

84

00:04:20,861  -->  00:04:24,867
So this type of animation is called
bone-based animation, and it's all
85

85

00:04:24,867  -->  00:04:29,079
about saying okay, when a character moves,
the arm needs to walk like that.
86

86

00:04:29,079  -->  00:04:31,778
And also the legs,
if I can drill into it here,
87

87

00:04:31,778  -->  00:04:34,305
the legs need to do
a little bit of walking.
88

88

00:04:34,305  -->  00:04:37,900
[LAUGH] Need to do a little bit better
than that but you get the point here,
89

89

00:04:37,900  -->  00:04:39,765
maybe it's moving left or right and so.
90

90

00:04:39,765  -->  00:04:43,770
Let me see if I can undo it put his
arms back on, or might be funny for
91

91

00:04:43,770  -->  00:04:44,980
if we leave the arm out there.
92

92

00:04:44,980  -->  00:04:47,669
Then when I play the game,
and I'll just click on play,
93

93

00:04:47,669  -->  00:04:50,657
I'll stay zoomed in over here so
you can see what's going on.
94

94

00:04:50,657  -->  00:04:52,158
And I click attack or
95

95

00:04:52,158  -->  00:04:57,112
if I move, you can see that these
are moving in and out, rotating.
96

96

00:04:57,112  -->  00:05:00,636
And we have an idle animation here that is
just saying move this piece that's known
97

97

00:05:00,636  -->  00:05:04,179
as the arm, let's move it to the left and
right, left and right, left and right.
98

98

00:05:04,179  -->  00:05:06,538
Move the head up and down a little
bit every now and again, blink.
99

99

00:05:06,538  -->  00:05:10,970
So that's bone-based animation,
and it takes a lot more work
100

100

00:05:10,970  -->  00:05:14,460
within Unity here to set up exactly
how the bits and pieces move.
101

101

00:05:14,460  -->  00:05:18,096
The animation is happening within Unity,
whereas for
102

102

00:05:18,096  -->  00:05:23,120
the sprite based animation,
it's all been taken care of by an artist,
103

103

00:05:23,120  -->  00:05:26,080
and they give you the sprites and
say, there you go.
104

104

00:05:26,080  -->  00:05:29,713
So both are cool, both are fine, but it
just depends on what your artist wants to
105

105

00:05:29,713  -->  00:05:33,146
do, and whether you're the artist and
where you want to put the emphasis.
106

106

00:05:33,146  -->  00:05:37,531
So I'm gonna focus mostly on sprite sheet
animation in this section of the course,
107

107

00:05:37,531  -->  00:05:40,615
but a little bit of bone-based just so
we can practice it.
108

108

00:05:40,615  -->  00:05:43,837
Next up, I'll be importing a sprite sheet
and slicing it up, so if you haven't
109

109

00:05:43,837  -->  00:05:47,075
download the assets against this lecture
already now's a good time to do that.
110

110

00:05:47,075  -->  00:05:50,236
Or to download the assets
from the Glitch website,
111

111

00:05:50,236  -->  00:05:53,268
find where you download those,
and let's see.
112

112

00:05:53,268  -->  00:05:57,240
In sprite sheets, so within the following
in sprite sheets, I'm gonna look for
113

113

00:05:57,240  -->  00:06:01,630
Lizard Walk,
drag that over into my Assets directory.
114

114

00:06:01,630  -->  00:06:04,790
And I need to create myself a new folder,
so right click, Create Folder,
115

115

00:06:04,790  -->  00:06:06,740
I'll call this sprites.
116

116

00:06:06,740  -->  00:06:09,680
And then drag the lizard walk
into Sprites, double click and
117

117

00:06:09,680  -->  00:06:11,200
you can see Lizard Walk here.
118

118

00:06:11,200  -->  00:06:14,780
If we drag up the little preview, so
click down at the bottom and drag,
119

119

00:06:14,780  -->  00:06:16,540
we can see there is our sprite sheet.
120

120

00:06:16,540  -->  00:06:19,830
So if you've already sliced up sprite
sheets before, and you know how to do it.
121

121

00:06:19,830  -->  00:06:24,090
Here's a good time for a challenge, the
challenge is to Import a sprite sheet and
122

122

00:06:24,090  -->  00:06:27,950
then to slice it up so
that you have individual units to it.
123

123

00:06:27,950  -->  00:06:30,830
If you haven't done that before
then let's do it together, or
124

124

00:06:30,830  -->  00:06:33,900
you might want to watch me and
then do it afterwards.
125

125

00:06:33,900  -->  00:06:36,720
Okay, let's start slicing up,
click on Lizard Walk.
126

126

00:06:36,720  -->  00:06:40,590
Then Sprite Mode, we need to change
that from Single to Multiple.
127

127

00:06:40,590  -->  00:06:43,720
And then to click the Apply button so
that that sticks.
128

128

00:06:43,720  -->  00:06:46,820
Now, Unity now thinks that
there's multiple sprites
129

129

00:06:46,820  -->  00:06:48,780
on this one png that we've given it.
130

130

00:06:48,780  -->  00:06:52,180
Click on the Sprite Editor to bring
out the Sprite Editor window and
131

131

00:06:52,180  -->  00:06:54,680
then up in the top left
you'll see a Slice button.
132

132

00:06:54,680  -->  00:06:59,890
On the Slice button, we're going to leave
it as automatic and then click on slice.
133

133

00:06:59,890  -->  00:07:01,210
And you might not have noticed it but
134

134

00:07:01,210  -->  00:07:04,310
now we have a white lines
around each of our sprites.
135

135

00:07:04,310  -->  00:07:07,710
So when we do automatic Unity's saying,
okay all of this is transparent.
136

136

00:07:07,710  -->  00:07:09,370
That clearly not a sprite,
137

137

00:07:09,370  -->  00:07:13,190
I'm gonna put a tight box around each
of these what I think is a sprite, and
138

138

00:07:13,190  -->  00:07:16,640
then give it a name that goes up from two,
to three, to four, and so on.
139

139

00:07:16,640  -->  00:07:19,710
So you can see each of these numbers,
you can rename these if you want,
140

140

00:07:19,710  -->  00:07:21,920
I find it a little bit unnecessary for
what we're doing.
141

141

00:07:21,920  -->  00:07:26,610
We've got the numbers that are increasing,
so click on Apply and
142

142

00:07:26,610  -->  00:07:28,760
that is now your sprite
sheet all chopped up.
143

143

00:07:28,760  -->  00:07:32,350
You can see it's chopped up by going back
onto your sprite sheet, opening it up,
144

144

00:07:32,350  -->  00:07:33,720
and you'll see each of these.
145

145

00:07:33,720  -->  00:07:36,420
Make sure we drag up our preview so
we can see it.
146

146

00:07:36,420  -->  00:07:40,850
Each of these has been chopped up
to create an individual frame of
147

147

00:07:40,850  -->  00:07:41,900
our walk cycle.
148

148

00:07:41,900  -->  00:07:45,760
And then it should loop back to the start,
so if we were to simulate this being
149

149

00:07:45,760  -->  00:07:49,780
an animation, that is how our character
would look walking, which is awesome.
150

150

00:07:49,780  -->  00:07:52,940
So that's all we're going to do in this
video, I've had a couple of mega marathon
151

151

00:07:52,940  -->  00:07:55,910
videos of late, I know so
this one I'll keep a little bit quicker.
152

152

00:07:55,910  -->  00:08:00,050
In the next video, we'll be diving in and
taking care of animation, and
153

153

00:08:00,050  -->  00:08:04,650
actually making our lizard animate and
look like he's walking in our game.
154

154

00:08:04,650  -->  00:08:06,560
So, great work and I'll see you shortly.
