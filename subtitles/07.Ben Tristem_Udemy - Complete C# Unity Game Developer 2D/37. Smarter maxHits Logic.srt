1
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:04,740
Here.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,980
Hello again in this video we're going to do three main things we're going to tidy up our blogs.

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,490
We're going to protect our souls from issues where we might have.

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,080
The array not having any element in it.

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:21,890
And we're also going to have a smarter way of calculating Max hits so that we don't have to enter manually

6
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:26,450
Max hits and then also the number of spri to potentially have a mismatch there which I've done myself

7
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:27,370
a couple of times.

8
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:32,150
So step one in this process I don't know about you but I get annoyed every time I need to double click

9
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:36,240
on my block or triple click because my game canvas is getting in the way.

10
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,000
So this is the UI our big old UI up here.

11
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,190
It's getting in the way when they're clicking so I'm going to do what I've done in previous videos which

12
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:47,870
is jump up to the top to layer's up in the top right and click on the little eyes symbol next to you

13
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:53,750
I'd turn that off and that way it means that we won't see that as we're never getting our way around

14
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:54,410
our world.

15
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:55,880
Let's just jump in nice and close.

16
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:56,780
So it shouldnt getting away.

17
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:00,860
So when I click on a block and then click on another block it clicks straight on them are so much better.

18
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:05,210
Apologies if you've been noting that as I've been trying to click on blocks and you've been yelling

19
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:10,070
at the screen why don't you just turn off your UI or go to the next thing I know is remove all of my

20
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:15,260
blocks because buried somewhere in there is some dodgy logic and I've just been using it for prototyping

21
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,960
and play testing and I've just been messing around with it.

22
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,990
Sorry I think we're getting our array out of index issue because something we've done in there is incorrect

23
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:27,960
and broken so I'm going to delete it all and start from scratch with our new found awesomeness.

24
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,350
To do this I'm going to drop in.

25
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,930
Let's see my big three hit break will block why I dropped that in there.

26
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,150
I'm going to change the instant So it is twice now say four times as big so on scale.

27
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,280
I'm going to change it to four and four and four.

28
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:42,740
There we go.

29
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,450
There's the Whopper.

30
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,880
There's the mother.

31
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:50,240
Mother Ship of blocks and we can see who's got Max it's a three and multiple broken States may or may

32
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,430
not look amazing you can see that everything's been scaled up so it's not amazing amazing but from a

33
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,330
gameplay point of view I think it's going to be pretty decent.

34
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:05,170
Next up I'm going to drop in a couple of unbreakable blocks to make sure that they still work so 1 and

35
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:11,750
then duplicate to duplicate three duplicate four just so I can't bounce straight up towards the big

36
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:19,790
block and then I'll drop in some of these to hit wonders over the side one and then duplicate to duplicate

37
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,420
three.

38
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,330
Just check my max hits on this for some reasons.

39
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:28,850
Back down to zero-sum going to click on the prefab change to the max hits up to let's see this is the

40
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:29,580
two hits.

41
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,540
I will change it to 2 and that should change my instances.

42
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,690
Yes it does.

43
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,200
OK and then I am going to highlight all of these duplicate.

44
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,350
Move them over to the right hand side just so difficult is symmetry.

45
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:42,710
There we go.

46
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:48,680
There's my little nothing amazing but not too terrible and you can see I've got a mess in my hierarchy

47
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,150
so it's clean that up grab all the blocks put this underneath my blog's game object.

48
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,620
Grab the ones I have at the top do the same under blocks and then close up blocks.

49
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,180
Looks good.

50
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:04,250
Okay now I've got a working level that when I play my game it should not be giving me any errors and

51
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,870
it should be playing nice as while our case looks a little bit dumb.

52
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,540
Having that quite so big I'd need to change up the assets that I use.

53
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,190
If I want to have mega big blocks but no errors.

54
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,400
Game play is called nice big block to I aim for.

55
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,680
You could even have this as 10 states.

56
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,440
Sorry 10 levels of breakage.

57
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,720
OK cool now.

58
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,950
Next up what I want to do is open up my scripts open up.

59
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,370
BLOCK dotsie s within here.

60
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:39,320
I want to just protect against a situation where we can get an array not knowing what's going on and

61
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,940
having a little bit of a complain.

62
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,880
Add us in a way that doesn't make sense.

63
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:49,430
I make it very obvious so you can see we've got it Sprite index segal's times more times it minus one

64
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:56,160
and then we're getting the component and we're changing the Sprite renderer based upon our array.

65
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,070
So just to protect our self here underneath int Sprite index.

66
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,170
Then add a new line and say if.

67
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:08,930
What I want to say in here is if the Sprite index E is not null.

68
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,510
So in other words if it's valid then continue on.

69
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,130
Otherwise give us a particular error.

70
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:23,160
So I'll say if hit sprite's and then out a ray is going to be Sprite index index so if if that is where

71
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,970
our Sprite index is exclamation mark.

72
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,080
Equals.

73
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:33,850
That means not null is not null valid.

74
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:34,720
What have I done wrong here.

75
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,800
I have missed any apologies for the Sprite index.

76
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,570
Then let's wrap in our curly braces.

77
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:45,000
How get component changing up the Sprite in renderer.

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,720
There we go.

79
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,120
Else so.

80
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,270
Otherwise else we are saying what did one do.

81
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,020
Here to give us a warning so debug dot.

82
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,510
Log error to make it very clear that's going to show an error.

83
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:08,620
The red exclamation mark stop sign thing will say block Sprite is missing from a ray that should protect

84
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,600
us and make it really clear what's going on.

85
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,580
To put a couple of these things in so just to be clear we could be fine without this.

86
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:19,570
But this is the sort of check and balance you want to put into your code so you don't find yourself

87
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:23,470
in a position where you make a little bit of a tweak a little bit of a mistake and you're completely

88
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,020
confused about what's going on.

89
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:29,790
So we'll see if we can test this just by forcing a bad scenario.

90
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,120
Fine.

91
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,880
This is right just here it lets me click on at once I'm finished compiling.

92
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,800
Click on that and will say size of.

93
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,290
Or 3.

94
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:43,120
Just to change it up a little bit and then I'm going to slide all these to none.

95
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,810
None.

96
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,600
None.

97
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,170
None.

98
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:49,690
This is something that could possibly have happened that we forgot to put our sprite's in there click

99
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:55,050
play and we'll see what happens when we hit this block over on the right hand side here.

100
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,980
Boik nothing happens because of it.

101
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,200
The wink.

102
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,110
Because it's got multiple levels and we didn't see any affordance of the fact there is getting damage.

103
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,390
But when we look in our console block Sprite is missing from a ray.

104
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:09,350
Okay.

105
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,490
And then for bonus points he's a little challenge for you.

106
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,300
We'll see if we can do this.

107
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,110
I thought about this but it just popped into my head just now.

108
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,650
Also logout block Sprite is missing from Ouray and then logout.

109
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,310
Which particular game object is the problem.

110
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:28,000
So pause a video and see if you can do that now too.

111
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,740
In this era we're logging out.

112
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,090
Also add the name of the game object.

113
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:34,400
OK.

114
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,390
So I'm going to say.

115
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:40,750
Plus and then we will type in game object dot name.

116
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,940
Should be as simple as that.

117
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,270
Save Beco into unity.

118
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,260
Clear that.

119
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:52,430
Now when we hit that one game object the one block over in the top right there.

120
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,200
It should tell us the comply.

121
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:01,510
It should tell us the name of that particular game objects are and go look for it and then pause says.

122
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,440
Box is missing from a race to hit breakable 5 so.

123
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,520
It's from the array.

124
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:07,980
Great.

125
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,490
And then to hit breakable 5.

126
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:09,740
Great.

127
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,480
This one just here is missing so that's a really good way of adding some code.

128
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:19,310
So you can find exactly what's going on to help you with your debugging and help you with finding any

129
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:19,830
issues.

130
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:25,160
Trust me there will be issues because that's the name of the game having bugs is part of the fun of

131
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,800
making video games.

132
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:30,950
Right now the other thing I wanted to do in this video was to be a little bit cleverer with how we're

133
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,670
calculating our Max he.

134
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,770
And you can see at the moment where are we on one of our clocks.

135
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,590
You can see Max it's has two.

136
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:40,520
And the number of hits Brites we've got is three.

137
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,700
So it's actually bigger than the max.

138
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,970
So there's a lot of manual process in here.

139
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:51,050
What we know is how many hits brides we've got because we want to have a hit Sprite even if it's the

140
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:57,260
same visual representation if we've got three elements in there then we want to.

141
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:02,870
We know that the number of Max hits is going to be four because that's our logic.

142
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:08,390
We have the very first Sprite which is our non Braken non broken sprite.

143
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,870
And then we have varying degrees of breakage after that.

144
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:16,970
So we can hook that up in code and just get away with this idea of us manually putting in Max hits and

145
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:23,470
also to bulletproofing ourselves a little bit more in case we make any mistakes as I had done just there.

146
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:32,210
So what we have at the top is Max hits that we've serialized going to for now remove these and instead

147
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:40,540
we're going to put Max hits down in our code in here where we're first doing our Max its comparison.

148
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,930
So many times hit.

149
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,070
Plus Plus let's add it Max hits.

150
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,650
And what's this going to equal.

151
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:52,110
Well the max hits is going to equal something to do with the size of our ray.

152
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,390
So say he sprite's This is our Ray.

153
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,060
It's bright dot Layng.

154
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,850
That's going to be the length of our ray.

155
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:05,630
And then we know that it's going to be one be higher because our race starts at zero so there's only

156
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,230
one in free in our array it's going to be zero.

157
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:17,060
So NDA plus 1 to get the number of maximum hits so maximum hits is the length of our array plus one

158
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:23,670
from back over into unity will see that Max hits should disappear once it's compiled papa comp. Okay

159
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,510
megacities disappeared size is 3.

160
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:32,660
Let me just remove this block because that was one of the ones that we were using to test duplicate

161
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,650
the block above it.

162
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:40,160
Now it should be a good old fashioned size of one so that should take two hits to destroy.

163
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,340
We are CONSOL.

164
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,270
And play the game over on the right who play the game once.

165
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,100
Yes that's right America just right now if it gets destroyed.

166
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,530
If I can hit it there we go.

167
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,420
It gets destroyed.

168
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:53,770
OK.

169
00:09:53,780 --> 00:10:00,380
So we're dynamically through our code figuring out how many levels of damage our sprite's should have

170
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,120
how block should have.

171
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,070
My calculating that I don't know about you but I find it difficult to talk and play the game at the

172
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:10,400
same time and so terrible on my game because I'm never concentrating on it.

173
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,670
That does really fundo play I'm quite enjoying it.

174
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,590
And there's a ton of level design variety that we can implement now that we've got our unbreakable blocks

175
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:23,120
and we've got bigger blocks and we've got multiple levels of damage on the blocks and in some upcoming

176
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,580
videos we'll talk a little bit more about a couple of game design philosophies or approaches you can

177
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:33,800
take and then take a little bit of a moment to make a bit more of a game and flex your muscles in terms

178
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,380
of tuning of your game.

179
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:40,160
But for now we've tidied up a couple of things we've created some cleverer logic we've given ourselves

180
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,340
protection against errors.

181
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,430
We're in a good place.

182
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,270
I will see you in the next video.
