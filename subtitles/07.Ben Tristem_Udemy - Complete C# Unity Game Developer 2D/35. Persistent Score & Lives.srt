1

00:00:00,025  -->  00:00:05,921
[SOUND] In this video,
we're tying a few things together.
2

2

00:00:05,921  -->  00:00:09,505
We're tying together our life system and
our scoreboard system so
3

3

00:00:09,505  -->  00:00:12,961
that the player lives are remembered and
printed on the screen,
4

4

00:00:12,961  -->  00:00:14,890
the score is printed on the screen.
5

5

00:00:14,890  -->  00:00:17,986
And when the player dies, bloink,
we know it should be 2 and
6

6

00:00:17,986  -->  00:00:19,951
we know our score should be retained.
7

7

00:00:19,951  -->  00:00:24,650
So let's jump in and get our game
feeling a lot more like an actual game.
8

8

00:00:24,650  -->  00:00:27,992
Okay, I've jumped back over to my Level
1 over here, we're on my Level 1, yeah,
9

9

00:00:27,992  -->  00:00:29,939
where we've already
created our game session.
10

10

00:00:29,939  -->  00:00:34,407
And I'm gonna prefab the game session,
just drag it down into our prefab folder,
11

11

00:00:34,407  -->  00:00:38,140
because we'll be needing to use
that in each of our levels.
12

12

00:00:38,140  -->  00:00:40,806
Okay, the first thing we're
gonna do is jump in and
13

13

00:00:40,806  -->  00:00:44,791
create ourselves some text to have on
the screen to display score and lives.
14

14

00:00:44,791  -->  00:00:48,371
So right-click in the hierarchy,
down to UI.
15

15

00:00:48,371  -->  00:00:49,851
We will create ourselves a Canvas.
16

16

00:00:49,851  -->  00:00:52,211
Gonna rename this UI Canvas.
17

17

00:00:52,211  -->  00:00:55,940
UI Canvas, so it's nice and clear.
18

18

00:00:55,940  -->  00:01:00,830
UI Canvas, underneath which we will
right-click and create UI &gt;Text.
19

19

00:01:00,830  -->  00:01:04,905
This Text I am going to call,
what's this one gonna be,
20

20

00:01:04,905  -->  00:01:10,140
we'll do lives first, so
we'll call it livesText, livesText.
21

21

00:01:10,140  -->  00:01:12,960
And then my mouse wheel scrolls
at the speed of a sloth,
22

22

00:01:12,960  -->  00:01:15,880
so I'm gonna double click on Canvas
to get the whole thing on the screen.
23

23

00:01:15,880  -->  00:01:20,180
You can see our new text just here,
and drag it up over in the top left.
24

24

00:01:20,180  -->  00:01:22,630
I think lives on the left and
score on the right.
25

25

00:01:22,630  -->  00:01:24,570
We can put a little bit more
flavor into it later on, for
26

26

00:01:24,570  -->  00:01:26,120
now we're just getting the functionality.
27

27

00:01:26,120  -->  00:01:28,154
But I do wanna make sure
I've clicked on the anchor,
28

28

00:01:28,154  -->  00:01:30,330
and we've anchored it to the top left.
29

29

00:01:30,330  -->  00:01:36,190
And also to increase the font to say 50,
and to make it white.
30

30

00:01:36,190  -->  00:01:39,740
These are all areas where you can
customize to your hearts content,
31

31

00:01:39,740  -->  00:01:41,540
so do with it what you would like.
32

32

00:01:41,540  -->  00:01:43,562
I'm going to do it just nice and
simple for now.
33

33

00:01:43,562  -->  00:01:45,910
Let me make it bold actually,
that'll be my bit of flavor.
34

34

00:01:45,910  -->  00:01:47,060
How many lives?
35

35

00:01:47,060  -->  00:01:49,573
Well, I don't see the player
getting more than 99 lives,
36

36

00:01:49,573  -->  00:01:52,101
that would be a little bit crazy,
so we'll cap that at 99.
37

37

00:01:52,101  -->  00:01:52,917
Put that in there so
38

38

00:01:52,917  -->  00:01:55,581
we can see how it looks with
the maximum number of characters.
39

39

00:01:55,581  -->  00:02:00,230
And then we also, while we're here,
want to create text for our scoreboard.
40

40

00:02:00,230  -->  00:02:05,260
So while we're on the UI Canvas,
right-click, UI &gt; Text.
41

41

00:02:05,260  -->  00:02:06,130
Actually, no, don't do that.
42

42

00:02:06,130  -->  00:02:08,670
I'm gonna just do duplicate,
that'd be the smart way to do it.
43

43

00:02:08,670  -->  00:02:13,550
Duplicate livesText, and
then we will call this our scoreboardText,
44

44

00:02:13,550  -->  00:02:15,350
or it's just scoreText.
45

45

00:02:15,350  -->  00:02:18,252
I think scoreText is
cleaner in that instance.
46

46

00:02:18,252  -->  00:02:22,870
scoreText makes sense, and then we will
move our scoreText over to the right hand
47

47

00:02:22,870  -->  00:02:26,520
side, change the anchor to be
the right hand side as well, and
48

48

00:02:26,520  -->  00:02:29,610
also change the alignment
to be over on the right.
49

49

00:02:29,610  -->  00:02:31,760
Okay, so that's pretty
quickly just setting that up.
50

50

00:02:31,760  -->  00:02:35,370
More numbers are required for
our score I think, so let's see.
51

51

00:02:35,370  -->  00:02:38,869
Maybe six digits, so you can get to
just about a million in our game.
52

52

00:02:40,380  -->  00:02:41,380
That looks pretty good.
53

53

00:02:41,380  -->  00:02:42,790
We can finish this later on.
54

54

00:02:42,790  -->  00:02:44,130
But that's pretty good
as a starting point.
55

55

00:02:44,130  -->  00:02:48,340
livesText and scoreText on our UI Canvas.
56

56

00:02:48,340  -->  00:02:53,061
Now where do we determine what
numbers are put onto the screen?
57

57

00:02:53,061  -->  00:02:54,812
Well, that's going to
be in our GameSession.
58

58

00:02:54,812  -->  00:02:59,770
Our GameSession is going to manage and
control, I should say control
59

59

00:02:59,770  -->  00:03:04,430
where our lives are stored, and how many
lives a player has, and what happens when
60

60

00:03:04,430  -->  00:03:07,050
the player gets to zero lives, and
also what we show on the screen.
61

61

00:03:07,050  -->  00:03:09,312
So we'll go into our GameSession script,
and
62

62

00:03:09,312  -->  00:03:12,740
we'll start by pointing this script
to the text that we just created.
63

63

00:03:12,740  -->  00:03:15,026
So we'll serialize
a couple of fields here.
64

64

00:03:15,026  -->  00:03:19,210
serializeField and
the first one will be Text.
65

65

00:03:19,210  -->  00:03:20,560
So it's of type Text.
66

66

00:03:20,560  -->  00:03:22,031
And we lighten up TextAlignment.
67

67

00:03:22,031  -->  00:03:24,145
So okay,
that's gone blank up on the screen,
68

68

00:03:24,145  -->  00:03:27,521
when it should have said Text because
we're not using the namespace yet.
69

69

00:03:27,521  -->  00:03:33,831
So using UnityEngine.UI, there we go.
70

70

00:03:33,831  -->  00:03:36,219
Now when we come down here and
we say Text,
71

71

00:03:36,219  -->  00:03:39,570
it knows what Text is,
it has an understanding of it.
72

72

00:03:39,570  -->  00:03:45,184
And we'll start with livesText, and
then I'll just copy-paste that.
73

73

00:03:45,184  -->  00:03:48,640
The next one, we will say scoreText.
74

74

00:03:51,410  -->  00:03:53,900
Okay, so we've got these two here,
I've left a little bit of a gap
75

75

00:03:53,900  -->  00:03:58,010
just to differentiate between my
text fields here and my playerLives.
76

76

00:03:58,010  -->  00:03:59,450
We'll come back to that in a moment.
77

77

00:03:59,450  -->  00:04:03,920
So we've got our text back over into
our engine, we need to point things at
78

78

00:04:03,920  -->  00:04:07,200
the right direction, just wait a moment
for the script to compile, there we go.
79

79

00:04:07,200  -->  00:04:08,830
So we've got livesText and scoreText.
80

80

00:04:08,830  -->  00:04:09,570
Where do they come from?
81

81

00:04:09,570  -->  00:04:11,910
Well, this is livesText and
that is scoreText.
82

82

00:04:11,910  -->  00:04:16,690
So while clicking on GameSession, drag
livesText over into that field there and
83

83

00:04:16,690  -->  00:04:20,650
drag scoreText over into
that field right there.
84

84

00:04:20,650  -->  00:04:22,110
Fantastic.
85

85

00:04:22,110  -->  00:04:23,920
Okay, so we've set that up.
86

86

00:04:23,920  -->  00:04:26,090
If we play our game now,
let's see what happens.
87

87

00:04:26,090  -->  00:04:27,670
It should initialize at what?
88

88

00:04:27,670  -->  00:04:28,861
3 and 0, I believe.
89

89

00:04:28,861  -->  00:04:32,050
99 and 999999, okay,
so it hasn't done that.
90

90

00:04:32,050  -->  00:04:33,570
Why is it not doing that?
91

91

00:04:33,570  -->  00:04:35,950
Let's have a look,
let's see what is going on.
92

92

00:04:35,950  -->  00:04:39,594
Well, we haven't told it that these
numbers, the numbers we have in,
93

93

00:04:39,594  -->  00:04:41,294
where are we, this number here,
94

94

00:04:41,294  -->  00:04:44,904
we haven't told it that should be
a string that's displayed in here.
95

95

00:04:44,904  -->  00:04:46,944
So we have to go ahead and display it.
96

96

00:04:46,944  -->  00:04:49,024
Just doing this is not
gonna do anything just yet.
97

97

00:04:49,024  -->  00:04:54,108
So we'll go down to our Start method, and
98

98

00:04:54,108  -->  00:05:02,405
in here we need to say livesText.text
= playerLives.ToString.
99

99

00:05:02,405  -->  00:05:03,384
We've done this before.
100

100

00:05:03,384  -->  00:05:06,885
ToString or not ToString,
that is the question.
101

101

00:05:06,885  -->  00:05:09,885
[LAUGH] Bad joke or not bad joke,
that is the question.
102

102

00:05:09,885  -->  00:05:15,070
Okay, so we've got that we're saying,
whatever we have as our score,
103

103

00:05:15,070  -->  00:05:17,395
our number should be
converted into a string.
104

104

00:05:17,395  -->  00:05:21,280
We'll do this at the same time for
our score as well.
105

105

00:05:21,280  -->  00:05:26,243
So that was lives I should say, so
whatever for lives we do this for
106

106

00:05:26,243  -->  00:05:30,033
score and
that will be scoreText.text = score,
107

107

00:05:30,033  -->  00:05:33,371
which it won't know
what score is just yet,
108

108

00:05:33,371  -->  00:05:38,273
that's why I tried to auto-complete that,
ToString();.
109

109

00:05:38,273  -->  00:05:42,520
Okay, we need to define score so
we jump up the top here.
110

110

00:05:42,520  -->  00:05:48,125
We need to SerializeField,
score being int, and we could say = 0,
111

111

00:05:48,125  -->  00:05:52,393
we don't have to,
it's initialized at 0 anyway.
112

112

00:05:52,393  -->  00:05:56,340
But I am going to say = 0 just so I can
cleanly see these two belong together
113

113

00:05:56,340  -->  00:06:00,160
as I'm flying through and
trying to figure out what's going on.
114

114

00:06:00,160  -->  00:06:03,740
Score starts at 0, it's a good reminder
if it's starting at anything but 0,
115

115

00:06:03,740  -->  00:06:05,280
then that might be a problem.
116

116

00:06:05,280  -->  00:06:08,300
Okay, so we've got lives, we've got score,
we've got the text for those two,
117

117

00:06:08,300  -->  00:06:11,020
and now what else do we need to do?
118

118

00:06:11,020  -->  00:06:14,100
Well, let's take a look and
see if it is now updating, if it's
119

119

00:06:14,100  -->  00:06:18,350
accurately understanding what it should be
displaying on the screen at the get-go.
120

120

00:06:18,350  -->  00:06:21,070
Click play, it should be 3 and 0.
121

121

00:06:21,070  -->  00:06:22,970
Okay, now we have 3 and 0, excellent.
122

122

00:06:22,970  -->  00:06:25,850
As we run along, score's not going up yet
cuz we haven't told it about that.
123

123

00:06:25,850  -->  00:06:27,350
When we die, bloink.
124

124

00:06:27,350  -->  00:06:27,973
Back up to 99.
125

125

00:06:27,973  -->  00:06:30,053
Why is that the case?
126

126

00:06:30,053  -->  00:06:34,994
Okay, so there's a very good reason
why our lives isn't being remembered,
127

127

00:06:34,994  -->  00:06:38,339
and it's not that it's not
even being remembered,
128

128

00:06:38,339  -->  00:06:41,570
we've lost that step of
telling it that it's 3.
129

129

00:06:41,570  -->  00:06:45,090
So it didn't even go to 2,
didn't even say 3, it's gone to 99.
130

130

00:06:45,090  -->  00:06:49,434
That's because our DontDestroyerOnload
is only relevant for the GameSession.
131

131

00:06:49,434  -->  00:06:51,210
So if we click out of play mode here,
132

132

00:06:51,210  -->  00:06:55,005
we've got our singleton that we've got
on GameSession that says if another
133

133

00:06:55,005  -->  00:06:58,643
GameSession comes along then destroy
that but don't destroy this one.
134

134

00:06:58,643  -->  00:07:04,152
And we haven't got that on our UI Canvas
here, so we could go and put a script
135

135

00:07:04,152  -->  00:07:09,765
which has a singleton there or we can
drag that underneath the GameSession.
136

136

00:07:09,765  -->  00:07:14,805
And that approach, the DontDestroyOnload
that we've got up in here,
137

137

00:07:14,805  -->  00:07:18,837
the GameSession DontDestroyOnload,
this will work for
138

138

00:07:18,837  -->  00:07:24,220
anything that's charted underneath
the object that has that script on it.
139

139

00:07:24,220  -->  00:07:28,068
So because we've got
DontDestroyOnload on GameSession,
140

140

00:07:28,068  -->  00:07:32,450
then the Canvas and these livesText and
scoreText aren't destroyed.
141

141

00:07:32,450  -->  00:07:37,230
So we'll click play and I'll show you that
in action that it should start at 3 and 0.
142

142

00:07:37,230  -->  00:07:40,377
When we jump in the water,
it stays at 3, stays at 3.
143

143

00:07:40,377  -->  00:07:42,904
We haven't told it to decrement yet
144

144

00:07:42,904  -->  00:07:47,716
on the screen but it knows that it
shouldn't destroy the UI Canvas.
145

145

00:07:47,716  -->  00:07:50,980
Well, I clicked on GameSession,
I'm gonna click Apply there just so
146

146

00:07:50,980  -->  00:07:53,390
that it makes this whole
thing the prefect.
147

147

00:07:53,390  -->  00:07:56,203
Okay, now let's get it actually
decreasing when it should decrease.
148

148

00:07:56,203  -->  00:08:00,630
We scroll down, we look at Start,
ProcessPlayerDeath, TakeLife.
149

149

00:08:00,630  -->  00:08:04,170
Okay, this is where it's going to be
relevant when it's taking a life,
150

150

00:08:04,170  -->  00:08:08,630
it is decreasing but we're not
telling it again to update the text.
151

151

00:08:08,630  -->  00:08:11,910
We're just saying that in Start
that this is what lives equals.
152

152

00:08:11,910  -->  00:08:14,700
So we'll copy this, and
we'll put it down here as well.
153

153

00:08:14,700  -->  00:08:18,260
When you take a life,
you should also update the livesText so
154

154

00:08:18,260  -->  00:08:21,390
that whatever the current playerLives
is should go into a string.
155

155

00:08:21,390  -->  00:08:27,548
So I'll save that, back over into
the engine, click play, click play.
156

156

00:08:27,548  -->  00:08:29,800
Always takes me a couple of
clicks to get the play button.
157

157

00:08:29,800  -->  00:08:33,210
It's thinking, it's like, yeah man,
I'm gonna do these scripts calm down.
158

158

00:08:33,210  -->  00:08:35,580
If we jump in the water now,
it's now down to 2.
159

159

00:08:35,580  -->  00:08:37,290
Great and then down to 1.
160

160

00:08:37,290  -->  00:08:39,760
Okay, so success there with our lives.
161

161

00:08:39,760  -->  00:08:42,940
We are having our don't destroy work and
162

162

00:08:42,940  -->  00:08:47,890
we're remembering the state of our lives,
remembering what the value is.
163

163

00:08:47,890  -->  00:08:49,450
Now let's do the same thing for score.
164

164

00:08:49,450  -->  00:08:52,570
And we'll get a quick clue
from what we did for lives.
165

165

00:08:52,570  -->  00:08:53,350
If you have a look here,
166

166

00:08:53,350  -->  00:08:58,280
we've got our public method we created,
ProcessPlayerDeath.
167

167

00:08:58,280  -->  00:09:01,340
And then over in the players script,
we're using that.
168

168

00:09:01,340  -->  00:09:04,253
We're finding the ObjectiveOfType,
which is GameSession, and
169

169

00:09:04,253  -->  00:09:06,600
then calling the method
ProcessPlayerDeath.
170

170

00:09:06,600  -->  00:09:08,980
So let's do something very
similar over here for the score.
171

171

00:09:08,980  -->  00:09:10,547
I'm gonna put this up at the top, so
172

172

00:09:10,547  -->  00:09:14,290
that I don't have to jump all the way down
to the bottom of my script to find it.
173

173

00:09:14,290  -->  00:09:18,160
We will say a public void,
what shall we call this?
174

174

00:09:18,160  -->  00:09:21,630
I think it will be AddToScore.
175

175

00:09:21,630  -->  00:09:23,610
So something's being added to score.
176

176

00:09:23,610  -->  00:09:28,050
And then we want to make sure
that whatever calls this method
177

177

00:09:28,050  -->  00:09:30,590
passes back the amount that it should add.
178

178

00:09:30,590  -->  00:09:32,368
So we don't want to have
to manage that in here.
179

179

00:09:32,368  -->  00:09:36,012
We don't want to have to say
the GameSession understands that a coin is
180

180

00:09:36,012  -->  00:09:40,583
worth 100 points but a gem is worth 200
points and something else is worth 300,
181

181

00:09:40,583  -->  00:09:41,850
we want to be told that.
182

182

00:09:41,850  -->  00:09:45,215
When something from another script says,
hey, add to score,
183

183

00:09:45,215  -->  00:09:49,288
we want it to say add 100 to the score,
add 200 to the score, and so on.
184

184

00:09:49,288  -->  00:09:55,946
So we will say in here, int PointsToAdd
is the amount that we wanna add.
185

185

00:09:55,946  -->  00:09:58,668
And then, what will be our method?
186

186

00:09:58,668  -->  00:10:04,000
Our method's gonna be score +=,
so we want it to be increasing.
187

187

00:10:04,000  -->  00:10:07,500
So take what you are now, and then
increase on top of that a certain amount,
188

188

00:10:07,500  -->  00:10:10,910
which will be the pointsToAdd
that we just passed back in.
189

189

00:10:12,330  -->  00:10:16,940
And then as we did just now with,
down here with playerLives,
190

190

00:10:16,940  -->  00:10:19,880
we need to make sure that we're updating
the string on the screen again.
191

191

00:10:19,880  -->  00:10:25,140
So I'll go and copy my scoreText,
copy that, and
192

192

00:10:25,140  -->  00:10:29,930
now we have scoreText.text
= score.ToString(), okay?
193

193

00:10:29,930  -->  00:10:33,578
So this whole method here is saying
update and add to the score.
194

194

00:10:33,578  -->  00:10:36,180
And this is where I've got a challenge for
you and
195

195

00:10:36,180  -->  00:10:38,350
the challenge is to increase the score.
196

196

00:10:39,510  -->  00:10:43,200
So update the onscreen score
when coins are picked up.
197

197

00:10:43,200  -->  00:10:45,365
If you want, you can add a gem
that has a different amount and so
198

198

00:10:45,365  -->  00:10:47,127
on, but for
now we'll concentrate on the coins.
199

199

00:10:47,127  -->  00:10:49,631
And to be sure to serialize
the pickup amount, so
200

200

00:10:49,631  -->  00:10:53,358
in the inspector you can change,
okay coins are worth 100 or 200,
201

201

00:10:53,358  -->  00:10:57,901
something else might be worth a different
amount, or a huge coin might be worth 500.
202

202

00:10:57,901  -->  00:11:01,774
And to use the player.cs for
clues on how to go about doing this,
203

203

00:11:01,774  -->  00:11:05,960
the structure is very similar for
score as we have just done for live.
204

204

00:11:05,960  -->  00:11:07,870
So you've got all the intel you need.
205

205

00:11:07,870  -->  00:11:11,050
Jump in, take that in now, and I'll see
you back here when you've given it a shot.
206

206

00:11:13,000  -->  00:11:13,850
Okay, welcome back.
207

207

00:11:13,850  -->  00:11:18,710
So the first thing we need to do is
hop over to our CoinPickup.cs and
208

208

00:11:18,710  -->  00:11:21,460
we want to add some information in here.
209

209

00:11:21,460  -->  00:11:25,620
First of all, I am going to
say how much a coin is worth.
210

210

00:11:25,620  -->  00:11:29,933
So SerializedField and
we will use a int here,
211

211

00:11:29,933  -->  00:11:34,810
pointsForCoinPickup, how
much we'll make that?
212

212

00:11:34,810  -->  00:11:35,859
Well, make it a 100 for now.
213

213

00:11:35,859  -->  00:11:38,857
It's a nice, clean, round amount, 100.
214

214

00:11:38,857  -->  00:11:43,136
And then in our OnTriggerEnter method,
when the player runs over a coin,
215

215

00:11:43,136  -->  00:11:47,276
we wanna do very similar to what we did
over here with the die method where
216

216

00:11:47,276  -->  00:11:51,640
we were looking for the ObjectOfType
GameSession ProcessPlayerDeath.
217

217

00:11:51,640  -->  00:11:55,441
Over here though,
we're going to FindObjectOfType and
218

218

00:11:55,441  -->  00:11:57,509
again it will be GameSession.
219

219

00:11:57,509  -->  00:12:05,167
Game session, and the method we
just created was what, AddToScore.
220

220

00:12:05,167  -->  00:12:06,258
What do we need to pass in there?
221

221

00:12:06,258  -->  00:12:11,730
Well, we need to pass in this thing we
just created which is pointsForCoinPickup.
222

222

00:12:11,730  -->  00:12:12,750
We can just say 100 in there but
223

223

00:12:12,750  -->  00:12:16,530
that doesn't make it as flexible,
PointForCoinPickup.
224

224

00:12:16,530  -->  00:12:23,094
And it knows pointsForCoinPickup,
say that fast five times, is 100.
225

225

00:12:23,094  -->  00:12:25,810
Okay, we'll save that,
back over into the engine.
226

226

00:12:25,810  -->  00:12:27,200
Click on play.
227

227

00:12:27,200  -->  00:12:29,810
Moment of truth,
we'll see if our logic works.
228

228

00:12:29,810  -->  00:12:31,490
See if everything makes sense.
229

229

00:12:31,490  -->  00:12:32,598
Quickly check that we can die.
230

230

00:12:32,598  -->  00:12:33,178
Yes, we can.
231

231

00:12:33,178  -->  00:12:34,540
Down to 2, points are going up, fantastic.
232

232

00:12:35,750  -->  00:12:37,080
And what happens when we die?
233

233

00:12:37,080  -->  00:12:38,270
Is it still 600?
234

234

00:12:38,270  -->  00:12:41,140
Bam, it is still 600, fantastic.
235

235

00:12:41,140  -->  00:12:45,700
There's one last step in this whole
process which bugs me a lot, so
236

236

00:12:45,700  -->  00:12:47,480
in the next video we're
going to resolve that,
237

237

00:12:47,480  -->  00:12:51,620
is that when I run over these coins,
if I was to die now those coins,
238

238

00:12:51,620  -->  00:12:54,550
like happened just now,
reappear, and I don't want that.
239

239

00:12:54,550  -->  00:12:57,830
I want for the player not to be able
to go and pick up all the coins and
240

240

00:12:57,830  -->  00:13:00,570
nearly make it to the end and
go pick up all the coins again.
241

241

00:13:00,570  -->  00:13:03,710
I want that when you pick up a coin once,
it's gone.
242

242

00:13:03,710  -->  00:13:08,880
And we need to do that in a way
that it works for this level but
243

243

00:13:08,880  -->  00:13:12,360
when I go into the next level, the next
level's coins are all there and present.

00:13:12,360  -->  00:13:16,438
So there's a little bit of messing around
with the state of what things need to
245

245

00:13:16,438  -->  00:13:20,581
persist in the GameSession and what things
need to persist in the level session
246

246

00:13:20,581  -->  00:13:22,669
which we'll take on in the next video.
247

247

00:13:22,669  -->  00:13:23,809
So great work in this lecture.
248

248

00:13:23,809  -->  00:13:27,751
I look forward to seeing all your
sharing on our Facebook site and
249

249

00:13:27,751  -->  00:13:30,290
in the QA section in the forum.
250

250

00:13:30,290  -->  00:13:31,370
And I'll see you in the next lecture.
