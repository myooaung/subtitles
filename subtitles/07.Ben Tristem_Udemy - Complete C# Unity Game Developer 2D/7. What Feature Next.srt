[MUSIC]
In this video we're gonna talk about
2

2

00:00:03,483  -->  00:00:08,810
priorities and
how we decide what feature comes next.
3

3

00:00:08,810  -->  00:00:11,440
And usually,
I start with the player movement,
4

4

00:00:11,440  -->  00:00:12,750
the player input when I make a game.
5

5

00:00:12,750  -->  00:00:14,210
And we've done that,
we've got our player moving around.
6

6

00:00:14,210  -->  00:00:20,060
And we often look at our game at
this point and say, so what next?
7

7

00:00:20,060  -->  00:00:21,420
And the what next for us,
8

8

00:00:21,420  -->  00:00:23,980
well, there's a way to go about
that process to figure it out.
9

9

00:00:23,980  -->  00:00:26,750
And I just wanted to show you
the process that I go through
10

10

00:00:26,750  -->  00:00:31,160
when I'm figuring out what feature I
should implement next into the game.
11

11

00:00:31,160  -->  00:00:32,175
First, jump over a couple of slides here.
12

12

00:00:32,175  -->  00:00:34,227
Here are our feature
areas that we've got for
13

13

00:00:34,227  -->  00:00:36,720
our game that we've identified
we'd like to create.
14

14

00:00:36,720  -->  00:00:38,510
We've got our Player Movement,
left, right, up, down.
15

15

00:00:38,510  -->  00:00:42,910
We've got our Player Shooting,
Player Health, Enemy Movement.
16

16

00:00:42,910  -->  00:00:45,230
And we need to Spawn Enemy Waves as well.
17

17

00:00:45,230  -->  00:00:45,910
They need to be multiple waves.
18

18

00:00:45,910  -->  00:00:48,100
They need to do path finding.
19

19

00:00:48,100  -->  00:00:51,160
They need to do go along an interesting
particular path following waypoints.
20

20

00:00:51,160  -->  00:00:54,968
And we need to have Enemy Health so
that the enemies can die and
21

21

00:00:54,968  -->  00:00:56,543
also the player can die.
22

22

00:00:56,543  -->  00:00:58,850
So they are the core feature areas.
23

23

00:00:58,850  -->  00:01:02,920
We also have some secondary features
that we've identified, have a Score and
24

24

00:01:02,920  -->  00:01:04,248
to also have Enemy Shooting.
25

25

00:01:04,248  -->  00:01:07,862
If our game didn't have those two things,
it would still be playable and
26

26

00:01:07,862  -->  00:01:09,340
still be good fun.
27

27

00:01:09,340  -->  00:01:12,490
Whereas, with the core,
if we did not have an aspect of the core.
28

28

00:01:12,490  -->  00:01:14,110
If the player did not have health,
29

29

00:01:14,110  -->  00:01:18,350
then you sort of just play forever with no
consequences, so we need to have these.
30

30

00:01:18,350  -->  00:01:19,223
These are the nice to haves.
31

31

00:01:19,223  -->  00:01:21,834
And because I have made this
game design pretty tight,
32

32

00:01:21,834  -->  00:01:23,950
we don't have a lot of secondary features.
33

33

00:01:23,950  -->  00:01:25,750
You might have another 2 or 3, or
34

34

00:01:25,750  -->  00:01:29,300
50 secondary features you want to
put into a game, which is cool.
35

35

00:01:29,300  -->  00:01:30,473
And then on top of that,
36

36

00:01:30,473  -->  00:01:34,530
we're going to have a Polish to make our
game more playable and more interesting.
37

37

00:01:34,530  -->  00:01:36,730
We'll need Visual Effects,
particle effects and explosions.
38

38

00:01:36,730  -->  00:01:38,960
Sound Effects and Menus and Screens, so
39

39

00:01:38,960  -->  00:01:43,108
people can navigate from the start menu
and when they die, what do they do?
40

40

00:01:43,108  -->  00:01:44,080
Restarting, etc.
41

41

00:01:44,080  -->  00:01:47,890
And also the Content, so putting in
a bunch of enemies and enemy speed and
42

42

00:01:47,890  -->  00:01:52,340
how fast they shoot and
how fast they respawn, etc.
43

43

00:01:52,340  -->  00:01:53,860
And general tuning of our game.
44

44

00:01:53,860  -->  00:01:57,160
So here is the big bucket of
feature areas, each of these,
45

45

00:01:57,160  -->  00:01:58,090
I would call a bucket.
46

46

00:01:58,090  -->  00:02:01,240
Player Movement is a bucket,
Enemy Health is a bucket.
47

47

00:02:01,240  -->  00:02:03,150
So what do we do next?
48

48

00:02:03,150  -->  00:02:05,890
Well, we've already done player movement,
we know that.
49

49

00:02:05,890  -->  00:02:06,460
And if we look at it,
50

50

00:02:06,460  -->  00:02:10,180
we can eliminate the secondary
features as the very next thing we do.
51

51

00:02:10,180  -->  00:02:13,360
Cuz we don't want to be diving
into secondary until we've done
52

52

00:02:13,360  -->  00:02:14,265
most of our core.
53

53

00:02:14,265  -->  00:02:15,955
And also,
we don't need any polish just yet.
54

54

00:02:15,955  -->  00:02:19,870
That'll be a little bit of overinvestment
in making our game pretty,
55

55

00:02:19,870  -->  00:02:24,148
you've got to actually have a game first
before you go down that path, I believe.
56

56

00:02:24,148  -->  00:02:27,460
Okay, we could also
eliminate Player Health and
57

57

00:02:27,460  -->  00:02:30,100
Enemy Health cuz we don't have
a way of damaging them yet.
58

58

00:02:30,100  -->  00:02:32,110
Until I can shoot there's no way for
59

59

00:02:32,110  -->  00:02:35,350
me to be testing out my health and
testing to make sure it works.
60

60

00:02:35,350  -->  00:02:39,118
So you have to have a way to do damage
before you register the damage.
61

61

00:02:39,118  -->  00:02:41,240
That's our logic there.
62

62

00:02:41,240  -->  00:02:43,500
So we're left with these four, sorry,
63

63

00:02:43,500  -->  00:02:45,470
these three because we've
already done Player Movement.
64

64

00:02:45,470  -->  00:02:49,190
Player Shooting, Enemy Movement,
and Spawning multiple enemy waves.
65

65

00:02:49,190  -->  00:02:53,090
Spawning multiple enemy waves is a little
bit more complex than just straight
66

66

00:02:53,090  -->  00:02:53,880
up movement.
67

67

00:02:53,880  -->  00:02:57,015
But these two are so intertwined in
terms of where we spawn them, and
68

68

00:02:57,015  -->  00:02:58,720
the path that they're spawning on.
69

69

00:02:58,720  -->  00:03:01,860
So there's a lot there, and
this is going to be reasonably technical.
70

70

00:03:01,860  -->  00:03:05,670
So for me, looking at that one,
these should really be grouped together.
71

71

00:03:05,670  -->  00:03:08,411
This Player Shooting is pretty much
grouped with the Player Movement.
72

72

00:03:08,411  -->  00:03:11,126
So it makes sense next to
do the Player Shooting, and
73

73

00:03:11,126  -->  00:03:13,546
that would be the next
feature that we work on.
74

74

00:03:13,546  -->  00:03:16,370
So that's the flow that I go through
in terms of figuring out what next.
75

75

00:03:16,370  -->  00:03:19,933
And after we do Player Shooting,
I'll go through the same process.
76

76

00:03:19,933  -->  00:03:23,707
And it will most likely be these two that
I've already identified, saying, well,
77

77

00:03:23,707  -->  00:03:26,300
we should really get
the enemies moving around now.
78

78

00:03:26,300  -->  00:03:28,620
And the enemy spawning
in a meaningful way.
79

79

00:03:28,620  -->  00:03:32,200
And then after that we can go on to
giving the player some health and
80

80

00:03:32,200  -->  00:03:35,990
the enemy some health so we can hurt each
other and have some sort of interaction.
81

81

00:03:35,990  -->  00:03:37,020
And then once we've done that,
we'll have our MVP,
82

82

00:03:37,020  -->  00:03:41,690
we'll have a game that you can actually
win and lose and play through.
83

83

00:03:41,690  -->  00:03:43,402
Then we can add our secondary features.
84

84

00:03:43,402  -->  00:03:48,530
And possibly at the same time,
adding in our polish as we go along.
85

85

00:03:48,530  -->  00:03:50,500
Now, one thing I'll say is that,
86

86

00:03:50,500  -->  00:03:54,090
I do like from time to time grabbing
one of these polished elements.
87

87

00:03:54,090  -->  00:03:56,913
Maybe some particle effects or
a little bit of sound effects and
88

88

00:03:56,913  -->  00:03:58,200
putting them in earlier on.
89

89

00:03:58,200  -->  00:04:00,203
So our game's feeling polished as we go.
90

90

00:04:00,203  -->  00:04:03,624
And that's why in the very start of our
game we put it in the background so
91

91

00:04:03,624  -->  00:04:05,085
it looks a little bit pretty.
92

92

00:04:05,085  -->  00:04:06,880
We're looking at something
nice as we go along.
93

93

00:04:06,880  -->  00:04:07,550
It's not just a blank screen.
94

94

00:04:07,550  -->  00:04:09,740
If that wasn't there, we just have this.
95

95

00:04:09,740  -->  00:04:11,620
And our game wouldn't feel
like a game yet, right?
96

96

00:04:11,620  -->  00:04:16,240
So that's why I like to put a little bit
of polish in each step of the process.
97

97

00:04:16,240  -->  00:04:20,600
Okay, so no challenge in this video except
to say we're doing Player Shooting next.
98

98

00:04:20,600  -->  00:04:22,955
And if you don't have any projectiles,
now is the time to find projectiles.
99

99

00:04:22,955  -->  00:04:28,895
I've given to you in the assets using
my assets, but no other challenge.
100

100

00:04:28,895  -->  00:04:33,305
I'm just giving you a clear window on
the thought process for how we go about.
101

101

00:04:33,305  -->  00:04:35,700
For figuring out what we work on next.
102

102

00:04:35,700  -->  00:04:37,610
So let's jump in and
work on Player Shooting.
