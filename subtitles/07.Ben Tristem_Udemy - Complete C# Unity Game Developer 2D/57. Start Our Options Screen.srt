00:00:03,941  -->  00:00:06,359
Hey in this video I'm going
to start with a challenge,
3

3

00:00:06,359  -->  00:00:09,000
I want you to create an options
screen that looks like this.
4

4

00:00:09,000  -->  00:00:12,150
Sometimes a designer will hand you
a piece of paper or a image and
5

5

00:00:12,150  -->  00:00:13,260
say make me one of these.
6

6

00:00:13,260  -->  00:00:17,870
So you need to have a heading,
need to have a couple of text fields,
7

7

00:00:17,870  -->  00:00:18,550
couple of buttons.
8

8

00:00:18,550  -->  00:00:23,660
This button is the default button this
is the back button and then sliders so
9

9

00:00:23,660  -->  00:00:27,560
that the player can be sliding
the volume up and down and
10

10

00:00:27,560  -->  00:00:29,060
sliding the difficulty up and down.
11

11

00:00:29,060  -->  00:00:31,070
So go ahead and make this screen.
12

12

00:00:31,070  -->  00:00:35,170
Also for bonus points, implement that the
Back button takes you back to the Start
13

13

00:00:35,170  -->  00:00:36,970
menu or the Start screen.
14

14

00:00:36,970  -->  00:00:38,060
And on the Start screen,
15

15

00:00:38,060  -->  00:00:42,010
you have an Options button that
takes you to the Options screen.
16

16

00:00:42,010  -->  00:00:44,410
So there it is, there's your challenge,
jump in and take that on now, and
17

17

00:00:44,410  -->  00:00:45,860
I'll see you back here when you're done.
18

18

00:00:45,860  -->  00:00:50,624
I'm gonna start by finding my
Start Screen and duplicating that,
19

19

00:00:50,624  -->  00:00:54,038
renaming my Start Screen
to be Options Screen.
20

20

00:00:56,382  -->  00:00:59,380
Then open up Options Screen,
yes, it's opened up.
21

21

00:00:59,380  -->  00:01:01,240
Find the Canvas, find the Image.
22

22

00:01:01,240  -->  00:01:05,640
I'm gonna change my image, I've gone and
downloaded one of the other glitch images.
23

23

00:01:05,640  -->  00:01:10,860
Let me just find Images folder here,
yes, drag that image in.
24

24

00:01:10,860  -->  00:01:13,140
It's kind of a cool mushroom vendor guy.
25

25

00:01:13,140  -->  00:01:15,180
It looks pretty cool,
I quite like that one.
26

26

00:01:15,180  -->  00:01:17,990
And then here we are, Glitch_Meal,
I'm just gonna rename this to being
27

27

00:01:17,990  -->  00:01:23,790
Options Screen Image, so
it's very clear what's going on.
28

28

00:01:23,790  -->  00:01:30,130
Find my image Game object and
then drag in Options Screen Image.
29

29

00:01:30,130  -->  00:01:32,270
There we go, one cool change, wonderful.
30

30

00:01:32,270  -->  00:01:35,460
Okay, now let's find our Start Text,
it's no longer Start Text,
31

31

00:01:35,460  -->  00:01:40,460
it's gonna be Options Heading,
I'll call it Options Heading.
32

32

00:01:40,460  -->  00:01:44,469
Great, change it to
an orangey color I think?
33

33

00:01:45,880  -->  00:01:46,950
There we go, just to be clear.
34

34

00:01:46,950  -->  00:01:48,870
Click on W, move it over.
35

35

00:01:48,870  -->  00:01:52,910
Probably left align cuz I'm gonna have
it over the left side of my screen.
36

36

00:01:52,910  -->  00:01:53,824
There we go.
37

37

00:01:53,824  -->  00:01:58,512
I'm gonna make it a little bit bigger
cuz it's a heading, 140, nice and big.
38

38

00:01:58,512  -->  00:02:02,350
Okay, instead of saying Start Game,
it should say, Options.
39

39

00:02:02,350  -->  00:02:06,020
And grab the quick text,
change that to be the back,
40

40

00:02:06,020  -->  00:02:10,090
button and from quick,
it's gonna say back.
41

41

00:02:10,090  -->  00:02:11,420
It's probably not quick text, is it?
42

42

00:02:11,420  -->  00:02:14,160
It's probably quick button,
but okay, no problem.
43

43

00:02:14,160  -->  00:02:16,430
And back down here make
this bigger as well.
44

44

00:02:16,430  -->  00:02:20,490
I'll make it say 125, see how that looks.
45

45

00:02:20,490  -->  00:02:24,110
I'll weight this one 140 as well, just to
be really clear, that's how we get back.
46

46

00:02:25,410  -->  00:02:28,230
And then one more button that we need,
click on back button,
47

47

00:02:28,230  -->  00:02:32,150
duplicate this,
rename it to be default button.
48

48

00:02:33,300  -->  00:02:36,830
The text I'm gonna
change to be Default and
49

49

00:02:36,830  -->  00:02:40,090
then click, move it on over a little bit.
50

50

00:02:40,090  -->  00:02:41,820
So it's in the middle of the screen.
51

51

00:02:41,820  -->  00:02:44,600
It's gonna be a little bit in conflict
with this whole Glitch heading here, but
52

52

00:02:44,600  -->  00:02:46,090
I'm ignoring that for now.
53

53

00:02:46,090  -->  00:02:48,970
Not very good design, but we're working
with the images that we've got, so
54

54

00:02:48,970  -->  00:02:51,420
Default, Back, and Options.
55

55

00:02:51,420  -->  00:02:56,640
Now we need some text, so
click on Options heading, duplicate that.
56

56

00:02:56,640  -->  00:02:59,180
Highlight this, change it to.
57

57

00:02:59,180  -->  00:03:01,026
Volume is gonna be the first one.
58

58

00:03:01,026  -->  00:03:03,508
Volume, drag it down a little bit.
59

59

00:03:03,508  -->  00:03:07,015
[SOUND] Change the color to
something that doesn't say,
60

60

00:03:07,015  -->  00:03:10,082
I'm a button and
doesn't say, I'm a heading.
61

61

00:03:10,082  -->  00:03:13,340
Change it to this bluey kinda thing,
I think.
62

62

00:03:13,340  -->  00:03:15,200
Make the size smaller, down to 80.
63

63

00:03:15,200  -->  00:03:15,830
How's that?
64

64

00:03:15,830  -->  00:03:17,600
80, probably a little bit too small.
65

65

00:03:17,600  -->  00:03:19,090
100, okay.
66

66

00:03:19,090  -->  00:03:22,350
100 Options,
I'm probably gonna change this color.
67

67

00:03:22,350  -->  00:03:24,210
Looking at it now,
I don't think it quite works, but
68

68

00:03:24,210  -->  00:03:26,390
wait until we've got everything
else lined up first.
69

69

00:03:26,390  -->  00:03:29,070
So change this to be, say, Volume.
70

70

00:03:29,070  -->  00:03:30,820
At the very top, Volume, that's fine.
71

71

00:03:30,820  -->  00:03:36,000
Volume, I will call it Volume Text
to differentiate that it is text and
72

72

00:03:36,000  -->  00:03:37,540
not the slider we'll have in a minute.
73

73

00:03:37,540  -->  00:03:39,540
So Duplicate that as well.
74

74

00:03:39,540  -->  00:03:46,200
This will be called Difficulty Text,
the text will be called Difficulty.
75

75

00:03:47,500  -->  00:03:49,160
Okay, slide that down a little bit.
76

76

00:03:49,160  -->  00:03:52,180
Okay, that's most of it stubbed out,
now we need our sliders.
77

77

00:03:52,180  -->  00:03:59,220
So underneath Canvas,
I'm gonna right-click UI, find a Slider.
78

78

00:03:59,220  -->  00:04:03,370
Excellent it's nice and
tiny at the moment, let's scale it up.
79

79

00:04:03,370  -->  00:04:07,913
Clicking on my R tool,
[SOUND] make it nice and bigger.
80

80

00:04:07,913  -->  00:04:11,158
Okay, that's around a bit so
it looks like it's a 5.
81

81

00:04:11,158  -->  00:04:16,120
5, 5, 5, nice and huge,
probably don't need it quite that big,
82

82

00:04:16,120  -->  00:04:19,100
but we'll start there and
make it a bit smaller if need be.
83

83

00:04:19,100  -->  00:04:21,230
So there's our Volume.
84

84

00:04:21,230  -->  00:04:24,230
Okay, quite massive,
kind of bumping into the guy's face.
85

85

00:04:24,230  -->  00:04:27,000
But we'll get it all stubbed in first,
and then we'll finesse it in a moment.
86

86

00:04:27,000  -->  00:04:32,240
So instead of slider,
this needs to be Volume Slider, excellent.
87

87

00:04:32,240  -->  00:04:35,520
And then we will duplicate that,
actually you know what,
88

88

00:04:35,520  -->  00:04:36,340
I'll change it up a little bit.
89

89

00:04:36,340  -->  00:04:40,160
First I'm going to the handle slide area.
90

90

00:04:40,160  -->  00:04:42,080
We're gonna change,
we've done this before, the image,
91

91

00:04:42,080  -->  00:04:45,280
instead of using the knob,
I'm gonna find the star.
92

92

00:04:45,280  -->  00:04:48,980
There you are, have a little star on
there that we can slide up and down.
93

93

00:04:48,980  -->  00:04:50,410
Okay there we go to our star slider.
94

94

00:04:50,410  -->  00:04:54,280
Now let's click on the volume slider,
duplicate that, and
95

95

00:04:54,280  -->  00:04:57,060
change this to be Difficulty Slider.
96

96

00:04:58,440  -->  00:05:01,350
And I encourage you to do
your own finessing here.
97

97

00:05:01,350  -->  00:05:02,390
Change it up.
98

98

00:05:02,390  -->  00:05:04,310
Create something that
you think looks nifty.
99

99

00:05:04,310  -->  00:05:05,490
We've gone through this before.
100

100

00:05:05,490  -->  00:05:07,590
Animated sliders, they're really good.
101

101

00:05:07,590  -->  00:05:09,330
So I think it is a little bit too big.
102

102

00:05:09,330  -->  00:05:11,500
Go back to Volume Slider, change it to 4.
103

103

00:05:11,500  -->  00:05:15,290
I think it's gonna fit on
the page a little bit better.
104

104

00:05:15,290  -->  00:05:18,845
Okay, good,
good move it a little bit to the left,
105

105

00:05:18,845  -->  00:05:23,172
there we go and we'll do the same
with our difficulty slider.
106

106

00:05:23,172  -->  00:05:26,113
Just change the scale from 5 down to 4.
107

107

00:05:31,009  -->  00:05:35,063
Now I'm going to change up the color,
I'm going to click on the Volume slider,
108

108

00:05:35,063  -->  00:05:36,393
just put it in the middle so
109

109

00:05:36,393  -->  00:05:39,380
I can see what happens on my
left into the right of the star.
110

110

00:05:39,380  -->  00:05:41,970
Let's have a look at the background here.
111

111

00:05:41,970  -->  00:05:44,900
If I change the background
to be say a red.
112

112

00:05:44,900  -->  00:05:47,910
That kind of says I'm not here yet,
that's okay.
113

113

00:05:47,910  -->  00:05:49,930
I can make it a darkish red.
114

114

00:05:49,930  -->  00:05:52,440
And then we'll see if we
can find the fill area.
115

115

00:05:52,440  -->  00:05:55,190
Click on fill underneath fill area.
116

116

00:05:55,190  -->  00:05:57,650
The color here will make
the same color as the text.
117

117

00:05:57,650  -->  00:06:00,140
So this bluish kind of color.
118

118

00:06:00,140  -->  00:06:03,310
Okay, so that way, as we're sliding,
click on Volume Slider,
119

119

00:06:03,310  -->  00:06:07,910
as we're sliding it's kinda going
from I'm filled up with blue,
120

120

00:06:07,910  -->  00:06:11,550
versus I'm not filled up with that last
little bit of the red there, okay,
121

121

00:06:11,550  -->  00:06:14,040
to give a visual indication to the player.
122

122

00:06:14,040  -->  00:06:17,020
And then Difficulty, yeah,
we'll do the same for Difficulty, as well.
123

123

00:06:17,020  -->  00:06:21,190
So let me go and Find my Background here,
click on the red, highlight
124

124

00:06:21,190  -->  00:06:26,190
the hexadecimal code and then go over
into the difficulty slider background,
125

125

00:06:26,190  -->  00:06:28,750
click on the color,
paste in the hexadecimal.
126

126

00:06:29,840  -->  00:06:32,770
Now we want to slide our
slider along a little bit so
127

127

00:06:32,770  -->  00:06:34,300
we can see that it's working.
128

128

00:06:34,300  -->  00:06:37,830
Click on the Fill for
129

129

00:06:37,830  -->  00:06:42,740
the fill area for the other one,
for the Volume slider, copy that.
130

130

00:06:42,740  -->  00:06:48,150
And then to paste that into
the Fill underneath Fill Area for
131

131

00:06:48,150  -->  00:06:49,770
the Difficulty slider.
132

132

00:06:49,770  -->  00:06:51,540
I know that's a lot of bouncing around.
133

133

00:06:51,540  -->  00:06:55,230
Okay, Save that up, now we need to get
the functionality for the Back button.
134

134

00:06:55,230  -->  00:06:57,950
We won't have Defaults just yet,
but for the Back button.
135

135

00:06:57,950  -->  00:07:01,010
Okay, let's just check, yes,
we have Level Loader in the screen.
136

136

00:07:01,010  -->  00:07:01,870
We will now go and
137

137

00:07:01,870  -->  00:07:05,960
click on the Back Button which already had
functionality I think of the Quick Button.
138

138

00:07:05,960  -->  00:07:06,640
Yes it did.
139

139

00:07:06,640  -->  00:07:14,020
So I'll change the Quick Button to
be LevelLoader LoadMainMenu, okay.
140

140

00:07:14,020  -->  00:07:18,029
And then Default, we don't want Default
to accidentally break the game, so
141

141

00:07:18,029  -->  00:07:22,222
for now I'm going to give it No Function,
just to say that when you click on that,
142

142

00:07:22,222  -->  00:07:23,224
nothing happens.
143

143

00:07:26,090  -->  00:07:30,169
So let's save this up,
go back into our Start menu,
144

144

00:07:30,169  -->  00:07:34,173
Start Scene, [SOUND],
Start Screen, there it is.
145

145

00:07:34,173  -->  00:07:37,630
And we need to add an extra button
within here, which is Options.
146

146

00:07:37,630  -->  00:07:39,470
So open up our Canvas.
147

147

00:07:39,470  -->  00:07:44,080
Click on start game which is not
start text but start button.
148

148

00:07:44,080  -->  00:07:47,510
I'm gonna change this while I'm here,
start button, and it's not quick text but
149

149

00:07:47,510  -->  00:07:48,600
it is quick button.
150

150

00:07:48,600  -->  00:07:52,410
How about naming button up,
Ben would be very proud,
151

151

00:07:52,410  -->  00:07:55,260
he's very into having things named.
152

152

00:07:55,260  -->  00:07:56,950
Exactly the way it should be.
153

153

00:07:56,950  -->  00:08:00,230
So thank you to Ben for
instilling that in us.
154

154

00:08:00,230  -->  00:08:04,980
Click on Start Button, duplicate,
drag that down a little bit.
155

155

00:08:04,980  -->  00:08:09,500
Instead of Start Game, we are going
to call this the Options Button.
156

156

00:08:11,680  -->  00:08:15,030
And then in the text we have Options.
157

157

00:08:15,030  -->  00:08:17,720
Okay, start game, options and quit.
158

158

00:08:17,720  -->  00:08:19,930
Our three things in there,
let's scroll down.
159

159

00:08:19,930  -->  00:08:25,170
Now we haven't added this to our
build index so file, build settings,
160

160

00:08:25,170  -->  00:08:27,210
let's find our options screen.
161

161

00:08:27,210  -->  00:08:33,890
I'm going to put that, let's see,
we wanna go straight from splash screen
162

162

00:08:33,890  -->  00:08:37,290
to start screen, start screen to level one
it's kind of the flow that we're doing.
163

163

00:08:37,290  -->  00:08:42,790
So put this as the second to last,
at some point we'll have a,
164

164

00:08:42,790  -->  00:08:45,960
you win the entire game screen,
which would be after all of our levels.
165

165

00:08:45,960  -->  00:08:48,300
But at the moment we'll put our
options screen just there for me.
166

166

00:08:48,300  -->  00:08:52,810
It's build index four Close that up, we
need to give ourselves some functionality,
167

167

00:08:52,810  -->  00:08:55,870
so open up your level loader script.
168

168

00:08:55,870  -->  00:08:58,570
I don't think we've got that at
the moment, start screen, lose screen,
169

169

00:08:58,570  -->  00:08:59,600
no we don't.
170

170

00:08:59,600  -->  00:09:04,662
So I'm gonna highlight my LoadMainMenu,
copy that.
171

171

00:09:04,662  -->  00:09:09,610
So I'm in LevelLoader,
I found LoadMainMenu method,
172

172

00:09:09,610  -->  00:09:14,874
and I'm hollowing that,
copying pasting underneath it,
173

173

00:09:14,874  -->  00:09:20,034
and we're going to create
ourselves a new public method,
174

174

00:09:20,034  -->  00:09:24,584
public void LoadOptionsScreen
we'll call this.
175

175

00:09:24,584  -->  00:09:28,310
And timeScale nope, we don't want
to be messing around with that
176

176

00:09:28,310  -->  00:09:33,000
SceneManager.LoadScene, back over into
Unity to make sure we copy it exactly.
177

177

00:09:33,000  -->  00:09:37,030
We've called Options Screen, so
I'll highlight that, copy that,
178

178

00:09:37,030  -->  00:09:41,395
back over into our script,
paste that as our string reference.
179

179

00:09:41,395  -->  00:09:43,718
[SOUND] We don't like string references,
but
180

180

00:09:43,718  -->  00:09:46,293
sometimes we use them
because we need to use them.
181

181

00:09:46,293  -->  00:09:50,870
LoadOptionsScreen, now we can
go into the Options Button.
182

182

00:09:50,870  -->  00:09:53,300
Click on the Options Button,
scroll all the way down the bottom.
183

183

00:09:53,300  -->  00:09:58,090
Instead of LoadNextScene, we're gonna
change that to be LevelLoader and
184

184

00:09:58,090  -->  00:10:00,230
LoadOptionsScreen.
185

185

00:10:00,230  -->  00:10:05,230
Great, Save, click on Play,
check that it all works.
186

186

00:10:05,230  -->  00:10:07,460
Click on options takes us
into our options screen.
187

187

00:10:07,460  -->  00:10:08,970
We can twiddle our sliders.
188

188

00:10:08,970  -->  00:10:10,900
Well, that actually doesn't look too bad,
does it?
189

189

00:10:10,900  -->  00:10:14,650
And clicking Defaults does nothing yet,
click on Back, Back into the start screen.
190

190

00:10:14,650  -->  00:10:16,980
Back boom boom,
just check Start Game works.
191

191

00:10:16,980  -->  00:10:20,480
So it does, excellent,
mission accomplished, success, great work.
192

192

00:10:20,480  -->  00:10:23,390
In our next video we'll start
hooking up some functionality
193

193

00:10:23,390  -->  00:10:26,490
in our Options screen so
we can get it doing some cool stuff.
194

194

00:10:26,490  -->  00:10:28,350
Okay, great work and
I'll see you in the next video.
