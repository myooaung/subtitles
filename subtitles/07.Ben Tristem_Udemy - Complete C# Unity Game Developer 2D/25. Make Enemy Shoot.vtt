00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:05.070
[SOUND]
In this video,
2

2

00:00:05.070  -->  00:00:07.838
we're giving our enemies some bullets and
having them shoot.
3

3

00:00:07.838  -->  00:00:10.648
We've got lots of tunability here.
4

4

00:00:10.648  -->  00:00:13.272
We've got some randomness and
a lot of levers for
5

5

00:00:13.272  -->  00:00:16.603
you to pull when you're doing
your design tuning of the game.
6

6

00:00:16.603  -->  00:00:19.526
So let's jump in and
have our enemies do some shooting.
7

7

00:00:19.526  -->  00:00:23.469
In this video, we're working in the the
Enemy script and the Player script.
8

8

00:00:23.469  -->  00:00:25.961
So let's just recap what we're
trying to do with our enemy.
9

9

00:00:25.961  -->  00:00:29.839
A little bit different to the player,
cuz the player is shooting on a coroutine
10

10

00:00:29.839  -->  00:00:33.565
based upon whether the input is on
the button down or not on the button down.
11

11

00:00:33.565  -->  00:00:36.862
But we don't need the button-down stuff
for the enemy, cuz the enemy is our AI,
12

12

00:00:36.862  -->  00:00:38.671
and it knows whether it's shooting or not.
13

13

00:00:38.671  -->  00:00:40.216
So this is an enemy.
14

14

00:00:40.216  -->  00:00:43.497
It kinda looks like a box, but
let's pretend it's an enemy.
15

15

00:00:43.497  -->  00:00:45.514
There you go, it's an enemy with ears.
16

16

00:00:45.514  -->  00:00:47.147
[LAUGH] Best enemy ever.
17

17

00:00:47.147  -->  00:00:48.126
And a rocket booster.
18

18

00:00:48.126  -->  00:00:51.697
So when the enemy shoots,
it's gonna shoot a laser beam.
19

19

00:00:51.697  -->  00:00:55.792
And this laser beam, we want to
have it shoot at a certain time.
20

20

00:00:55.792  -->  00:00:57.813
So if we don't give it
a mechanism of time,
21

21

00:00:57.813  -->  00:01:01.082
it's just gonna be this constant
stream of shooting the whole time.
22

22

00:01:01.082  -->  00:01:05.154
So what we wanna say is shoot
every x amount of time.
23

23

00:01:05.154  -->  00:01:07.124
So every one second, for example.
24

24

00:01:07.124  -->  00:01:11.113
So then it's gonna go pew, and then
wait a second, pew, wait a second, pew,
25

25

00:01:11.113  -->  00:01:11.904
wait a second.
26

26

00:01:11.904  -->  00:01:13.982
I also think we should
put in some randomness.
27

27

00:01:13.982  -->  00:01:17.868
Cuz when you get an enemy
that's going pew, pew, pew,
28

28

00:01:17.868  -->  00:01:21.849
it's very predictable and
very, again, not organic.
29

29

00:01:21.849  -->  00:01:25.570
It doesn't feel like the enemy is
actually thinking about what it's doing.
30

30

00:01:25.570  -->  00:01:29.049
Now, just a slight caveat, you might
wanna have an enemy that comes onto
31

31

00:01:29.049  -->  00:01:31.561
the screen and
it has a very predictable pattern, so
32

32

00:01:31.561  -->  00:01:34.091
the player has to do some
kind of dodging or weaving.
33

33

00:01:34.091  -->  00:01:37.334
So predictability is okay, but
I wanna have some randomness.
34

34

00:01:37.334  -->  00:01:41.990
So it might be every second, all right,
plus or minus half a second, for example,
35

35

00:01:41.990  -->  00:01:44.130
that we want our enemy to be shooting.
36

36

00:01:44.130  -->  00:01:48.655
So we need a mechanism of
having a shot counter.
37

37

00:01:48.655  -->  00:01:54.122
And if it's 1 second, then as soon
as we shoot the previous bullet,
38

38

00:01:54.122  -->  00:01:59.964
or as soon as we start our shot counter,
we want that to be ticking down to,
39

39

00:01:59.964  -->  00:02:05.380
0.99, 0.98, 0.97, and so
on until we get down to 0.
40

40

00:02:05.380  -->  00:02:08.504
And then when we get down to 0 it says,
fire!
41

41

00:02:08.504  -->  00:02:13.417
And then it restarts the shot counter.
42

42

00:02:13.417  -->  00:02:16.939
And it might be, if we've got this
randomness in here, it might start at 1,
43

43

00:02:16.939  -->  00:02:20.300
or it might start at 1.2, for example,
and then it ticks its way down,
44

44

00:02:20.300  -->  00:02:21.846
and when it gets to 0, it fires.
45

45

00:02:21.846  -->  00:02:25.102
Okay, so that's generally
the approach we're taking.
46

46

00:02:25.102  -->  00:02:28.086
So we'll start by creating
our shot counter.
47

47

00:02:28.086  -->  00:02:31.696
So [SerializeField] float, and
I'll call this shotCounter.
48

48

00:02:31.696  -->  00:02:35.050
And this is serialized just so we can see
it in the Inspector if we need to look
49

49

00:02:35.050  -->  00:02:38.587
at it from a debug point of view, but
not so that we're changing it ourselves.
50

50

00:02:38.587  -->  00:02:43.150
Now, two more variables,
[SerializeField] float,
51

51

00:02:43.150  -->  00:02:46.667
this will be our minTimeBetweenShots, and
52

52

00:02:46.667  -->  00:02:50.862
we'll initialize that at, say, 0.2f;.
53

53

00:02:50.862  -->  00:02:55.252
And then we will [SerializeField],
54

54

00:02:55.252  -->  00:03:01.920
create a float that we'll
call maxTimeBetweenShots.
55

55

00:03:01.920  -->  00:03:05.195
We'll initialize that at, say, 3f.
56

56

00:03:05.195  -->  00:03:10.413
Okay, so within our stop method, let's,
start our shop counter, when we start our
57

57

00:03:10.413  -->  00:03:15.718
script, in other words when, start is cold
that means our enemy has been insatiated.
58

58

00:03:15.718  -->  00:03:18.463
We want to initialize our shot counter or
start it.
59

59

00:03:18.463  -->  00:03:23.563
So shotCounter = Random.Range.
60

60

00:03:23.563  -->  00:03:27.509
And the Random.Range is going
to be between two values.
61

61

00:03:27.509  -->  00:03:31.274
And those two values, you guessed it,
62

62

00:03:31.274  -->  00:03:36.421
are minTimeBetweenShots,
maxTimeBetweenShots.
63

63

00:03:36.421  -->  00:03:41.293
Okey-dokey, now, in our update,
we need to be saying, okay,
64

64

00:03:41.293  -->  00:03:44.756
shoot and
then start your shot counter again.
65

65

00:03:44.756  -->  00:03:48.727
Or wait until you're able to shoot again,
and then after we've shot,
66

66

00:03:48.727  -->  00:03:51.387
we need to restart our
shot counter once again.
67

67

00:03:51.387  -->  00:03:55.809
So in our update, let's call a method,
we'll call this CountDownAndShoot,
68

68

00:03:55.809  -->  00:03:59.247
that we haven't created yet,
but we'll create in a moment.
69

69

00:03:59.247  -->  00:04:01.507
Parentheses and semicolon.
70

70

00:04:01.507  -->  00:04:07.807
I'll create this just right
underneath our Update method,
71

71

00:04:07.807  -->  00:04:12.015
private void CountDownAndShoot().
72

72

00:04:12.015  -->  00:04:13.640
Open our code block.
73

73

00:04:13.640  -->  00:04:15.403
Now, what shall we say within here?
74

74

00:04:15.403  -->  00:04:18.210
We need a way of decreasing
our shot counter.
75

75

00:04:18.210  -->  00:04:26.186
So shotCounter -= Time.deltaTime.
76

76

00:04:26.186  -->  00:04:28.990
So we have this frame rate
independent using Time.deltaTime.
77

77

00:04:28.990  -->  00:04:33.652
So it's saying every frame,
cuz we're calling this method every frame,
78

78

00:04:33.652  -->  00:04:38.390
CountDownAndShoot, every frame our shot
counter needs to be going down for
79

79

00:04:38.390  -->  00:04:40.776
however long our frame takes in time.
80

80

00:04:40.776  -->  00:04:46.460
So that's shotCounter minus the time
that our frame takes every single frame.
81

81

00:04:46.460  -->  00:04:49.481
And then once the shotCounter gets to 0,
that's when we shoot.
82

82

00:04:49.481  -->  00:04:54.183
So we'll say if (shotCounter &lt;= 0f),
83

83

00:04:54.183  -->  00:04:58.510
so float, then what do we wanna do here?
84

84

00:04:58.510  -->  00:05:01.583
Well, in this case, we want to say, fire!
85

85

00:05:01.583  -->  00:05:04.022
Fire(), and then semicolon.
86

86

00:05:04.022  -->  00:05:04.810
What is Fire?
87

87

00:05:04.810  -->  00:05:05.873
Well, we haven't created that yet.
88

88

00:05:05.873  -->  00:05:09.812
But that is where we are going to
instantiate our projectile and
89

89

00:05:09.812  -->  00:05:12.127
to give it some downwards velocity.
90

90

00:05:12.127  -->  00:05:14.635
And I'm gonna save and
jump over to my slide,
91

91

00:05:14.635  -->  00:05:18.931
cuz this is where I have a challenge for
you, which is to make the enemy shoot.
92

92

00:05:18.931  -->  00:05:22.078
So as we did with the player shooting,
so there's the big hint for you,
93

93

00:05:22.078  -->  00:05:25.083
is to go into the Player script and
have a look at what we did in there.
94

94

00:05:25.083  -->  00:05:28.902
Or, if you think you can figure this out
without going and having a look at that,
95

95

00:05:28.902  -->  00:05:29.988
that's cool as well.
96

96

00:05:29.988  -->  00:05:33.528
What you need to do is
instantiate a projectile and
97

97

00:05:33.528  -->  00:05:36.065
to give it velocity to make it move.
98

98

00:05:36.065  -->  00:05:40.971
Remember, we also need to serialize
a variable that will be the projectile, so
99

99

00:05:40.971  -->  00:05:45.512
that in the Inspector we can say the enemy
is going to shoot this particular
100

100

00:05:45.512  -->  00:05:46.409
projectile.
101

101

00:05:46.409  -->  00:05:50.197
And we also need to create
a projectile for the enemy to shoot.
102

102

00:05:50.197  -->  00:05:51.838
So there's a few things to do in there.
103

103

00:05:51.838  -->  00:05:54.333
But if you just wanna
do the starting point,
104

104

00:05:54.333  -->  00:05:58.996
it's to instantiate the projectile and
give it some velocity to move downwards.
105

105

00:05:58.996  -->  00:06:01.080
So take that on, and
I'll see you back here in a moment.
106

106

00:06:03.023  -->  00:06:04.682
Okay, so we have our Fire method.
107

107

00:06:04.682  -->  00:06:08.539
I'm going to create a private,
don't know what happened there.
108

108

00:06:08.539  -->  00:06:13.074
Going to create a private
void Fire method, open and
109

109

00:06:13.074  -->  00:06:17.000
close parentheses, and then curly braces.
110

110

00:06:17.000  -->  00:06:19.694
In here we need to start by
having some way of saying,
111

111

00:06:19.694  -->  00:06:21.364
this is what the projectile is.
112

112

00:06:21.364  -->  00:06:25.552
So, we'll create a GameObject that
I will call, we'll call it laser.
113

113

00:06:25.552  -->  00:06:28.663
It might not always be a laser,
but I'll just call it that now,
114

114

00:06:28.663  -->  00:06:32.277
cuz that's a generic kinda enemy word for
what it's gonna be shooting.
115

115

00:06:32.277  -->  00:06:34.904
And that = Instantiate.
116

116

00:06:34.904  -->  00:06:39.082
We know this is gonna be reasonably long,
so I'll put this on the next line.
117

117

00:06:39.082  -->  00:06:41.880
Instantiate (projectile).
118

118

00:06:41.880  -->  00:06:45.486
And we need some sort of mechanism
to say what projectile is, so
119

119

00:06:45.486  -->  00:06:48.829
I'll go up to the top of my script,
[SerializeField].
120

120

00:06:50.876  -->  00:06:55.378
[SerializeField], this will be
121

121

00:06:55.378  -->  00:07:00.934
a GameObject that we will call projectile.
122

122

00:07:00.934  -->  00:07:03.088
Oops, okay.
123

123

00:07:03.088  -->  00:07:04.255
GameObject of projectile.
124

124

00:07:04.255  -->  00:07:06.955
So let's back down to our
Instantiate (projectile,
125

125

00:07:06.955  -->  00:07:09.075
comma, what comes next in this sequence?
126

126

00:07:09.075  -->  00:07:13.497
Well it's the position that we
want it to instantiate at, so
127

127

00:07:13.497  -->  00:07:15.934
that's transform.position.
128

128

00:07:15.934  -->  00:07:22.601
So create yourself where the enemy is,
and then Quaternion.identity,
129

129

00:07:22.601  -->  00:07:28.956
which is just our way of saying we
don't need to worry about rotation.
130

130

00:07:28.956  -->  00:07:33.055
The rotation is just
the rotation of the parent.
131

131

00:07:33.055  -->  00:07:34.923
And we close our parentheses.
132

132

00:07:34.923  -->  00:07:38.408
And then we say as GameObject
to be very clear that
133

133

00:07:38.408  -->  00:07:42.410
we're instantiating our
GameObject as a GameObject.
134

134

00:07:42.410  -->  00:07:45.318
And on the next line, again,
I haven't showed you the Player script but
135

135

00:07:45.318  -->  00:07:47.083
I'm sure you found it
if you went looking for
136

136

00:07:47.083  -->  00:07:49.153
this while we we're doing
our Fire continuously.
137

137

00:07:49.153  -->  00:07:52.701
We've got the same information here
where we have our laser.GetComponent.
138

138

00:07:52.701  -->  00:07:56.071
So I might just copy this from over
here on our Player script, copy that,
139

139

00:07:56.071  -->  00:07:59.800
head over into the Enemy script, paste
that out and make sure it all looks okay.
140

140

00:07:59.800  -->  00:08:05.298
laser.GetComponent&lt;Rigidbody2D&gt; yes,
.velocity, that looks good.
141

141

00:08:05.298  -->  00:08:08.849
= new Vector 2(0, projectileSpeed).
142

142

00:08:08.849  -->  00:08:13.699
Okay, we don't have a projectileSpeed yet,
so again, [SerializeField],
143

143

00:08:13.699  -->  00:08:17.500
and this'll be a float, and
we'll call it projectileSpeed.
144

144

00:08:17.500  -->  00:08:23.504
And we'll start that off at,
let's say 10f, just as a guess.
145

145

00:08:23.504  -->  00:08:24.640
So we have our projectileSpeed.
146

146

00:08:24.640  -->  00:08:26.843
Back down to our Fire.
147

147

00:08:26.843  -->  00:08:29.201
Okay, so there's one problem with this.
148

148

00:08:29.201  -->  00:08:34.075
You can see that in the Player,
we have a positive projectileSpeed,
149

149

00:08:34.075  -->  00:08:37.698
which has the enemy shooting
upwards on the y axis.
150

150

00:08:37.698  -->  00:08:40.871
Whereas our Enemy,
we need to be shooting downwards, cuz
151

151

00:08:40.871  -->  00:08:45.492
they're coming from the top and shooting
down, so we'll say -projectileSpeed.
152

152

00:08:45.492  -->  00:08:49.471
We'll save all this up, jump back
over into Unity, find a projectile.
153

153

00:08:49.471  -->  00:08:51.124
Do we have one yet for our enemy?
154

154

00:08:51.124  -->  00:08:52.653
Probably not.
155

155

00:08:52.653  -->  00:08:53.661
Click on Prefabs.
156

156

00:08:53.661  -->  00:08:54.732
We've got the Player Laser.
157

157

00:08:54.732  -->  00:08:55.667
I'm gonna create a different one.
158

158

00:08:55.667  -->  00:08:58.326
I'm not gonna use the Player Laser,
cuz we're
159

159

00:08:58.326  -->  00:09:02.727
gonna have different sort of damage and
different values on the Player Laser.
160

160

00:09:02.727  -->  00:09:05.741
So over into our assets,
we'll see what we've got.
161

161

00:09:05.741  -->  00:09:11.454
PNG, Lasers, okay,
we've got a few in here.
162

162

00:09:11.454  -->  00:09:15.234
[SOUND] Okay,
this red laser beam looks like it's okay.
163

163

00:09:15.234  -->  00:09:17.234
I'm gonna drop that into
my Sprites folder, so
164

164

00:09:17.234  -->  00:09:19.436
it's very clear I am using it for
my Sprites folder.
165

165

00:09:19.436  -->  00:09:22.814
Drop it into my scene,
that looks just fine.
166

166

00:09:22.814  -->  00:09:25.066
It might be a little bit too dark, but
167

167

00:09:25.066  -->  00:09:29.803
that'll add to the danger of the whole
situation with these red laser beams.
168

168

00:09:29.803  -->  00:09:32.349
We might need to brighten it up a little
bit, but for now we'll leave it as is.
169

169

00:09:32.349  -->  00:09:36.746
Instead of LaserRed3,
I’ll call this Enemy Laser, and
170

170

00:09:36.746  -->  00:09:41.510
then drag that into my Prefabs
folder to create an enemy laser.
171

171

00:09:41.510  -->  00:09:42.328
Super-duper.
172

172

00:09:42.328  -->  00:09:43.690
What’s on the Player Laser?
173

173

00:09:43.690  -->  00:09:47.393
Well, we’ve got a Damage Dealer script,
we need to have that on an enemy as well.
174

174

00:09:47.393  -->  00:09:51.099
Enemy Laser for the future,
Damage Dealer, great.
175

175

00:09:51.099  -->  00:09:53.719
The Damage Dealer is looking for
a certain amount of damage.
176

176

00:09:53.719  -->  00:09:56.167
Cool, we'll leave that as is for now and
177

177

00:09:56.167  -->  00:10:02.159
then jump over onto our enemy prefab,
To Roger on here.
178

178

00:10:02.159  -->  00:10:05.621
We need to tell him what
the projectile is going to be.
179

179

00:10:05.621  -->  00:10:08.577
So in our Inspector,
I've found my Enemy script.
180

180

00:10:08.577  -->  00:10:12.645
And there's a field, Projectile,
that currently has no GameObject.
181

181

00:10:12.645  -->  00:10:16.431
I've hit my selector, and
then select on Enemy Laser.
182

182

00:10:16.431  -->  00:10:18.199
Projectile speed 10, good.
183

183

00:10:18.199  -->  00:10:20.945
The shot counter is 0.
184

184

00:10:20.945  -->  00:10:22.583
So we've exposed that in the Inspector.
185

185

00:10:22.583  -->  00:10:24.102
We probably don't need to see that, but
186

186

00:10:24.102  -->  00:10:26.704
we can look at it from the point of
view of debugging what's going on.
187

187

00:10:26.704  -->  00:10:29.367
And we can hide that once we've
got that all taken care of.
188

188

00:10:29.367  -->  00:10:30.876
And this looks pretty good.
189

189

00:10:30.876  -->  00:10:32.516
Let's see if it actually shoots.
190

190

00:10:32.516  -->  00:10:36.182
I'm going to delete my laser
that I dropped into the scene.
191

191

00:10:36.182  -->  00:10:39.004
Click on play, all going to plan.
192

192

00:10:39.004  -->  00:10:41.538
We should have some shooting, whoops.
193

193

00:10:41.538  -->  00:10:45.517
Okay, so they're shooting, but
not in a way that makes any sense at all.
194

194

00:10:45.517  -->  00:10:47.918
So they're just leaving it
as a trail behind them.
195

195

00:10:47.918  -->  00:10:50.540
Let's jump back into our script
to see what we're doing here,
196

196

00:10:50.540  -->  00:10:52.720
make sure we're actually
giving it some velocity.
197

197

00:10:52.720  -->  00:10:58.118
Laser, yes, and of course the clue
is right here in this line.
198

198

00:10:58.118  -->  00:11:01.581
When we have a look at this, what is the
one thing in here that we haven't talked
199

199

00:11:01.581  -->  00:11:03.059
about when it comes to our laser?
200

200

00:11:03.059  -->  00:11:06.312
We haven't talked about actually
giving it a Rigidbody 2D.
201

201

00:11:06.312  -->  00:11:07.114
So that's cool.
202

202

00:11:07.114  -->  00:11:12.269
Let's click on our Enemy Laser prefab,
Add Component, Rigidbody 2D.
203

203

00:11:12.269  -->  00:11:13.746
Now it should be cool.
204

204

00:11:13.746  -->  00:11:17.469
It has a Rigidbody 2D, so it knows how
to push itself along with some velocity.
205

205

00:11:17.469  -->  00:11:22.165
It's currently on body type Dynamic, so
I'm going to change that to Kinematic,
206

206

00:11:22.165  -->  00:11:25.243
not leave it on Dynamic,
as I did for my Player Laser.
207

207

00:11:25.243  -->  00:11:27.008
At some point, here we go.
208

208

00:11:27.008  -->  00:11:28.228
Move around, okay.
209

209

00:11:28.228  -->  00:11:32.394
[LAUGH] That's doing a whole
lot of shooting, pretty nasty.
210

210

00:11:32.394  -->  00:11:38.782
And that is because we have
not reset our shotCounter.
211

211

00:11:38.782  -->  00:11:41.601
We haven't said the,
let's see up here, shotCounter,
212

212

00:11:41.601  -->  00:11:44.952
we're setting at Random.Range and
saying how long it should take.
213

213

00:11:44.952  -->  00:11:45.925
I'm gonna copy that.
214

214

00:11:45.925  -->  00:11:51.534
And then after we Fire, we need to add
this line to reset the shotCounter,
215

215

00:11:51.534  -->  00:11:56.975
and to give it a new Random.Range
between our minimum and our maximum.
216

216

00:11:56.975  -->  00:11:59.516
We'll save this up again,
jump back over into Unity.
217

217

00:11:59.516  -->  00:12:01.067
This is often the process we go through.
218

218

00:12:01.067  -->  00:12:01.832
Add a little bit,
219

219

00:12:01.832  -->  00:12:04.996
chip away at it, figure out what's wrong,
figure out what's working.
220

220

00:12:04.996  -->  00:12:09.649
Now our enemies should be shooting in
a little bit more of a friendly way.
221

221

00:12:09.649  -->  00:12:11.184
Okay, shoot-shoot, pew-pew.
222

222

00:12:11.184  -->  00:12:13.091
Okay, there's some good
lasers coming down.
223

223

00:12:13.091  -->  00:12:16.159
It looks like there's
definitely randomness in them.
224

224

00:12:16.159  -->  00:12:19.905
And we'll see if one enemy,
we'll have a look at our guy just here.
225

225

00:12:19.905  -->  00:12:21.686
It looks like he's
shooting quite regularly.
226

226

00:12:21.686  -->  00:12:23.071
Yeah, so shooting over and over.
227

227

00:12:23.071  -->  00:12:27.159
We'll make sure when we shoot the enemies
that the right sort of behavior happens.
228

228

00:12:27.159  -->  00:12:28.364
Okay, looking pretty good.
229

229

00:12:28.364  -->  00:12:32.311
So next up, we need to give our player
some health and a way for the enemy and
230

230

00:12:32.311  -->  00:12:35.510
the enemy's bullets to decrease
the health of the player.
231

231

00:12:35.510  -->  00:12:37.080
Great work, and
see you in the next lecture.
