00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.080
- [Instructor] In this video, we are going to import

2
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.080
the dependencies we need for our application.

3
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.030
Let's open up IntelliJ, and then

4
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.020
open up the file app.module.ts.

5
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.040
Let's import reactive forms module.

6
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.020
Type in import, then ReactiveFormsModule,

7
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:30.050
surrounded by curly braces, from @angular/forms,

8
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.000
and be sure to add a semi colon at the end.

9
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.020
ReactiveFormsModule is a template-driven forms module

10
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.020
that facilitates the creation of forms.

11
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:50.040
Let's also add it into the imports section of the NgModule.

12
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.060
Now, lets import the HTTP client module.

13
00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:02.040
Type in import HTTPClientModule

14
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:10.090
from @angular/common/http.

15
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.040
Let's add the module into imports,

16
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.030
and then save the file.

17
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.040
The HTTPClientModule allows us to

18
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.070
use the HTTP client where we need it.

19
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.030
Now, lets open up app.component.ts.

20
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:42.000
Let's import FormControl and FormGroup...

21
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
from angular/forms.

22
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.020
Let's also import the HTTPClient

23
00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.050
from angular/common/http.

24
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.010
Let's add in a constructor in the AppComponent class.

25
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.020
The constructor will accept a instance of the HTTP client.

26
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:19.020
Type in private, http, colon, HttpClient.

27
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.080
Now finally, let's add in some constants

28
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.030
for the URI for our Spring REST API.

29
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.050
Let's create a private string named baseUrl,

30
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.090
and set it to localhost at port 8080.

31
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.030
Now, let's create another variable called reservationUrl.

32
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.080
Let's make it of the type string,

33
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.040
and let's concat the baseUrl,

34
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.050
plus the room reservation URI.

35
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:57.060
Let's append the room reservation URL to the baseUrl.

36
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.030
And don't forget to add a semi colon

37
00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.000
at the end of each statement.

38
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Great! That's all we need to move forward.
