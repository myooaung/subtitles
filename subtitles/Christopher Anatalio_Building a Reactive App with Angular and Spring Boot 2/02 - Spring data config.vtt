00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.070
- [Narrator] In this video, we will configure

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.030
our beans to be used to interact

3
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.000
with our MongoDB database.

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.060
First, let's open up IntelliJ.

5
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:15.050
Then, let's navigate to SRC, main, Java,

6
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:22.020
the base package, config, and then open up data config.

7
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.030
First off, let's define a string constant

8
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.080
to define the database name.

9
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.060
Let's use a IntelliJ shortcut here.

10
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:37.010
Type in psfs, and press enter.

11
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.080
That will automatically type out public static final string.

12
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.000
Then in all caps, let's type out database name.

13
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.030
Constants are generally named in snake case

14
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.000
in all uppercase letters.

15
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.070
An underscore separates each element of the name.

16
00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.020
This format is also called screaming snake.

17
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.000
Let's set the database name to reservations.

18
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.020
Now let's define a method that returns the type

19
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.060
Reactive Mongo Database Factory.

20
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.010
Type in public.

21
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.090
Reactive Mongo Database Factory.

22
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.060
Let's go ahead and use auto complete.

23
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.090
And let's take a Mongo client as a parameter.

24
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.010
This Mongo client bean comes from

25
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.030
the embedded Mongo auto configuration class.

26
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.050
Reactive Mongo Database Factory is an interface.

27
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.070
So let's implement a concrete class.

28
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.090
Let's instantiate a instance of simple,

29
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.060
Reactive Mongo Database Factory.

30
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.040
Then, let's pass in a instance of Mongo client,

31
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.040
and our database name.

32
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.060
We need to be sure to import the right version

33
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.020
of the Mongo client.

34
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.040
If we take a look at line three,

35
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.060
we imported the non reactive version of the Mongo client.

36
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.060
So if we delete that line,

37
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.010
and use the keyboard shortcut alt plus enter,

38
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.040
we can be sure to grab the reactive version

39
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.090
of the Mongo client.

40
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.090
Then let's add a bean annotation.

41
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.070
Now let's define another dependency

42
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.060
of the type Reactive Mongo Operations.

43
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.000
Type in public.

44
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.070
And then set the return type to the interface

45
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.090
Reactive Mongo Operations.

46
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.020
Let's name the method Reactive Mongo Template.

47
00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:01.030
And pass in the bean Reactive Mongo Database Factory.

48
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.000
Now, let's instantiate a instance

49
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.010
of Reactive Mongo Template.

50
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:16.030
Type in return new Reactive Mongo Template.

51
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.010
Which is a concrete implementation

52
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.080
of the interface Reactive Mongo Operations.

53
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.080
Let's pass in the Mongo Database Factory bean,

54
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.000
and close it at the semicolon.

55
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.020
Finally, let's mark it as a bean.

56
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.020
Now our Reactive Mongo Template

57
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.000
is available for dependency injection.

58
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.090
Keep in mind, this config is for your local profile.

59
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.000
Your configuration may change in production.
