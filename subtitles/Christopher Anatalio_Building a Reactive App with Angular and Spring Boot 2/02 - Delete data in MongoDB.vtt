00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.080
- [Instructor] Now, let's check out how we could delete

2
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.010
an existing document in MongoDB.

3
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.010
Let's open up IntelliJ,

4
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.050
and then open up the Reservation Services Info class.

5
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.090
Let's jump to line 51,

6
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.070
delete Reservation.

7
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.070
Let use our reactive Mongo template,

8
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.020
and call the method, remove.

9
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.090
Let's pass in a query,

10
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.010
and set the criteria,

11
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.020
where the id field

12
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.040
is equal to the passed in id.

13
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.070
Then let's add in

14
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.010
the Reservation Class,

15
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.030
as the document type.

16
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.090
Let's be sure that Reservation Class

17
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.060
is a argument to the remove method.

18
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.050
The remove method, returns a Mono

19
00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.020
that emits a delete result.

20
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.090
If we click into delete result,

21
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.060
it contains two fields.

22
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:11.030
Acknowledged and Delete count.

23
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.050
Let's go ahead and use flat map,

24
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.060
and take that delete result,

25
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.010
and return a Mono that admits a Boolean,

26
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:28.080
based on whether the delete result was acknowledged.

27
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.090
Let's use command, ALT-L, to format.

28
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.060
Since MongoDB is a distributed database,

29
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.020
a delete result won't necessarily propagate

30
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.070
to every single node

31
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.000
before you get a successful acknowledgement.

32
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
However, we will return true,

33
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
if a delete operation was acknowledged.
