00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.090
- [Interviewer] We are going to create

2
00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:05.040
a Angular service class to encapsulate logic

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.040
for making http requests.

4
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.060
We can use the Angular CLI to do this.

5
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:18.080
Let's check out angular.io/cli/generate.

6
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.000
The ng generate class can help you generate

7
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.030
all kinds of different components you may need.

8
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.030
Now let's open up a terminal.

9
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.070
Let's navigate to the reservation app directory.

10
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.050
And then execute the following command.

11
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.000
Ng generate service reservation.

12
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.040
This will generate our service class

13
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.050
and a spec unit test.

14
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.030
Now let's move over to IntelliJ.

15
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.060
Let's open up the file reservation.service.ts.

16
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.090
This file contains the service skeleton.

17
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.030
Now let's open up app.component.ts.

18
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.040
Let's migrate the HttpClient from the component

19
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.030
to the service.

20
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.010
Let's select line three, the import for HttpClient,

21
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.030
use command x for cut,

22
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.070
and then past it into the reservation service.

23
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.010
We can use command x for cut from the lines 13 to 16,

24
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.010
including the constructor in the constants

25
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.030
for the reservation rest API URL.

26
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:46.010
And migrate those over to the reservation service.

27
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.080
Now let's update the constructor on the component.

28
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.020
Type in constructor,

29
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.010
private reservation service,

30
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:07.090
colon, reservation service as the type,

31
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.020
and then let's also import it.

32
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.060
Let's type in import,

33
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.060
curly braces,

34
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.090
reservation service,

35
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:27.070
from dot forward slash, reservation service.

36
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.070
Don't forget the dot between reservation and service.

37
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.030
And a semi colon at the end.

38
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.030
Cool that's it.

39
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.010
Now we have the HttpClient,

40
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.020
wired into our ReservationService,

41
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.080
and we could use the ReservationService

42
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.040
in our component to make the http calls we need

43
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.000
to our back end rest API.
