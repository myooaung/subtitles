00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.090
- [Chris] Reactive functional programming can help you

2
00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.040
produce much more stable, responsive, and efficient systems.

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.050
The quickest way to get up and running is to use Angular

4
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.020
and Spring Boot to Bootstrap your applications.

5
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.090
In this course, we'll briefly review

6
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.040
some Spring Reactive concepts such as WebFlux

7
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.070
and Spring Reactive data.

8
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.050
We'll build an application that leverages

9
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.000
this Reactive Spring stack to create a REST API

10
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.050
on the back end.

11
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.020
On the front end, we'll use Angular to build a reactive app

12
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.050
to consumer the REST API and display the results

13
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.070
of various operations.

14
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.050
Hi, I'm Chris Anatalio and I've been

15
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.000
programming professionally for over a decade.

16
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
By the time you're done with this course,

17
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.060
you should have a solid foundation

18
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.030
in building a full-stack Reactive Spring

19
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.050
in Angular application.

20
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.030
Come join me in my LinkedIn Learning course
