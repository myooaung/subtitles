00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.040
- [Instructor] Now let's import our static

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.010
pre-made HTML and CSS files.

3
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.060
These files represent the branding

4
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.000
of the fictional Landon Hotel property

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.090
we are modeling in this course.

6
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.040
First off, download the exercise files

7
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.040
for chapter four, video four.

8
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.050
There should be a zip file labeled Landon Hotel

9
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.050
static files.

10
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.090
Go ahead and extract that zip file by double-clicking on it.

11
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.000
Let's open up the HTML file in whatever

12
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.040
lightweight editor you prefer.

13
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.080
We are going to use Atom in this case.

14
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.020
Let's right-click on home dot HTML,

15
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.070
open with and select Atom.

16
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.050
Let's use command A to select all the text,

17
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.010
then command C to copy.

18
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.040
Let's open up IntelliJ and then navigate

19
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.090
to app dot component dot HTML.

20
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.050
Click into the window, then use command A

21
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.090
to select all, then command V to paste.

22
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.050
Head back to the finder window.

23
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:16.070
And let's open up the Landon dash Hotel dot CSS file.

24
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.080
Command A to select all, command C to copy,

25
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.080
and then back in IntelliJ let's open up

26
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.090
app dot component dot CSS.

27
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.000
Click into the window, command V to paste.

28
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.090
Then you can save your files using command S.

29
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.050
Now, let's head back to the finder window one more time.

30
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.050
Left-click on images, command C to copy.

31
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.010
And then go ahead and navigate to IntelliJ.

32
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:55.020
Left-click on assets and paste in your images.

33
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.010
Now, let's open up a terminal, type in NG serve

34
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.050
and then wait for the application to start up.

35
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:08.040
Open up a browser and head to local host at 4200.

36
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.070
If your application doesn't update

37
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.020
head back to IntelliJ, click on the root directory,

38
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.000
and select synchronize.

39
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.050
Open up a fresh terminal window and then run NG serve.

40
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.070
Open up your browser, right-click on the window,

41
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.040
select inspect, and then right-click

42
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.010
on the refresh button and try empty cache and hard reload.

43
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.020
That should refresh your browser.

44
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:48.060
And now we should see the Landon Hotel webpage.

45
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.090
Okay, looks good.

46
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.050
Let's check it out in a mobile responsive view.

47
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.070
Great, it looks like the page automatically

48
00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.000
adjusts for a mobile viewport.
