00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.030
- Next up, let's build out a put-in point

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.000
to update an existing document in MongoDB.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Let's create a new public method,

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.040
let's return a Mono that admits a String as before.

5
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.090
We can update this later, we'll need build-out

6
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.000
or service implementation.

7
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.050
Let's name it "updatePrice".

8
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.080
Let's go up to our createReservation method

9
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.050
and let's copy the RequestBody.

10
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.030
The update call will accept a JSON request

11
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.050
just like the Create method.

12
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.030
Now let's add a PutMapping annotation.

13
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:51.050
Let's set the path equal to a roomId path variable,

14
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.050
let's surround the string roomId with curly braces,

15
00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.090
and then go up to our Create method,

16
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.090
and let's copy the produces and consumes fields

17
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.070
and copy them into our PutMapping annotation.

18
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.050
This update call will produce a JSON

19
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:22.000
as well as expect a JSON in the request body.

20
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.060
Let's also add a parameter to capture that path variable.

21
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.010
Let's create a string named "roomId",

22
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:40.030
and then add the annotation PathVariable.

23
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:48.080
Finally, let's return an empty JSON string as before.

24
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:55.090
Let's open up the Run window and restart our application.

25
00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.090
Now let's open up Postman, open up a new tab,

26
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:08.030
let's copy the URI into our new tab,

27
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.020
and then add a PathVariable at the end.

28
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:18.020
Let's change the verb to "put"

29
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.030
and then head back to our PostCreate method,

30
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.040
let's copy the body, open the body tab,

31
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:33.040
enter PutUpdateRequest, select "raw", then "JSON".

32
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.030
Then finally, you paste in the JSON request body

33
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.040
from the Create request.

34
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.000
Now let's try to execute.

35
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.080
It looks good.

36
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.000
We got a 200 OK status code and the expected response.
