00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.000
- This course is targeted at intermediate

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.040
and advanced developers.

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.020
You should have some experience with Java and basic Spring.

4
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:14.000
You should also be familiar with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.080
to get the most out of this course.

6
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.040
It'll also be helpful to have some exposure

7
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.060
to functional programming,

8
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.040
Java 8 streams and lambdas, and TypeScript.

9
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.070
TypeScript has the same syntax as JavaScript,

10
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.090
but it enables static type checking and code refactoring.

11
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.010
We'll be using TypeScript with Angular in this course.

12
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.080
If you want to get a primer on reactive programming

13
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.050
with Spring, you could check out my course,

14
