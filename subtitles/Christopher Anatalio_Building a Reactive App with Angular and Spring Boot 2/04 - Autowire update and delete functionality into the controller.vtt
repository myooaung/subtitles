00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.000
- Now let's set up update

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.040
and delete functionality in our controller.

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.020
Let's open up the reservation resource class

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.060
and let's head to line 42

5
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.020
in the update price method.

6
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.070
Let's update the room id field.

7
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.080
Right click, refactor, rename,

8
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.040
rename code occurrences

9
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.020
and let's rename it to just id.

10
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.020
Let's also update the path variable name.

11
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.010
Now let's call the reservation service.

12
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.050
Let's call the update reservation method.

13
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.070
Pass in the id

14
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.030
and the reservation.

15
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.000
Let's go ahead and update the return type.

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.010
The same thing on delete reservation.

17
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.050
Right click, refactor, rename,

18
00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.050
code occurrences.

19
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.060
Change it to id.

20
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:07.040
Then also update the path variable.

21
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.080
Now, let's call reservation service.

22
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.000
Delete reservation and pass in id.

23
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.040
Let's go ahead and save.

24
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.010
Right click on your main application class

25
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.000
and select run.

26
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.080
Okay, after it starts up,

27
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.050
let's head back to the postman client.

28
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.070
Let's go ahead and create a new record.

29
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.080
This time for room 129.

30
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.040
Go ahead and copy that id.

31
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.000
Open up the put update call.

32
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Select the body tab.

33
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.080
Update the path variable to that id

34
00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.030
of the reservation that just got created

35
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.060
and let's update the price to 210 dollars.

36
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.070
Then execute.

37
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.060
Okay, great.

38
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.090
We got back 200

39
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.090
and the price is now 210.

40
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.040
Go ahead and copy that id.

41
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.040
Open up the GET request

42
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.090
and let's do a lookup.

43
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.030
We could see the price is now 210.

44
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.070
Finally, open up the delete request.

45
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.030
Paste in that id as a path variable.

46
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.010
Then send the request.

47
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.050
We are 200 OK

48
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.010
and the delete operation was acknowledged.

49
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.040
Let's try to look up that request by id again.

50
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.000
It looks like it was successfully deleted.
