00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.030
- Okay, now let's display all the current reservations

2
00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.050
that we get from the backend API.

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.090
First up, let's open up IntelliJ.

4
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.040
Open up the file app.components.ts.

5
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.000
Let's modify the create reservation method.

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.060
On line 67, let's add in curly braces.

7
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.050
And let's call get current reservations every time we

8
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.000
create a new one to keep the list updated.

9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.060
Now let's open up add.component.html and on line 39

10
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:45.020
let's add in a new div.

11
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.030
Let's set the class equal to row, and let's add in an

12
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.070
angular directive ngIf.

13
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.040
Let's pass in the value current reservations, so that this

14
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.000
block will only be displayed if we have any

15
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.020
current reservations.

16
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.010
Let's add in an h1 and update the label to be

17
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.090
current reservations.

18
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:21.060
Now let's nest another div and let's use the ngFor

19
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.050
directive to iterate through the list of

20
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.010
current reservations.

21
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.020
Now let's create an unordered list element.

22
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.090
And let's create three list items.

23
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:47.020
First, let's display the room number by calling the room

24
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.030
number field on the current reservation.

25
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.050
Let's go ahead and highlight and copy line 45 to

26
00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:02.000
create a new line item.

27
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.070
Then let's display the price.

28
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:23.050
On the next line, let's share the check-in date.

29
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:29.010
For date formatting, we could use a pipe or other directive.

30
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.030
But for now we're just going to keep it simple and display

31
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:43.010
the month and the day, separated by a dash.

32
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:55.080
Now, let's also display the check-out.

33
00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:01.020
Let's restart our Angular app.

34
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:08.030
Let's see, let's take a look at this error.

35
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.000
Let's fix the name of the method invocation in

36
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.040
create reservation.

37
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.040
Okay, now let's open up a browser, let's refresh and

38
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.000
we can see we have one current reservation.

39
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.090
Let's scroll up and we can see the one current reservation

40
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.010
displayed here.

41
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:41.000
Let's try adding one more.

42
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And we can see it's displayed there.

43
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.040
Let's head back to the html page, and let's add a divider

44
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.080
in between each list.

45
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.030
There we go, that's a bit more readable.

46
00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.000
So now we're displaying each current reservation that

47
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
we have created.
