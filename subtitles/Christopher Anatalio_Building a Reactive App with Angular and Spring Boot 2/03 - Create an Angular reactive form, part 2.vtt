00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.030
- [Instructor] Now let's work on the front end elements,

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:11.050
let's open up app.component.html,

3
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:17.030
let's type in hr for a divider and add in a new h1 header

4
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:25.070
called reserve room, now let's create a form element

5
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.080
let's add in the CSS class form dash horizontal

6
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.080
let's set the formGroup to roomSearchForm

7
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:47.080
that maps to our angular variable.

8
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:56.040
Now let's create a div, set the CSS class to form group.

9
00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:03.060
Let's add in a input label, for the input ID check in,

10
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:11.040
with the class column four and the label value check in.

11
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:20.030
Now let's add another div, let's add the class column eight

12
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.030
then nest a input element in that div.

13
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.050
Let's set the ID equal to check in,

14
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:36.070
the type equal to date which will give us a date picker

15
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:42.090
set the class equal to form dash control

16
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.000
and the formControlName will be equal to check in

17
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
which will map to the FormControl that we defined

18
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.060
in app.component.ts.

19
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:04.010
Now let's copy lines 69 to 75,

20
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.030
and paste them right below for the check in field.

21
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.090
On line 78 let's change check in to check out

22
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.060
let's update the ID of the input field to checkout,

23
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:27.020
and also the formControlName.

24
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.030
Now let's do that one more time.

25
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:35.060
Let's copy lines 77 to 83, copy the form group block

26
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:42.060
right below it, let's change the label to roomNumber.

27
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.010
Let's update the label value to Room Number

28
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:56.030
then let's replace this input block with a select block.

29
00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.040
Let's create a select element,

30
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.060
give it the id roomNumber

31
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:11.090
and the formControlName roomNumber.

32
00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.010
Now we have to populate the options for this select.

33
00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.090
If you go back to app.components.ts we have a collection

34
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.080
that contains all the available rooms.

35
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.020
So let's loop through that room array for each option

36
00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:36.030
in this select, let's use an ngFor directive

37
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.020
for each room in the rooms array.

38
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.010
I'm going to close the project window for readability

39
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:54.030
and then set the value equal to the roomNumber

40
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.070
separated by a pipe then the room price.

41
00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.030
There are a couple different ways to do this,

42
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.000
but this is the most straight forward

43
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.060
for a simple application.

44
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.070
Then let's set the display value of the select option

45
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:16.090
to the roomNumber, let's open up a terminal.

46
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.090
Navigate to the reservation app directory

47
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.080
and run ng serve.

48
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:30.080
Looks like we have a typo in AppComponent.ts

49
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.020
the room search form form group exposes changes

50
00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.080
under valueChanges, we were missing an s.

51
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.090
So let's try again.

52
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.090
We have a mismatch in naming, we named the variable

53
00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.040
roomValues we tried to access roomVals

54
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.040
so let's go ahead and fix that typo.

55
00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.050
Now let's fix one more error.

56
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.080
Let's open up app.component.html

57
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.030
and let's make sure this value property

58
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.040
is surrounded by square brackets.

59
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.040
This will ensure we use the html option element

60
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.040
from lib.dom.ts so that room.roomNumber

61
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.080
and price get interpreted correctly.

62
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.050
Let's open up a terminal and make sure we restarted

63
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.080
and then let's open up our browser, right click, inspect

64
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:42.030
in console and let's try setting our form fields again.

65
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.070
Yeah so it looks like we are capturing the check in,

66
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:53.000
the check out, room number, and price correctly.

67
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.020
We could then pass in these variables

68
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.000
through a call to our back-end service.
