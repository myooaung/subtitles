00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.070
- [Instructor] In preparation for this course,

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.000
we are going to assume that you have some standard

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.020
development tools set up.

4
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.010
Your local macOS machine should have Homebrew and Java.

5
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.010
We are going to be working with Java 12 in the course,

6
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.000
but you could use any version from Java 8 and up.

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.030
You should also have Node.js and npm installed.

8
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.090
It will also be great if you have

9
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.050
the following tools installed: IntelliJ Community Edition.

10
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.090
I recommend using it to follow along,

11
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.000
as I'll call out some handy shortcuts

12
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.010
that will save us a bit of time and typing.

13
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.030
You could use another IDE, but you'll need to manually

14
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.000
type in some of the things

15
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.040
that IntelliJ will do for us automatically.

16
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.000
And finally, you should also have Postman installed.
