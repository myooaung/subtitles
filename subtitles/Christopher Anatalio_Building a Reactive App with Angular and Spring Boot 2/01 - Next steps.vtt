- [Chris] I just want to thank you for watching my course.

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.070
Let's recap.

3
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.080
We built a reactive, full-stack application

4
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.040
using Spring Boot and Angular.

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.080
We modeled our application after the Landon Hotel.

6
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.060
We walked through some high-level flows in our application.

7
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.000
Then we built a reactive Spring REST API

8
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.020
and we also build a Reactive Angular front end app.

9
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.040
If you want to learn more about the topic,

10
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.020
check out my courses Reactive Programming with Java 8

11
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.070
and Reactive Spring in our learning library.

12
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.090
You should now have a solid foundation

13
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.040
for building a reactive application

14
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.080
in Reactive Spring and Angular.

15
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.010
I wish you luck as you continue your learning journey.

16
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.090
Now get out there and start building your own

17
00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.000
reactive application with Spring and Angular.
