00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.210
Hello,

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:01.750
guys.

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:02.970
In the last lesson,

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.580
we learned about the archive dot PHP file.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.470
Now you know that it's used when visitors requests posed by category al for attack or date

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.470
.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:13.610
Oh,

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.050
let's start great in this file,

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.870
even sublime text or in your favorite editor,

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:27.300
we're going to create a new file and call it archive dot PHP off course to speed things up

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.700
a bit.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.340
Let's copy the contents off the index dot PHP.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.940
File taking care to replace the class for the main tiff tag.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.010
Let's include the class cold archive.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.960
But of course,

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.000
that may be whatever name you want,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.510
and here the name of the content file is gonna be content.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.160
Hyphen archive dot PHP.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.730
That's great.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.150
This file inside the corresponding folder.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:01:02.150
And to speed up to that Scott be what's inside the content that PHP file.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:11.420
Let's replace the content function with the excerpt and just to make the view a little

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.100
different from the other views.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.590
Let's remove the category from here and I start off the test.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.480
Then let's open up our thing.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:27.950
Go to the block page and we're gonna click on one of the months that we have here in the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:28.650
sidebar.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.180
As you can see when I click on a specific month,

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.750
we have only news from the mouth correspondent to the one we clicked on.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.850
Well,

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:39.590
that's correct.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.810
But let's make that a little better.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.280
We can create,

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.920
for example,

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.580
a title above the posts.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.090
It'll be showing the name of the month so the visitor will not be lost.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.000
And this will also be used for for Alfa category and tag pages.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.750
It's called a WordPress function here before starting the thief else block.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.470
This time the function is gonna be the archive.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:13.180
Title dysfunction allows us to pass to formatting parameters that are HTML tax within which

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.850
the title text will stay.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.800
The first prime minister is the opening tank.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.520
Let's use an H one heading tag of the archive title class,

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.650
and the second is the closing tack.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.280
I save and see what happens.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.350
Okay,

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.630
Fantastic.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.950
Now we have the name of the mouth,

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.510
and this will greatly help people who are visiting a website that uses the learned WP thing

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.510
.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.420
Our thing.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.050
Another thing we can do is also load the archive description.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.060
This will not work everywhere just in categories and tack pages,

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.750
but it can be off helping some occasions you.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:09.100
So let's call the function down here and its name is the archive description as go to the

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.210
admin area and add a description in one off our categories.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:25.650
And now,

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.370
when we click on one of the links in this category,

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.750
we see that we now have the description as well,

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.520
closing it well,

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.970
I think that's excellent.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:36.860
Now,

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.580
just a complete our example.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.340
Let's see if everything's working.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.080
Also,

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.090
when you click on a Now for link our attack,

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:52.120
about having tea here on the author link and look this template final loaded is archive dot

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.820
PHP.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.550
That's correct and also gather description just above.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:57.400
No,

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.750
a tag sensing,

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.420
that is,

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.380
Everything is working perfectly,

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.650
and I have to agree with me That wasn't so hard.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.200
Great,

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.350
but I have a challenge for you.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.350
How about making your thing even more specialized?

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.580
To do this,

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:21.210
you need to create the three specialized template files that it didn't create in this

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.680
lesson.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.550
Remember,

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.500
those files are optional.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.450
That's why I won't be creating them with you,

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.020
but they can make your theme much more interesting.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.350
It's pretty easy.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.630
All you need is to create a file called Tag Doctor Ph.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.950
B,

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:43.710
another one called category dot PHP and the less file called date dot PHP.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.900
You can complete the contents of the index dot PHP and comes in that speech.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.700
Be as I did in this lesson.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.090
Just be careful to modified names off the TIF tags.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.550
Okay,

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.520
as you do this,

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.530
exercise Jack in the plugging.

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:03.900
If the template name changes a year ago is to make the template file name changes to tag

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.450
that pitch b category dot PHP and days dot PHP.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.750
So I'll see you again in the next lesson.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.050
Happy Colding.
