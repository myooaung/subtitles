00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.260
Hello,

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:01.870
everyone.

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:03.250
And welcome back.

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.760
You're back here for another lesson and for a new section of her course.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.780
And today we're going to start talking about the theme customizer.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.850
One of the most interesting development chose for WordPress themes.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.220
But before we start talking about it,

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.150
I just want to show you a couple of simple modifications I made to the theme.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.610
As you can see on the home page,

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.310
the search farm is a little different as well as the contact form.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.490
There are also other areas of the theme have been modified,

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.050
but nothing too important.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.180
These are only small success changes.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.460
As you know,

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.200
you can find them all in our CSS file.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.990
You see,

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.350
they're all the success for the theme in a very well organized file.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.700
Also,

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:56.420
I decided to change the HTML markup for this middle area here a bit before the sidebar had

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.510
Onley three columns and now it has four columns.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.390
With that,

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.800
the new stiff has been reduced to eight columns,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:13.590
and there's also this heading tag here and here on archive dot PHP and index dot PHP also

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.710
changed the pagination.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.550
Dave Tex Before we have the core MD six classes,

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.620
and now we have only cold six.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.220
That means the students here who always have a live off 50% each,

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.450
regardless of the screen resolution.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.260
Okay,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.650
back to today's subject.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.310
Let's remember that we have some sections on the thing that are not finished yet.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.450
So here on the home page have this area that to be a place for the logo,

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.050
the crop right area.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.760
All this areas are still unchanged and you'll be using the thing customizer to deal with

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.150
them.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.060
It could,

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.610
of course,

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.430
toe all that manually using only html code PHP etcetera.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.910
But the point is that if you do that are feeling we get hard to maintain to make changes to

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:06.400
the code,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.600
the site owner would have to understand about programming.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.560
But of course,

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.220
this is not a reality that we have to take into consideration because not everyone knows

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.250
how to write code.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.050
So our task is to build the whole thing in the most dynamic way possible.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.870
But before you start creating anything,

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.030
I'm gonna show you,

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.600
of course,

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.850
how this WordPress tool works,

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.350
especially for those who still don't know it.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.390
First,

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:44.800
let's go over to the WordPress dashboard appearance menu customize or as the site

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.730
administrator.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.100
You also have the possibility to access the same screen.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.290
Fear the front end.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:59.190
My clicking on this I can hear this tool is very versatile and allows us to make changes to

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.660
the thing.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:00.580
Bio viewing.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.350
These changes owned the right side of the screen,

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.400
So this is the great potential we have when they use it.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.310
Well,

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.950
let's explain how it works in more detail.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.530
Here on the right side,

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.950
we have this big rectangular area where we can see the actual theme.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.650
This area is highly dynamic.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.850
So,

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:20.650
for example,

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.550
if I click on this link actually can go to a new page.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:31.800
And on the left side we have several controls that are used to modify specific areas of the

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.290
theme.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.470
Now let's give names to those things.

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.850
The controls you see on the left are called sections.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:40.820
Here we have,

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:41.720
for example,

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.490
the site identity section,

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.110
the color section,

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.010
the header image section that is a no,

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.630
the acquaintance of us from previous lessons.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:51.250
Remember,

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.150
within each section we have the controls.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.320
For example,

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.050
if you click here on site identity,

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.290
we have all the controls that relate to the sites.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:08.930
Identity suggests the title prescription and other fuels to these controls can be of

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:09.980
different types.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.690
They can be taxed feuds,

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:12.620
check boxes,

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:13.950
upload buttons,

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.110
color pickers.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.200
There are many possibilities.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.870
And with each version,

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.210
the WordPress team brings more items to the customizer,

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.900
not to mention some custom libraries that fuze that are not yet in the native version of

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:28.580
WordPress.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:35.280
Another thing we can do here is also to change the thing that we're viewing dis click here

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.560
and choose another thing to customize it.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.020
I'm gonna choose,

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.780
for example,

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.200
the 2017 theme.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:48.920
This thing also futures of fuel sections and I could also make modifications and already

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.350
see the modifications reflected on the right side of the tool.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.450
So that's sweet things again.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.310
Well,

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.430
another very interesting thing in the studio is the possibility to see how our layout will

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.950
be presented in several different devices.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.840
So here on the right side,

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.250
I'm feeling the themes desktop version.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.490
If I click owned this button here,

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.560
I can see how the site is on a tablet like device,

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.380
and if I click on this other button here,

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.600
we can see how the theme behaves on a smartphone.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.440
As you can see if the changes we made in previous lessons are,

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.270
fame is totally responsive.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.950
We even see the response of menu here at the top of the thing.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.130
Well,

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.620
that's it.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.560
Basically,

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.850
it's what the GATT within the customizer.

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.670
This is a very powerful tool not only for you the thing developer,

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:46.390
but also for your clients.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:52.870
It allows us to make custom is ations in a very practical and fast way and without the need

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.390
for the end user to know how to write code.

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:01.550
So what I want you to understand in this lesson is basically how this show is made up.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.550
So remember the follow me.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.850
These left side structures here are called sections,

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:15.180
and it's section can contain many controls which can be of various types from simple tax

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.740
boxes to check boxes,

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:17.980
upload buttons,

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:18.550
etcetera.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:19.670
Okay,

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.490
so in the next lesson,

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:26.750
we're gonna start writing some code for the customizer and you then heavy coding
