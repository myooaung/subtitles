00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.480
Hello.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.570
How's it going?

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:08.070
Picking up where we left off in the last lesson Today we're going to include pagination on

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.750
the search results page.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:10.470
Well,

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:16.430
this time we're going to view the numeric pagination Those who didn't like the pagination

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:22.340
we created in the last lesson You surely like this new one because it's much easier to

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.150
create and you understand To begin this,

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.420
let's open up the search dot PHP file which is the template fire for this plane Search

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.430
results and again it once you create the pagination as soon as the loop completes.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.500
But this time we don't need to break the PHP attacks because the code we're going to right

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.710
here is pure PHP.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:45.350
Okay,

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.150
The function that does all the magic for us is called the post pagination.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.580
Pay close attention to the names of this functions.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.890
In this case,

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.500
the correct is the posts,

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.100
not the post.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.950
Okay,

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.370
inside it.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.570
Let's open a nuri.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.830
This function has its own set of arguments.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.150
So let's go ahead and add them here.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.390
If you look for the function in the world breast Codex,

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.920
we'll see that we have four possible arguments for you.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:28.550
We're going to be used on Li Chu for now at other following pref text and next next.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.790
The logic is not inverted here.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.210
Okay for the breath tax argument,

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.000
Let's typing attacks that we want should be displayed and that can leaders to the previous

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.550
page.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:50.410
So let's type in here previous and for next next less typing next the only this we already

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.650
have a very functional pagination.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.090
Let's save.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:06.750
And now let's search again for the letter A and there it is awesome!

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.500
Finally,

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.950
we can browse through our search results.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.940
As you can see here we have this text but it can change it using one off the arguments of

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:18.720
this function.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.290
This off course will be an exercise for you guys.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.280
If you visit the link for the WordPress Codex,

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.510
the one that we visit in this lesson,

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.500
you'll know exactly which arguments use.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.910
Just be sure to add another comma after the last element of the array recreated otherwise,

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.990
you certain stumble upon an error.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.450
Okay,

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.110
well,

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.650
our bonus for this lesson.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.990
I want to teach you how to implement a post navigation that is a sort of pagination

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.450
somewhere.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.750
Press things display with being posts But you guess you have an idea of what I'm talking

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:55.190
about.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.980
Let's take this website here as an example,

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.150
I am inside the post.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:07.210
And if I scroll down to the bottom of the page I have year link that points to the previous

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.530
post and another link that points to the next post.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.750
How can he do that?

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.130
In fact,

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.290
it's very easy to begin with.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.750
Let's open up the single that PHP file.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.450
We have it open here.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.350
This time we're gonna add this pagination inside the loop,

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.960
not outside loop,

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.480
as we did in the two previous cases.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.750
We want this link to be positioning before the comments form.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.460
So let's open any post and I want you explain again what we're going to do.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.590
Take a close look.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.550
The links with state right here in this space here before the Commons form.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.990
Okay,

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.890
so here in the file,

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.550
let's close the beach be here,

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.290
reopen it.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.160
And here we're going to create the HTML structure for the links.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.270
First,

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.570
we need a new row and here you're going to have to gifts.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.550
The 1st 1 we received the pages glass.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.850
This is a name I chose to use.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:14.250
Okay.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.420
It's not any specific class that is.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.600
You can use whatever name you want.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.690
Now you're going to have a bootstrap class.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.240
And since this first link will float you left.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.290
You were using the text left.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.320
Bootstrap class.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.650
Let's copy this here.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:42.750
And we're gonna change here to text right and change the text to.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.280
Now,

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.750
let's see what we have for now.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.750
Okay?

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.050
It's this plane correctly.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.350
Now we need to know what WordPress functions we need here to generate each link.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.210
The logic is pretty much the same as the one we apply.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.050
It owned the block page.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.910
So for the last link,

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.510
we used the next post link function.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.270
And for the right link,

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.950
we're gonna use previews,

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.250
boasts link function,

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.100
pay close attention to this detail.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.550
The word boast in this functions is in the singular.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.280
So whenever you're creating post navigation links,

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.700
remember that the function is in the singular.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:28.150
Okay,

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.650
By doing this,

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.580
we already have a great result.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.560
Look at us now.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.620
We can navigate between posts.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:39.650
Excellent.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:46.220
One thing I usually do is change the direction off this arrows here for this,

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.260
I can use the first parameter of the stew functions.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.650
It allows us to firm at the link any way we want.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:53.820
For example,

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.820
here in the next post link,

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.450
I'm gonna pass the string with this value here.

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:01.870
That is a narrow point into the left,

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.550
followed by the link.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.280
And for the previous post link.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:13.590
I passed another string that is first the link and then an arrow pointing to the right side

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.590
.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:19.930
It's much better now,

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.150
more intuitive than you think,

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.950
then that's it.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:26.240
I hope you enjoy this lesson.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.820
See you next time.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:32.050
