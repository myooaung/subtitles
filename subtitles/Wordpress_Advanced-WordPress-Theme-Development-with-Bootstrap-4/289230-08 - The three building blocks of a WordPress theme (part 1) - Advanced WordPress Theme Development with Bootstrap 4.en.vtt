00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.345
Hello guys, welcome to on more lesson.

00:00:03.345 --> 00:00:08.025
In this lesson we'll start talking about the basic building blocks of a WordPress theme.

00:00:08.025 --> 00:00:09.465
In the next few lessons,

00:00:09.465 --> 00:00:13.470
we'll see that we need only three blocks to build a theme,

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.815
a header, a dynamic content area, and a footer.

00:00:16.815 --> 00:00:21.735
This dynamic area at first will be represented by the index.html file.

00:00:21.735 --> 00:00:26.505
But as remember, this fiery is used as a default theme template.

00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:30.660
We also have different template files used for static pages,

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.415
for viewing posts, etc..

00:00:32.415 --> 00:00:35.700
But let's focus first on the index.html file.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.755
Okay? So first, let's open up our layout.

00:00:39.755 --> 00:00:45.515
You may notice that it has this region here that is going to be the same for all pages,

00:00:45.515 --> 00:00:49.580
which extends from this red bar here to the end of the menu.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:55.610
It also has a dynamic content region that goes from the slide to this map.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.365
And then there is a footer that is going to be displayed on all pages.

00:01:00.365 --> 00:01:05.000
This dynamic region at the beginning will becoming from the index.html file.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.745
But when we click on a post link, for example,

00:01:07.745 --> 00:01:11.915
we will make arrangements for WordPress to use a different template file.

00:01:11.915 --> 00:01:13.745
But first things first,

00:01:13.745 --> 00:01:16.790
in the last lesson we created the index.js file,

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.695
but it's still quite minimal.

00:01:18.695 --> 00:01:21.560
It has only one paragraph and a title tag.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.725
Only there are, if you can remember from another lesson,

00:01:24.725 --> 00:01:28.205
I told you that our homepage is very different from

00:01:28.205 --> 00:01:32.270
a contact page and about us page, a services page.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.485
And so that's why we're going to make this layout more dynamic.

00:01:36.485 --> 00:01:37.955
In order for this to work,

00:01:37.955 --> 00:01:40.535
let's split this layout into treat parts.

00:01:40.535 --> 00:01:43.775
To begin with, let's create our basic HTML.

00:01:43.775 --> 00:01:48.065
And it will be all based on this layout very seen here.

00:01:48.065 --> 00:01:50.495
Let's head over to Sublime Text.

00:01:50.495 --> 00:01:52.940
Open up index.html.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.900
And I'm going to leave this paragraph here just as a reference for us.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:57.560
Okay.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.575
Well, let's start off with the body tag.

00:02:00.575 --> 00:02:02.915
Fortunately, WordPress gives us

00:02:02.915 --> 00:02:06.575
a very useful function that can be used inside the body tag.

00:02:06.575 --> 00:02:11.540
It helps us identify which page the theme is displaying at a given moment.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.990
So we can use this function to better style everything.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.325
And this function is called body underscore class.

00:02:19.325 --> 00:02:23.705
It basically returns the classes related to the page we're viewing.

00:02:23.705 --> 00:02:26.419
For example, when we visit the homepage,

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:29.825
it prints out a home class inside the body tag.

00:02:29.825 --> 00:02:34.760
Thus, we can style a page that has the whole class in a different way.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.735
But don't worry because you understand this better as we move along the course,

00:02:38.735 --> 00:02:41.555
ok, we see this in detail.

00:02:41.555 --> 00:02:46.010
For now, let's start by creating the HTML for the site header.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.070
Inside the header, according to our layout,

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.620
we have a red bar at the top.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.860
So first we create a header tag.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.915
And inside that tag,

00:02:56.915 --> 00:03:01.580
we want to create a section that will have the top hyphen bar class.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.710
Just type in Section a dot for the CSS class.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.970
Top hyphen bar and press the Tab key.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.335
Inside this top bar,

00:03:12.335 --> 00:03:14.015
we have two other areas.

00:03:14.015 --> 00:03:18.995
In the first one on the left side reserved for the social media icons.

00:03:18.995 --> 00:03:23.615
And another one on the right side that will be named search.

00:03:23.615 --> 00:03:25.490
Can you see what I'm doing here?

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:26.765
Let me explain to you.

00:03:26.765 --> 00:03:31.760
I'm just translating that red bar from the layout into HTML content.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.090
I'm just calling it top hyphened bar in the HTML.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.335
So inside it, I created a structure for these two other areas.

00:03:39.335 --> 00:03:42.485
On the left side, an area for the social media icons,

00:03:42.485 --> 00:03:45.050
and on the right side is search area.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.940
As you can see, you're creating for now only the basic markup of the thing.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.175
And this will do for starters.

00:03:52.175 --> 00:03:53.360
Let's move on.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.640
Let's go ahead and create the menu area,

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.320
still within the header area.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.350
Let's call it menu hyphen area.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.240
And within this menu,

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.635
we'll have another section,

00:04:06.635 --> 00:04:08.225
let's call it logo,

00:04:08.225 --> 00:04:13.685
because we'll be placing our logo there and we want a nav tag.

00:04:13.685 --> 00:04:18.140
This class will be called main hyphen menu.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.275
And we'll be adding our first menu there.

00:04:21.275 --> 00:04:23.495
And I solve for the hair.

00:04:23.495 --> 00:04:25.565
This whole area be creating now,

00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:27.680
we repeat on every single page.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.325
Okay, so let's go ahead and create our dynamic area Now.

00:04:31.325 --> 00:04:35.160
Lets call it content hyphen area.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.260
So inside this one will have many other areas.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.775
According to the layout,

00:04:43.775 --> 00:04:45.140
we will have here.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.620
Our main area, which will stay inside the main tag.

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.960
Inside this tag will have a section for the slide.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.150
And the load is slide will have a red area for the services.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.840
And after the services will have a central area,

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.200
let's call it middle hyphen area.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.265
Inside this middle area, we have a sidebar in the news area.

00:05:13.265 --> 00:05:15.380
Then here in the HTML,

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.860
the sidebar will be inside an aside tag.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.935
And you have the class of Sidebar.

00:05:21.935 --> 00:05:26.270
And after that we'll have a new div tag called news.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.985
And we'll have a less section for the map.

00:05:28.985 --> 00:05:31.850
Let's type in here, section,

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.900
class met, and hit the tab key.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.009
Now both the main area and the dynamic area are complete.

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:41.840
And now we can create our footer,

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.180
which finally closes and the thing.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.900
So let's use the footer tag to mark this region.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.745
Okay, we have then the index that PHP file finally ready.

00:05:52.745 --> 00:05:58.325
But again, I must tell you that if we only have the index.html file created that way,

00:05:58.325 --> 00:06:00.620
our theme will be pretty simple.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.285
So let's do different.

00:06:02.285 --> 00:06:06.155
My idea is to break this index.html into three blocks.

00:06:06.155 --> 00:06:10.250
The first one will contain an area that will be always dynamic.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.805
I mean, its content will change depending on the page visited.

00:06:13.805 --> 00:06:15.890
For example, on a homepage,

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:20.435
this area will look identical to the image you are seeing now.

00:06:20.435 --> 00:06:22.850
However, on a blog page, for example,

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.815
it will not display this slide,

00:06:24.815 --> 00:06:28.625
this service area, the map and other areas.

00:06:28.625 --> 00:06:33.440
On the other hand, the other two areas from here up and from

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.795
the footer down will always repeat for every single page, right?

00:06:38.795 --> 00:06:41.570
This will be R, three building blocks.

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.245
So in the next lesson we're going to continue with the explanation, right?

00:06:45.245 --> 00:06:49.470
So until then, and I catch you guys in my next video.
