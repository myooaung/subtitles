00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.830
hail Marcello here again.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.040
In this lesson,

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.540
we're gonna learn about a very important function which will accompany you all the time

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.950
during your career as a WordPress developer.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:19.530
And the name of it is get template part function as get straight to the point and open up

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.250
our index dot PHP file.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.740
Well,

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.480
anyone who has at least basic knowledge of PHP knows that we use a command called require

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.960
in other chin clued files within another file in WordPress for have something similar,

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.950
which is the GATT staying plate part function.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.620
It works much like PHP required,

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.760
including template parts inside another template file to exemplify how this function works

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.760
.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.060
I'm gonna cut out this HTML article,

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.200
which repeats itself inside the loop and basis contents.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.750
Inside another file.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.680
Let's create a folder inside the things folder called Template Hyphen parts.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.310
Here,

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:11.650
let's create a file called content dot PHP and inside it less based in the court we cut

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:12.350
before.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:20.220
Let's go back to index dot PHP right now.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.820
If I write something here in place of that article that content we repeat according to the

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.840
number of times Ula prints,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.930
For example,

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:37.960
let's add a paragraph here and noticed that this paragraph we repeat here a few times every

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.570
single reputation corresponds to the number of both found on the database brought to us by

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.200
the WordPress.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.550
Look,

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.040
now,

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.610
if I want to bring the counter that it's now inside the new counter dot PHP file when it

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.500
you used to get staying plate part function.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.130
This is a very useful function.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.730
Well,

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.260
often use it when you develop your word breath teams.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.680
So let's call it here instead off the paragraph.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.500
Well,

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.970
first,

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:08.950
how does he work?

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.900
This function has two parameters.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.600
The 1st 1 is always required.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.090
And the word breast Codex has a somewhat complicated explanation for this function,

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.950
but I will try to make it simple.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.000
The first parameter we pass is the file name you want to call,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.450
leave out the PH B extension.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.840
In our case,

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.460
this will be template hyphen parts for slash content.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:42.200
Since our country that PHP file is inside the template parts folder that's supposed that,

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.650
it's not inside any folder.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.920
Then we will just have the word content.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:47.550
Okay,

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.170
The second parameter is optional.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.150
We won't use it now,

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.780
but it will be very useful in the next lesson.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.170
When you talk about both firm,

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.350
it's Let's save that.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.550
And now let's go back to our thing.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.480
Look,

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.820
now the content of the theme is again complete.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.460
But then my asked me,

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.360
But why do I have to use that?

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.350
I didn't see any difference.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.440
The thing didn't get any faster.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.000
Anyway,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.050
it seems that nothing happened.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.860
Marcello.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:23.540
Really?

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.050
Apparently nothing happened.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.990
But we made way to use every all very important programming concepts here.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.950
First,

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.440
do not repeat yourself.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.050
That is,

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.730
don't create lines and more lines of code when you can write much less and get the same

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.670
result also by doing what idiot?

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.690
Here we will have a cleaner coat one that you will be easier to understand by other

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:48.440
developers,

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.240
which is recommended in any word pressing.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:57.950
We changed several lines with HTML content and moved to another location living the cold

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.890
charter easier to be read.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.290
Well,

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.950
it just scratched the surface off this new function.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.650
In the next lesson,

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.310
we'll come back and we're gonna show uneven,

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.130
more practical use for it.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.810
So see you later
