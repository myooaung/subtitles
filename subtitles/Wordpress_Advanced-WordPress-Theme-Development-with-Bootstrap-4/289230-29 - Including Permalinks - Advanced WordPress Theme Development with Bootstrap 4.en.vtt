00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.175
Hello guys.

00:00:02.175 --> 00:00:05.340
Welcome to a new section of our course.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.555
We're going to start by correcting the problem we have in our thing.

00:00:09.555 --> 00:00:13.020
If you hover over a post title or an image,

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.690
you'll see that none of them has a link.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.750
So here on the homepage, for example,

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.360
if you tried to click on any post a message or

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.705
any title will not be able to get anywhere.

00:00:24.705 --> 00:00:27.480
It's very sad. In today's lesson,

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.480
we're going to solve this problem once and for all.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.740
But before I go on with this lecture,

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:38.090
certainly notice that each of the titles in the new section has changed a bit.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.610
You can have access to all of the changes,

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.530
of course, in this CSS file,

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.660
the theme which is available for download,

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.960
just copy the code snippet corresponding to the section on right.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.540
Now back to the subject of today's lesson.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.175
Okay, first, we gotta figure out where we need to make the changes.

00:00:55.175 --> 00:00:58.820
Let's open up the Page home dot PHP file.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.420
And here in the file in our CIO loops,

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.735
as you remember, Jew files have been required.

00:01:05.735 --> 00:01:10.685
And it's within these files that we can find the pose contents.

00:01:10.685 --> 00:01:14.645
Let's start with the content Future dot PHP file.

00:01:14.645 --> 00:01:18.740
Well, in this file I have a div tag for the thumbnail

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.730
and also an H2 tag where the post title comes from.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.370
This is where we had to change.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.785
Well, to create a link,

00:01:27.785 --> 00:01:29.990
we're going to use an anchor tag.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.770
Let's create it here within this div tag.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.130
Let's go ahead and cut out all the content from

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.485
the feature image and paste that here inside the anchor tag.

00:01:42.485 --> 00:01:46.100
Now here's the secret inside the HREF attribute.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.700
Let's pass a WordPress function called the permalink.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.730
Permanent in WordPress and nothing more than URLs

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.035
in which a resource or article will be permanently saved.

00:02:00.035 --> 00:02:01.415
To put it simple,

00:02:01.415 --> 00:02:05.945
permanent are all the links for posts, pages, et cetera.

00:02:05.945 --> 00:02:09.930
Let's do the same thing now for the H2 tag.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.840
Another thing we can do here is placed this H2 tag below

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.425
the featured image so that the thing can be as similar as possible to the initial layout.

00:02:27.425 --> 00:02:30.540
Okay, now we can say,

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.925
now, as you can see,

00:02:37.925 --> 00:02:40.115
we have the featured news link,

00:02:40.115 --> 00:02:44.300
both here in the picture and here in the title.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.035
I can do the same thing now for the secondary row.

00:02:48.035 --> 00:02:53.810
To do this, open up the content secondary dot PHP file.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.330
As the content will be the same.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.410
It can copy the changes we made in the other file and paste in here.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.520
Let's say if now.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.110
And now, we also have the links for the secondary news items.

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.165
See, if you click here,

00:03:17.165 --> 00:03:19.760
you can already get somewhere.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.090
Now we can do the same thing for the posts that are being called on the blog page.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.280
If you visit that page,

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.985
C, We don't have links here either.

00:03:31.985 --> 00:03:34.040
For known of the items.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.595
These posts here are being called by that loop that we have inside the index.html file.

00:03:40.595 --> 00:03:42.455
And in this loop,

00:03:42.455 --> 00:03:45.710
as you remember, at least I hope you remember,

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.860
we are requiring three content files,

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.800
which are these three here,

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.515
as open one by one.

00:03:54.515 --> 00:03:59.195
But its time is going to be easier because we already know what to do.

00:03:59.195 --> 00:04:05.075
So let's go ahead and copy only the modified H2 tag of this file here.

00:04:05.075 --> 00:04:09.330
And I spaced in niche of the files.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.050
Let's do the same for the thumbnails.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.390
Okay, everything's saved.

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.300
Let's see how the blog page looks like.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.845
Okay, everything's fine.

00:04:48.845 --> 00:04:53.405
Now look again the links in all the posts.

00:04:53.405 --> 00:04:54.980
Very good.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.405
In the next lesson,

00:04:56.405 --> 00:04:57.830
we will continue on.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.840
Now that we got links.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.205
We will learn how to create the single view WordPress template file.

00:05:04.205 --> 00:05:06.720
So see you then.
