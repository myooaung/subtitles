00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.150
So hello again and welcome back.

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.990
In the last lesson, we started creating our style.css file.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.195
In today's lesson, we'll go ahead and activate our first theme in the Word Press admin.

00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:17.460
I speak in. Let's go ahead and continue editing the style.css file.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.150
This time, we'll type in here the themes version.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.115
So version, our version will be 1 for now,

00:00:26.115 --> 00:00:29.025
since this is the first version of the thing,

00:00:29.025 --> 00:00:31.935
and the next item is called tags.

00:00:31.935 --> 00:00:34.275
But before we add it to the list,

00:00:34.275 --> 00:00:36.675
let's understand what therefore,

00:00:36.675 --> 00:00:38.934
as open up our browser.

00:00:38.934 --> 00:00:41.870
And let's visit the WordPress theme directory.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:49.140
The adresses wordpress dot ORG, WHO slash things.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.555
And here we have a collection of many free WordPress themes.

00:00:56.555 --> 00:01:01.430
If we click on More Info for any of the things available here,

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.760
you'll see that they all have this screenshot.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.345
The themes version, the update information,

00:01:08.345 --> 00:01:12.810
the themes URL, and the description as well.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.535
Right below we get a list of tags.

00:01:16.535 --> 00:01:20.825
Basically, this tags act as search facilitators.

00:01:20.825 --> 00:01:24.980
Anyone looking for a theme with certain characteristics can find

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.015
it easier since they are identified by these tags.

00:01:29.015 --> 00:01:33.005
For example, let's make believe you want to download a theme

00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:37.400
that has a left sidebar or features a custom logo,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.980
or is a theme for education websites,

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.285
or has a plug,

00:01:41.285 --> 00:01:42.919
or has two columns.

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:45.380
Anyway, that's what they're for.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.840
And we can do that for our theme as well.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.184
If you want to submit your theme to any marketplace,

00:01:51.184 --> 00:01:53.045
the tags are required.

00:01:53.045 --> 00:01:56.090
But even when we don't have plans to sell your theme,

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.415
it's a good idea to add tags,

00:01:58.415 --> 00:02:00.365
and it's so easy to add them.

00:02:00.365 --> 00:02:02.989
So let's go back to the editor.

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:05.809
You type in here tags,

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:08.195
and we start adding our texts,

00:02:08.195 --> 00:02:10.010
but not so fast.

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.425
There are some rules to follow here.

00:02:12.425 --> 00:02:16.249
If this is a theme you are submitting to the WordPress repository,

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:20.060
you should follow the list of tags available on the site will be visiting.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.395
Now, by the way,

00:02:24.395 --> 00:02:27.500
I'll make this link available as an extra resource for this lesson.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.635
Okay? And you can see if we scroll down a bit,

00:02:30.635 --> 00:02:33.680
that we have a list of tags thin can use and

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.655
the requirements it needs to fulfill to be allowed to use that tech.

00:02:37.655 --> 00:02:40.895
So it's not enough just to have a list of tags.

00:02:40.895 --> 00:02:45.260
For example, if your theme has attack called full width template,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.435
it must be in this format.

00:02:47.435 --> 00:02:50.585
I mean, it really must have a full-width template

00:02:50.585 --> 00:02:54.515
is not enough to just create a list of sex out of nothing.

00:02:54.515 --> 00:02:57.365
So let's go back once again to the editor

00:02:57.365 --> 00:03:01.310
and include our list of tags here according to our theme.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:09.124
So Chou, columns, left sidebar,

00:03:09.124 --> 00:03:13.025
custom header,

00:03:13.025 --> 00:03:20.945
custom menu, Custom Logo, plug.

00:03:20.945 --> 00:03:24.275
If we save this file and go back to the admin,

00:03:24.275 --> 00:03:28.560
you'll see that this information becomes available.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.500
As you can see, our tags are all here now.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.695
And also the version that we just test.

00:03:36.695 --> 00:03:40.100
So this is the easiest way to create a theme in WordPress.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.230
Looks at, is it didn't hurt at all.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.460
And we have our first theme created within the WordPress Academy.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.695
It's not that GU. Great.

00:03:48.695 --> 00:03:50.840
So we have our theme Ready.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.270
Now we can go ahead and activate it and preview it on the homepage themes for them.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:03.080
But if we visit the homepage now to be completely empty and the answer is quite simple.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.800
It's because our index.js,

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.965
which of course is aimed T2.

00:04:06.965 --> 00:04:10.010
Or maybe it's because the fire is not working.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.260
Okay, we cannot be in doubt.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.255
So let's do a little testing our index.html page to see if it's really working.

00:04:17.255 --> 00:04:22.080
Let's go ahead and create a basic HTML structure within this file.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.660
So a lot of you ask me, how can I do that?

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.210
I just typed this exclamation mark,

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.725
hit the tab key and it's spitting this whole HTML5 code.

00:04:33.725 --> 00:04:35.525
How do I do that?

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:38.195
Right within our Sublime Text editor,

00:04:38.195 --> 00:04:43.295
a fairly easy way to create the structure is to use an extension called image

00:04:43.295 --> 00:04:45.410
make available to you the link of

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.520
a very interesting tutorial that teaches how to install m it,

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.965
if you are using sublime text of force,

00:04:51.965 --> 00:04:56.465
extension image greatly streamlines the life of the web developer,

00:04:56.465 --> 00:04:58.880
making it easier to write comments.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.940
In our case, let's just type an exclamation point

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.015
or exclamation mark and hit the tab key.

00:05:05.015 --> 00:05:06.360
Very, very easy.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.475
See the magic.

00:05:07.475 --> 00:05:10.175
The software outer completes and prints out

00:05:10.175 --> 00:05:14.300
the complete HTML5 structure on the screen for us,

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.740
you'll be seen me using image shortcuts all the time along this course.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.330
And you can learn more about the shortcuts in the video tutorial available in

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:29.700
the extra resources or visit the address on your screen for a complete charge catalyst.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.279
Alright, so I'm gonna change to information.

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:39.630
I'll be adding just a title to the page and also a new paragraph.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.940
I'm gonna save that and go back to the homepage.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.730
Now you notice that the browser is already

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.015
showing that page title included in the PHP file.

00:05:56.015 --> 00:05:59.375
The contents of the paragraph is also showing here.

00:05:59.375 --> 00:06:05.975
And that confirms that our file index.html is really working and our theme as well.

00:06:05.975 --> 00:06:09.590
So we already have our first WordPress theme available

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.925
within the admin activated and easily identifiable.

00:06:13.925 --> 00:06:17.210
We also have a working index.html file.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.070
Alright, so we then created our first WordPress theme,

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.290
but of course we will not stop here.

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:29.810
In the next lesson, we will learn how to make the index.html file much more versatile.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.735
So I'll be waiting for you in the next lesson.

00:06:32.735 --> 00:06:34.410
Until then.
