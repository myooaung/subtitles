00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.890
Hey, what's up?

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.425
Today, we're going to start learning how to create our first menu in WordPress.

00:00:07.425 --> 00:00:09.630
At the end of the next two lessons,

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.130
you have a horizontal menu similar to this one in the layout.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.160
I ready, so let's get started.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.400
Well, so far we have no menu created.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.495
So if you head over to the Dashboard Appearance menu,

00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:29.335
you'll notice that we don't have any way to create a menu yet.

00:00:29.335 --> 00:00:32.060
In order to manage our own menus,

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.360
you have to do something in the functions that PHP file.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.595
This file, you'll help us register our menus so that we can use them in our theme.

00:00:40.595 --> 00:00:42.319
Before creating a menu,

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:45.515
let's create some static pages within WordPress.

00:00:45.515 --> 00:00:50.060
As this is the first time we will be creating a page or a post in the course.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.655
Let me just clarify one thing.

00:00:52.655 --> 00:00:56.285
This course has been created with WordPress Version four.

00:00:56.285 --> 00:00:58.745
Currently WordPress is reading version

00:00:58.745 --> 00:01:03.305
five between the last updates or version four and version five.

00:01:03.305 --> 00:01:07.115
And new editor emerged in WordPress called Gutenberg.

00:01:07.115 --> 00:01:09.574
It's a new content creation experience,

00:01:09.574 --> 00:01:11.910
literal like that of a page builder.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.220
However, the existence of a new editor changes

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.595
very little the way you create themes in WordPress.

00:01:18.595 --> 00:01:23.470
That is, everything I teach you here in this course remains 100% valid.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:24.250
Okay?

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.755
The only thing you notice is that my page and post editing screens are little different.

00:01:29.755 --> 00:01:33.850
If you've never worked with WordPress prior to version five,

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.925
you'll notice that my editor is a little different.

00:01:36.925 --> 00:01:39.835
It's called the classic editor.

00:01:39.835 --> 00:01:42.895
All the tools I use inside the old editor,

00:01:42.895 --> 00:01:46.480
the classic editor also exist in the new editor, okay?

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.925
And we just have a little more work to find them.

00:01:48.925 --> 00:01:50.875
If you have any difficulties,

00:01:50.875 --> 00:01:54.255
you can contact me and I will be glad to help you out.

00:01:54.255 --> 00:01:56.480
But from what I've noticed so far,

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.425
very few students are having trouble finding the tools.

00:02:00.425 --> 00:02:03.695
Just a warning for those who didn't like the new editor.

00:02:03.695 --> 00:02:06.245
At the moment, I'm recording this video.

00:02:06.245 --> 00:02:10.250
Wordpress is announcing that a2 support the classic editor and

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.450
Qd 20-20 to or as long as it's necessary.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.485
So you'd better get used to using the new editor.

00:02:18.485 --> 00:02:19.865
They couldn't bury editor.

00:02:19.865 --> 00:02:21.260
At the end of this course,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.085
you'll see that I have prepared seven lessons about new editor.

00:02:25.085 --> 00:02:29.210
There are also explain how to get your fin ready to work with it.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.310
So I think you'll love it.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.250
But for now, let's get on with the lesson.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.510
Let's head over to pages, add new.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.450
Let's create some pages then.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.285
The first one is going to be the homepage.

00:02:44.285 --> 00:02:48.514
For other pages, I'm going to just write a minimal description.

00:02:48.514 --> 00:02:53.700
So this is the home page.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:04.470
Now the blog page About Us Contact.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.730
Now we can start registering our menu.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.955
But what do I mean by registering a menu?

00:03:13.955 --> 00:03:16.700
Well, it means nothing more than logically

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.090
creating it within WordPress so we can use it later.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.870
The first thing we're gonna do is use a Wordpress function called register nav menus.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.970
Like every function call,

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.430
it has this parenthesis that opens and closes and a semicolon at the end.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.240
This function allows us to define an array which in

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.320
a singular definition is only a list of elements.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:48.995
We are going to use an array because we can register more than one menu at a time.

00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:52.070
This is even an exercise you can do yourself.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.730
Do you remember that we have too many use in our layout,

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.270
one at the top of the page and another one at the bottom.

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.465
So I'm going to register one of these menus and

00:04:02.465 --> 00:04:06.170
slicing and your exercise will be registered a second menu.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.660
Okay, why do you think about this exercise?

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.760
It's a very simple exercise.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.300
Ok.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.530
I know some students think it's weird that I proposed exercises like this.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.850
I've seen a few students complaining about this in the course reviews,

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.965
but there's no big deal about it.

00:04:21.965 --> 00:04:24.410
It is just one more opportunity to learn.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.725
You get the answer in the first video lesson about WordPress loop,

00:04:27.725 --> 00:04:29.615
I mean, two lessons.

00:04:29.615 --> 00:04:31.610
So let's go back to the chain of thoughts.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.155
So we've been working with

00:04:33.155 --> 00:04:37.310
the first element inside this array is going to be the menus slug,

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.860
that is to say a short name for it.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:48.125
I'm gonna create a slug called my underscore main underscore menu.

00:04:48.125 --> 00:04:52.910
Don't forget you write this value with lowercase letters and no spaces.

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.780
You can use dashes and underscores as I did myself.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.050
The value of this element of the array will be

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.305
the name that will show within the admin area.

00:05:03.305 --> 00:05:05.705
That is a more friendly name.

00:05:05.705 --> 00:05:09.215
In our case, it will be Main menu.

00:05:09.215 --> 00:05:14.930
Don't worry, because soon even understand where this value is shown K. Ok,

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.805
now an important information.

00:05:16.805 --> 00:05:18.710
If I add a comma here,

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.020
I can register a second menu.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.540
In fact, I can register multiple menus within the single function.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.690
I can add a new slug and a new venue.

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.995
Each menu corresponds to what Wordpress caused a position.

00:05:33.995 --> 00:05:38.450
So I will have a second register menu position here,

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.400
but I will not do that now.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.640
This will be a little exercise for you guys.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.925
So I'll go ahead and delete this for now.

00:05:46.925 --> 00:05:53.795
And now when I save this file and get back to the dashboard, reloading the page.

00:05:53.795 --> 00:05:56.660
If I hover over to Appearance menu,

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.530
you see that the menu's option is now available.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.644
When I click on menus,

00:06:02.644 --> 00:06:06.155
we get to the menu admin area of WordPress.

00:06:06.155 --> 00:06:10.250
Wordpress creates automatically a menu called menu one.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.585
Just an update.

00:06:11.585 --> 00:06:15.665
It seems WordPress has recently stopped creating the menu automatically.

00:06:15.665 --> 00:06:17.360
If this happens to you,

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.900
just give a name to the menu and click the Create Menu button.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.570
So moving on with the explanation,

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:30.020
I can stay with this menu or I can create a new one by clicking on this link above.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.825
Let's go ahead and click on this link.

00:06:32.825 --> 00:06:39.995
I want to give a name for this menu and the name of it is going to be top menu.

00:06:39.995 --> 00:06:42.350
It could also be Main Menu.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:43.535
Anyway.

00:06:43.535 --> 00:06:47.000
I'm gonna click on Create menu.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.670
By the time the menus created,

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:51.680
two options will show below.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.180
Automatically add new top-level pages to this menu.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.715
I'm going to leave this option checked.

00:06:58.715 --> 00:07:03.440
And this means that the moment I create a new static page,

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.250
it will automatically be added to my menu.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:10.250
I'll show this in practice in the next lesson, right?

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:17.135
And the check box below display location is to indicate a menu position in the menu.

00:07:17.135 --> 00:07:21.035
Remember that we added choose tax strings to the menu.

00:07:21.035 --> 00:07:23.915
Men are registered in our functions file.

00:07:23.915 --> 00:07:27.395
The first one was the slag menu, a key,

00:07:27.395 --> 00:07:33.020
and the second string was a description for the menu, it's corresponding value.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.145
The text that we have here corresponds to that second string,

00:07:37.145 --> 00:07:39.665
that is to say the menu disruption,

00:07:39.665 --> 00:07:42.320
in our case, main menu.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.030
If I chose disruption,

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:48.050
I'll be telling WordPress that menu I'm creating right now will be

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:52.800
relative to the main menu that I've registered in the functions file.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.710
So go ahead and click on save menu.

00:07:56.710 --> 00:08:00.850
So is it over, though,

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:05.965
is not ready yet because we don't have the menu items here.

00:08:05.965 --> 00:08:08.620
You see on the left side that I can choose to

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.875
add some items should my recently created menu,

00:08:11.875 --> 00:08:14.500
I have a list of pages, posed,

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.515
custom links, categories, et cetera.

00:08:17.515 --> 00:08:20.950
Here on pages. I have those pages I created earlier,

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:22.600
indolence and they remember them.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.125
So I'm going to add all these pages to my menu.

00:08:26.125 --> 00:08:27.205
Should do this.

00:08:27.205 --> 00:08:32.480
I just select one-by-one and click on this Add to Menu button.

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:41.030
I can also reordered the items if I want.

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:45.455
Now, I need to save the menu once again.

00:08:45.455 --> 00:08:47.885
And now the menu is ready.

00:08:47.885 --> 00:08:51.650
When it's ready, at least in the admin area.

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:55.700
Because this is not enough to have our menu displayed on the front end.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.985
Yeah, let's visit the homepage.

00:08:58.985 --> 00:09:01.370
Refresh the page.

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:05.690
And you can see that we don't have any menu here.

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:09.035
Only this word menu and nothing else.

00:09:09.035 --> 00:09:11.270
So what more do we need?

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:16.940
Well, we need to indicate in the header dot PHP file that the menu created in

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:20.060
the enemies and registered in functions file

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.765
will be positioned it in this specific place here.

00:09:23.765 --> 00:09:26.525
But that will be a subject for the next lesson.

00:09:26.525 --> 00:09:29.160
So see you later.
