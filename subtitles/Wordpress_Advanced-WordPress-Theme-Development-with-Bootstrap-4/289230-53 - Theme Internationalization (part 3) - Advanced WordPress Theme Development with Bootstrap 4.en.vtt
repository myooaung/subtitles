00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.105
Hello guys, you're reaching the end of the internationalization process.

00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:09.735
We already have a fully translatable thing at hand.

00:00:09.735 --> 00:00:11.355
And in today's lesson,

00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:15.045
we're going to create a file whose purpose is to save as a template

00:00:15.045 --> 00:00:19.095
for anyone who wants to translate our thing in any language.

00:00:19.095 --> 00:00:24.330
The first thing we need for this lesson is to download an application called pole added.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.690
Pole added is one of the most used software for

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.080
internationalization of the most diverse applications.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.870
It's free and it's cross platform,

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.405
which means you'll be able to use it regardless of the operating system you have.

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:42.160
So what I show here on my computer,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.360
which uses the MacOS system,

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.200
you'll also be able to do it in Windows or Linux.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.375
So as each operating system has its own way of installing applications,

00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:55.610
I will not show here how to install it.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.805
Okay. But if you still don't have the software installed,

00:00:58.805 --> 00:01:00.740
just visit the project page,

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:07.069
which is on pole edit.net and go ahead and download and install the application.

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:10.040
So let's fire up poet.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.485
And when he open it,

00:01:12.485 --> 00:01:14.705
they have this option below.

00:01:14.705 --> 00:01:17.570
Translate, WordPress theme or plugging.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.915
But unfortunately, this is a premium feature.

00:01:20.915 --> 00:01:24.470
If you click here, you end up realizing that is a future

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.850
available only in the Pro version of the application event.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.545
So you can still go ahead and create our translation template files.

00:01:33.545 --> 00:01:35.930
But we need to take some shortcuts.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:43.610
So follow me from the top menu of boneheaded head over to File New.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.790
Let's choose the language of the translation.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.055
Let's start with English, okay?

00:01:49.055 --> 00:01:50.840
Okay.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.080
Now we need to navigate your file.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.270
Save.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.830
And we can save the translation file inside our themes Language folder.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.375
The software will save our file as EN underscore US dot py file.

00:02:08.375 --> 00:02:14.255
And the also generate another file called EN underscore US DOT AMO.

00:02:14.255 --> 00:02:17.810
Let's go to our language folder because we need

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.780
to remove one of these files and renamed the other one.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.760
Well, here are the files.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.620
So the file with the extension is not useful for us at the moment.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.195
So I'm going to delete this file, the leftover file.

00:02:35.195 --> 00:02:43.520
I'm going to rename it to learn WP and its extension to that P o t.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.385
You can go ahead and do this without any worries,

00:02:46.385 --> 00:02:49.265
even if you see some warning popping up on the screen,

00:02:49.265 --> 00:02:53.580
since it's just a plain text file. So don't worry.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.700
One little tip for Windows users is that you probably won't be

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.540
able to change the file extension using the Windows File Manager.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.850
To solve this, you can open up this file in Sublime or in your favorite code editor.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.140
Click on the File menu and choose Save as.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.810
Then you can change the file extension more easily.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.090
Now back to the main software page,

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.995
we see this message here which says that there are no translations yet.

00:03:24.995 --> 00:03:27.994
Click here in extract from sources.

00:03:27.994 --> 00:03:32.435
And Paul edit will take you to the catalog properties window.

00:03:32.435 --> 00:03:35.240
Now we click on the source path tab.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.535
And here again the path to our file.

00:03:37.535 --> 00:03:41.945
And these two areas are it can include and exclude more paths.

00:03:41.945 --> 00:03:44.900
We click on this plus sign.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.630
And now we need to select r things folder.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.565
Pay attention because it's the thing folder, okay?

00:03:55.565 --> 00:03:58.470
Not the translations folder.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.345
Okay.

00:04:01.345 --> 00:04:05.770
And note here that this little dot is displaying.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.550
Now as you finish out, we're going to click the next step.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.980
And the purpose here is just to do according to what is saying up here.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:21.655
Use these keywords, function names to recognize translatable strings in source files.

00:04:21.655 --> 00:04:25.885
Let's include here the two functions we used in our thing files.

00:04:25.885 --> 00:04:27.415
And you're going to also include

00:04:27.415 --> 00:04:30.685
three other functions we came across in other template files,

00:04:30.685 --> 00:04:35.065
as you are including the translation functions that was in the last lesson.

00:04:35.065 --> 00:04:38.410
For example, here in search form dot PHP,

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.650
we found these two other functions,

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.050
ask at Ax and underscore x.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.680
Those functions were already in this file because remember,

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.925
this file here have been copied from the 2016 things folder.

00:04:52.925 --> 00:04:59.705
And what it did was only replaced the text domain here from 2016 to learn WP.

00:04:59.705 --> 00:05:04.190
So any to add them in our list to click the plus sign.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.680
The first function used was the underscore e function is added to the list.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.970
And we do the same thing to add the other translation function we used.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.430
Now as soon as I click OK,

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.360
our PUT file will be populated automatically without

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.355
the translation strings that power added can find inside theme files.

00:05:34.355 --> 00:05:37.620
And look how cool it is.

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.080
All those strings that have been wrapped by

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.730
those translation functions on the score E double underscores,

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:48.830
underscore x, underscore n,

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.645
x and S attribute X were brought here automatically.

00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:58.985
We can now have a translation template file ready to be delivered to anyone.

00:05:58.985 --> 00:06:02.510
So for example, if you have a list of collaborators,

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.730
do you think you can send them a copy of

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.809
this file and they can translate your theme into any language.

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:13.250
Finally, let's go to the File menu and save our work.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.640
We can go back to the language folder.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.560
And as you can see,

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.045
our file is here.

00:06:20.045 --> 00:06:22.250
But still with the POX tension,

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.740
let's just rename the file to p o

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:33.830
t. And if you

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.390
open this file in Sublime,

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.345
we see that it's only a translation file,

00:06:41.345 --> 00:06:45.440
but without the translations fo added automatically as

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.375
the name of the file where the string was found along with this line number.

00:06:50.375 --> 00:06:52.640
This makes translation quiet easy,

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.160
especially when the translator doesn't understand

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.965
the context of each individual sentence.

00:06:57.965 --> 00:06:59.855
Based on this file here,

00:06:59.855 --> 00:07:01.925
anyone can generate a P, o,

00:07:01.925 --> 00:07:05.225
and M o files using poetic itself.

00:07:05.225 --> 00:07:07.880
Your task as the theme developer.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:12.170
Whenever you come across a theme project that needs to be internationalized,

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.185
localized for one reason or another.

00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:18.140
These are the steps that you need to follow, right?

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.375
Well, I hope you have enjoyed it,

00:07:20.375 --> 00:07:21.815
that you have understood,

00:07:21.815 --> 00:07:26.479
or that at least you have acquired that totally new knowledge with this lesson's.

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:29.520
Until then, bye.
