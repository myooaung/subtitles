00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560
Hello,

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.110
guys.

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:03.960
In the next three lessons,

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.750
we're gonna learn the basics about internationalization of WordPress themes,

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.610
generally in small projects,

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.450
which will only be used by a single client who don't want their page to be viewed in

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:17.500
several languages.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.000
I don't worry about the internationalization,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.450
but this thing is essentially important.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.570
If you as a thin developer,

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.230
want to make your thing available for download,

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.630
or if you have a client who knits he's or her side should be translated into other

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.400
languages.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.150
It is your task as a fin developer to at least make the thing translatable.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.580
That's what I'm gonna be teaching you in the next lessons.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.570
Let's learn how to make the theme,

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.450
translatable and easily generated files that will serve as the basis for translators.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.990
But before we start,

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.450
I want to explain a little bit about how the translation flow works on the WordPress theme

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.450
.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:59.300
First,

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.070
there for translation.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.110
To be possible,

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.930
we first have to use some specific functions.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.290
These functions need to be used every time you have some tax in the thing that can be

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.890
possibly translated into another language.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.020
For example,

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.420
we have the term search inside our search box in the Brazilian side,

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.550
for example.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.950
This term will have to be displayed as this Kieser not search.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.140
But for now,

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.250
it's impossible for us to translate this turn because if you look at the source called,

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.070
it is hard coded.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.550
For example,

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:40.550
that's open up the search form that PHP file and you can see here as it it's now.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.080
It's impossible to trigger some translation for this term.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.620
The same thing goes for the thing files.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.380
For example,

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.170
the customizer that PHP file.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.280
There are several strings here that cannot be translated,

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.870
at least the way they are.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:56.670
At the moment.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.820
They will remain intact in the language in which they were reading.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.060
In this case,

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.640
they will remain in English.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.460
To solve this,

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.590
we'll have to rely on a group of functions which,

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.340
as a whole,

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.650
are known as get text functions.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.550
There are several dysfunctions,

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.620
but in the next lessons our focus on the two most used in WordPress themes.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.150
Okay,

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.030
so second step waas,

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.880
each thing term is properly wrapped with the get X functions.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.840
We can create a file that will have the beat of tea extension,

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.230
which stands for portable object template this file containing a list of all translatable

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.840
strings,

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.650
but we won't have any translation yet.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.740
As the name suggests,

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.580
the BLT file is just a template.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.730
Typically,

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.200
this fire sensor translators and from it the translator's generates two files,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.790
one with a P O extension and another one with the aim.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:58.040
Oh,

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.750
extension.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.190
These two files contain all the translations.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.670
The difference between them is that the purifier contains tax that can be easily read by

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.460
humans.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.670
On the other hand,

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.550
the M O contains machine code and can only be read by Web servers.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.950
My explanation in this license will be limited to the creation of the beauty file,

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.330
and the reason for that is very simple.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.800
Within developer doesn't have to translate the theme itself.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:33.170
This task is after the client or to the translators that he or she may hire or,

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.260
for your own thing,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.580
collaborators if it should have a team.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.220
Many themes and plug ins,

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.980
especially the best known ones,

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.560
have the help off several collaborators.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.240
Word vials.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.380
Well,

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.190
as I said,

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.050
this translation test is not yours.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.900
At least that's my opinion,

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.210
but it's your duty to make the film translatable ready to be translated by your orders.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.650
OK,

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.260
well,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.930
in this license,

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.810
I just wanted to explain this to you.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.310
But in the next lesson,

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.990
we're gonna start with the first step.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.750
That explained in today's lesson,

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:05.610
that is,

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:06.800
let's understand,

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.350
which are the to get tax functions I mentioned today.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.220
And you go ahead and find the strings in our thing that can be transformed into

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.550
translatable terms.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.050
So until then,

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:19.040
this out,

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.570
guys.
