00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.060
Hello. In the last lesson,

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.040
we created our custom loop,

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.940
but it still doesn't print out any information on screen.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.760
So what you are going to do today is tell

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.960
WordPress which fields we want to be fetched from each post.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.325
To begin this lesson, let's take a look at our layout.

00:00:20.325 --> 00:00:24.235
Well, let's understand first what we want.

00:00:24.235 --> 00:00:27.800
Here. We defined that we want the post image,

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.245
let's call it the featured image.

00:00:30.245 --> 00:00:34.550
And just below the author link category,

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.325
the tags, the publication date,

00:00:37.325 --> 00:00:39.560
and finally the post excerpts.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:46.280
That is the first 55 words from the editor content text area, followed by ellipsis.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.760
A couple more information before we begin.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.960
If you look at the dashboard in our post table as open one of the posts, for example,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.665
this first post from the web design category has made some modifications to the content,

00:01:03.665 --> 00:01:05.810
but nothing so important,

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.065
only that the content is a little different.

00:01:09.065 --> 00:01:12.275
And also that there is a featured image for

00:01:12.275 --> 00:01:17.705
every post from the web design and web development categories.

00:01:17.705 --> 00:01:22.700
Those modifications are only to illustrate what you're going to learn today, right?

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.755
And don't worry about the fact that this is supposed to be the image format, okay?

00:01:27.755 --> 00:01:30.170
This one fact that final result,

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.265
and it's just a hypothetical scenario, right?

00:01:34.265 --> 00:01:37.865
Okay, going back to Sublime Text,

00:01:37.865 --> 00:01:42.845
make our look cleaner so that the code itself becomes more readable.

00:01:42.845 --> 00:01:47.630
We're going to use that gas template part function we'd learned in previous lessons.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.610
So let's do the following.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.855
Let's close the PHP tag here after the post.

00:01:53.855 --> 00:01:57.680
Since it is from here that the post content will be brought.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.565
And we're gonna re-opened the tag just below.

00:02:01.565 --> 00:02:05.405
So the content would be inserted here in the middle.

00:02:05.405 --> 00:02:07.610
That is everything that is here.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.770
At this point, as you already know,

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.895
you'll be repeated because here we've got a loop.

00:02:13.895 --> 00:02:17.120
Let's go ahead and open a div tag here.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.000
Let's pass the code 12 class here.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.305
As I have already explained to you,

00:02:23.305 --> 00:02:30.835
this future news will occupy the full width other new row we created inside that div,

00:02:30.835 --> 00:02:33.745
let's call the get's templates per function,

00:02:33.745 --> 00:02:36.560
and let's pass two parameters.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:45.055
The first one is going to be template hyphen parts, forward slash content.

00:02:45.055 --> 00:02:48.625
And the second one is going to be featured.

00:02:48.625 --> 00:02:52.330
There is we'll have to create a new file inside of

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.805
templates parts folder called content hyphened features that PHP,

00:02:57.805 --> 00:03:00.350
SQL, this file them.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.235
Okay. What do you have in this file?

00:03:07.235 --> 00:03:11.555
Well, they want to make space to bring the post featured image.

00:03:11.555 --> 00:03:15.170
The authors link to category the tags,

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.495
the publication date, and the excerpt.

00:03:17.495 --> 00:03:19.370
So speed things up a bit.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.665
Let's copy everything from the content dot PHP file and paste in that new file.

00:03:24.665 --> 00:03:28.190
Hence, we have to write less code.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.855
Let's add one more CSS class to the stack here.

00:03:32.855 --> 00:03:38.045
To do that, I'm gonna create a new array inside this post class function,

00:03:38.045 --> 00:03:44.795
add an argument called class and set its value to future.

00:03:44.795 --> 00:03:49.925
By doing this, along with the CSS classes generated automatically

00:03:49.925 --> 00:03:55.175
by the post class function will have warmed more code featured.

00:03:55.175 --> 00:03:59.460
Let's create a new div to load our thumbnail.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.040
Unless cat that code snippet related to the thumbnail.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.060
And we want to make some changes here.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.060
For the size, lifespan, enlarge parameter.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.284
And for the image to the responsive,

00:04:17.284 --> 00:04:18.950
let's create an array here,

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.485
including the class argument.

00:04:21.485 --> 00:04:25.925
And its value is going to be IMG,

00:04:25.925 --> 00:04:33.050
hyphen fluid that will cause a bootstrap class cone IMG fluids to be included.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.154
Mts make our image for responsive.

00:04:36.154 --> 00:04:41.450
Now, down here, let's change the order of the fields that debt.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.850
Within a single paragraph.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.770
We're going to include each field.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.830
We want each of them inside the span tag.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.575
Okay, notice here that the publication date went down.

00:05:09.575 --> 00:05:12.920
We only have a single paragraph tag.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.520
Also, notice that for the tags function,

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.305
we added a last parameter,

00:05:18.305 --> 00:05:21.875
including here the closing HTML span tag.

00:05:21.875 --> 00:05:25.820
This function accepts three parameters and we can add

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.365
HTML tags here on the first and the last parameters.

00:05:30.365 --> 00:05:33.515
Okay, one more modification here.

00:05:33.515 --> 00:05:35.765
And instead of the full content,

00:05:35.765 --> 00:05:38.030
we only want the excerpts.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.650
Should do this, we replace the content with the excerpt.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:49.235
Okay, let's save this and let's see if finally we get any results.

00:05:49.235 --> 00:05:52.260
We load in the homepage.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.105
Here we get the image and the other fields to.

00:05:59.105 --> 00:06:03.510
Let's just check if it's really the post we want.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:10.775
C, as we excluded the Social Media category from our loop.

00:06:10.775 --> 00:06:17.220
Remember, what appears on the page is the first post from the web design category.

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:22.295
Okay, let's see if the image is indeed responsive.

00:06:22.295 --> 00:06:28.085
Coherent press control shift I or on a Mac command option,

00:06:28.085 --> 00:06:37.220
I. Click here and

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.880
see that the image is real responsive.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.380
Next step now is to bring the two secondary news.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:50.405
For this, we will have to create a second loop here on the same page.

00:06:50.405 --> 00:06:56.360
As you notice, this is only possible using alternatives such as the WP query class.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.300
But that's a subject for our next lesson.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.220
And she'll then happy coding.
