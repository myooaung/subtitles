00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
flow guys into these lessons,

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.590
I'm going to show you one more thing we can do with the WordPress Regis areas.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.400
In previous lessons,

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.740
we used this widget areas tribute.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:12.610
Sybers,

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.150
if you choose sad birds one for the home page and another for the block page.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.460
But we can have more than simple sidebars.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.850
Don't let the name fool you.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.740
Today we're gonna be creating three widget areas.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:34.740
Tribute This service section here Notice here that in this service section we got three

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.490
items.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.310
Each of them is made up by the same elements.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.600
An image,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.050
a header in the progress.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.410
Fortunately,

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.680
WordPress has all the features that allows us to create this area.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.340
And we can do that just by clicking and dragging elements.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.480
There was a region that allows us to insert an image and there's also a region that allows

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.150
us to create an area with a header and a totally customized content.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.450
So why not use this widgets to create all this year?

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.590
One future I've always missed in wordpress is a native region that future.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.750
What you see is what you get side editing area.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.600
There are several places on the dashboard where this type of editor is there by default,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.700
for example,

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.050
in The Post Editor.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.940
But in two version 4.7,

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.600
there was no native widget to do the same thing from this version.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.310
4.7 new widgets were added ching quid for mata text,

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.220
images,

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.700
video and audio.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.660
All of them are resources that the word breast community requested.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.240
And that and Children,

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.870
we're only possible to implement using plug ins.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.070
Great,

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.610
but enough small,

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.320
tall can.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.960
Let's get down to business.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.160
The first thing we're gonna do is Butte,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.450
the HTML markup off the service section.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.730
First of all,

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.450
let's open up the page home that PHP file.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.350
And we want to remove this word here.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.770
I'm going to use the Emmett Extension to speed up my work.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.400
As you all know,

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.800
you can write everything faster with it.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.150
I just I pee in the classes I need and then hit the tab key.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.090
Now,

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.630
before the start of the row,

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.380
I'm going to create a new header,

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.600
and within this role,

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.650
I'm gonna create a markup for the three elements and nature place here.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.330
By doing this,

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.620
I create all three lives,

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.830
all of them with the column sizes.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.120
I won't and now to close out within each day.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.650
If I'm going to create a narrative with services.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:47.890
Iten class.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:54.950
I can easily do this by holding the control key or a command on a Mac clicking like this

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.720
and type in the code for the three gifts at once.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.090
Okay,

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.730
accident.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.250
I already have the requires my cup.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.950
Now let's create the three widget areas within the functions file.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:18.060
I was looking up that file and now to greet the three new Egypt areas.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.400
Let's just copy and paste this last portion here three times.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.520
Just be careful not to copy anything wrong.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.370
For example,

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.750
we have to copy from the word register sidebar to the Senate calling here.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.580
Okay,

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.220
now we just changed the values for name I.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.930
D and description arguments off each of these areas.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:04:13.800
Let's leave the HTML

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.120
rappers the way they are,

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.670
okay and save everything.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.830
Now go back to the WordPress dashboard,

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.750
head over to the appearance menu Regent's,

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.970
and now we have our three new agent areas.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.060
Now it's pretty easy.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:37.430
We just have to know what we just We need to visually compose our service section for all

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.650
that we just need to very simple native widgets.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:48.350
One of them is this one image and the other one the text widget.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.850
Let's click and drag the first widget to the first digit area.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.750
See that it allows me to add a title and upload an image.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:58.960
In our case,

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.090
I don't need a title.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.940
I live it.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:08.940
Auntie and dis upload an image to complete the design off this area.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:15.380
I already have three images ready each with a wave and height off 200 pixels.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.550
So I'll go ahead and grab this first image.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.120
Okay,

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.180
Now let's drag text widget.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:31.610
This time I'm going to add a title which will work as a heading element for my design.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.520
And here in the content,

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.850
I'm gonna paste any damage text.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.160
Okay,

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.350
I'll say this here.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.030
Let's go back to the base home.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.250
That's PHP file.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:54.510
And we want to say the following open PHP tax if is active Sidebar and what is the name of

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.040
the first wages area?

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.880
Its services.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:07.880
One dynamic side wear and the widgets area name again.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:14.850
Let's copy this here and call the next region areas.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:26.750
I saved this here and refresh the theme.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.600
Home page A look.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.480
You already have all the elements of the first digit area here.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.080
Excellent,

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.550
isn't it?

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:36.930
Well,

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.070
since it worked,

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:42.450
let's go back to the widgets manager and do the same for the next widget areas.

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.280
I'll speed up the video a bit.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:44.650
Okay.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:07:10.540
Now,

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:17.110
back to the theme accident.

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:21.740
We now have all the elements of the services section here on the page,

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.220
all the images,

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.430
all the headings and the content.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:26.340
Of course,

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:27.480
it's a bit ugly,

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:32.200
but that's something we can solve easily with a bit of CSS.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.630
As of mention,

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:39.810
it seems the beginning of the course will not focus here on CSS only on features that

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:42.100
relate directly to WordPress.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.400
So in the next lesson,

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.360
you'll see this.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:45.580
Yes,

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:46.280
exchanges,

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.060
I'll be applying.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.420
But of course,

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:54.720
any changes I make here will be in the files I'll make available for download anyway.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.610
Don't means the next lesson.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:02.450
As we're gonna learn how to create a custom loop within WordPress simply one of the most

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:05.400
interesting subjects so far in the scores.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.280
That being said,

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.420
I wait for you in the next lesson,

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.650
and you then bye
