00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.130
Hey, what's up, guys?

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:03.495
In the last lesson,

00:00:03.495 --> 00:00:07.995
I asked you to solve a problem that popped up in the search page template.

00:00:07.995 --> 00:00:09.780
Among the search results,

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.820
we also have pages.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.770
And as you can see,

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.965
they don't have any information about categories

00:00:16.965 --> 00:00:20.400
simply because they are pages and not posts.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.070
And pages don't have categories.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.490
So how did you to remove the snippet here for every search results related to a page,

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.380
I asked you to search for a word press function called has category.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.370
This function returns true if the post within the loop has

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.325
a given category or if no categories specified,

00:00:42.325 --> 00:00:46.670
it will also return to if it has any category.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.165
Let's open up the content search.html file.

00:00:50.165 --> 00:00:56.405
And let's play around with this function that we want to make some changes here,

00:00:56.405 --> 00:00:59.975
where we're loading the category the way it is now,

00:00:59.975 --> 00:01:02.750
we are displaying text category regardless

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.960
of whether or not we have categories within the loop.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.100
To solve this, let's create an if else block right here.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.500
And inside the if block at the hes

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:26.195
category function, it returns true.

00:01:26.195 --> 00:01:28.340
We're going to show you the category.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.875
This will always happen for posts,

00:01:30.875 --> 00:01:33.620
at least for posts that have categories,

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.930
what most of the time is true?

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.120
If it returns false,

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.980
the code snippet that lows the category will not even be displayed.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.915
That's result we want.

00:01:44.915 --> 00:01:47.700
So let's test that out.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.355
Now for all pages related results like this one,

00:01:55.355 --> 00:01:58.595
the category doesn't appear excellent,

00:01:58.595 --> 00:02:03.215
okay, but we can improve our results page a bit more.

00:02:03.215 --> 00:02:05.540
One of the things that were press recommends for

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.445
thing developers is that the results page also has the search form.

00:02:10.445 --> 00:02:14.135
So if the user wants to repeat the search using another term,

00:02:14.135 --> 00:02:18.410
we can help as open our search dot PHP file.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.185
And before our loop starts,

00:02:21.185 --> 00:02:22.940
again, include the search form.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:23.750
Again.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.520
This is very easy.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.800
It's enough if it just call the get search form function again.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.240
By doing so, we're going to have the form at the top of the page. Again.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.160
By the way, that's how you're going to add

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.130
a third form to a sidebar if you wanted to do so.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.650
That's one of the methods available.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.375
Another thing we can do,

00:02:44.375 --> 00:02:49.640
create something that shows more clearly what is the search term for this page?

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.285
We can include that before the second search form.

00:02:53.285 --> 00:02:55.145
For example, we can say

00:02:55.145 --> 00:03:04.055
search results for and here we specify what is the query string.

00:03:04.055 --> 00:03:07.430
To repeat the search query string that use the function we

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.210
learned in the last lesson called get's search query.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:17.195
Let's do that. We must act it out.

00:03:17.195 --> 00:03:21.060
And now reload the search page.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.815
And again the query string here.

00:03:24.815 --> 00:03:26.655
That's very cool.

00:03:26.655 --> 00:03:29.575
Now we only have one big problem.

00:03:29.575 --> 00:03:34.345
Incidentally, a huge problem if we search only for an, a,

00:03:34.345 --> 00:03:36.610
yes, a nail letter,

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.015
only ten search results will appear.

00:03:40.015 --> 00:03:45.190
But surely we have several posts and pages that have the letter a in

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.860
their content where not this other pages displaying the answer to this is quite simple.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.680
They are heating, should reveal them.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.205
We need to find a way for WordPress to show the other pages.

00:03:57.205 --> 00:04:02.200
To do this, we need to understand how pagination works in WordPress,

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.065
but that's a subject for the next lessons.

00:04:05.065 --> 00:04:09.740
So for now, peace out guys, bye.
