00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
Hello guys.

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.940
As we go through the next lessons,

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.740
I will be explaining everything you need to know in order to get your finger gratitude.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:10.400
Gutenberg,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.300
This new tool yet to be officially lounged by WordPress,

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.650
named after the great German inventor of the printing press.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.680
Why did I record this video?

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.780
Gutenberg is still being developed.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.770
The official released is expected for the year 2018 along with WordPress.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:28.980
Version five point.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:29.460
Oh,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.870
so maybe if you're watching this video by the end of 28 ng or later you don't even need to

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.640
wonder what Gutenberg is.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.950
But right now that's a question and nature answer here.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:41.950
Basically,

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.170
Gutenberg is the new WordPress editor.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.980
Its main goal remains the same off the old editor.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.380
Under the hood,

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:56.420
content created in the editor is still sent to the same WordPress post table and steal

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.750
retrieved by the content function within the same loops.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.250
But it would be unfair to say that it's just a redesign off the old editor.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.960
The WordPress team is really expecting to see Gutenberg as a watershed in content creation

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.960
.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.350
It's a new where you're thinking about the content and its richness as a whole new

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.140
alternative for rich content creation for pages,

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.790
posts and custom post types within the CMS.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.640
WordPress promises that creating content with this new toe will become much faster,

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.050
easier and without mysteries.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.120
That is why we have in so much buzz around its official release.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.510
Well,

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.100
if it is going to be easier or not,

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.090
Onley time,

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.500
you tell for now,

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.230
like everything you Gutenberg has been causing,

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.660
a bit of controversy may need because let's be real.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:58.250
It's really annoying and complicated to do with changes that's part of being human.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.160
If you look at the WordPress Blackness repository where Gutenberg is already available as a

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.590
plugging before the official release,

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.840
of course we should have them bring it into the core.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.450
Look,

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.350
most people don't feel satisfied.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.610
Bugs are still crucial for the project,

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.140
as you see as we go through the lessons,

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.620
but we're still at the beginning.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.880
Guttenberg is still evolving over the next lessons.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.070
My goal will be to explain how good number quirks we'll understand its basic functions on

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.150
Lee,

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.800
the main ones.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.140
Okay,

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.070
since reason number one as the two always still revolving,

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.390
new features will be incorporated.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.760
The time and reason number two.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.750
This course is more focused on developers,

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.360
so we're going to limit ourselves here to explaining what you change from the developers

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.110
point of view,

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.850
not the end user's point of your right,

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.020
but anyway,

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.330
the basic futures I'm going to show you.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.600
You already help you stand on your own two feet as Gutenberg evolves the main stretchers,

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.530
you here will be that we'll grab the theme that we're developing in this course,

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.510
and you see what more of a niche add to say in the end that the theme is good and Berg

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.150
ready.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.880
You see that it's not so difficult,

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.780
and you'll be able to offer a thing,

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.740
whether for your client or anywhere else you can say is ready for Gutenberg.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.470
As I said before,

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.460
this is an evolving tool than possibly.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.630
New lessons will be added to the course.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.560
If there is any other functionality that impacts your work as a fin developer,

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.090
so stay tuned.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.870
Well,

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.090
I talked too much,

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.950
but I didn't show anything to you until now.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.530
In this first lesson.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.800
Then I'll start by installing and enabling good Renberg in our WordPress installation.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:55.670
By the time a record this video WordPress version 4.9 point eight has just been released.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.390
So this version is showing this invitation right here on the dashboard,

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.750
inviting users to get to know the new publishing tool.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:10.650
So you can be sure that your client we want to know what this little thing here is.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.170
So soon your fame units,

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.480
you comply with the latest requirement,

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.130
I say.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.650
But there's no reason to panic right now.

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.210
You have the options to install Good and Burke here by clicking this button,

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.990
which says,

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.330
Install Gutenberg America also downloaded directly from the plug in repository,

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:37.760
which means also going to plug ing's at New Search for Gutenberg.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:45.780
And it's gonna be here if you're reading using WordPress fipe on Oh,

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.340
there's no need to do this,

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.950
since Gutenberg will be included by default in WordPress.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.450
However,

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.750
if we go back here to the home page,

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.350
you see that we can continue using the classic editor.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.650
We still uses the tiny EMC extension.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.170
I believe that from version 5.0 onwards,

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:12.260
there should also be a way to choose whether or not she used Gutenberg.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.610
No one knows exactly at the moment.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:24.190
Well,

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.150
let's start off first,

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.930
Um,

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.000
it's always recommended to back up your installation.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.490
Okay,

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:31.450
you never know.

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.650
I'm going to click here to install Gutenberg,

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:41.250
and as soon as a click,

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.900
activate this demo page appears,

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.920
and this is good.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.410
Umberg.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:48.650
How are new editor?

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.650
And here's interesting thing.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.750
If you compare this new look and the classic editor,

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:02.100
it's not that the editor has Bean Onley redesigned.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.710
It's been totally revisited.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.250
Gutenberg is totally different from the classic tiny EMC editor,

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.480
and if you scroll down to see the content,

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:18.750
we'll see a lot of things that he couldn't get before using the old classic editor.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.050
For example,

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:35.810
image galleries like this one or a full size image like this or a full size video ended a

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.050
lot of fantastic stuff when compared to the old editor.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.640
In fact,

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.400
those things were possible,

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.450
but it was more difficult to achieve all this.

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:48.490
We needed to rely on short codes,

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:52.650
but then we could only see the code in the editor,

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.550
but not its result.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.000
Inside the editor screen,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.350
as you can know,

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.380
are we need a cheese plug ins.

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.070
Gutenberg is coming to change that,

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:03.950
making things more clear,

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:05.160
like video in batting,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:05.950
for example,

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.620
a lot of people used unnecessary plug ins for this.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.850
Now the process is more clear,

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:13.460
just at a block,

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.350
and you don't.

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:15.730
In a way,

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:21.340
the editor looks a lot like those page builders like the rib Utor L.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:22.090
A mentor,

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:24.300
visual composer and others.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:30.580
Gutenberg is not going to replace page builders even because it's not coming to put anyone

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:31.610
out of business,

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.510
as the WordPress team has already stated.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:36.430
And it's quite the opposite.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.400
It's coming to evolve WordPress.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.030
So there's more business to be had in the future for everyone,

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:45.260
so it won't replace page builders.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:49.490
But in a way it will bring a similar experience for the user.

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:57.070
But before your feet needs to be prepared to use all this in the best possible way,

00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:00.940
that's what we'll start learning in the next lessons.

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.150
Well,

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.900
see you then,

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.950
in the next lesson and Children
