00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.070
Hello,

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:01.740
guys.

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:02.620
In this lesson,

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:08.350
we're gonna test our first bootstrap classes less Jack if everything that is in the last

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.850
lesson when we included bootstrap for in our theme is really working.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.330
Before testing whether bootstrap is working,

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.740
we need to add a new tack in the head of Dutch PHP file.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.220
That tax is relative to the View port,

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.610
which is the visible part off the screen and rise from device to device.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:32.670
The view port tack ensures that the side content will respond correctly regardless off the

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:33.340
view port.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.300
In fact,

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.420
I already have that tag it hand.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.610
To be honest,

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.760
I just copied the attack from the one of the native words best teams,

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.450
and you can do the same.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.280
In fact,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.400
I recommend that you do the same because it's faster and it's reliable.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.150
So let's space it here.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.310
Well,

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.520
I will not explain in detail what each of these properties mean,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.860
but it's important that you include attack right.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:01.770
Otherwise,

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.960
your side may look totally weird on the phone or on a tablet,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.220
and we don't want this.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:07.650
Okay,

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.450
so let's go ahead and save this file.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.850
And now we contest bootstrap using this file the header dot PHP.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.750
Let's remove this paragraph because we don't need it anymore.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.880
Now how this bootstrap work?

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.440
To help us understand,

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.970
I'm going to show you an image from the Design motor website.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.620
Well,

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.480
as you see in the image briefly,

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.160
the basis of the stool is a great system off strove columns in which we can distribute the

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.560
content off the site.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.690
The content itself is centered within a special class called container who size rise

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.390
according to the device that is used to view the side content.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.380
Inside these containers,

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.820
we have the rose,

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.360
and those rows can be distributed over child columns.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.450
All of the scientists are controlled by CSS classes.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.330
That's why we've included the new CSS file in our functions.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.840
File.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.280
In the last lesson,

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.790
there was a CSS class for the container for the row and for the column sizes.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.590
We can also define specific column sizes for large,

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.340
medium,

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.780
small and extra small devices.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.090
Great,

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.590
but let's see that in practice,

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.850
let's create a new tiff tagged inside topper section.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.650
Anyone to add the container class to it.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.760
That class is specific to bootstrap.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.850
To use it,

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.200
you just need to add it to the elements you want within this death,

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.480
you want to create a new one with the role class.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:03:02.000
Now let's say that social media tive we'll have a live off 10 columns in extra large

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.790
devices,

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.620
eight columns in medium sized and small devices and the wave off six columns for extra

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.310
small devices like smartphones.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.100
For example.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.580
To do this,

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:21.350
let's add the Coal Excel 10 Cole and the Eight,

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.870
Cole S.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:32.360
M eight and Coal six classes to the social media icon Steve as to the same for the search,

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.890
def.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.680
But now we want to set another values for extra large size.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:50.080
We're gonna have to columns for medium and small sizes for columns and then for the extras

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:57.080
more size six columns notice that the some off all columns within the same role never

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.300
exceeds 12.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.380
So 10 and chew or six and six equals 12.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.010
It's at another special bootstrap class to the search def text,

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.590
right?

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.000
And this class,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.420
because this their floats to the right.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.990
We can also add some more rules to the sisters file,

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:21.760
which will only help us notice the difference between these two areas here has opened up

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.420
the template that CSS file and at the following lines social media.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:33.750
Aiken's background Green hide,

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:44.450
30 pixels Search background.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:53.810
Yellow Hi 30 picks us that saved the file and finally previewed the changes.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.250
And when we below the page,

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.500
Harris,

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.870
everything's working.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:02.830
It's live,

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.890
has the sizes despite and the Kohler's percent.

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.330
Now we first sized browser.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.050
We see that the columns are stacking correctly as well.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.190
So it's like magic,

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.750
isn't it?

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.340
So you can test that out later on your own.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.810
If you won,

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:19.200
right,

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.320
for example,

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.090
you can change the post wrapped classes and the ones you name it.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.090
It could be a very good exercise.

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.790
Well,

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:29.280
that's often.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.150
Now I hope you like this lesson and I see you in the next one.
