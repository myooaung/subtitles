00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.020
Hello.

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.540
We're back here for a new lesson in this lesson.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.350
We're gonna talk about this So called WP query.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:09.680
Well,

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.030
for those who have never heard of it,

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.250
WP query is a very powerful WordPress class that allows us to make a modification to the

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.840
default WordPress loop,

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.450
sometimes called the main query.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.140
And you make asked me,

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.910
Marcello,

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.530
what is that Default?

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.490
WordPress loop.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.150
I've never heard of it too.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.090
Well,

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.200
every time you open a page or opposed,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.040
what we see is this default WordPress loop in action.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.450
So we already know it.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.560
We have already created one of thes loops in our index file which generates supposed

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.700
listening force.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.450
That's on our block page.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.410
But as the name says,

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.170
we're talking about a default look that at times that we want to change that.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.530
Look,

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.550
if you want,

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.560
you have a visually different results.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.990
For example,

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.030
if you look again at the design off the home page of theme were beauty,

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.370
we can see that it has this section where we have this future news.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:15.080
It is followed by this to other secondary items with the fourth WordPress loop.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.940
We cannot achieve this,

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:23.350
and why basically because we need to loops on the same page to achieve this result.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.830
WP query is a class that allows us to make changes to this main query and have,

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:30.590
as a result,

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.570
something like this.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.490
Okay,

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.490
But before we start writing any cold,

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.290
let's start by showing some things that I have prepared for this lesson.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.750
Well,

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.710
in addition to the CSS modifications made here to the services area,

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.720
which you can see later in files available for download has made some minor changes in the

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.340
back end.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.350
Let's go over to the dashboard.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.180
The first thing I did was modified the post titles for some of the items we have already

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.980
created in other lessons.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.690
So there's nothing new here.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:04.760
Okay,

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.830
so we're going to start by opening the file,

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.550
which is our home templates.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:10.850
At this point,

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:17.150
everyone is tired of knowing that that file is the page home dot PHP file.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.680
The first thing we're gonna need to create is the HTML markup.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.650
It wont to create a new role inside the new section.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.640
Well,

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.440
why do I need to create this role here to answer that?

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.030
Let's take a look at our layout as you can see.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.900
This entire region here is already in a row.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.380
Within that row,

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.970
we have these two columns.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.780
One is the sidebar with three columns,

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.550
and the other is where our news will replace with nine columns.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:50.760
Now,

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.900
here in this news area,

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.040
we're gonna have another column division.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.410
Let's imagine that this Nero also has 12 columns.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.960
We're gonna have a news item that you occupy a space off trail columns in this new row and

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:06.730
here below.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.390
We're gonna have to more news items,

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.910
which will occupy in six columns.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.620
Did you see it?

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.110
So we need a new role here.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.490
It's a basic bootstrap room.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.950
It has nothing to do with WordPress.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:21.450
Okay,

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.450
this is just html and CSS.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.210
Okay,

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.290
for each news will be creating a new WordPress.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.680
Look,

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.560
the 1st 1 is gonna be used for the future item,

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.140
and the other one is gonna lows.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.510
The other two news items and that's the advantage off WP query.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.440
As you see in the next licence,

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.840
it allows us to have more than one WordPress look on the same page with different

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.250
parameters for each one.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.210
Okay,

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.170
since this topic may be a little difficult to understand.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:59.050
I'm going to divide this lessons into four parts to make it easier for you to understand.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.340
I'll try not your Russian things.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.620
So in the next lesson we come back and you understand in practice how to create this custom

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.080
queries in WordPress.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.950
So see you later.
