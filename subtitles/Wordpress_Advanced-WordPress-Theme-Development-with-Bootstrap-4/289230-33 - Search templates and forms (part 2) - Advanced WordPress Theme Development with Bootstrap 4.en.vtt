00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
Hello guys. In our last lesson,

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.125
as you remember, we started working with the search template file.

00:00:07.125 --> 00:00:08.985
Based on our tests.

00:00:08.985 --> 00:00:10.950
We can say it's fully functional,

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.705
but there's still the question.

00:00:12.705 --> 00:00:16.770
Is it possible to change the appearance of the search box itself?

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.140
This is an important question since we didn't even create a form for this search box.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.665
Yeah.

00:00:22.665 --> 00:00:27.235
So how can you change the appearance of a thing we didn't create?

00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:29.090
Start talking about that.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.850
We're going to have to dig into some theory,

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.485
but I promise it won't hurt.

00:00:33.485 --> 00:00:37.130
Okay? Now, you remember from

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.390
the previous lesson that if you want to include a search box in our thing,

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.330
use the get's search formed function.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.180
But in fact, what does this function do?

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.530
Show ends to that.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.485
I have to take a look at the WordPress codecs.

00:00:51.485 --> 00:00:54.570
So let's search for this function

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.565
and click on the first search result.

00:01:04.565 --> 00:01:09.690
Well, here it says display search form.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.730
We'll first attempt to locate the search form

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.885
dot PHP file in either the child or the parent.

00:01:16.885 --> 00:01:19.810
They mean child or parent themes here.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.020
Then loaded. If it does not exist,

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.005
then the default search form, you'll be displayed.

00:01:26.005 --> 00:01:30.340
In fact, that default search form is what we're currently loading,

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.640
since we don't have any file called search form

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.135
dot PHP in our thing that we know we don't.

00:01:37.135 --> 00:01:42.580
So by logic, it is enough if we just create that file in our theme.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.875
By doing that, we'll be able to modify our search form, our search box.

00:01:47.875 --> 00:01:51.170
So let's go ahead and create a file.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.850
Let's see if it's working.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.260
If it's working, anything we type in here will be displaying in

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.315
place over search form by just typing test.

00:02:07.315 --> 00:02:11.089
And let's see what happens.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.130
Okay, perfect.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.950
This means that we can create a brand new form

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.565
within this file with a different markup, et cetera.

00:02:21.565 --> 00:02:24.565
But before I do that, a hint.

00:02:24.565 --> 00:02:28.075
If you don't want to have a lot of work to do this,

00:02:28.075 --> 00:02:29.845
which is always interesting.

00:02:29.845 --> 00:02:35.865
It can open the search form dot PHP file of any native WordPress theme and copy it.

00:02:35.865 --> 00:02:37.580
For example, let's look at

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:44.495
the 2016 theme folder and let's copy what's inside the search form dot PHP file.

00:02:44.495 --> 00:02:48.155
Let's paste everything in our new file.

00:02:48.155 --> 00:02:52.850
And now we can define what we want to exclude are to include here.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.235
For example, we want to remove this label,

00:02:55.235 --> 00:02:57.830
search for and rescue

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.525
stay a tip about something and learned long after I created this course,

00:03:02.525 --> 00:03:04.250
removing the label information,

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.220
especially these screen readers text fields,

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.200
it's a good idea.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.910
They're very important for the website's accessibility. For the project.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.210
In this course, I will remove the field as you just saw,

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.330
but remember not to do that in your next project.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.125
If you want, you can keep the field and hide it using CSS.

00:03:24.125 --> 00:03:26.330
The 2016 theme, for example,

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.375
uses the following CSS to hide these fields,

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:31.920
keeping them in the code.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:42.290
So moving now, all we have here is a form that uses the get method to perform a search.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.990
Notice that the input tag has a function called get search query.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:53.120
This will bring the search term back into the form every new search.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.400
This function is very useful.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.520
Later on this course, we will see more about it.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:06.515
So let's save and then reload the page. Not bad.

00:04:06.515 --> 00:04:08.195
But as you can see,

00:04:08.195 --> 00:04:11.150
the appearance is still a little ugly.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.440
To fix that, let's modify our Bootstrap CSS classes.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.770
And let's also replace this word here with an OK.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.390
Let's just save everything.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.685
Let's go back to the thing.

00:04:34.685 --> 00:04:37.070
Reload the page.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.330
So now it's much better. Okay, that's it.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.420
Now have a very simple search form.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.615
If we wanted, we could also remove this button,

00:04:47.615 --> 00:04:51.530
which will force the user to use the Enter key to do the search,

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.540
but do not do that.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.810
Even because has already mentioned in this video,

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.100
that is not a good idea in terms of websites accessibility.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.305
So let's apply that, okay?

00:05:03.305 --> 00:05:06.725
Okay, I have exercises to propose to you.

00:05:06.725 --> 00:05:11.645
The first one is tried to load the search form here at the sidebar.

00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:14.675
That's easy, but think a little.

00:05:14.675 --> 00:05:16.070
How could you do that?

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.965
Second one is a bit more complicated,

00:05:18.965 --> 00:05:22.550
and I'll bring the correct answer in the next lesson.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.820
Notice that a moldy search results,

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.060
we also have pages, not just posts.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.810
As you know, pages don't have categories.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:38.315
So here in the search results we have the word category followed by an empty space.

00:05:38.315 --> 00:05:44.255
How would you do to remove this snippet here for every search results related to a page,

00:05:44.255 --> 00:05:50.585
a hint search for a word press function called has category.

00:05:50.585 --> 00:05:53.885
In the next lesson, I'll be back with the answer.

00:05:53.885 --> 00:05:57.390
Until then. Unhappy calling.
