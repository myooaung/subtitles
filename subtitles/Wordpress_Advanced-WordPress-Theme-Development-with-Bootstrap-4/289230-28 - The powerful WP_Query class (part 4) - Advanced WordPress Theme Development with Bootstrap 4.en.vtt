00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560
Hey,

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.370
what's going on,

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:02.900
guys?

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.570
It's Marcella.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.460
Once again,

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:12.210
today's lesson is the last one about WP query this powerful WordPress class that allows us

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.950
to create custom queries.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.100
So far,

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.050
we just created a custom loop.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.630
This look is helping us bring the latest posts on the home page,

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.050
and that will be our first news item in this lesson.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.130
We're gonna build our second loop.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.480
We should bring the next two news items into the list before we start.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.180
I must apologize because there is in error here in the bootstrap CSS classes.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.310
The order is inverted.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:47.820
The correct order will be first the container class and then the role inside this container

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:47.820
.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.410
So sorry for that.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:58.810
Let's just swap the classes now back to the explanation to speed up things that that I'm

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.340
going to copy the entire custom.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.380
Look we created in the last lesson.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:15.660
So next we go ahead and change the name of her class object.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.780
Let's call it secondary hoedown.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.910
Commence the almanac Contrave on Windows or Lennox to find and replace everything at once.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.150
Okay.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.240
In the first loop,

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.330
we used the choir string methods to retrieve the database information through the WP query

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.950
class.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.960
Now we go to the second life filled using an array.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.070
What is the advantage of using an array instead of Aquarius drink?

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.520
Well,

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.480
the adventures is quite clear.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.740
Let's say that we have to pass several arguments through the crowd of string.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.190
As the number of Bergman's grows,

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:59.250
it becomes more difficult to read and understand the commence to a point where you can no

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.670
longer make mistakes.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.060
If there is a single mistake here,

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.050
it will be like trying to find a needle in the haystack.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.030
Now,

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.400
when the user race,

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.950
that doesn't happen.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.250
Let's create an array up here.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:21.550
Let's call it arts and let's start adding the arguments here.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.080
The first argument is gonna be the kind of post we want to fetch.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.770
So post on the score type boast.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.050
In fact,

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.770
this argument can be ignored.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.750
It is optional if you choose not to pass it.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.020
WordPress feel always considered that what we want our boasting did.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.590
It's most useful,

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.040
actually when we have to work with custom post types.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.230
But it's not our case that's also passed here.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.150
The number of posts we want to bring in this case there are two posts.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.600
Now to fetch the post categories,

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.290
let's do something different.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.930
Let's start by choosing which categories will be excluded from the list for that,

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.850
let's best the category not in argument.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.970
Just pay attention because there are chew on the scores after the word category,

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:19.400
right?

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:26.040
So it's Category two underscores not on this court in Let's Go Ahead and create an array

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:33.450
here and pass category aid became later passed other category separated by commas.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.130
We will also choose which categories will be included in the list.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.700
The opposite off category,

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.330
not in its category.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.610
In once again with you underscores as great a new way,

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.220
and inside it we want to pass the values for in 11.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.200
Thus,

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.240
when new categories Air created,

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.880
they will have to be added here as well.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.260
Now that we have all the arguments,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.970
let's just pass disarray to WP query class.

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.550
Let's change a few more things here.

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:13.420
First,

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.570
the elements off this look will have six columns instead off 12.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.050
So let's have the Kohl s M six class here.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:30.230
It will make the diff techs have a live of 50% from small devices upwards towards large

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:36.190
screen sizes and the name of the file that will be required here will be content.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.870
Hyphen Secondary Doctor PHP.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.580
Okay,

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.030
the loop itself is ready.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.350
Now you need to create this file called content hyphen secondary dot PHP.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:58.050
That's short in this process up a bit by copying the contents off the previous lessons file

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:04.750
and we're going to savour new file.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.730
Okay,

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.820
here we Onley change of feel things,

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.810
the tag article class,

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:16.040
and we want to remove the publication date,

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.930
and that's it.

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:24.530
Okay,

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.390
we now have a second row with two news items.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:29.310
All of that,

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.600
thanks to your second custom loop notice.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.180
One thing,

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.560
though,

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.020
the first news has been repeated here.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.030
But what if it don't want it repeated?

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.050
Is there a way to do that?

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.790
Yes,

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:42.490
of course.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:43.290
First,

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:44.640
let's add another element,

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:52.960
Kadouri and the argument will be offset when he used offset it.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.980
Tell WordPress how many items we wanted to ignore at the beginning of the list.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.310
Let's type in,

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:00.260
for example,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:05.660
one that's reload,

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.990
as you can see,

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.910
nonetheless makes more sense.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.820
That's because WordPress ignore the first result off the list,

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.450
which was the same post we have up here.

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:20.580
If we change it to to this post here is gonna be ignored.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.650
And the 1st 1 on the list is gonna be this one here.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:32.550
Very cool.

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.910
Okay,

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.770
this is the last lesson own WP query.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.580
I hope you feel like you learn something new from the lessons,

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.720
but don't stop here,

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.390
okay?

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:49.830
The BP query and custom loops are the most interesting topics in the WordPress thing.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:50.990
Development world.

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:52.740
In addition to the arguments,

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:53.480
we work this.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.550
There are many,

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:55.550
many others.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:56.600
Go ahead.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:02.590
Visit Link that I left available in this lesson the curious and exploited full potential

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:04.330
off this WP query class.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.180
You see that for every scenario,

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.600
for every need,

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.270
there is a way to use this class that you can benefit from another thing.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:18.850
What I taught you is just one way to create a future news list in WordPress,

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:21.150
there are several relation to this.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:22.600
You find out Internet.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.800
Many people teaching how to do this neither ways wrong.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.340
So that's it.

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:32.210
Then I wait for you in the next section of this course.

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:35.950
Let's start bringing life to the inner bases of her thing.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:37.300
Jovan,

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.450
See you later.
