00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
Hello everyone, welcome to another lesson.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.140
So in this lesson we are going to talk about the anatomy of a WordPress theme.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.115
We will understand how we're pressing is made up what files,

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:15.780
directories, and what are the rules that you have to follow the gradient thing.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.170
Despite the fact that this video has a lot of theory,

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.050
I highly recommend that you follow it until the end.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.470
Okay?

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.120
It's very important.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.560
Before you start,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.630
you must already have Wordpress installed.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.025
If you're not ready yet,

00:00:29.025 --> 00:00:31.590
please take a look at the previous lesson came.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.285
For this course, I will be using Sublime Text three as my code editor,

00:00:36.285 --> 00:00:39.655
but of course you can use your favorite editor instead.

00:00:39.655 --> 00:00:44.539
To begin this lesson, I'll be showing you how WordPress installation is organized.

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.874
You remember that we install WordPress in a folder called WP.

00:00:48.874 --> 00:00:50.555
So if you open that folder,

00:00:50.555 --> 00:00:52.360
we have three other folders.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.825
The root of the installation,

00:00:53.825 --> 00:00:58.865
this WP admin is Other1 WP Content.

00:00:58.865 --> 00:01:01.340
And WP includes.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.650
We also have several other files that are also part of the Wordpress environment.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.540
But forget about the now came,

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.750
since we'll be talking about them later in this course.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.880
The themes themselves are within this WP Content folder.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.100
And if you open up that folder,

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.785
we'll find another one called things.

00:01:21.785 --> 00:01:23.540
Inside WP Content.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.520
We also have the plugins folder,

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.985
but let's stick with the themes folder for now.

00:01:28.985 --> 00:01:30.965
If you open this folder up,

00:01:30.965 --> 00:01:36.095
we'll see that WordPress erratic comes with at least three things installed.

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:40.910
And they are always related to the year in which they are produced.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:47.810
The last one here would be the 2017 thing because I'm creating this course in 2017.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.915
Let's go ahead and open up this folder.

00:01:50.915 --> 00:01:54.965
Inside it, look, there is a new folder structure.

00:01:54.965 --> 00:01:58.415
Again, a folder for the CSS files.

00:01:58.415 --> 00:02:02.930
And this one here can be used for including our own functions.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.250
If you want to do that.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.680
A folder for files in JavaScript and other files here as well.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.780
And I think you may be wondering,

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.754
but Marcello, There are so many files in so many folders.

00:02:15.754 --> 00:02:18.470
Manager create all of these files and all

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.560
of these folders if I want to customer pressing.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.240
Well, not exactly.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.920
In fact, in theory,

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.115
we only need two files for a WordPress thing to work.

00:02:28.115 --> 00:02:31.580
Index.html and style.css.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.770
Just to be clear, since the beginning,

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.950
index.js PHP is the entry point of our fin.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.365
And style.css is responsible for telling WordPress What is the name of the theme,

00:02:42.365 --> 00:02:44.000
the alpha, the theme,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.965
and the description of the thing.

00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:48.920
And of course, we can use it to write CSS.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.345
But we'll see all that in detail in the next couple of lessons.

00:02:53.345 --> 00:02:57.275
Of course, if you create a theme with just these two files,

00:02:57.275 --> 00:02:58.970
it will be two minimal.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.590
And we don't want them.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.505
Let's imagine that you want the content of a contact page,

00:03:04.505 --> 00:03:08.285
which displays when you click on the Menu link corresponding to it.

00:03:08.285 --> 00:03:12.350
We went that page to be different from the content of a homepage.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.100
For example, if you're a FEM has only the index.html file.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.255
Your contact page will be identical to that homepage.

00:03:20.255 --> 00:03:22.850
Surely, that's not what we want, is it?

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:23.990
Of course not.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.720
That's why we have these other files here.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.440
Each one of them will specialize in a part of the WordPress site.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.395
For example, the single dot PHP file

00:03:33.395 --> 00:03:37.205
will help us create the single view of a single post.

00:03:37.205 --> 00:03:42.800
On the other hand, the page dot PHP file is used to display a static page,

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.305
which in this case is different from a post,

00:03:45.305 --> 00:03:47.915
which were breast understands as having,

00:03:47.915 --> 00:03:52.145
say, a more dynamic content than a static page.

00:03:52.145 --> 00:03:55.190
And there yet several other files that will get,

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.945
you know, during the course.

00:03:56.945 --> 00:04:01.295
Another important file is this one called screenshot dot PNG.

00:04:01.295 --> 00:04:04.130
This file is just the cropped image of

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.850
her thing and is used to represent it in the admin.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.275
So here in the admin,

00:04:09.275 --> 00:04:13.415
if you head over to Appearance and click on themes,

00:04:13.415 --> 00:04:17.045
we see that for everything there is an image.

00:04:17.045 --> 00:04:22.265
Those images come from a file called screenshot dot PNG.

00:04:22.265 --> 00:04:24.155
Okay, one more information.

00:04:24.155 --> 00:04:28.280
One interesting thing that you'll notice is that think files such

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.005
as index that page B already serve as steady materials jurors,

00:04:33.005 --> 00:04:36.425
you can better understand how a theme works if you just

00:04:36.425 --> 00:04:40.010
open them up and began reading their documentation.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.805
For example, here we have the index.html file,

00:04:43.805 --> 00:04:46.595
which is part of the 2017 thing.

00:04:46.595 --> 00:04:47.945
In the fire itself,

00:04:47.945 --> 00:04:50.795
you already have a description of what it is.

00:04:50.795 --> 00:04:55.280
As you see here, it says that is the main template file.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.670
It is one of the files required for you to create a thing.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:03.005
The other one being the style.css, as explained previously.

00:05:03.005 --> 00:05:05.795
For each of the native WordPress theme files,

00:05:05.795 --> 00:05:08.075
you have this kind of documentation.

00:05:08.075 --> 00:05:12.575
In fact, it's a good practice if you start creating your files this way,

00:05:12.575 --> 00:05:16.715
offering all of the documentation for your fin as you created.

00:05:16.715 --> 00:05:19.880
However, we will not do that in this course, okay?

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.145
It can do it by yourself if you want,

00:05:22.145 --> 00:05:26.615
since it is just about copying and pasting and modifying the information,

00:05:26.615 --> 00:05:28.955
let's go ahead and choose another file.

00:05:28.955 --> 00:05:31.550
For example, page dot PHP.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:37.190
Documentation here says that it is the template for displaying all pages.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.000
And the single dot PHP is the templates used to

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.290
display all the single posts with what happens when you visit,

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:49.070
for example, a post or a static WordPress page.

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:53.000
By the way, if you don't know yet what a static page is,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.560
a good example would be the default example page of your WordPress installation.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.740
Just go ahead and open it and you'll see what I mean.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.955
So what happens when we visit one of those contents is that

00:06:04.955 --> 00:06:09.695
a mechanism that we're pressed calls the theme hierarchy comes into action.

00:06:09.695 --> 00:06:11.660
To explain how this works,

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.970
I'm going to use this image here.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.905
So it explains very well in my view how this mechanism works.

00:06:18.905 --> 00:06:23.990
In addition, it also describes how the anatomy of a WordPress theme works.

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.280
This is, say, an anatomical model of our pressing.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.035
So look in this anatomical model and also hierarchical,

00:06:33.035 --> 00:06:36.830
the main part will always be the index.html file.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.895
As explained earlier, it is the main theme file.

00:06:40.895 --> 00:06:42.830
It will always be used.

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.265
To show the content of a patient situations where we don't need

00:06:46.265 --> 00:06:52.040
any specific template or when WordPress doesn't know which page templates to use.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.535
This file is what we call a fallback.

00:06:55.535 --> 00:06:58.925
Now, if at some point we need to display a page with

00:06:58.925 --> 00:07:04.805
a specific layout to the site visitor will no longer used index that PHP file.

00:07:04.805 --> 00:07:09.365
At that point, we need to go down a bit in the hierarchy

00:07:09.365 --> 00:07:14.135
and use another page template inside another file as given example.

00:07:14.135 --> 00:07:18.080
And that's one thing that happens all the time within WordPress.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.445
Suppose a visitor enters your site using a misspelled link.

00:07:22.445 --> 00:07:25.610
In these situations, most sites will display

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:29.345
a page known as a four or four page to the visitor.

00:07:29.345 --> 00:07:31.235
A classic error page.

00:07:31.235 --> 00:07:35.075
If your theme has a file called for all four dot PHP,

00:07:35.075 --> 00:07:38.420
you can create a totally different look for that file.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.015
But if you think doesn't have such file,

00:07:41.015 --> 00:07:43.595
WordPress will follow the themes hierarchy

00:07:43.595 --> 00:07:46.610
and display the contents of the index.html file.

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:48.140
Instead, I mean WordPress,

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:52.655
you'll be using the fallback file instead of a four or four dots PHP file.

00:07:52.655 --> 00:07:56.090
We can apply the same reasoning model to the other files.

00:07:56.090 --> 00:08:00.830
For example, the single dot PHP file is the file for viewing single posts.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:03.829
If our film has this file, highly recommended,

00:08:03.829 --> 00:08:07.280
of course, every time you click on a postLink,

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.720
you'll feel the page according to the design of the single dot PHP file,

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:16.520
following all the HTML tags and PHP functions within that file.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:21.095
So considering this image as the anatomical template of a WordPress thing,

00:08:21.095 --> 00:08:24.185
you could say that these files about which I just

00:08:24.185 --> 00:08:27.455
spoke are here in the middle part of the page.

00:08:27.455 --> 00:08:31.235
They will be part of what we call the WordPress looked.

00:08:31.235 --> 00:08:35.045
And each template file has its own loop inside it.

00:08:35.045 --> 00:08:38.510
But we'll be explaining it better in other videos.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:40.925
Okay, in addition to the loop region,

00:08:40.925 --> 00:08:44.074
which is here in the middle of the page in this example.

00:08:44.074 --> 00:08:48.680
But it can move in any other area of the site according to your design,

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:53.795
we have two things that repeat on all pages and are generated by two files.

00:08:53.795 --> 00:08:59.090
Up here, the content coming from the header.html file and here below,

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:01.985
and other content from footer.html file.

00:09:01.985 --> 00:09:05.825
Optionally, you can also have a sidebar.

00:09:05.825 --> 00:09:07.685
We talk about that literature,

00:09:07.685 --> 00:09:11.045
and that's what makes the WordPress theme beautiful.

00:09:11.045 --> 00:09:14.900
You can even create a theme using only index.html and

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:20.540
style.css with WordPress gives you all the tools to make a very dynamic thing.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:25.775
We can see all this in action in the layout will be creating in this course.

00:09:25.775 --> 00:09:31.955
So here from the top where we see this little red bar up to the menu,

00:09:31.955 --> 00:09:34.085
we'll have our header.

00:09:34.085 --> 00:09:39.365
The contents of this whole area is coming from the heterodox PHP file, okay?

00:09:39.365 --> 00:09:44.480
The dynamic part in which we have the template files and they're loops will

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:49.715
extend from this slide here to this map.

00:09:49.715 --> 00:09:54.154
So we're going to include all of the dynamic contents of the website.

00:09:54.154 --> 00:09:58.490
The contents that is not a static in this big area here.

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:00.125
And she completely design.

00:10:00.125 --> 00:10:02.300
You'll have our footer at the end,

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:06.125
coming from a template part called footer.html.

00:10:06.125 --> 00:10:10.100
Also, for some pages will also have a sidebar.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.050
In our case, for the homepage,

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:16.370
the sidebar we'll be placed on the left side, but not now.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:19.370
We'll start seeing all this in our next lesson.

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:19.940
Okay?

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.520
There'll be room for a lot of practicing.

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:27.120
So until then, and I catch you guys on my next video.
