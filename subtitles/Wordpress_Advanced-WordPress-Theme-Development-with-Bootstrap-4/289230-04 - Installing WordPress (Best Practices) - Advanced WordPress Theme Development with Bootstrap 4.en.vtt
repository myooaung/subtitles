00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
Hello guys.

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.160
In this lesson, you're gonna learn how to install Wordpress.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.875
Unfortunately, information available on the internet is not always accurate.

00:00:10.875 --> 00:00:15.090
For example, not all tutorials explained best practices for

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.995
installing WordPress on both your local server and a live server.

00:00:19.995 --> 00:00:22.980
So in this lesson, I'm going to make a point of explaining

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.055
what in my opinion are those best practices.

00:00:26.055 --> 00:00:27.735
So let's get started.

00:00:27.735 --> 00:00:30.120
So the first thing we're gonna do is visit

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.480
the WordPress website and wishes at WordPress.org.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.810
Let's go ahead and click Download WordPress.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.820
Click this little button here,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.800
and save the file.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.405
Okay, this course we start with WordPress 4.8.2,

00:00:50.405 --> 00:00:54.770
but you see you will be using newer versions as we move along the lessons.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.275
Since WordPress is always releasing updates,

00:00:57.275 --> 00:01:00.575
you can of course download and use the newest ones.

00:01:00.575 --> 00:01:03.500
As I tried to keep this course always updated.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.840
I'll be including notes and new videos whenever I see there's some important update.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.685
So let's go ahead and open up

00:01:10.685 --> 00:01:16.160
our file explorer and look for the file with just downloaded,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.400
right-click, copy this file,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.340
and paste it on my local server folder.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:29.220
In my case, this border is here on My Documents folder and it's called 80 dogs.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.620
If you're interested, but you don't know how to change the Sam's age docs directory.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.635
Don't forget to watch the previous lecture again.

00:01:39.635 --> 00:01:45.290
By the way, let's check if both the Apache and the MySQL servers are running.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.350
Otherwise it will be impossible to install WordPress.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:55.710
So to do that, I'll just open my Sam's Control Panel manager OS ten.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.340
On Windows.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.555
If you're using Windows,

00:01:59.555 --> 00:02:05.195
you can click on this icon on the system tray and you open up them.

00:02:05.195 --> 00:02:08.255
Here on my Mac, I'll head over to this tab,

00:02:08.255 --> 00:02:12.695
manage servers, and start all servers at once.

00:02:12.695 --> 00:02:15.950
Now what I'm gonna do is how you uncompress

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.055
this file inside a folder I'll be creating now,

00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:20.630
the name of this folder,

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.075
you'll be WP, alright?

00:02:23.075 --> 00:02:26.735
But of course, you don't need to use the same name as mine.

00:02:26.735 --> 00:02:27.305
Okay?

00:02:27.305 --> 00:02:30.005
Now we need to pace the compressed file here,

00:02:30.005 --> 00:02:33.920
the zipped file, and uncompress it right here.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.395
When it's finished, we will eventually come up with a folder called WordPress, okay?

00:02:39.395 --> 00:02:42.440
But that's not what we want since I

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.545
don't want to install WordPress inside this folder here.

00:02:45.545 --> 00:02:48.140
So what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna delete

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.845
this zip file here because I don't need it anymore.

00:02:51.845 --> 00:02:54.770
Jumping to my WordPress folder,

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.060
select everything, copy the files,

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.170
and let's move everything.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.545
Paste them here at the root of this WP folder.

00:03:05.545 --> 00:03:09.115
Now I can also get rid of this WordPress folder here,

00:03:09.115 --> 00:03:11.695
since I don't need it anymore as well,

00:03:11.695 --> 00:03:13.855
and it's of course empty now.

00:03:13.855 --> 00:03:15.295
So boys and girls,

00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:17.875
this is the default installation of WordPress.

00:03:17.875 --> 00:03:19.885
And these are the installation files.

00:03:19.885 --> 00:03:21.055
Quite simple.

00:03:21.055 --> 00:03:24.700
Okay, now we have all the installation files.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.155
What do you need to do?

00:03:26.155 --> 00:03:32.020
Well, the first of the things I need after downloading installation files is a database.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.300
So let's go ahead and access our PHP.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.675
My admin, just type in localhost,

00:03:37.675 --> 00:03:41.090
forward slash PHP. My admin.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.820
Here on PHP my admin help just click on

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:52.025
this tab databases and choose a name for my database here,

00:03:52.025 --> 00:03:57.965
the name of it will be WP, underscore learn.

00:03:57.965 --> 00:03:59.419
Wp.

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:03.840
Just the hand, the collation used for WordPress databases,

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.590
UTF-8 em before underscore, Unicode, underscore CI.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.745
Okay? In case you need to select a collation before creating the database,

00:04:13.745 --> 00:04:15.845
just choose this one, right?

00:04:15.845 --> 00:04:18.695
Go ahead and click here to create it.

00:04:18.695 --> 00:04:22.280
And you notice that the new database is now showing

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.195
here on the sidebar and it's ready for me to use it.

00:04:26.195 --> 00:04:31.640
Now I'm going to open a new tab on my web browser and I can tap the following.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.645
Logo host, o slash WP.

00:04:35.645 --> 00:04:38.120
Remember that WP is the name of

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.840
that folder that contains all the WordPress installation files.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.570
Just hit Enter and you see the first page of your WordPress installation.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.195
You see this welcome message.

00:04:50.195 --> 00:04:51.755
But before we move on,

00:04:51.755 --> 00:04:55.070
you need to know in advance the value for the fluids below,

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.200
which are the database name.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.365
The database username, which in our case is root.

00:05:03.365 --> 00:05:05.525
Default is root ok.

00:05:05.525 --> 00:05:09.305
Its password, which is empty by default,

00:05:09.305 --> 00:05:12.170
the host name, which is local host,

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.165
and the database prefix.

00:05:14.165 --> 00:05:17.210
This little detail of the database prefix is what

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.435
many tutorials over there won't teach you.

00:05:20.435 --> 00:05:22.265
What do you mean herself?

00:05:22.265 --> 00:05:26.570
I mean, we need to change this prefix when we install WordPress.

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:32.600
That's crucial in my opinion because it's no use having a site BWT with WordPress,

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.505
no matter how securities,

00:05:34.505 --> 00:05:36.200
if you don't do your part.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.450
Ok, then our first task will be changed the prefix for the WordPress tables.

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.130
So let's do it now.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:44.315
Go ahead and click.

00:05:44.315 --> 00:05:45.810
Let's go.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.195
So first name of the database.

00:05:49.195 --> 00:05:52.870
As you know, the database user is rude,

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.000
the password is empty.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.745
And since we are using a local server,

00:05:57.745 --> 00:06:00.820
the name of the database server is local host.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.860
If you are on a live server,

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.470
check this information with your hosting company.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.595
Because generally, when you sign up for shared hosting services,

00:06:09.595 --> 00:06:12.370
that info is our essentially our email.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:15.130
And now we're gonna change the database prefix,

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.860
which is very important in terms of security.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.345
Has I told you earlier?

00:06:19.345 --> 00:06:22.000
But then you might be asking yourself,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.995
why is that so impersonal?

00:06:23.995 --> 00:06:24.955
Explain.

00:06:24.955 --> 00:06:28.515
By default, WordPress comes with this prefix here.

00:06:28.515 --> 00:06:34.865
Wp. But everyone knows that the default WordPress prefix is WP.

00:06:34.865 --> 00:06:36.725
Even the hackers know there.

00:06:36.725 --> 00:06:39.694
So if you keep the prefix as WP,

00:06:39.694 --> 00:06:42.694
you lend a hand to invaders.

00:06:42.694 --> 00:06:46.910
Changing the database prefix is also a good idea if you want

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.215
to run multiple WordPress installations using only one database.

00:06:51.215 --> 00:06:52.895
So let's change it here.

00:06:52.895 --> 00:06:55.160
Now it's not WP anymore.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.680
Let's call it WPC are AES,

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.790
for example, which is a lot better than just WP.

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:02.570
You can choose.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:04.580
Of course, whatever prefix you want.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.145
It doesn't have to be the same as mine.

00:07:07.145 --> 00:07:13.230
Okay, click on submit, round Install.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.740
Now let's move for the final part of the installation process.

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.024
I'll go ahead and type in the name of our website.

00:07:22.024 --> 00:07:25.535
It will be, for example, learn WP.

00:07:25.535 --> 00:07:31.430
Here under username, I recommend that you don't use names such as admin,

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:34.370
WP, test, et cetera.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:37.310
You can choose your own name or

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:41.195
any other strong username on that you can remember easily.

00:07:41.195 --> 00:07:43.730
For example, I'll choose my name.

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:47.930
But again, you can use whatever name you want, okay?

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:50.360
For the password, I recommend that you accept

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.540
this password here or choose a very strong the passwords,

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:57.815
especially in the case you are installing WordPress on a remote web server,

00:07:57.815 --> 00:08:00.800
a live web server for security reasons,

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.615
of course, in my case,

00:08:02.615 --> 00:08:04.550
as I am in a local server,

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:09.935
we'll just type in 1234567 to make things easier,

00:08:09.935 --> 00:08:13.189
even because it will be just a local installation.

00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:18.830
But be aware that when you work in a production environment in your life server,

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:21.455
you're always changed the admin password.

00:08:21.455 --> 00:08:24.590
Don't use 1234567. Okay?

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:28.145
This is only to make my work easier during the course.

00:08:28.145 --> 00:08:31.550
And as I am choosing a very weak password WordPress,

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:36.680
you asked me to confirm the use of a weak password, my e-mail.

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:41.525
And I can click here to prevent search engines from indexing the side.

00:08:41.525 --> 00:08:44.090
So I don't want search engines like Google,

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:46.955
for example, to index that site right now.

00:08:46.955 --> 00:08:49.805
You can always change that later if you want.

00:08:49.805 --> 00:08:53.104
Finally, just click on install WordPress.

00:08:53.104 --> 00:08:55.415
And we should be good to go.

00:08:55.415 --> 00:08:56.645
And here we are.

00:08:56.645 --> 00:08:58.505
Wordpress is just installed.

00:08:58.505 --> 00:09:01.190
If I click here on login,

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:04.980
enter my username and my password,

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.765
I would jump into the WordPress dashboard.

00:09:11.765 --> 00:09:15.695
By default, you'll see that under Appearance,

00:09:15.695 --> 00:09:19.700
Themes, press ships with a couple of native themes.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:24.410
The name of them is always related to the year the theme was created.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:27.980
What we're going to learn in this course is to stop depending on

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:32.060
this native WordPress themes or any other ready-made thing.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.710
You'll be learning how to create

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:37.400
your own theme and be able to customize it throughout the course.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.585
Why do you think of it?

00:09:38.585 --> 00:09:42.110
So that's what I had to explain to you in this lesson.

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:45.050
I'll be back in the next one and we'll begin to

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:48.619
understand how WordPress thing works on the inside.

00:09:48.619 --> 00:09:50.510
So I see you in the next lesson.

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:52.440
Until then guys.
