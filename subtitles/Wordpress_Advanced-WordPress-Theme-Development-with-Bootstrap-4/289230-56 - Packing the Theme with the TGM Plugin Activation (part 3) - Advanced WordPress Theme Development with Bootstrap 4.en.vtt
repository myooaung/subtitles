00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.140
everyone,

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:06.250
we're back to the last lesson about the T G M plugging activation.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:07.660
In this lesson,

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.700
you're going to test out The changes were made in the last two lessons.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.660
Let's see if the library actually works as expected.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.780
You know this.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:17.860
Just ask this out.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.950
We need a new installation of WordPress ready for I.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.120
Well,

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.650
the fact is that we need to simulate a very specific scenario.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.140
We need to make believe a user.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.010
A customer,

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.830
for example,

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.210
is installing our thing in a brand new WORDPRESS website.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.550
It cannot do this in the installation we're working on,

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.650
since it's already news with all the plug,

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:42.370
insist out.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.750
And on top of that,

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.590
the theme is reading stalled and activated.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.660
So that's why you need a brand new instance of WordPress.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.510
So for this lesson,

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.350
I have installed WordPress in a new folder.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.120
It's not a big deal.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.390
Just the name installation of WordPress that installed in a new folder called Test.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.050
Another thing I did was to zip my thing folder.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.220
To do that,

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.510
I just entered that.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.050
Will you be content themes and added learned WP folder.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.150
Just zip file.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.760
It is all you need to do.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.950
Okay,

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.040
I'm logged in now.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.330
Owned a new website,

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.750
and I'm going to start the theme here.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.390
I'll go ahead and head over to appearance things,

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.200
and I upload the compressed theme file.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:46.700
Okay,

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.570
The theme was successfully installed.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.100
Now I can click here and activated and watch what happens when I do this.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.260
Look,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.330
it is now I have this warning showing here on the screen Any saying that we have a list off

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.480
plug ins that required installation,

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.290
which are,

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.810
in fact,

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.600
those blood things we have included in the Fijian plugging activation fire.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.150
Remember,

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:16.410
I'm gonna click here on begin installing planning and the DJ am plugging activation engine

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.410
.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.450
You show me a table with all the play things that are necessary to the theme,

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.030
and I can check all the items in the table at once and do a batch install.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.350
That's what I'm going to do now.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:43.310
Now I can return to the blogging list and also activate them all at once.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.850
So let's go ahead and activate them here.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.160
Okay?

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.620
Ready?

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.110
Now the table is empty and you no longer have any plug.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.850
Instance Stall.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:05.810
I can click here and go back to the dashboard and you notice now that we have the menu

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.350
links for all the planets we need in the theme.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.680
Of course,

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:17.700
if you look at the front and now you see that it still seems quieting,

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.280
complete.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.250
Listen to me now.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.920
It's your task as a thing developer to write all the documentation and teach your user how

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.310
to play with your fame.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.580
You need to teach the user to abdomen use to set the themes home page.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.960
And,

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:34.510
of course,

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.460
just set the necessary plug ins to make your finger work.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.350
What leads provide the user with some source of information about it,

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.200
something developers prefer to offer.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.330
This documentation,

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.850
as video tutorials are,

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.320
the developers use other options,

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.420
like the get book,

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.250
for example.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:03.610
You see also that some placements allow you to export that I saved in the database to XML

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.250
files.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.410
If it's the case of your plugging,

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.410
it can offer an XML file with the initial settings of the plugging along with your fame

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.050
files.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.220
Well,

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.050
that's what we have for this lesson.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.040
I hope you have enjoyed it,

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.880
and I hope you feel like you learned something new during this lessons,

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.450
and you can use this new knowledge in your next projects.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.870
So see him the next lesson.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.050
Happy coding
