00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Hello,

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:01.570
guys.

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:02.880
In the last lesson,

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.720
we started learning how to create our first WordPress loop.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.350
We learned what a look ISS and what are the advantages of using it within WordPress scenes

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:13.350
?

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.390
The WordPress loop was responsible for creating this section here,

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.350
which shows one of their posts.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.620
And actually,

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.690
this is a beach and also this post link on the blood beach.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.100
In this lesson,

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.340
you're gonna learn how to make some pages look different since not all of the pages on the

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.480
side will be created equal.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.470
So just a quick recap.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.690
In the last lesson,

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.600
we had a problem yet to be solved on a visit the home page,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.370
for example.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.660
We see that it brings to us ecstatic base showing empty categories.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:54.050
The same thing happens on the about us page and on the contact page.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.550
But we want things to look different.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.460
The home page is gonna be very different from the other pages,

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.450
is gonna have a sideburn and new section services is like a map.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.190
On the other hand,

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.470
the about us page it's not gonna have any of them.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.520
There will be no sidebar,

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.930
no slide,

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.050
no man.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.810
But how they're going to do that?

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.660
Well,

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.050
we have to bring to you a new concept called template pages.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.370
There are two ways we can create such thank plate pages.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.860
One of them is creating new PHP files with the name of our bases in it.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:33.700
For example,

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.050
if I want to create a specific base just to load the about US page so that it looks totally

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.690
different from the other pages,

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.450
I will have to create a specific file just for the about us page.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:51.450
The same goes for the contact page and for our home page as I'm going to show you now.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.210
Home Page is showing content created in the administration,

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.940
coming from a static page called home,

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.190
but it must be different.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.650
Let's go over to our sublime text,

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.750
and we want to create inside thing folder and you file Let's save it.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.630
And here is the magic.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:22.200
The name of this file needs to be page hyphen and this leg off the base sewage this fire

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.890
first year.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.450
If you're wondering where you can find that slug,

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:34.590
I'm going to show you right now so you can find it when you added the page right here The

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.830
only exception is the pace Satchel be the home page.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.000
You can see it's like here,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.350
but this leg is home.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.030
So for the home page,

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.470
this name is gonna be beige hyphen home dot PHP.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.550
If it were for the about us page,

00:02:52.550 --> 00:03:03.080
it will be page hyphen about hyphen as that ph b things about hyphen us is this.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.550
Look for the about us page.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.900
What we want to be shown on this home page.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.580
Well,

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.730
to make this faster,

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.150
let's copy the contents of the index dot PHP file.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.780
The new file was still have a culture to get head of function,

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.830
the get food function and in tomato,

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.250
a dynamic area.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.120
Let's go ahead selecting copy everything a space,

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.360
everything here and just for you to notice the difference,

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:44.170
you're going to delete that loop and create a paragraph in its place that's safe and reload

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.880
the page.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.640
Look,

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.940
see that the space is surrounded different from the others.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:01.250
This is the page we created using a specific file called beige hyphen home dot PHP.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:08.150
This pace we'll have a logo services cyber Matt copyright.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.770
The way is to find in our initial layouts,

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.150
remember But what about the about a speech?

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.960
What can you do to create it?

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.240
We can use the same strategy.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.910
I just start that is creating a file with the page name in it.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:29.050
This name would be Beijing hyphen about hyphen us that PHP flushed greatest file.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:37.600
Let's copy the same content from the index that PHP file,

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.550
and she'll make the space look different.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.550
We want to delete the DIF tags in sections we don't want on this page.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.550
I still eat this content.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:57.010
Now.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.750
When you refresh the page,

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.350
you see that it would be totally different.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.770
Now the about us page as fellas,

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.360
the home and blocked pages are different.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.880
Another way to the same thing.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.650
We just did desecrate a template page file.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.820
The difference between creating a template file and the file with the page name,

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:19.480
for example,

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.030
Beige,

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.760
about us based home.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:29.020
It's such a is that template pages can be reused as often as we want for whatever pages we

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.460
want.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.020
For example,

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.320
I could create a page stay in place that could serve at the same time for both the about US

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.650
page and for the contact page.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.500
In doing so these two pages would have an identical structure.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.450
I'm not saying that the content will be the same.

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:52.510
Many people struggle leader to understand that the content want to be the same.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.690
But the positioning of the elements,

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:55.410
for example,

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:56.750
will be the same.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.070
For example,

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.080
if a page has a left cyber,

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.400
the other page will also have a left cyber.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.650
But the content off those sidebars can be totally different.

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.800
You see a concrete example of this,

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.480
but in the next lesson,

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.030
for now,

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.280
as an exercise,

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.620
you can go ahead and try to create a PHP template page for the conflict page.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.380
Do you think you can do that?

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.600
I think so.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.110
Think of this only as an exercise,

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.600
Okay,

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:31.060
since we'll be adopting another strategy to create both the contact and the about us page

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.450
in our next lesson.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.050
So once you then happy coding
