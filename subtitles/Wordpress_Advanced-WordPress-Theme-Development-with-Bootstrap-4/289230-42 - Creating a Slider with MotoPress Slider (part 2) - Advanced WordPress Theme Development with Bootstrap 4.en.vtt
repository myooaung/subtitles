00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.920
Hello,

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:01.470
guys.

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:02.740
In the last lesson,

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.530
we began configuring our first slider,

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.780
which will be included on the home page of her thing.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.450
In this lesson,

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.590
you'll be picking up where we left off.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.050
Let's start by setting off the items in the slider.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.480
Now that you have all slider setting saved,

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:28.930
we can go ahead and click here on this added template bottom or,

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:29.840
if you are owned,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.040
plug ins home page.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.360
Click on the name of this lighter or on the entertained plate bottom.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.050
Feel free to choose what's best You.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.740
The screen will be slightly different,

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.310
depending on the type of slider chosen.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.780
Since we choose a post lighter,

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.650
we don't have some items we would have for a customs lighter.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.190
The basic difference is that when we added the post liner,

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.030
you're editing a slice template.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.720
On the other hand,

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.640
if we had a custom slider,

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.580
we could add it each slide individually.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.950
I believe that explaining the difference now might confuse you a little,

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.100
so let's follow the explanation without getting out of focus for now.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.960
And I propose that later on,

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.090
you go ahead and created customs lighter as an exercise to see the difference.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.550
Okay,

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.130
so let's go here in the stain plate.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.560
One of the most important things to choose is what will appear at the bottom of each slide

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.560
.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.100
We can have a color or a Grady int of colors for the background.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.630
But to be honest,

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.430
I don't see much sense in this because what really prevails is what to choose Here.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.150
Under this image option,

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.090
we can choose the featured image of the post being displayed or an item from our media

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:56.840
library or an external link and out of image or the first image found in the post notice.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.480
For example,

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.480
if I choose an image from the library,

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.810
this image will appear at the bottom off all posts.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.650
It will always be repeated.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.290
Since I want the image to never be the same.

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.140
I'm gonna choose the featured image of each post.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.150
Notice that as each posts as a different featured image,

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.850
those images are not displayed here below and here I can set it positioning for this image

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.850
.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.950
I can also choose a video which will be running in the background.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.730
Okay.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.250
And what are these items here in the preview area?

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.310
Well,

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.750
this items refer to text feuds with values that come directly from each post.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.980
We can add several of these elements inside slide in the same way that we can insert

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:47.830
buttons,

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.970
images and videos as we're using a beauty in post Lighter.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.420
Previously imported.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.250
We already have this two feuds here,

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.610
one that shows the both Steidl and another that shows the boast exert.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.570
We can add one more below to show,

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:07.260
For example,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.800
the post publication date.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.110
Let's click here in ads.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.650
Text.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.050
This one here are here.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.960
Hearing content.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.050
Have to define which element of the post this sighting refers to.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.450
Let's delete this tax here,

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.820
Ang.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.050
Click here where it says Insert Micro's.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.800
We scroll down a little and she we find the publish date.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.370
Now I can click and drag this item just below the excerpt.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.460
In my experience,

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.910
even with this blue lines that serve as a guide,

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.390
this text that we have just the land will not be.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.720
Position it correctly to get the correct alignment.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.090
Click here on position and size a line.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.500
It's on the top left,

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.550
and now we can drag it down.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:10.770
You can also enter values for the X and Y axes manually.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:11.570
For example,

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.250
let's increase the Y Axis value to 420.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.950
We can type the value directly,

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.750
or use the keyboard navigation Arabs by moving the items up and down.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.350
Let's do the same for the other two elements.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.940
What a title.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.250
Let's set the why access to 150.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.130
We can also change the phone size here on style.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.450
Let's set it to 40 pieces.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.750
Align it to the right.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.030
And for the excerpt,

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:54.670
the Y axis is gonna be 250 and phone size 20 pixels.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.800
Okay,

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.710
I guess with that,

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.580
you can already have self into show in the slider.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.000
I saved the template,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.950
and it's finally see Howard Slideshow is displaying.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.870
We're gonna click here on clothes and now,

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.890
to show this ladder on the screen,

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.450
have two options.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.830
If you are adding the slider directly to a WordPress post or page,

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.550
we simply copy the short code and paste it into the content.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:23.930
In our case,

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.480
we need to insert slider not in a post,

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.250
but in a PHP file.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:29.710
Another to do that,

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.750
we need the second structure here.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.400
Let's go up yet and open the page home that PHP file.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.960
Let's replace this content here with the cold,

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:40.780
which is copied.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.320
And of course,

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.590
we have to change the name of the alliance.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.080
In our case,

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:51.070
let's go back here toward press and this is our allies.

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.790
Okay,

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:55.850
I was safe.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.350
And let's see what you got on the theme home page.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:06.000
Great.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.450
Almost perfect.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:10.250
I have here the both featured image,

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.050
the title,

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.430
the excerpt and also the publication date.

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.750
Let this light show bring the second item.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.730
Well,

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.220
here we have the same thing.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.420
The featured image in the background,

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:27.520
the title,

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.250
the excerpt and the publication date.

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:37.360
Notice that up here we have this white space above and below the slider.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.460
This is coming from the HTML section we created in the beginning of the course.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.670
So when that you added that in our CSS file,

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:51.650
let's open up the file there and let's find out where the problem is.

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:55.550
So it's here.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.300
We have this patting,

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.150
which we don't need,

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.210
so just comment on it,

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:02.350
and we're good to go.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:16.890
Another problem we have here is that the publication that is almost invisible we'll have to

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:19.150
fix this with CSS is felt.

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.450
But let's do it to the plug in itself.

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:26.450
Let's go back to WordPress added template.

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:31.270
You selected element.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:34.580
Now here in style.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:40.000
I'm going to create a CSS class to style this element in the pro version office plugging.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.440
We can do this more easily,

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.830
but in the free version,

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.030
we are limited to using CSS.

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:49.730
But with just a few custom is ations.

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.080
We already reach very nice effect.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:57.350
I saved the template and click on slider settings.

00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:00.270
You're under appearance.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:06.000
You remember that there was a text area in which you can write some CSS code.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.190
Let's take the class we just created and style it like this.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:18.550
Let's save and see how it's now.

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:24.970
Well,

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:26.270
you got a lot better.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:27.930
It's more visible,

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:36.020
and it's much like our original layoff before finishing this lesson to tips the 1st 1 in

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.840
the same way that we can style the publication date,

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.200
we can also style any other element off the slider.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.120
Just add a CSS Class M type,

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.210
the desired cold and elastic.

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:53.110
You can also play around with the animation controls for each element of this lighter.

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:57.350
Just use the element and click here in animation.

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:58.460
We can,

00:08:58.460 --> 00:08:59.260
for example,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:00.960
apply a delay to the element.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.490
Hide it.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:09.000
And with that we can have an effect similar to layers lighter the same way we have in plug

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:09.520
ins life,

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.020
the revolutions lighter.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:14.650
But the difference is that this plugging it's free.

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:15.900
Well,

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:22.030
I hope you enjoy this Lessons on back in the next one and the continued install a few more

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:25.840
plug ins in our thing and you then by
