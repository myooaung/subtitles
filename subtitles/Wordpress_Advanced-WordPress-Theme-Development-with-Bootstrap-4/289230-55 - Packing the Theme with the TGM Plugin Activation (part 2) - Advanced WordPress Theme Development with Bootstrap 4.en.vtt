00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
Hi there. What's going on?

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.225
Continuing our lesson on the Tg and plug-in activation.

00:00:06.225 --> 00:00:09.930
In this lesson, we're going to finish out the library configuration and learn

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.145
how to request the installation of plug-ins that we are using in our theme.

00:00:14.145 --> 00:00:16.050
So continuing where we left off,

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.880
let's go back to the required plug-ins dot PHP file and less clean up the file up.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.480
It has carried off this bunch of comments

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.965
and harder snippets of code that don't interest at the moment.

00:00:28.965 --> 00:00:30.675
But if you take a close look,

00:00:30.675 --> 00:00:33.675
in fact, this whole code is very interesting.

00:00:33.675 --> 00:00:40.355
The amount of code here also shows that there are several usage scenarios for the TCM.

00:00:40.355 --> 00:00:43.220
But if he focus on explaining everything here,

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.170
we will never reach our goal.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.765
So let's just stick with the essential.

00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:52.460
If you wish, you can go ahead and download the file and study it more carefully.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.040
Okay, what interests us here is inside

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.790
this function that ends with register required plug-ins.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.130
Within this variable called plugins,

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.750
we have this main array and other arrays inside this main one.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.350
This version of the library brings five arrays.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.810
Each one of them is for a given usage.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.150
And we have a usage example for when we have plugins bundled with the theme.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.120
I mean, when we want to include the plugging files

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.435
within your theme and many other examples.

00:01:23.435 --> 00:01:26.990
We're going to use this for fixed simple here because we want

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.575
to include a plugin from the WordPress plug-in repository.

00:01:30.575 --> 00:01:34.160
So here we are going to point out which plug-ins will be marked

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.270
as required after the user downloads inactivates our theme.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.540
So here it includes a usage example.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.750
We have here an example when you're theme uses the body

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.215
Press plugin and having these as an example,

00:01:48.215 --> 00:01:51.215
we can go ahead and create our own examples.

00:01:51.215 --> 00:01:55.280
First, let's remove all the usage examples we don't need.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.915
There's too much code here,

00:01:56.915 --> 00:01:59.165
and we don't need all of these here.

00:01:59.165 --> 00:02:02.180
What we need to specify are just three things.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.020
The first one is the name of the plugin, then it's slug.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.140
And finally, if the installation of this plugin will be

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.334
required or not after our theme is activated.

00:02:12.334 --> 00:02:14.870
If this last value is set to false,

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.815
to plug-in will appear only as recommended, not required.

00:02:18.815 --> 00:02:22.085
So let's start off with our social media plugging.

00:02:22.085 --> 00:02:25.220
Well, the first complicated question to answer is,

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.220
how do I find out is log of which plugging?

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.760
In fact, that's very easy to set this field.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.135
We head over to the dashboard, to the adenine.

00:02:35.135 --> 00:02:39.095
Click on plugins, installed plug-ins.

00:02:39.095 --> 00:02:42.560
Let's find out our social media plug-in.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.155
We click on details.

00:02:45.155 --> 00:02:47.870
And here in this window we have the link to

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.350
the plugin page in WordPress.org. Let's open it.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.550
Ok.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.195
Now, all you have to do is copy the last section of the URL,

00:02:59.195 --> 00:03:01.730
which corresponds to this leg of the plugging.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:08.315
All right, so let's start setting up our fields name.

00:03:08.315 --> 00:03:12.290
So show icons, widget,

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:20.730
and block by WP, zoom, slog.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.220
And as the thin cannot work without this plugin,

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.250
I'm gonna make it require true.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:34.160
But notice that if your intention is to submit the theme to Wordpress.org,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.145
no plugging candy marked as required.

00:03:37.145 --> 00:03:40.805
It is against the rules of WordPress.org.

00:03:40.805 --> 00:03:44.045
But if this is not your intention, don't worry about it.

00:03:44.045 --> 00:03:45.875
Now to include the next plugin,

00:03:45.875 --> 00:03:50.735
we're going to copy this entire array and we're gonna repeat process.

00:03:50.735 --> 00:03:53.540
The next one will be the slider plugging.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:00.110
Let's go to the Plugins page. I close this.

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.000
Let me copy the plugin's name.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.750
Now back to the admin.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.970
I'm going to click on View Details.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.770
Copy the last section of the rail.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.665
And this one will also be required.

00:04:27.665 --> 00:04:30.245
Now to the contact form seven plugin.

00:04:30.245 --> 00:04:32.670
Let's do the same.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.690
I'll just set the plugin's name here.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.720
And I'll go ahead and get the slugging.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.345
Okay, you ready?

00:04:56.345 --> 00:04:59.420
And now the less plugging the responsive menu,

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.160
I'm going to just repeat the same process.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.990
And there is, let's save this here and you're good to go.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.790
We just have to test it out.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:23.405
Now.

00:05:23.405 --> 00:05:28.980
What we're going to do that in the next lesson. See you there.
