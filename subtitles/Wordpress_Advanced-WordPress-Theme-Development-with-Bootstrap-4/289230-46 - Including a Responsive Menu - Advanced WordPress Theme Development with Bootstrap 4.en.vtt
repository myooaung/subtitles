00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.230
Hello,

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:01.770
guys.

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.530
Welcome to one more lesson in this section.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:05.660
Actually,

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.730
this is gonna be the last lesson.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.410
And today we're gonna install a plug in that will help us display a responsive menu on the

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:13.850
screen.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.520
Ever since the beginning of the scores,

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.590
we have already done a really cool job using bootstrap to make our side as responsive as

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.240
possible.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.240
However,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.250
one thing that it's still not working is the menu.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:34.410
If we enabled the browser element inspector on a Mac common option I on a PC control shift

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:42.130
I or the F 12 bottle You see that when it gets to very small screen resolutions are menu

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.300
starts to get weird.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.350
There will come a time when it will be totally broken,

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.850
but they don't want this to happen.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.170
To solve that,

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.990
we're going to stall a very simple,

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.180
very lightweight plugging called that.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.090
Will you be responsive menu?

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.570
It's very uses to set up,

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.380
and I always use it in my projects and you see why?

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.750
So let's look for this plugging.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:15.610
Install it and activated.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.260
Once installed,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.250
we have a new item here in the dashboard menu.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:36.450
Let's click here on WP our menu so here we get six steps.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.970
The new version of this plugging brings a lot of new functionalities.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.530
Many of them are bringing futures,

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.890
even though this is still a very good plugging.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.650
Be concentrating on these two first steps general and appearance.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.410
So under general,

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.750
one of the first options here is what menu we want to use as a responsive menu.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.550
Remember,

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:02.830
we have two menus,

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.450
one at the top of the page and one at the bottom.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.050
Let's juice here the top menu.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.200
The next setting is very important when it should specify here what HTML element is gonna

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.880
be hitting as soon as the response of menu appears on the screen.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.350
Generally,

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.950
we type here the menu class that we want to become responsive.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.840
To figure this out,

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.300
we have *** back to code for the menu.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.780
Let's go back to the theme and let's find out what is the CSS class off the main menu.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.080
Look here,

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.950
he found out.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:48.750
Skopje this class main menu and paste it here.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.890
Nice tape dot Before,

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.050
since it's a CSS class name,

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.050
search input within menu,

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.730
you can choose whether or not to display a search box in the menu Anglo.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.220
Which text will appear inside that box?

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.010
There are many other options here.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.880
For example,

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.940
you can choose a logo to be displayed in the menu enabled the swipe effect and a couple of

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.920
other options you can treat later if you want.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.160
OK now under appearance.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.190
There are also a lot of options.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.250
You can later own change if you want.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.310
Let's concentrate here on the main options.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.200
You can just hear the menu I can position and direction.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.600
Also the kind of animation the menu you have.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.950
We want change anything for now,

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.650
but the most important option is the next one.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:43.480
Here.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.860
We need to define the width in pixels below,

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.140
which are responsive.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.250
Menu will become visible.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.000
Let's add it to 767 picks us.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.020
That is,

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.330
when the screen resolution is less than R equals to 767.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:00.940
Pixels are responsive.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.230
Menu will appear and the regular menu that is not responsive.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:11.490
The simply disappear below got a bunch of other options related to the style of which menu

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.750
item and also supermen news.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:20.860
We're gonna go ahead and accept suggestions and also accepted callers suggested by the

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:21.350
plugging,

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.500
Let's save the changes.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.800
And after we save,

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.930
you can see a life review on the right side of the page.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.450
This is very helpful.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.390
Anyway,

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.230
Let's jump to our thing because we need to see how it's behaving on different screen

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.150
resolutions.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.150
Let's refresh page,

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:52.740
and I watch slowly going down the resolution that is here,

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.580
that we can see the size of the current resolution in pixels.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.610
Remember when we reached 767 pixels?

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.220
I Responsive menu.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.350
You have to appear.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.000
That's cool.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.650
Del.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.050
Go down and that's it.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.920
You reached 706 7 pixels,

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.500
and the response of menu is already here.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.490
Nice.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.850
Let's see if the menu itself it's working.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.050
Let's click here to go to the contact page,

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:29.150
and we're here on the contact page.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:34.450
Let's open the menu again and return to the home page.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.900
Excellent.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.190
Everything's working just perfect.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.180
You see that we just have feel settings.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.830
We now have a responsive menu on our feet Well,

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.680
but there's still one thing that has not convinced me at all.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.980
You may ask me,

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:53.790
Marcello,

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.800
and if I'm making this theme available for download,

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.490
how will my user know that he or she needs to install this plug in if they want a

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:03.590
responsive menu.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.860
This is also a valid question about the social media plugging,

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:08.760
the slider,

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.850
plugging and any other plug in you decide to include inner Feen.

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:13.610
Well,

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.130
that's a great question.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.860
So let's make a do get this question right in your heart.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:20.380
Okay?

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.380
We're not going to answer it now,

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.200
but,

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.540
um,

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.050
Onley at the end of the course after we finished out the theme.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:32.000
This will be interesting for those who intention great things to make available to other

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.490
people.

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:33.220
For example,

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.130
people who want to sell items on thing forest,

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.550
which is a well known marketplace for sending WordPress teams.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.550
So I wait for you in the next section of the course.

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:49.370
We'll be learning about one of the most interesting WordPress tools called the fame

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.780
customizer and kill them happy Colding
