00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.150
Hello,

00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:01.680
guys.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.240
I'm back to continue talking about Gutenberg.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.710
In the last lesson,

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.600
I made an introduction about this new tool.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:15.150
We installed Gutenberg and explain a little about this new editing experience in WordPress

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.150
.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.490
As I told you,

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.970
it looks a little like most page builders,

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.290
such as TV,

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.210
visual,

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.530
composer and so on,

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.200
but their systems some hard work to do well.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.070
The WordPress team works hard to improve Gutenberg.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.570
I'm going to show you all that's available at the moment and especially show you what your

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.540
fame can do to get the most out of good Emburgh.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.260
In this lesson,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.830
I'm going to spend some time explaining to use some of the basic futures of the new

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:44.880
Gutenberg editor.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.410
As I said in previous lessons,

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.410
the goal is not to explain everything about all the chose available,

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.550
even because Gutenberg is the project that's still evolving.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.940
Many things are yet to come.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:04.970
But as my students were very curious and eager to learn more about it and rightly so,

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.690
let's explore what we got into.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.050
Now let's first take a look at the layout.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.650
As I said before,

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.550
it has nothing to do with the Classic editor the tiny EMC editor.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.300
In fact,

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.600
Gutenberg resolves around the basic element,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.380
which is the so called block.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.650
Everything in the layout resolves around these blocks,

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.250
so if you hover over the document,

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.150
you see that every little element here is a block.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.150
We have a new image block,

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.370
paragraph blocks,

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.410
headers lists,

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:50.460
and they can all be identified by this little two tips that show when the miles over each

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.750
of them look.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.010
One interesting thing is that they are highly interactive.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.150
So here you can move a block up and down,

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:05.380
just a click of the mouse Dragon dropped to rearrange blocks.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.680
We also be available,

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.650
but not now,

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.240
maybe in the near future,

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.130
which will make Good America even more dynamic.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.900
And maybe when you're watching this video dysfunction is already in place.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.160
For now,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.460
what we've got is a functionality called the insert.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:28.030
Er the insert er is this plus button that you can see right here just below each block,

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.760
for example,

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.020
here or here in this toolbar.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.050
At it up,

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:39.210
the main goal is to facilitate as much as possible the insertion off any block in the

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.150
editing area.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.560
So by clicking this plus button.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.650
You have access to all the blocks.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.030
And this blocks can be of various types from simple chunks of texts,

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.010
paragraphs,

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.450
two elements that until now were hidden in WordPress,

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.810
for example.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.490
Did you know that you could,

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:05.820
in that a YouTube or a venial video or any media accountant from all of this other services

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.300
without any plugging?

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.460
Yeah,

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.650
a lot of people have no idea.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.380
Now that the blocks,

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.410
the whole thing,

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.050
became much clearer.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:21.410
And the whole idea is that any kind of content that can be added to the editor area will be

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.510
available as a block in the future.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.250
So they user will never need to use the charter cause any more or any piece of HTML cold.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:36.650
There were only need to choose a block and place the content wherever they want causing it

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.650
.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.560
Well,

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.710
then you may ask me,

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:40.680
but Marcello,

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.560
what will happen to the content like posts and pages content that are already having my

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.800
WordPress installation?

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.330
What will become of them?

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.250
We'll need to recreate everything from scratch.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.340
Well,

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.360
to answer this,

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.350
we're gonna live this day more content behind for a moment,

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.720
and we're gonna open one of the posts that it's already saved in our WordPress site.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.050
It's open up this one here.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.890
Well,

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:08.160
look,

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.130
as you can see,

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.680
it seems like everything is still in place.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.380
What happens when you activate the editor is that WordPress moves everything inside this

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.330
single block,

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.050
which is called the classic block.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:25.790
Basically the classic block her wish you can find also true.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:26.790
The insert er,

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:27.550
look,

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.350
it's the old editor,

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.450
Tiny MT.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:31.790
That is,

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.600
if you want to continue using the tiny EMC inside Gutenberg,

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.600
you can.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.260
It's possible if you want.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.950
You can also convert everything into blocks.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.680
Here on the right side,

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.650
you have some actions related to the block with real off course variety from block to block

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.650
.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.820
In this example,

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:57.790
I can convert this classic content into a block by clicking here in convert two blocks.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.410
In this case,

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.500
I end up with two paragraphs.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.960
If I'm not satisfied with the changes I made,

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.950
I just click here on this little Aargh.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:13.850
I can go back here and ask to duplicate all Remove the block.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.650
You can get the idea.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.090
Let's turn this content back into blocks.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.550
Okay,

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.850
So have two paragraphs again here.

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.150
So let me show you something else.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:31.110
Each block has its own settings and this rise from block to block.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.780
For example.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.450
Here for the paragraph block,

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.550
I have some basic formatting options.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.290
Bold italic alignment.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:41.870
And here on the side,

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.150
I have more options related only to the block selected.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.100
This box here is called the Block Inspector.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.740
Here a can,

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:51.940
as an example,

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.450
change the font size.

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.820
I can use this buttons.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.240
Oh,

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:05.440
this later I can tell Go to show a larger initial letter here on their color saddens.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.130
I can choose the phone color and also background color by default.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.850
I have these collars here,

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:15.970
but I can also choose in other colors later own.

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:20.250
We're gonna learn how to make the color palettes for your theme available to.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:24.780
So if you want the client to be restricted to only a few colors,

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:25.470
for example,

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:26.180
you can do it.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.040
And for most blocks,

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:33.820
you can also add a special sisters class that can be very useful if you want to customize

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:38.950
them pretty much like what we got in most page builders out there.

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:45.200
It's under attack called document give you access to all settings related to the post as a

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.850
whole,

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:51.280
really much like we already had in the old editor as metal boxes on Lee,

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.790
the layout is a bit different.

00:06:52.790 --> 00:07:01.150
One of the advantages off the stool is that even if your theme hasn't yet added any support

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:01.840
your Gutenberg,

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:08.200
it allows us to have a very consistent look both here in the editor and in the front end,

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.250
so both versions can look quite the same.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:17.210
Yet you can always take a look at how old front it looks like by clicking here on this

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.350
preview button.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.840
As we have already tweaked the post a little,

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.810
we can have a look at how it's getting.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:30.350
Let's click here in preview and from an opens in a new tab.

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:33.780
Sometimes you notice a boring buck here.

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.850
As try to preview of the Post.

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:40.330
You see that if you click home the update button before previewing the results,

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.130
the bottom you'll be endlessly processing.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:44.260
To build the base,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.890
you have to reload the editor and then click review again,

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:50.480
then the Bayview load.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.350
Also,

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.900
sometimes you see some errors displaying,

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.270
saying that the update has failed,

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.750
as we saw at the beginning of this lesson,

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:01.750
I hope that in the future they can correct that.

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:04.700
Let's try some more.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:11.280
Let's suppose I want to insert in an image gallery here between these two paragraphs.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.570
For me,

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:14.230
this calorie block,

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:16.550
which is a native Guldberg block,

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:19.450
it's one of the most incredible blocks.

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:22.030
It simply works out of the box.

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:24.350
So you create a new gallery.

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:26.220
Let's go ahead and use the insurgent.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:30.240
It may be this one here or this one here,

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:30.650
too.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:35.150
The difference is that when you choose to use this one at stop,

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:40.590
you need to reposition the block later because it's going to replaced at the end of the

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:41.090
post.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:46.530
So I'm gonna use this one here and to color block.

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:48.660
I have a couple of different options.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:54.150
I can choose a block here where some off the were centrally used blocks with show.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:56.490
I can click here on this,

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:57.690
plus Aiken,

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:00.150
and look for the black here,

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:01.800
Or use the search box.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.000
Or it can do.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.980
It's the easiest way I'm gonna type a slash and then write the name of the black our for

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:11.740
example,

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.840
slash gallery.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:18.420
And I don't even have to ride the full name off the block.

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:18.860
Look,

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:19.710
for example,

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:21.450
slash you.

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:25.130
It's already showing me the YouTube block and so on.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:34.150
Just hit Enter and I can set up some options from a block.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:35.880
In this case,

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:41.050
I'm gonna choose a couple of images that they already have in this WordPress installation.

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:45.140
I can upload some new images to If I wish,

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:48.780
I'm going to select these three images,

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:50.170
and that's it.

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:55.650
And the gallery is a reading place.

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:57.290
In this case,

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:57.580
it's,

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:57.800
Ah,

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.050
three column gallery,

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:00.660
and if you wish,

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.950
you can come here and choose only two columns.

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:05.690
I see what happens.

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:07.840
Lukaku.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:11.750
So let's see if it's showing up right on the front end.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:18.680
And there you have it.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:19.950
Perfect.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:22.740
Now the whole thing.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:23.750
Don't stop here.

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:28.160
Gutenberg has pro to us June new types of alignment.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.910
Those alignments will affect blocks such as images,

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:33.140
image galleries,

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.020
videos,

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:34.650
etcetera.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:41.110
You can choose between an alignment called white and the 2nd 1 called Fu.

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:42.690
In the next lesson,

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.240
I'm going to show you how to enable the stool.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.090
Lyman's in the thing,

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:48.050
because by default they're not enabled.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:51.950
We only get these three kinds off alignments up here.

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:54.710
Another thing you can do with the blocks.

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:56.780
It's turned them into something else.

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:57.830
For example,

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:01.890
a gallery block can be converted into a single image block.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:06.280
Just click here on the first button off thes area here,

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:06.820
which,

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:07.370
by the way,

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:08.020
has a name.

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.350
It's called the Floating Menu Bar,

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:12.970
and it to show you a list of blocks.

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:16.090
You can convert it into this off course,

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:18.190
rise from block to block and,

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:18.640
of course,

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.730
not all blocks.

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:24.830
You have this feature here in this case week entrance from the gallery into individual

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:25.810
image blocks.

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:26.850
Look.

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:32.880
And,

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:33.290
of course,

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:35.290
if you want to revert this action,

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:40.940
you can always click here already for have already closed The Post editor.

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:47.240
We can revert it back to the older version by clicking this revision button later on this

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.060
course to talk about other futures.

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:50.750
But that's enough now.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:56.690
I believe you had an interesting idea of how Gutenberg works For those who want to learn

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:57.040
more,

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:57.700
of course,

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:04.030
Oliver Link of a great tutorial that explains in detail how other blocks work inside good

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:08.570
Merck and this link will be available in the extra materials for this lesson,

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:12.780
and the next lesson we're going to start working with the theme files.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:18.100
So let's first see how to add support for those two special alignments that I mentioned

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:18.580
today.

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:23.850
And you begin to understand the connections between our thing and good Newberry editor.

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:26.250
So until van see you
