00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.250
hi,

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:02.040
everyone.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.380
In today's lesson continuing,

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.480
our plug installations were gonna be adding to contact forms.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.640
Your thing 1st 1 will be added in the home page sidebar,

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.450
and the 2nd 1 will be added to the themes Contact page.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.780
So without further adieu,

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:19.950
lets get started.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.190
There are several plug ins that can be used to add forms In WordPress.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.870
We can use this plug ins to create from simple contact forms to more specific and more

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:31.950
complex forms.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.430
In our case,

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:40.700
we want to use a plug in cold contact form 71 of the most used in WordPress and also one of

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.530
which I love to work with.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.380
Well,

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.790
before you asked me,

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.530
why am I using a plug in to create a simple contact form?

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.960
Isn't it easier to create that using Onley plane PHP called well off course,

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.650
It could be easier the painting on your PHP skills In WordPress,

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.440
you can create just about everything,

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.280
but I always use a plugging in.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.300
This case is in the first place because it's faster and secondly,

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.950
because a good plugging is going to take care of various security aspect,

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.910
such as escaping strengths,

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.150
security tokens,

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.190
etcetera since I don't want to worry about these things in all my projects,

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.740
I always prefer to use some kind of plug.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.170
That said,

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.980
Let's go ahead,

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:37.010
install this plug He had over to plug ins at New and we're gonna search for contact Form

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.650
seven.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:46.450
That's thing stole it activated.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:54.250
And now we have one more writing in the dashboard menu called Contact.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.680
When we click here,

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.750
you're at a gas,

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.900
a butin example for notice here that it has a link that allows us to added the form and the

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.480
short cold that will be using concert deformed intra page or into a template file.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.770
If you click on the Edit link,

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.380
you get to this page.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.170
Here we get these four taps,

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.490
I'll be showing you the 1st 3 off them in the 1st 1 We can create the form itself,

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.880
adding the fields we want.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.620
And the coolest thing is that we can create fields using HTML or clicking on this buttons,

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.230
which makes things easier and speed up the form creation.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.800
I'm not going to explain every single element,

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.550
even because everything here is quite intuitive and easy to handle.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.370
I suppose I want to add another text feud in which the user will have to type in the name

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.180
of their city.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.180
So just make room for the textbooks.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.510
For example.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.090
Here,

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.450
click here in text and then through the necessary data,

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.190
for example,

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.300
I'm gonna make this fuel required.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.880
Call it city if I want to place Holder.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:15.650
I enter some value here on the default value field in click here owned this option.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.750
And if later on I wish to style the field,

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.330
I can type in I d or a class.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.340
Okay,

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.830
ready.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:24.290
Now,

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.900
just click on inserts that and to make it look the same as the other fields,

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:39.380
I'm gonna place it inside a label tag here under mail,

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.410
we have the form submission settings as I am on a local server.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.640
I'm going to leave everything as it is,

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.270
since I would need to be on a remote server.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.470
If I want to make a food and more accurate test under messages,

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.900
we can modify the ever messages,

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:57.920
warnings,

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.450
success messages and so on.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.110
Before saving,

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.330
I'm going to change the name of my form.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.270
Chew sidebar form.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.780
This will be the form that will be displayed in the home pay sidebar,

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:17.280
and I'm going to add Nhu heading tack and a paragraph explaining What is this form?

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:24.950
So let's save the form,

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.150
and we're ready to take it to the home page.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.590
To do this is very easy.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.850
Just company charge code and inserted in the place that we want.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.010
In our case,

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.250
this form will be inserted in the home pay sidebar.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.810
Remember that in the previous sections were created to sidebars in the functions that BHP

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:45.360
file.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.450
Until then,

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.050
we have used on Lee the second cyber.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.500
The 1st 1 was used for testing purposes only.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.880
But enough of that.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.050
Now let's include some meaningful content here.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.530
Let's go ahead,

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:05.150
head over to appearance widgets and we're gonna and a text widget in the first cyber.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.440
In our case,

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.390
let's just add it.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.620
The tax wages we already had that space,

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:11.190
the forms,

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.890
short code.

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:12.820
We just copy it.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:18.690
He want to remove this title here too safe.

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.070
And now let's see how our thing looks like.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.800
As you can see,

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.670
it's working,

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.210
but it's a little weird.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:35.720
This is happening because there's no CSS roles in the plugging that control the with off

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.750
the text fields,

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.730
so it's sumptuous creating such success rules.

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:41.650
But don't worry,

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.550
because it's quite easy.

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:44.510
Actually,

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.650
I'll be using a code snippet I found in a plug INS documentation itself.

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.850
Just go ahead and open our main CSS file,

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.450
and I'll be based in that code snippet right here.

00:05:55.450 --> 00:06:03.600
I'm gonna change this value here to 100% and remove thes other venues here because you

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.940
don't need them by doing this.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:12.250
My text field stacks areas and other input fields will all feel the content area.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:22.060
So let's say awesome.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.860
It's very cool with literally for it.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.750
We have a working contact form.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:27.850
It's amazing.

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:29.300
Okay,

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:34.800
What it can do to make it a little better is to have placeholders to the other phone feuds

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.450
because we want to the other fields to look the same.

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:46.700
So let's go back and added the form once again and just follow the same logic that we used

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.050
for the Citi field.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:07:00.510
Oops,

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.250
I think I forgot the mayor fueled Let's get back there.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:16.250
And here we get all of the fuels with same ferment.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:17.220
Okay,

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.150
Now we also need a form for the contact page.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.340
If he opened this page.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:28.200
We see that we have only a bunch of dummy text to solve this in the fastest way.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.850
We're gonna duplicated form we've already created for the home page.

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:40.060
If it just melts over the forms link and click here where it's saying duplicate,

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:47.970
Let's renamed Form and last week,

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:49.250
the content a bit.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:54.650
Now I'm just safe and copied in new short cold.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:08:00.460
Let's go to pages and open the contact page for editing.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:04.420
Now just space,

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:05.130
the short code,

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:06.950
wherever you want in the page.

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:13.650
And now let's take a look at the base to see if the form is showing up.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:15.870
And look.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:19.050
The form is here the way we wanted accident.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:22.290
Just one more thing before we finish this lesson.

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:23.630
This plugging,

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:26.250
as I told you at the beginning of today's lesson,

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:27.810
is quite versatile.

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:29.870
You can do a lot with it,

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:31.030
however,

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:35.770
since one lesson it's not enough for us to explain all of its futures.

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:38.780
I invite you to visit the plug ins documentation.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.170
So whenever we added a form,

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:46.170
we have this link here on the right side that leads to the plug ins documentation.

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:50.580
I think it's worth taking a look you never know when you need some support.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.190
Well,

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:52.920
with that said,

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.600
we finished this lesson here,

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.760
and our fame is getting even more beautiful and complete.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.690
So I hope you enjoyed it too.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:04.250
And I see you in the next lesson by
