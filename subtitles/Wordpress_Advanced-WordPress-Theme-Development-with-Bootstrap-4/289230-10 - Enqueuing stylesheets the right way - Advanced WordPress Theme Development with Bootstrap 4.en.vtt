00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.515
Hello guys.

00:00:01.515 --> 00:00:04.230
In this lesson, we're going to start learning about one of

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.065
the most important files of a WordPress theme,

00:00:07.065 --> 00:00:09.135
the function's dot PHP file.

00:00:09.135 --> 00:00:10.560
At the end of this lesson,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.625
we are going to be able to load any stylesheet within anything.

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:17.445
And the most important thing, the right way.

00:00:17.445 --> 00:00:20.610
In the last lesson, we just started creating the layout,

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.830
splitting our index.html into three parts.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.375
And we created the header, the footer,

00:00:26.375 --> 00:00:29.194
and made our index.html more dynamic,

00:00:29.194 --> 00:00:33.245
including the functions that call both the footer and the header.

00:00:33.245 --> 00:00:34.655
To start this lesson,

00:00:34.655 --> 00:00:39.485
let's just label all of our sections so that they can later style our theme.

00:00:39.485 --> 00:00:41.255
I start with the header,

00:00:41.255 --> 00:00:45.875
less typing here, social icons.

00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:53.630
Here, search, logo, menu.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.650
Let's save this now and open the index.html file.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:04.260
Here we're gonna type in slide services.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:16.160
Here in the middle we have the sidebar news map.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.770
Okay, now we can save it.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.780
Now in our footer,

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.099
let's create a paragraph.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.899
Rebel, usually to include stylesheet,

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:31.670
but using only HTML,

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.225
the traditional way, we must simply create a CSS folder,

00:01:35.225 --> 00:01:36.800
organize our files in there,

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.660
and find a link tag.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.035
Let me show you one of the ways of doing this in WordPress.

00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:47.165
So let's create a new folder within our learned WP named CSS.

00:01:47.165 --> 00:01:48.995
Inside the CSS folder,

00:01:48.995 --> 00:01:52.790
I'm gonna create a file called template dot CSS.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.600
This time you can choose a different name, okay, if you are,

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.170
there are several ways to load a style ship into WordPress,

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.560
but I'm going to show you the most recommended method.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.735
The recommended way is to create a file named functions dot PHP within our theme.

00:02:08.735 --> 00:02:12.455
If you look at the other themes such as the 2015,

00:02:12.455 --> 00:02:15.965
you see that it has a function that PHP file as well.

00:02:15.965 --> 00:02:17.315
If you open that file,

00:02:17.315 --> 00:02:20.450
you'll see that it has several functions inside it.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.245
The function's dot PHP file act as it was a kind of plugging.

00:02:24.245 --> 00:02:28.235
However, unlike plugins that affect all things at once,

00:02:28.235 --> 00:02:32.975
functions that PHP only relates to the theme there is currently active.

00:02:32.975 --> 00:02:36.575
So whatever function I create within that functions that Pitch B,

00:02:36.575 --> 00:02:38.675
when the 2015 is active,

00:02:38.675 --> 00:02:41.435
will only apply to the 2015 theme.

00:02:41.435 --> 00:02:44.720
Likewise, the functions that PHP we're going to

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.560
create will only be valid for the learn WP theme.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.145
What makes this functions that PHP file soap different?

00:02:52.145 --> 00:02:54.125
What is its function?

00:02:54.125 --> 00:02:57.995
Well, it can't contain costs for our stylesheets.

00:02:57.995 --> 00:03:06.755
Scripts. Sidebar is we're going to create menu functions, thumbnail image settings.

00:03:06.755 --> 00:03:09.560
Wherever different pose Fermat's we may have.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.020
And we can also create our own specific functions and low than in WordPress.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.480
So very versatile file.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.200
It always come in handy and I love working with it.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.345
If you want to learn a little bit more,

00:03:23.345 --> 00:03:28.625
you can just go ahead and open up the functions that PHP file of another thing.

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:33.620
For now, we're going to create our own file to load our own sites.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.835
But before spoke about what makes all of this magic happen.

00:03:37.835 --> 00:03:42.920
We'll try to explain more or less the dynamics of this whole process.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.770
While the loading process of a Wordpress site is a bit different from most websites.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.365
Not just a simple process,

00:03:51.365 --> 00:03:55.790
since it's accompanied by several moments of execution.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.700
Wordpress calls them action hooks.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.410
And some of these hawks are defined in the WP settings file.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.705
So if you open that file and look for the term do underscore action,

00:04:08.705 --> 00:04:11.480
we'll see several of these hooks.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.695
For example, setup theme is fired before the theme is loaded.

00:04:15.695 --> 00:04:19.985
There are still all those like after setup theme in it.

00:04:19.985 --> 00:04:21.920
Wp loaded.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.260
The hook that interests us the most in this lesson is WP enqueue scripts.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.340
That hook is inside this script loader dot PHP file.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:38.435
In turn, this file is included new line 192 of the WP settings file.

00:04:38.435 --> 00:04:41.360
And now we have a hook which will help us fire

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.390
the function responsible for our stylesheets.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.240
But let's understand this better in practice.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.630
Okay, so let's create a new file in

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.085
Sublime Text and we'll just name it functions that pitch me.

00:04:55.085 --> 00:05:00.485
And this file must be placed within the learn WP folder. In our case, write.

00:05:00.485 --> 00:05:03.275
And before any doubt arises, yes.

00:05:03.275 --> 00:05:06.170
The file must be called functions that PHP

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.020
don't forget this letter S at the end of the name.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.985
Okay, let's start.

00:05:10.985 --> 00:05:13.640
The file will be PHP opening tag.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.385
But notice that we want close it.

00:05:16.385 --> 00:05:20.285
We do this to avoid the header's already sent type of error.

00:05:20.285 --> 00:05:22.475
If a file has only PHP code,

00:05:22.475 --> 00:05:24.140
you can omit the tag.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.485
Now after that less creative PHP function.

00:05:27.485 --> 00:05:30.110
And as you know, a PHP function starts

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.350
with the word function followed by the function's name.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:38.975
And our functions, they will be load underscore scripts.

00:05:38.975 --> 00:05:42.890
Now the WordPress function that will add our style sheets to

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:47.000
the q is the WPA and Q style function.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.965
So when this function is called,

00:05:48.965 --> 00:05:54.905
it will load our stylesheets one underneath the other in a queue, right?

00:05:54.905 --> 00:05:57.980
We can see this later in the source code of the page.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.945
For this function to do something,

00:05:59.945 --> 00:06:01.910
we want to pass some parameters with.

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.265
The first one is a handle.

00:06:04.265 --> 00:06:07.565
What will the file handle B in the row?

00:06:07.565 --> 00:06:11.585
Since we have already created a file called template dot CSS,

00:06:11.585 --> 00:06:13.400
This will be our handle.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.635
But it could be any name, okay.

00:06:15.635 --> 00:06:18.875
As long as you don't repeat those names, that's okay.

00:06:18.875 --> 00:06:23.015
The second parameter is used to print out the path to our file.

00:06:23.015 --> 00:06:29.280
There is a WordPress function that does that called Get template directory URI.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.835
After using that function,

00:06:34.835 --> 00:06:37.760
we only need to say that the stylesheet is inside

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.570
the CSS folder and it's named template that CSS,

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.215
we concatenate this function to the string foward slash

00:06:45.215 --> 00:06:52.565
CSS folder slash template that CSS don't forget the training slash, right?

00:06:52.565 --> 00:06:57.200
The next parameter says whether or not our style sheet has dependencies.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.870
That is, if there's any other stylesheet that needs

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.540
to be loaded before our template dot CSS.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.035
That is, again, if it depends on some other file.

00:07:06.035 --> 00:07:10.700
If so, we need to type out the handle of this file inside an array.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.940
For example, if there is a stylesheet called data,

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.505
we would pass its name inside an array.

00:07:16.505 --> 00:07:18.410
Since we have no dependency,

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:20.600
we can leave only an empty array.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.890
And other arguments that the function needs is that of the version.

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:27.200
This argument is not required.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.185
We can type for example 1,

00:07:30.185 --> 00:07:32.510
we shall be our style sheet version.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:37.130
You see that the version tax to be concatenated with the filename.

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:40.985
And again, we can see the version number in the source code.

00:07:40.985 --> 00:07:43.955
The last parameter is used to let WordPress know

00:07:43.955 --> 00:07:46.790
what kind of media the CSS file refers to.

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:49.010
It could be print,

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:57.500
screen 00 would be relative to all media types.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.585
And it's the most common value.

00:07:59.585 --> 00:08:04.160
Alright? But it's not enough to just declare the function.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.705
In the case of this function,

00:08:05.705 --> 00:08:08.135
we must first add it to an action,

00:08:08.135 --> 00:08:10.280
associating it with some hook.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.060
We want associate our load scripts function with a hook called

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:18.620
WP enqueue scripts so that it can actually be executed.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.750
To join the hook to the function,

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:24.815
we're going to use another word press function called add underscore action.

00:08:24.815 --> 00:08:28.445
You will see this feature being used many times in WordPress.

00:08:28.445 --> 00:08:31.505
First we have three form the name of the action hook,

00:08:31.505 --> 00:08:35.210
which in our case will be WP enqueue scripts.

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:38.420
And then the function that is going to be executed,

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:41.280
which is the one we just created.

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:44.450
So what is going on here?

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:49.865
In summary, we have created our load scripts function. Inside it.

00:08:49.865 --> 00:08:52.684
We call the function that enqueues our stylesheets,

00:08:52.684 --> 00:08:56.390
template that CSS, whose path is this one here?

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:58.340
It has no dependency.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:00.590
Its version is 1,

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:03.350
and it applies to all types of media.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:08.345
The add action function adds a new action within the WordPress execution.

00:09:08.345 --> 00:09:10.640
Then the WordPress page will load.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.735
And then we automatically have several hooks available.

00:09:14.735 --> 00:09:18.305
One of those hooks is called WP enqueue scripts.

00:09:18.305 --> 00:09:22.925
We take this hook can have a function executed on it called load scripts,

00:09:22.925 --> 00:09:25.625
which in turn includes our starship.

00:09:25.625 --> 00:09:28.100
Wow, amazing though.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:32.225
But none of this is possible if we don't require a function called

00:09:32.225 --> 00:09:36.410
WP underscore head within our header.html file.

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:40.310
And it needs to be placed before the head tag ends.

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:46.970
So let's open the PHP tag and typing here, WP underscore head.

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:50.330
Without dysfunction, no script will be loaded.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:54.665
No stylesheets, including those used by WordPress plug-ins.

00:09:54.665 --> 00:09:59.000
We can now open our frontend and see if everything's working.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.385
And let's reload the page.

00:10:01.385 --> 00:10:05.405
And look here we have all the markup we made.

00:10:05.405 --> 00:10:07.760
If we inspect the code,

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:13.025
we'll see that several things that were not here before now are loaded.

00:10:13.025 --> 00:10:14.915
So check this out.

00:10:14.915 --> 00:10:19.535
All this code was loaded because of the WTP hat function.

00:10:19.535 --> 00:10:23.465
So let's see if our starship is in the list.

00:10:23.465 --> 00:10:26.180
And look here it is.

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:29.330
Template that CSS with its handle,

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.870
its path, the version 1 that we defined,

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:34.370
the type of media.

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:38.190
Now we can finally test our establish it out.

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:42.260
Let's create a rule for our top bar.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:46.920
Let's just set the color red and a height for the area.

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:56.190
So background, red, height 70 pixels.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.160
Let's once again reload the homepage.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:05.045
And there it is, it worked perfectly.

00:11:05.045 --> 00:11:08.195
Now we can start the rest of the page without no problem.

00:11:08.195 --> 00:11:10.520
But before we finish this lesson,

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.635
I have two important things to tell you.

00:11:12.635 --> 00:11:15.605
First one, ever since this course was released,

00:11:15.605 --> 00:11:19.790
a few students asked me where I teach how to create a template that CSS file

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:24.979
instead of using the style.css file itself to ride the theme CSS.

00:11:24.979 --> 00:11:27.950
My answer is that we'll simply my choice

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:32.330
again in case you want to know how to enqueue the style.css file.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:38.435
Instead, you see how to do it now because the code is on the screen if you want,

00:11:38.435 --> 00:11:40.685
and if you understand a bit of WordPress,

00:11:40.685 --> 00:11:43.265
you can call the CSS file like this, okay?

00:11:43.265 --> 00:11:49.220
Anyway, there is no right or wrong way teaching this course is not wrong or right.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.475
It's just one way and my way of doing things.

00:11:52.475 --> 00:11:55.775
And second thing in the course, I think you,

00:11:55.775 --> 00:11:57.110
there's some information about

00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:01.580
some cash problems that always come up at this point of the course.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:06.065
So if you're not seeing the changes you're making in your CSS file.

00:12:06.065 --> 00:12:07.985
Take a look at the FAQ.

00:12:07.985 --> 00:12:11.270
This is a subject that many students ask me about.

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:15.260
They go like Marcello and making some modifications to

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:19.400
my CSS file and I can't see the updates on the page.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.725
So if you have any issues like this,

00:12:21.725 --> 00:12:26.420
please take a look at the FAQ because there you have all the answers,

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.865
okay, well, that's all for this lesson.

00:12:28.865 --> 00:12:33.605
In the next lesson we're gonna learn how to load our scripts and more.

00:12:33.605 --> 00:12:37.355
Learning practice how to integrate bootstrap into the theme,

00:12:37.355 --> 00:12:39.815
something that many people struggle, Alito.

00:12:39.815 --> 00:12:43.010
So don't miss the next class until then.

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:44.940
And happy coding.
