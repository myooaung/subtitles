00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.360
Everyone, today I have a quoting and trivia question, which is usually asked by Microsoft during their

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.620
coding round, and this is the famous Ken Dean's algorithm.

3
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:16.230
So I will be explaining the solution for this question step by step on the whiteboard.

4
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.060
So let's get right to it.

5
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.790
So in this question, we need to find a maximum summary, which can give us the largest sum to solve

6
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:27.450
this problem.

7
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:36.960
You are given a function called Max Subarea, which takes an area of prices and returns the largest

8
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:37.380
sum.

9
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.330
So we have to design algorithm to find this summary.

10
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.660
So to solve this in one loop, we need two variables.

11
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.990
So the first one is current and the second one is to keep track of the largest store.

12
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.190
So we began by pushing the first element to both variables, which is negative for.

13
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:10.040
Then we're going to skip the first element since we already have it here and we're going to do to the

14
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.750
rest of the elements in the area.

15
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.880
So let's start with the first element, which is two.

16
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.300
So two plus negative one, which will give us a one.

17
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.480
So is one greater or two greater?

18
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:24.630
Two is greater.

19
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.490
So we're going to update the current with the two.

20
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.720
OK, and then we're going to compare the current to the global.

21
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.380
So the global has a negative one right now.

22
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.330
So negative one greater or two greater, two is greater.

23
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.470
So we're going to update the global izabella with the two.

24
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.670
Then we'll move on to the next element, which is three.

25
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.140
So three plus two, which will give us a five.

26
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.670
So it's five greater or three greater five is greater.

27
00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.220
So we're going to put that right here.

28
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.260
And then we're going to compare with the global so comparing the current to the global is five feet

29
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.160
or two greater.

30
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.950
So actually five is greater collective update update than here.

31
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.270
So.

32
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.510
Then we'll move on to the next element in the area, negative five, so negative five plus five, which

33
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.440
will give us a zero.

34
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.930
So negative five or zero square zero is greater.

35
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:34.300
Then we're going to compare the current to the global and we see right here five, which is greater

36
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.830
than zero.

37
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.220
So there's no point to updating the global because five is greater than zero.

38
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:46.080
And then we're going to move on to the last element in the area, which is four and four plus zero,

39
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.560
which will give us a four, or we could either have four or five zero, which is the same.

40
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.510
So we're just going to put that right here for.

41
00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:01.160
And then we're going to compare the current to global, so five is still greater than this, five is

42
00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.260
still greater than the current.

43
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.040
So we're just going to keep five.

44
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:12.230
And that's our largest sum, so we're going to return this as a large sum, which is five.

45
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.230
All right, guys, so now I will show you all of this in code.

46
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:27.660
All right, guys, so we're given this function called Max Sabari, and it takes an area of integers,

47
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.770
and if you remember from that explanation that we need to create two variables.

48
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.610
The first one is the current and the second one is the global.

49
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:45.210
So this is both are the are going to take the first element of the area and then we're going to look

50
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:46.040
through this area.

51
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.510
But we're going to start with the second element in the area, because we've already covered the first

52
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.930
element.

53
00:03:52.880 --> 00:04:01.160
So we're going to loop and then we're going to find finding max current, so the max card is either

54
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.860
this element or its max current plus the element that we're on.

55
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:09.410
So which one?

56
00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.530
Whichever is greater, as I explained earlier.

57
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.399
So if you don't understand until this point, then go back a little bit in the video and watch the whiteboard

58
00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:20.329
explanation again.

59
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.780
So all we're doing here is we're trying to get the current.

60
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.510
So either it's going to be the element or on in the.

61
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.000
Or it's going to be the max current plus the element, whichever is greater.

62
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.560
Then we're going to check.

63
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.990
The max current is greater to the max global.

64
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:53.870
So as I explained earlier, we're going to compare the the global with the current, so if the max current

65
00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.690
is greater than the max global.

66
00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.850
Then we want to update the max global with the max current.

67
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:11.040
So this week, we're going to keep looping until we have the largest sum in the next global, and all

68
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.350
we're going to do is we're going to return the max global, which is the largest.

69
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.120
And that's that's pretty much it.
