00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.750
Everyone, today I have a coding interview question, and it's a question that's asked by Amazon and

2
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.330
in this problem, we need to figure out when is the best time to buy and sell the stock.

3
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.080
So let's get right to it.

4
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.270
OK, guys, to solve this problem, you're given a function called max profit.

5
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.210
OK, which takes an area of prices.

6
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.840
Right, and returns the maximum profit, so we have to design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

7
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.390
OK, so let's start with this area.

8
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:43.360
OK, so it looks like all we have to do is find the max number, which is right here, seven and the

9
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.530
PIN number, which is right here one, and subtract the two to find the maximum profit.

10
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:56.620
So seven minus one, which will equals six and that would be over maximum profit.

11
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.720
But remember, since these are stock prices, you first have to buy the stock before you sell it.

12
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:09.620
So in reality, what we just underlined is a case where you would buy the stock at seven.

13
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.120
Right, and then you would sell for only one dollars.

14
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.490
So our profit would be negative six dollars.

15
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.020
OK, guys, so all we need is two variables to solve this.

16
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.600
So first, we need is the minimum buy price.

17
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.820
The price we were going to buy the stock market and the max profit.

18
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.850
So it would be the greatest number, minus the minimum number, which would give us the max profit,

19
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.930
so let's look through this area, OK?

20
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.970
And then we can find the minimum buy price and the max profit.

21
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.930
OK, so let's start with the first index.

22
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.420
So can seven be the minimum buy price?

23
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.770
Sure, because we haven't seen any other element in the area, so we'll make this as the minimum.

24
00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:05.060
OK, and then we move on to the second index, the next index, and which is one, so should one be

25
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.200
the minimum by price?

26
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.600
Yes, that would be a good idea because one is less than seven.

27
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.140
So actually, it would be a good idea to buy it at just a one dollar.

28
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.750
So let's make minimum buy price at one.

29
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.460
OK, so let's move on to the next index, which is five.

30
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.810
Can can this be the minimum by price?

31
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.610
Well, five is greater than one, so it wouldn't be a good idea to buy it at five dollars.

32
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.990
But can we sell it at this price?

33
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.030
Sure.

34
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.180
That would be a good idea.

35
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.010
So because we're going to make a profit.

36
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.760
So five minus one, which will give us four.

37
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.310
So we'll make the profit of four dollars.

38
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.200
OK, then we move on to the next index, which is three.

39
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.610
So should we should we buy it at this this price at three dollars?

40
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.390
No, because three is greater than one.

41
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.800
So it wouldn't be a good idea.

42
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.630
So can we should we, like, sell this stock at this price?

43
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.480
Well, no, because three minus one, which would give us only two.

44
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.950
So that's not a good profit for us.

45
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.500
So we'll keep the max profit at four and then we'll move on to the next index, which is six.

46
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.260
So of course, we're not going to buy it for six dollars because we already bought it for one dollar,

47
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.330
which is a better deal.

48
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.850
So can we sell it at this price?

49
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.330
Would it give us a better profit?

50
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.770
So actually it would give us a better profit because six minus one, which will give us five.

51
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:45.820
So we will sell it at six dollars and that would make this max profit as five.

52
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:53.160
So let's go on to the last element in the area, which is for should we buy it at this price?

53
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.380
Is this the minimum price?

54
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.590
No, because one is still lower than that.

55
00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.520
Can we should we actually sell it at at this price?

56
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.410
Well, no, because that would only give us a profit of three dollars.

57
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.320
So that's all we have found over a minimum by price.

58
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.870
And we have found our maximum profit and all we have to do is return this max profit.

59
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.870
So let's go see this in our code.

60
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:25.700
OK, guys, so we're given a function called max profit and it's given a prices, a area of prices,

61
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.680
and the first way we're going to create is a minimum buy price.

62
00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.470
And we're going to set that to infinity because we want to set a number so high that when we get to

63
00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.410
the first price then is definitely lower than that.

64
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.650
OK, and then we're going to create a variable called Max Profit and we're going to set that to zero

65
00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.710
because we have we have not done any transactions yet.

66
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:57.080
Then we will do a check to make sure our record is a fail safe, so we're going to check if the prices

67
00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:03.310
does not exist or if the price is lenth is equal to zero, then we're just going to return to Max,

68
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:04.810
which is currently zero.

69
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:12.370
Oh, we're going to look through the prices and remember, the price is the stock price.

70
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:18.410
So when we're looping, we are trying to find the best price to buy our stock.

71
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:24.670
So if the price of the current price is less than the minimum by price, then definitely we want to

72
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:25.810
buy at that price.

73
00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.510
So we're going to set the minimum buy price to that price.

74
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.060
And then we're going to check.

75
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:37.830
So if it's if the price is not less than the minimum by price, then we're going to go into this Felsted.

76
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:47.730
So if the price minus the minimum by price is greater than the max profit, then what we're going to

77
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.120
do is we're going to set the max profit to this.

78
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.740
So we're going to take the price.

79
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:59.070
Let's say the price is higher than the minimum by price, then we definitely want to sell our stock.

80
00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.780
So what we'll do is we'll take that price and we will sell the stock.

81
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.300
So minus the minimum buy price and we will get the max profit.

82
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.250
And that's pretty much it.

83
00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.010
That's how we will get the max profit and the minimum buy price.

84
00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:18.540
And at the end of this fall, we just want to return our max profit.
