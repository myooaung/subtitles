00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:07.470
So this is one of the most common questions asked on a coding interview, and you're given an integer,

2
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.830
let's say one, two, three, and you'll all you need to do is reverse it.

3
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.630
So that will become three to one.

4
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.770
So what you need to do is you need to write a function that takes the integer and returns the reverse

5
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.360
digits.

6
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.930
So, for example, you're given five one, two, and then it's reversed.

7
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.730
It turns into two one five.

8
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.910
So the way we do this is we first we grab the last number, which is to.

9
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:51.660
And what we need to do, what we really need is twenty one, so there is a simple math formula to accomplish

10
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.020
this.

11
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.800
What we what we do is have two variables to keep track of our results.

12
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.560
The first is reversed.

13
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.790
And the second is current.

14
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.330
And it is the current number, so which is five one to.

15
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.090
And we always start reverse with a zero.

16
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:38.990
Now the formula is reversed, multiplied by ten plus current number 10, which gives us the remainder,

17
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:46.370
and then we add these two, which gives us two and stored in a reverse variable.

18
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:54.290
So let me show you what we need to do is take the reverse, which is zero, and multiply it by 10.

19
00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:03.740
Plus, we need to take the current, which is five one two and marked it by 10, which will give us

20
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.640
the remainder.

21
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.650
So we're going to add these together together, which will equal.

22
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.820
And then we're going to store it in the reverse where you will.

23
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.670
So zero will now come to.

24
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:29.350
So now we need to remove the last digit from the current number because we already went to the last

25
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:36.980
digit, so we want to remove it and we will do this by dividing the current number by 10 and then do

26
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.880
madalitso.

27
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.750
So card number is five.

28
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.170
I want to go into divided by 10.

29
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.870
And we're going to wrap this.

30
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:53.430
Dr..

31
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.880
Which will pretty much give us the fifty one.

32
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.530
And then we update the variable current.

33
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.530
So that will become fifty one.

34
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:18.540
So now we need to repeat these steps until current becomes zero and reverse becomes two one five.

35
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.290
So, again, what we're going to do is take the.

36
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.950
Reversed, which is true, and we're going to multiply that by 10.

37
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:37.400
Which will give us 20 and then we're going to add this to the next one.

38
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.170
So the next one is current fifty one.

39
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.900
And we're going to do mark 10.

40
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:54.170
So it's pretty much fifty one divided by ten, and the more pretty much means the remainder, which

41
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.130
is going to be one.

42
00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:04.200
So we're going to add 20 plus one, which will equal twenty one, and we're going to put that into the

43
00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.670
first.

44
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.330
Now, again, we want to take this one.

45
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.500
From the current.

46
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.250
So what we're going to do is same thing.

47
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.290
My thoughts for.

48
00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.180
Current is fifty one, divided by 10.

49
00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.250
Fifty one divided by 10.

50
00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:40.340
Which will give us five point one and the floor was going to do is remove the remainder, so we'll have

51
00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.930
five and we're going to update the current to five.

52
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.270
OK, so then we just repeat the steps again for the last one.

53
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:58.960
So we're going to take the reverse again, which is twenty one, and we're going to multiply that by

54
00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.380
10.

55
00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:08.720
Which will give us to 10, then we're going to add it to the next one, which is current.

56
00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.450
And more than.

57
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.720
So that would be zero point five and.

58
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:31.270
Margaret, give us a reminder so it'll be quiet and we're going to add to 10 to five, equal to 15.

59
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.460
And we're going to put that into the reverse.

60
00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.160
So to one five.

61
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:45.790
So now what we need to do is just take care of the current, which is five, so since we already went

62
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.320
through it, what we need to do is again, Mark.

63
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:51.630
Dotzler.

64
00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.940
And take five, which is current and divided by 10.

65
00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:08.200
So five divided by ten and four, so we do this right here, if I can.

66
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:16.880
It's a zero point five and Manteuffel will remove the dogfight the remainder, so we'll end up with

67
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.630
zero and that will be our new current.

68
00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.280
And that's it, so that's how we get the reversed guys.

69
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.360
So let me show you this in code.

70
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.070
So I forgot to mention that we can also get a negative number.

71
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:44.440
So what we can do is times that negative number by negative one, which will make it a positive number.

72
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:56.590
And before we return, we can again look at a variable called is negative and check if the value we

73
00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:58.800
need to return is negative or not.

74
00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:05.380
If it's negative, then we can just do it again by multiplying it by negative one and returning it.

75
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:06.940
So let me show you.

76
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:11.800
So create a variable that is negative.

77
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:20.160
Equals false.

78
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:30.020
We're not we don't know if it's a negative and then let the worst equals always start with zero, so

79
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:30.860
we want to check.

80
00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:34.970
So how can we check if the value we're given is a negative?

81
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.780
We have to make sure if it's less than zero.

82
00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.560
So if.

83
00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.610
X is the value they were given is less than zero.

84
00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:49.110
OK, so what we can do is take these negative.

85
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.170
And make it true.

86
00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:57.740
If it's a negative.

87
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:05.950
Actually, I can just do this in here, so x.

88
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.320
Times.

89
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.120
X equals X times negative one.

90
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:19.400
OK, and then this is the way you write it, and that will make it into a positive no.

91
00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:30.220
We have to go through each digit in the numbers, so we have to we we can write a wild statement.

92
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:31.050
So while.

93
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:44.340
X is less than zero because our goal is to make the current X into a zero.

94
00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:48.890
So while it's not a zero, we're going to keep going to it.

95
00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:50.620
Keep looking through it.

96
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.680
So reversed.

97
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:56.820
Will equal.

98
00:08:59.230 --> 00:08:59.890
Reversed.

99
00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.600
Times 10.

100
00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.130
And then we're going to add.

101
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:10.840
The current, which is ex lord.

102
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:14.760
As I've shown you before.

103
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:23.670
So if you don't understand this, go back in the in the video and watch my explanation again and come

104
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:24.110
back here.

105
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:28.080
So what do we do next is we want to.

106
00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:34.370
Remove the last digit of the X, so we're going to do is X equals.

107
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.400
My Dr..

108
00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.400
X divided by 10.

109
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:54.800
And so what is going to do is keep giving you the reversed value every time, and then we're going to

110
00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:59.350
keep updating the current until it becomes zero once it becomes zero.

111
00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:00.200
Right.

112
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:02.360
It's going to break out of this loop.

113
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:04.460
And we done.

114
00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:06.530
We just want to return the number.

115
00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.230
So there's a couple of things.

116
00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:11.980
We need to do before we return.

117
00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:18.480
So as you can see here in the question, this.

118
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:26.940
It says, assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store pitchers with 30 to sign

119
00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:34.900
range from this right here to to the power of 30 first minus one for the purpose of this fall, to assume

120
00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:38.620
that your control turns zero when the reverse in pitcher overflows.

121
00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:44.310
So you want to make sure our pitcher is not greater than this.

122
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:47.320
So let me show you.

123
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:54.840
So all we need to do is say is the statement if.

124
00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:57.640
Reversed.

125
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:05.940
Is greater than to and power like this power of thirty first.

126
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:07.970
Minus one.

127
00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:13.470
Then we do like it says in the instructions, return to zero.

128
00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.760
OK, so that takes care of that.

129
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:25.890
And then we want to return the reverse, so before we were turning viewers, like I said, you want

130
00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:32.160
to make sure if it's a negative, you want to make it into a negative and debt so we can do this easily.

131
00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:41.260
Within one line, so if it's a negative, is it a negative then reversed?

132
00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:47.810
Great times by negative one.

133
00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.810
OK, so it was a negative.

134
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:56.750
There were times, negative one, to make the positive into a negative and return.

135
00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:01.080
Otherwise we can just return the reversed.

136
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:10.960
And that's a guys, it's that simple, we need to first understand how it's going to look by writing

137
00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:20.920
it down and then convert that written explanation into code, and that's how we can explain to the interviewer

138
00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.700
what we're exactly doing and how we got to our solution.

139
00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.680
OK, so I have submitted the answer and it has been accepted.

140
00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:34.820
So one thing I did wrong is this was the flaw with capital.

141
00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:40.740
All we need to do is make it into a lower case and then you can submit it.

142
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:48.130
So please see the description down below for the link to this problem.

143
00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:50.320
This is all for now.

144
00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:54.880
Let me know if you have any questions and join me on the next one.

145
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:55.540
Good luck.
