00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.370
What's going on today?

2
00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:08.460
We're going to be answering a Google coding question, this is called Final Numbers Disappeared in an

3
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.250
area and I will leave all the links in the description below.

4
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.350
All right, let's get started.

5
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.670
So this could be asked by Google and this question I'm very familiar with.

6
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.530
I was asked this question during my Google coding interview, and this is a really interesting one.

7
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:23.580
So let's get started.

8
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:24.310
All right.

9
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.060
So instead of reading the confusing problem description, I would just explain to you guys in a much

10
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.870
simpler way so you all don't get confused.

11
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.460
Basically, what are you going to do is solve a function called find dispute numbers.

12
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.110
Our input is going to be an area of integers.

13
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.590
Some elements appear to eyes and other elements appear.

14
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.360
Ones are our objective is to find all the elements that do not appear in the given area.

15
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.770
So our solution must be in all of end runtime.

16
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:57.290
All right.

17
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.830
So let's just go through this example.

18
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.739
So our function is given an error of integers, as you can see up here, four, three, two, seven,

19
00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:05.910
eight, two, three, one.

20
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.220
And the output should be five, six, because we're missing five, six in here.

21
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.330
So it should actually be one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

22
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.410
And you don't see the number five and six.

23
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.420
So that is what our function should return.

24
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.220
Let's have a look at another example.

25
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.170
So let me give you this.

26
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.680
Every one comma to.

27
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:35.360
Four and three, so we can see here that this is not in the correct order, so let me right the index

28
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.870
of each element below this area.

29
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.410
So there's going to be zero one, two and three.

30
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.120
So the index are pretty much similar to the given elements.

31
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.610
So let's think of it this way.

32
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.030
Every element of the area is just an index.

33
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.420
So what we can do is subtract one from the element to get the index.

34
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.020
Why?

35
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.140
We have to subtract one because if we get to number four.

36
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:05.000
Right, and try to do something at the fourth index, it would overflow because there is no fourth index,

37
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:13.050
so we just take every number and subtract one to make sure we have an index within the area.

38
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.580
OK, so let's take the first number, which is one and subtract one, which will give us the zero index.

39
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.500
So we will place that number there.

40
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.020
So right here.

41
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.220
OK, so let's take the second number, which is true, too, and subtract one, which will give us one

42
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:39.320
index so we can place that right here and let's take four, subtract one, which will give us three.

43
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.220
So zero one zero one, two, three.

44
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.580
So we replace that right here.

45
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.020
And let's subtract number three by one, which will give us two.

46
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.110
So zero one two.

47
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.380
And we're going to place it right here so you can see.

48
00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.540
That every number can be thought of as an index.

49
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:10.490
Let's do a scenario where a number is missing and in this case we are missing three.

50
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.940
So it should be one, two, three, four.

51
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.630
So we can do this again.

52
00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.440
Let's take the first number, which is one and subtract one, which will give us zero index.

53
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.050
So that will be right here.

54
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.490
And then two minus one, which will be one.

55
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.230
So we'll place that right here and then four minus one, which will be three.

56
00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.810
So zero one, two, three.

57
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.250
So right here.

58
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:47.760
OK, so now we land on two, so since we already have done two, we don't have to make any changes because

59
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:54.210
it's already completed so we can tell what number is missing by the index that is not marked.

60
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.240
So the trick is to add one to the index that is not marked.

61
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.250
And in this case, the index is to.

62
00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:12.990
So zero, one, two and one to which we're adding one, which will give us three so we can place that

63
00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.970
right here and we found the missing number in this area.

64
00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:24.720
OK, guys, so to take away from this example, our first take elements one by one from here.

65
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:34.280
And subtract one from each to find the index second, once we find the index that is not marked, which

66
00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.680
was right here, we add one to it to get the number that was missing.

67
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.000
So I want you guys to remember that when we were writing or code.

68
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:50.060
And next, what we can do is in our code to mark the index that we have already visited.

69
00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.910
We can accomplish that by making the number a negative.

70
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.710
So in our code, we're going to need two for loops.

71
00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.810
And then the first loop, first for a loop.

72
00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.980
We're going to start with each element and make it a negative.

73
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.200
So we take one and we minus one, which will give us zero.

74
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:14.210
So that's the first index we're going to make negative and we take two and minus one, which will give

75
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.690
us one.

76
00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.070
And we're going to make that index a negative and then four minus one, which will give us three.

77
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.340
So we're going to make that a negative.

78
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.280
So zero one, two, three, make this a negative.

79
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.750
And once we land on negative two, that's where we're going to stop.

80
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:37.270
So now we can have another loop and we look through each element and see if it's marked.

81
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:43.940
And once we find the unmarked element, which is right here and this is not marked with a negative,

82
00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.040
we can take its index.

83
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.140
And to get the missing number, we have to add one to the index.

84
00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:57.810
So the index is zero one two and we have to add one to it, which will give us three.

85
00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.870
So we're missing three.

86
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.630
OK, now let's write this in code.

87
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:09.170
So we're giving a function called Find Disappeared numbers and it takes an area called numbers.

88
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:17.420
And first, we're going to create the first loop to look through our area and take the elements one

89
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:22.750
by one and subtract one from each to find the index, which we're going to do here.

90
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.020
So we're going to look through it.

91
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:32.690
And then we need a reference to that index, so we create that reference right here and this is going

92
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.160
to be less than the element we are on.

93
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:44.270
So we're subtracting and then we have to take that index and make it a negative number.

94
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.180
So we take that index.

95
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.730
Right here and three times about negative, negative, want to make it a negative number.

96
00:06:54.010 --> 00:07:00.490
And then we need our results, so we create a result of results right here.

97
00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.790
Then we're going to look through this area that we updated.

98
00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.030
So what are we up to right here?

99
00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:15.780
We're just going to look through it again and then we're going to see any element as positive.

100
00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.380
So there's less than zero.

101
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:27.470
I mean, sorry, if it's greater than zero, if it is positive, we will add one to it to get the index

102
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.890
and then we're going to add that to our results.

103
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:35.600
And finally, we just need to return the results.

104
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.970
And that's that's pretty much it.

105
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:40.670
So that is it for fine.

106
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:41.600
Disappeared numbers.

107
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.320
Once again, this is a Google coding question.

108
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:47.990
So if you guys see this question in your interview, I hope you feel prepared for it now.
