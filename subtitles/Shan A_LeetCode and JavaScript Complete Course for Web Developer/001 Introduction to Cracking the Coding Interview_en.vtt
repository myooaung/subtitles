Everyone, I want to start off this video with a good news for you, and that is it's not hard to pass

2
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:13.920
coding interviews and I'm pretty sure that you can land jobs in the big tech companies like Google,

3
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.040
Apple, Facebook, Amazon and many more because many people did.

4
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.570
So why can't you?

5
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.340
But you need to do one thing that is practice, practice and practice.

6
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.990
Success in any field is consistency, not abilities.

7
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:37.800
While you're watching this video, this course, just keep in mind that I will be available any time

8
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.600
you need my help because I want to see you successful.

9
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.220
And that is it for this video.

10
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.100
My name is Sean and I am a senior software engineer at one of the top companies in the world.

11
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.740
And I will see you in the next video.
