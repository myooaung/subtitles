Hey, guys, I am Sean.

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.800
I am a software engineer, and today I want to talk to you about a lot of mistakes that beginners make

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.420
when they first start working as a programmer and sometimes they end up getting fired because of those

4
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:12.930
mistakes.

5
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.760
So if you don't want that to happen to you, then please watch till the end.

6
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.450
So it's a combination of things I struggle with as well as trends I noticed in my previous projects.

7
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.480
I think the experiences I share with you today would be very helpful, whether you are a student in

8
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.350
college or self-taught or you're already working as a software engineer.

9
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.950
So the first mistake I noticed programmers making is that they forget that the application they're creating

10
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.880
is for business users and those users are not technical people who use your application or not developers.

11
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.370
So we should not use technical words like if the application has an error, we should tell them a business

12
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.960
reason like network issue or not.

13
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.190
So there was this developer on my team and one of the features he was creating was like a Google search.

14
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.120
And when there were no results, he displayed something like no children available.

15
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.550
So a business user would be completely lost.

16
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.710
Looking at this message, he would be wondering, did I search for children so well, we should vote

17
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.050
was something like no results found.

18
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.290
A developer should think about business users and the user experience while developing a feature.

19
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:29.160
OK, guys, before we move forward, please consider subscribing and turning authentications at Boston.

20
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.490
You would know every week about coding interviews and data structures and algorithms and all the helpful

21
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.500
tips and tricks for developers like this.

22
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.310
So you don't want to miss out.

23
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.210
The second mistake I noticed programmers making is that most of them don't like to add no checks to

24
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.750
their code.

25
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.890
As developers, we need to think dynamically about every situation.

26
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:57.480
A feature should not rely on static data because many times the data changes and server is not responding.

27
00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:58.290
We don't.

28
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.260
If we don't add enough checks, then our code will crash.

29
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.650
An application will look like a total joke in front of business users.

30
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.699
So always add no checks no matter how annoying it is.

31
00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:13.560
The third mistake developers don't always think about security issues.

32
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.620
We just code our future just to finish it and don't think about those annoying hackers.

33
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.930
I have seen some code where I was able to hack a feature just by removing some success to this kind

34
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.430
of mistake could cost your company millions of dollars and is not good for your career.

35
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.970
So always check your code for security issues and fix them right away.

36
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.950
All right.

37
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.200
So the fourth mistake, developers don't like to show their code to their team members.

38
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.290
This is very important in software development and should always be open for feedback.

39
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.540
We are humans, so we do make mistakes, even if we are experts.

40
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.600
If you don't code review, then those mistakes will begin to show months later when your team members

41
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.450
have to update or add new features into your logic, they will be mad that they have to fix your silly

42
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.390
mistakes and it could cause major issues as well.

43
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.600
Your reputation could get hurt and you could lose your job.

44
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.550
So always pulled over.

45
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.780
Sure.

46
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.210
Your code to the team and do code reviews.

47
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.800
It is very, very important.

48
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.850
All right.

49
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.060
So the first mistake, this mistake is a very common one.

50
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.730
And I do find international developers doing it very often for most developers, English as a second

51
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.830
language and managers understand that.

52
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.510
But the business does not.

53
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:37.590
In one of my projects, we were creating a mobile app and one developer wrote Hypponen instead of iPhones.

54
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.460
And trust me, that got a lot of negative attention from business team spelling mistakes make developers

55
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.480
look like children and destroys our reputation as professionals.

56
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:55.260
So always remember to spell check your code or at least you can review your code a couple of times.

57
00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.690
All right, guys, these are the five common mistakes software engineers make.

58
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.400
So thanks for watching.

59
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.590
