00:00.000 --> 00:02.790
So, at this point, you might be asking yourself,

00:02.790 --> 00:05.445
why blockchain and why now?

00:05.445 --> 00:09.150
It seems like cryptoassets and blockchain technology have

00:09.150 --> 00:12.840
catalyzed a massive amount of interest from individuals,

00:12.840 --> 00:14.565
companies, and the press.

00:14.565 --> 00:17.160
So, why is everyone talking about this stuff?

00:17.160 --> 00:18.240
As I mentioned before,

00:18.240 --> 00:21.720
it's important to know that this isn't just about technology.

00:21.720 --> 00:26.595
While cryptocurrencies and blockchains are an important technological innovation,

00:26.595 --> 00:30.389
this technology also has profound impacts on social,

00:30.389 --> 00:33.825
political, and economic theories in organizations.

00:33.825 --> 00:37.640
Therefore, many of the early adopters particularly of

00:37.640 --> 00:42.890
bitcoin have shared very specific views about individual rights and freedoms,

00:42.890 --> 00:45.290
something referred to as self sovereignty or

00:45.290 --> 00:47.905
the ability for an individual to govern themselves.

00:47.905 --> 00:50.125
As we talked about in the last section,

00:50.125 --> 00:54.065
this concept of social scalability or shared vision

00:54.065 --> 00:58.640
is also really important component of how these systems are going to develop over time.

00:58.640 --> 01:02.060
In my view, there are three key drivers outside of

01:02.060 --> 01:06.395
just financial speculation that are driving an interest in blockchain technology,

01:06.395 --> 01:09.755
digital currencies, and decentralization more broadly.

01:09.755 --> 01:14.125
The first theme I want to dive into is the theme of trust.

01:14.125 --> 01:16.730
We're seeing an erosion of trust in

01:16.730 --> 01:21.200
financial institutions following the 2008 financial crisis in which

01:21.200 --> 01:24.875
not a single banker went to jail and our government used

01:24.875 --> 01:29.620
trillions of dollars to bail out very financial institutions that caused the crisis.

01:29.620 --> 01:32.390
Or also seeing a lack of trust in governments.

01:32.390 --> 01:36.935
We've seen this reflected in the political environment in America and beyond,

01:36.935 --> 01:39.215
with the breakdown of the European Union,

01:39.215 --> 01:40.700
with the UK leaving,

01:40.700 --> 01:44.930
with some of the rising populist tendencies in the developed world and

01:44.930 --> 01:49.105
also some of the challenges related to stability in the developing world.

01:49.105 --> 01:51.950
Lastly, we're seeing a massive erosion of trust

01:51.950 --> 01:55.025
in corporations and the way they use our information.

01:55.025 --> 02:00.470
As Facebook, Google, and other companies have revealed, there are many,

02:00.470 --> 02:03.320
many fundamental problems with their business models,

02:03.320 --> 02:05.745
where they utilize data from us,

02:05.745 --> 02:07.285
the users of their products,

02:07.285 --> 02:10.580
as the products they sell to advertisers and marketers.

02:10.580 --> 02:15.515
Our information is more vulnerable than ever and there's increasing frustration

02:15.515 --> 02:20.840
over centralized corporate control of the information that defines us.

02:20.840 --> 02:23.280
The second factor that's driving an interest in

02:23.280 --> 02:27.740
blockchain technology and digital currencies is demographic shift.

02:27.740 --> 02:31.315
We're in the midst of one of the largest wealth transfers in human history.

02:31.315 --> 02:35.030
An estimated $30 trillion of assets will flow from

02:35.030 --> 02:39.860
baby boomers and the sleeper regeneration to Gen X and millennial investors.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.700
Now, while at the surface,

02:41.700 --> 02:43.425
that may not appear to matter much.

02:43.425 --> 02:46.010
You have to remember that different types of

02:46.010 --> 02:48.830
investors and individuals have different preferences.

02:48.830 --> 02:54.440
Millennial, as we've seen repeatedly have an interest in things like social impact,

02:54.440 --> 02:57.170
environmental sustainability, and other factors that

02:57.170 --> 03:01.175
prior generations and prior groups of investors may not have cared about much.

03:01.175 --> 03:04.520
We've actually seen this change in investor preferences

03:04.520 --> 03:08.605
reflected in the way some of the world's largest asset managers conduct themselves.

03:08.605 --> 03:11.490
Earlier in 2018, Larry Fink,

03:11.490 --> 03:12.870
the CEO of BlackRock,

03:12.870 --> 03:15.575
which is one of the world's largest asset managers,

03:15.575 --> 03:18.560
announced that going forward BlackRock would look at

03:18.560 --> 03:21.520
the social impacts score of any company it invested in.

03:21.520 --> 03:24.680
Now, while that may not seem critical at its surface,

03:24.680 --> 03:29.975
this reflects a large shift in how institutions are viewing investment opportunities.

03:29.975 --> 03:34.250
The second important themes to highlight relating to [inaudible] demographic shift is

03:34.250 --> 03:38.555
the increasing role that women will play in the future of our economies.

03:38.555 --> 03:40.250
Women comprise 51 percent of

03:40.250 --> 03:45.525
the world population and they control over 80 percent of household spending.

03:45.525 --> 03:49.940
Increasingly, women are also making investing decisions in their households.

03:49.940 --> 03:52.730
Therefore, I believe one of the key ways to accelerate

03:52.730 --> 03:56.500
the adoption of cryptoassets and blockchain technology,

03:56.500 --> 03:59.195
will be to target these female consumers.

03:59.195 --> 04:03.170
The third key theme that's driving an interest in blockchain technology and

04:03.170 --> 04:05.555
digital currencies is the theme of disruption

04:05.555 --> 04:08.255
through digitization and change in business models.

04:08.255 --> 04:11.900
If we look at the top ten companies in the world about ten years ago,

04:11.900 --> 04:15.105
there are companies like General Electric, ExxonMobil.

04:15.105 --> 04:19.070
Companies with hard assets that made physical things.

04:19.070 --> 04:21.830
Now, if we look at the top ten companies in the world,

04:21.830 --> 04:25.205
they are all companies that operate on the internet.

04:25.205 --> 04:28.715
They make digital things that we consume and use.

04:28.715 --> 04:31.355
Without the internet, we wouldn't have Prime,

04:31.355 --> 04:34.040
Same-Day Delivery, something I personally love.

04:34.040 --> 04:38.540
A number of innovations were required to make that business model possible.

04:38.540 --> 04:42.235
As we discussed, it required the development of various protocols,

04:42.235 --> 04:45.860
the development of the internet as a physical compute network,

04:45.860 --> 04:48.980
as well as the development of multiple applications including

04:48.980 --> 04:53.100
payment applications, information transfer applications.

04:53.100 --> 04:57.635
The internet economy today is still largely unfinished and incomplete.

04:57.635 --> 04:59.960
There are many components that we wish we had,

04:59.960 --> 05:01.280
but haven't yet developed.

05:01.280 --> 05:06.115
What we see here is two potential paths for blockchain technology and digital currency.

05:06.115 --> 05:09.420
One way this could have developed is that blockchain technology and

05:09.420 --> 05:14.005
digital currencies enhance this [inaudible] Internet business model,

05:14.005 --> 05:17.180
by enabling further digitization and the extension of

05:17.180 --> 05:20.345
digitization into new forms and shapes.

05:20.345 --> 05:23.840
The second way blockchain technology can disrupt business models is to

05:23.840 --> 05:27.575
build an entirely new form of organization altogether.

05:27.575 --> 05:30.680
One that builds a new set of business models,

05:30.680 --> 05:33.500
completely independent or largely dependent of

05:33.500 --> 05:38.690
Internet business models that focus on organizations that are loosely organized and

05:38.690 --> 05:44.420
leverage open source software to get users to their products and platforms and

05:44.420 --> 05:47.390
create new types of value-driven ecosystems leveraging

05:47.390 --> 05:50.695
digital currency as the primary transaction mechanism.

05:50.695 --> 05:53.690
While it's unclear how exactly all of these factors will

05:53.690 --> 05:57.860
combine to form the future of blockchain technology and digital currencies.

05:57.860 --> 05:59.640
One thing is very clear,

05:59.640 --> 06:03.619
in evaluating this technology and its potential to change our world,

06:03.619 --> 06:06.350
it's very important to get outside of what I like to call

06:06.350 --> 06:09.890
the crypto bubble and to understand the broader lens through which we

06:09.890 --> 06:11.600
should evaluate what's happening in

06:11.600 --> 06:16.495
the cryptocurrency blockchain space in order to understand its potential impacts.

06:16.495 --> 06:20.990
Next up, we're going to delve into some of the confusing terminology of

06:20.990 --> 06:26.430
blockchains and where we are currently in the development of this technology.
