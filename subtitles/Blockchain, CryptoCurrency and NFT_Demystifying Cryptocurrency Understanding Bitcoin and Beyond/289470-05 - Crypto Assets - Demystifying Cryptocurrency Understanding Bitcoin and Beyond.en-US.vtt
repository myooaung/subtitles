00:00.000 --> 00:02.145
Let's dive right into terminology.

00:02.145 --> 00:07.950
Blockchain is very confusing and to be honest after five years of working in it,

00:07.950 --> 00:10.425
I sometimes still don't know what we're talking about.

00:10.425 --> 00:13.740
But let me do my best to try to provide an overview of some of

00:13.740 --> 00:16.860
the words we're using in this space and what they actually mean.

00:16.860 --> 00:21.540
So, you've probably heard the word blockchain and ask yourself, "What is blockchain?"

00:21.540 --> 00:25.530
We talked a bit about the technology and how blockchain actually works,

00:25.530 --> 00:26.715
but at a high level,

00:26.715 --> 00:30.270
blockchain can be used to refer broadly to the category of

00:30.270 --> 00:34.110
technologies that are defined by distributed ledgers.

00:34.110 --> 00:36.840
As we discussed, there are many different models for

00:36.840 --> 00:39.495
how distributed ledgers or blockchains work,

00:39.495 --> 00:43.635
but often the word blockchain or distributed ledger are used interchangeably.

00:43.635 --> 00:45.735
When we talk about cryptocurrency,

00:45.735 --> 00:47.485
we could also say crypto asset,

00:47.485 --> 00:50.930
digital asset, digital currency, virtual currency.

00:50.930 --> 00:55.190
Really what we're talking about is an asset that's native to

00:55.190 --> 00:59.990
a blockchain and what that means is that the asset is part of how that blockchain works.

00:59.990 --> 01:04.940
The best example is to explain the difference between Bitcoin and the Bitcoin blockchain.

01:04.940 --> 01:06.980
So, Bitcoin is two things.

01:06.980 --> 01:08.840
Number one as we discussed,

01:08.840 --> 01:12.950
it's a protocol and that protocol is run by a bunch of

01:12.950 --> 01:17.330
devices as part of the Bitcoin network or the Bitcoin blockchain.

01:17.330 --> 01:20.885
This is a technology and it's a network.

01:20.885 --> 01:24.445
However, Bitcoin is also an asset.

01:24.445 --> 01:26.905
Bitcoin is a unit of account,

01:26.905 --> 01:30.770
it's a form of money that's used to store value and

01:30.770 --> 01:34.610
transfer value and that's a digital asset.

01:34.610 --> 01:37.550
Now, there are many different ways that people are using

01:37.550 --> 01:41.870
these terms but at their core and way to think about it is blockchain is

01:41.870 --> 01:46.220
the big category of technology and digital currency or crypto

01:46.220 --> 01:51.085
assets are a subset of that technology that relate to payments,

01:51.085 --> 01:53.640
value and value transfer.

01:53.640 --> 01:57.240
Now, we've already talked about the word consensus and what it means,

01:57.240 --> 02:00.775
but broadly, consensus is how people come to agreement.

02:00.775 --> 02:02.900
As we've discussed, the way that people come to

02:02.900 --> 02:05.480
agreement about the state of a blockchain network can have

02:05.480 --> 02:07.730
profound implications for the security model of

02:07.730 --> 02:10.970
that network as well as the role that a crypto asset,

02:10.970 --> 02:14.960
cryptocurrency or a token as it's sometimes called,

02:14.960 --> 02:18.625
the role that asset actually plays in how consensus works.

02:18.625 --> 02:22.220
Now, we've also talked about the word mining and what that means.

02:22.220 --> 02:25.430
Mining is simply the process that the Bitcoin network

02:25.430 --> 02:29.090
goes through in order to add new data to the blockchain.

02:29.090 --> 02:31.175
Now, in other blockchains,

02:31.175 --> 02:32.525
we use different words.

02:32.525 --> 02:36.770
For example, Ethereum which is another popular blockchain,

02:36.770 --> 02:39.735
is working on something called proof of stake.

02:39.735 --> 02:42.290
Proof of stake is where people stake or put up

02:42.290 --> 02:47.650
token collateral to attest to their version of the truth of the state of that network.

02:47.650 --> 02:50.370
If they're wrong, that stake gets taken away.

02:50.370 --> 02:53.350
In this process, you wouldn't use the word mining,

02:53.350 --> 02:55.490
but you use the word staking to define

02:55.490 --> 02:58.705
the activity of participating in consensus in the network.

02:58.705 --> 03:02.000
Well, I know this is confusing, don't worry.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.770
Whenever there's new technology,

03:03.770 --> 03:06.800
people often grapple to define new words and give them

03:06.800 --> 03:10.570
new meanings to capture some of what these things actually mean.

03:10.570 --> 03:14.270
While there isn't yet standard terminology in the blockchain space,

03:14.270 --> 03:16.340
hopefully understanding some of these words and

03:16.340 --> 03:18.440
how they're used will help you become more

03:18.440 --> 03:22.765
adept at understanding what people actually mean when they use some of these terms.

03:22.765 --> 03:26.570
One of the things that's characteristic of any new technology space

03:26.570 --> 03:30.725
that's still being defined is something I like to call complexity theater.

03:30.725 --> 03:32.765
As you start learning and reading more

03:32.765 --> 03:35.285
about digital currencies and blockchain technology,

03:35.285 --> 03:39.545
you'll often encounter words that are difficult to understand.

03:39.545 --> 03:41.630
Words you may not have seen before,

03:41.630 --> 03:45.080
words that are used in ways that they're typically not used in.

03:45.080 --> 03:48.860
I would encourage you to delve into the actual meaning of these words and

03:48.860 --> 03:52.870
the intent of these words rather than get hung up on the terminology.

03:52.870 --> 03:54.745
Since this is early stage tech,

03:54.745 --> 03:57.980
a lot of the terminology is still being defined and there are

03:57.980 --> 04:01.610
a lot of incentives to define this terminology in certain ways.

04:01.610 --> 04:03.155
I wouldn't worry about it.

04:03.155 --> 04:05.360
A lot of what we're talking about is actually

04:05.360 --> 04:08.090
quite easy to understand and hopefully this course

04:08.090 --> 04:10.250
has given you some of the building blocks to start to

04:10.250 --> 04:13.300
understand some of the jargon you may encounter.

04:13.300 --> 04:17.525
Now, we talked a little bit about the actual technology,

04:17.525 --> 04:19.820
how and why it matters,

04:19.820 --> 04:22.445
but let's talk about where we're actually at.

04:22.445 --> 04:26.900
As we mentioned in the first lesson much like the way the Internet was developed,

04:26.900 --> 04:30.560
the development of the blockchain ecosystem is going to take time and there's

04:30.560 --> 04:32.525
an interesting relationship between

04:32.525 --> 04:36.790
the protocols or these systems and the code underlying them,

04:36.790 --> 04:41.540
the networks of computational capacity that support these protocols and

04:41.540 --> 04:44.090
the applications that are going to build the products and

04:44.090 --> 04:47.690
services that people like us or corporations may interact with.

04:47.690 --> 04:52.070
So, let's talk about where we actually are in the stage of that development.

04:52.070 --> 04:56.390
One idea I want to go back to is understanding the adoption life cycle.

04:56.390 --> 04:59.840
There's a great book called "Crossing the Chasm" that's all about

04:59.840 --> 05:04.160
the adoption of new technologies and you can find it linked in the resources section.

05:04.160 --> 05:08.585
What's often talked about is that technology adoption doesn't happen in a straight line.

05:08.585 --> 05:11.590
It often happens through series of stops and starts

05:11.590 --> 05:14.830
and it's often not as straightforward as we think.

05:14.830 --> 05:17.465
Civically, there's a group of early innovators and

05:17.465 --> 05:20.150
early adopters who do a lot of experimentation,

05:20.150 --> 05:23.960
build a lot of random stuff or experiments to try to come

05:23.960 --> 05:28.025
up with how they might use this technology in ways that create value for users.

05:28.025 --> 05:30.805
This is called the first part of the lifecycle.

05:30.805 --> 05:33.655
Typically, after all of this experimentation,

05:33.655 --> 05:38.600
there's a lot of excitement or hype as people start to see how potentially some of

05:38.600 --> 05:41.180
this technology could be impactful and typically

05:41.180 --> 05:44.020
there's a rush to invest in some of this technology.

05:44.020 --> 05:46.225
At the peak of the Internet bubble,

05:46.225 --> 05:51.020
over $1.5 trillion of value was wiped off a balance sheet

05:51.020 --> 05:56.330
as a result of the correction in how people perceived the value of this technology.

05:56.330 --> 06:00.275
This process is something that's in fact been well documented.

06:00.275 --> 06:04.400
There's another book by a researcher named Carlota Perez that focuses on

06:04.400 --> 06:09.710
exactly this relationship between new technology innovation and investment capital.

06:09.710 --> 06:12.080
As you'll see in this diagram on

06:12.080 --> 06:14.750
innovation and financial bubbles which is taken from her book,

06:14.750 --> 06:20.675
there's typically a phase where new technology emerges where we see intense funding.

06:20.675 --> 06:25.400
We then enter into a frenzy as more and more investors learn about this technology and as

06:25.400 --> 06:27.380
early investors make money where there's

06:27.380 --> 06:30.760
rampant speculation on the future of this technology.

06:30.760 --> 06:33.855
Now, what's interesting is as we've mentioned before,

06:33.855 --> 06:35.945
blockchains aren't just technology.

06:35.945 --> 06:40.370
There's actually a cryptocurrency or an investable asset that's

06:40.370 --> 06:44.930
native to many of these blockchains which has led to a lot of

06:44.930 --> 06:47.510
rampant speculation in these digital currencies

06:47.510 --> 06:51.650
themselves and we've seen this in a lot of cases and the decoupling between

06:51.650 --> 06:54.920
the actual production value of what some of these technologies are able to

06:54.920 --> 06:59.680
do and the paper value of some of these assets and the prices at which they trade.

06:59.680 --> 07:02.450
Now, this isn't necessarily new thing.

07:02.450 --> 07:07.370
As I said, this is a documented phenomenon that occurred in the Internet frenzy as well,

07:07.370 --> 07:11.420
but it's important to understand that we're now going through phase as

07:11.420 --> 07:15.725
products are becoming more refined as these technologies are becoming more mature,

07:15.725 --> 07:17.705
there will be a phase of correction,

07:17.705 --> 07:20.090
but there will be a recoupling of value where we

07:20.090 --> 07:22.640
start to see more of a focus on production or building

07:22.640 --> 07:27.590
actual products and services at the application layer that people can use as well as

07:27.590 --> 07:30.410
the maturity of this technology where we'll start to see

07:30.410 --> 07:33.545
growth shifts to more experimental technologies.

07:33.545 --> 07:37.430
This is also reflected in the adoption life cycle of new technology.

07:37.430 --> 07:41.320
As technology becomes more and more prominent and widely adopted,

07:41.320 --> 07:45.050
we start to see larger groups of people accept and adopt this technology.

07:45.050 --> 07:48.890
This is typically reflected in the early majority and the late majority.

07:48.890 --> 07:51.190
The iPhone came out in 2007.

07:51.190 --> 07:53.240
Now, that didn't mean that every single person in

07:53.240 --> 07:56.960
2007 owned an iPhone or rushed out to buy an iPhone.

07:56.960 --> 08:00.890
The iPhone ecosystem was still really immature and there weren't necessarily a lot

08:00.890 --> 08:05.165
of apps you could download that could do things you can do with other phones we hadn't.

08:05.165 --> 08:10.400
I myself was a BlackBerry user and didn't even switch to an iPhone until 2011.

08:10.400 --> 08:15.650
So, I was probably one of the early majority who adopted an iPhone and today,

08:15.650 --> 08:17.630
there are a lot more people who own iPhones

08:17.630 --> 08:20.030
meaning the technology is far more developed and far more much

08:20.030 --> 08:22.490
mature and the application ecosystem around

08:22.490 --> 08:25.780
the iPhone is also much more developed and much more mature.

08:25.780 --> 08:29.750
Similarly, it's important to understand that a lot of the innovation happening

08:29.750 --> 08:33.740
with blockchain technology is still very early and very experimental.

08:33.740 --> 08:36.215
That doesn't mean that there isn't a value in it.

08:36.215 --> 08:40.520
What that simply mean is it will take some time for it to proliferate throughout

08:40.520 --> 08:44.000
popular society and it will take some time for it to develop

08:44.000 --> 08:48.020
meaningful use cases and applications that people will feel comfortable using.

08:48.020 --> 08:50.030
Next, let's delve into some of

08:50.030 --> 08:54.420
the use cases of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.
