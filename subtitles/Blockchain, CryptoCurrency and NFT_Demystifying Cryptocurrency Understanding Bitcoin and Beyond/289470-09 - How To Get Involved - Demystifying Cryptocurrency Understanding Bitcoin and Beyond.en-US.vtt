00:00.000 --> 00:01.485
We've made it.

00:01.485 --> 00:03.720
We are finally at the end of this class and

00:03.720 --> 00:06.315
hopefully you've learned something new and if not,

00:06.315 --> 00:10.305
hopefully you are at least a little bit entertained by some of the topics we discussed.

00:10.305 --> 00:11.970
Now that we're at the end of the course,

00:11.970 --> 00:15.180
let's talk about some of the ways you can get involved and how you can

00:15.180 --> 00:18.765
step today on all the exciting developments in the crypto ecosystem.

00:18.765 --> 00:20.940
First, I want to start by saying you don't need to be

00:20.940 --> 00:25.155
technology expert to make meaningful contributions to the crypto space.

00:25.155 --> 00:28.800
What's really interesting is that there are a number of different disciplines

00:28.800 --> 00:32.415
that you need to master to really be an expert on all things crypto.

00:32.415 --> 00:36.330
Some of these ideas of outlined here in this graphic that shows what

00:36.330 --> 00:39.320
the bitcoin analysts brain might contain are

00:39.320 --> 00:42.435
things like cryptography which is a branch of math,

00:42.435 --> 00:45.870
Information theory which is a branch of Computer Science and math,

00:45.870 --> 00:49.320
Computer Science itself but also economics,

00:49.320 --> 00:53.960
monetary history, network dynamics and ideas like game theory.

00:53.960 --> 00:57.470
There are a lot of disciplines that are starting to factor into how

00:57.470 --> 01:01.700
crypto ecosystems will develop and everyone has something to bring to the table.

01:01.700 --> 01:05.060
The best way to provide your talents to crypto ecosystem is

01:05.060 --> 01:09.620
participate in both in-person physical conversations through meetups,

01:09.620 --> 01:12.590
conferences and other local events but also on

01:12.590 --> 01:16.790
online forums where much of the chatter in the crypto ecosystem takes place.

01:16.790 --> 01:20.240
A number of different online forums exist including Twitter,

01:20.240 --> 01:22.700
which is leveraged extensively by the crypto community

01:22.700 --> 01:25.450
to disseminate news and share interesting findings.

01:25.450 --> 01:30.125
Medium where people tend to share a longer form articles particularly those focusing

01:30.125 --> 01:34.940
on research or new developments they've been working on and forums like Telegram,

01:34.940 --> 01:38.660
Reddit and other places where messaging and information can be

01:38.660 --> 01:43.055
exchanged in real time that's more time-based and more sensitive to recent events.

01:43.055 --> 01:46.380
If you're still in the learning phase and you wanna get more information,

01:46.380 --> 01:49.850
some of the concepts that were explained a fairly high level in this course.

01:49.850 --> 01:53.270
YouTube is actually a great resource to help you on your learning journey.

01:53.270 --> 01:56.060
We provided some links to YouTube videos we think are

01:56.060 --> 01:59.020
interesting in the resources section so check it out.

01:59.020 --> 02:01.170
Another great way to stamp to date in

02:01.170 --> 02:04.925
a simple easy way is to subscribe to some newsletters.

02:04.925 --> 02:07.805
There are a lot of great newsletters that cover a variety of

02:07.805 --> 02:11.390
different aspects of what's happening in the crypto ecosystem.

02:11.390 --> 02:15.655
These include things like technical developments, community developments,

02:15.655 --> 02:20.015
protocol developments, and other aspects that you may find interesting.

02:20.015 --> 02:22.430
We've listed some of these out and hopefully

02:22.430 --> 02:24.680
you'll subscribe to some of these newsletters and

02:24.680 --> 02:29.620
find them a useful way to stay up to date without having to do a lot of work.

02:29.620 --> 02:34.070
Lastly, if you're into Twitter which is a place where I spend a lot of time,

02:34.070 --> 02:37.190
I've created a Twitter list that's also linked in the resources section

02:37.190 --> 02:40.460
to some of the people that I find interesting to follow.

02:40.460 --> 02:44.215
But as always, I highly encourage you to do your own research and to look

02:44.215 --> 02:48.320
carefully the incentives the people who may be sharing information with you.

02:48.320 --> 02:51.880
After all, this is the combination of two very potent things,

02:51.880 --> 02:55.280
technology and money and that often means that

02:55.280 --> 02:58.795
people have a very specific stake in how things turn out.

02:58.795 --> 03:04.535
With that, I hope this course has provided you with some clarity on all the complexities,

03:04.535 --> 03:07.250
the jargons, some of the weird ideas that

03:07.250 --> 03:10.145
you hear about in the crypto and blockchain space.

03:10.145 --> 03:13.010
If anything is unclear or if you have any questions,

03:13.010 --> 03:16.685
I look forward to reading about it in the comments section of this class.

03:16.685 --> 03:22.560
Thanks so much for joining and I hope to see you on the next part of your crypto journey.
