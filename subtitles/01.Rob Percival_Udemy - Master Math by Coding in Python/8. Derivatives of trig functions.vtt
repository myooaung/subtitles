00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:12.820
In this video we are going to explore the derivatives of two trig functions sine and cosine.

2
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.900
So let's get started.

3
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.550
So it turns out that the derivative of cosine of X is minus the sign of X..

4
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.020
So that's already pretty neat because you take the derivative of one function one trig function and

5
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.560
you get back another trig function.

6
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.700
So now we can kind of do a loop here.

7
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.970
Let's see what is the derivative of minus the sign of X..

8
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.140
So the derivative of minus sine is minus cosine high.

9
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.080
So that's pretty funny.

10
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.710
We get back to this and you can already see that this is gonna go in a circle.

11
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:52.130
So we take the derivative of minus cosine and that gives us plus sine and then of course the derivative

12
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.320
of sine gives us cosine.

13
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.870
So we've started with cosine taken its derivative and then a derivative and the derivative and derivative

14
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.840
and we end up back at the original function.

15
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.110
That's pretty neat.

16
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:10.100
I have always remembered this cycle of trig derivatives using this little image here.

17
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.850
So we have co signs up and down and sine left and right and then the negative signs are here.

18
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.550
Like if you think of drawing a diagonal line here than below into the left of the diagonal are negative

19
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:29.330
and above the diagonal is positive and then you just have to remember that the derivatives flow this

20
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.150
way.

21
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:36.770
I'm going to talk about integration in a few videos and then the arrows actually flow the other way.

22
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:43.850
But anyway I don't know if this little picture helps but that's the way that I have always remembered

23
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:53.130
these cycles of derivatives what I'd like to do in Python is show you this cyclist city of these cosine

24
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.070
and sine derivatives and then use simplify to generate some plots.

25
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.280
So we are going to need simplify and display in math for later printing.

26
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:10.110
Amazingly we are not going to be using none PIs is probably the first video in ages that we're not using

27
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.360
number pi.

28
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.600
OK.

29
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.970
So let's start off with a you know I use x all the time I mean X is a great letter of course but it's

30
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.580
good to like change things around a little bit.

31
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:31.640
So q equals symbolic symbol for Q and now I'm going to write out Sim dot def so the derivative of SIM

32
00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:41.160
dot cosine of Q and here you go just as I claimed in these slides it is minus the sign of Q And then

33
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:52.790
let's try again for sine and then we get that the derivative of sine is cosine OK so to show the cyclist

34
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:59.670
see what I'm going to do is basically have a loop it's gonna be a loop that's just continuing to compute

35
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.530
the derivative of what goes into the loop and then print out what that derivative is.

36
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.200
So let me show you how this is going to work so I'm going to define a function.

37
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.530
Let's start off with cosine of Q And then let's see.

38
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.870
For i in range 0 2.

39
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.220
How about 8.

40
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.880
So we'll go through this cycle a total of eight times.

41
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.970
So I'm going to display.

42
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:35.500
So what I want to do here is print out the original function and then print its derivative a fraction

43
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:46.300
D by D X of percent G R S and then this is gonna be the function equals percent s and then I will replace

44
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.630
that with the derivative.

45
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:49.200
So let's see.

46
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:59.920
So this first replacement is going to be late tech version of the function here and then the next substitution

47
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:07.850
here is going to be the late tech coded version of the derivative of f.

48
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.260
Okay.

49
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.670
So let's just run this code now.

50
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.930
So far this is not terribly interesting.

51
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.580
Well the first line is pretty interesting.

52
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.040
Everything else is quite redundant.

53
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:27.400
So what I'm going to do now is update this variable F so I'm going to say F equals Sam dot diff of F.

54
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:34.720
So now notice that although f starts off as being this expression here each time we run in the loop

55
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:41.110
at each iteration of the loop f is going to become the derivative which means that at the first iteration

56
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.350
of the loop F is cosine of q.

57
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:50.950
But then at the second iteration of the loop f is going to become the minus sign of q.

58
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:58.870
So now when we run this you can see that cosine goes to minus sine minus sign minus cosine minus cosine

59
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.930
the sine and then sine back to cosine.

60
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.740
We've gone full circle and then I don't know why we go full circle twice.

61
00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.120
OK so that is for algebra.

62
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.130
You know it's just a bunch of letters and lines and curves and things like that.

63
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.600
I would like to see how this looks in pictures.

64
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:23.680
So therefore what I'm going to do is put these four different components so co-sign the original function

65
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.430
and then all of its derivatives into the same plot.

66
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:35.860
And to do this I'm going to use the simple plotting and as I've done in previous videos I'm going to

67
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:43.200
create a shorthand to access simplified plotting dot plot as Sam plus.

68
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.410
So that's just gonna make things a little bit cleaner for the code.

69
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.420
So I don't have to write out all of this business.

70
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.790
All right.

71
00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:55.370
So let's start again resetting F to sim that costs of Q..

72
00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:02.060
Now I'm going to loop again except now this time it's not going to go in eight steps we're just going

73
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.750
to go through this loop once okay.

74
00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:05.740
So what do I want to do.

75
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.730
I want to say something like P that extend and then insert a plot in here.

76
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:17.540
So that means I need to initially define P out here to be sin plot.

77
00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:25.870
So then the function is going to be f show equals false because I want to put multiple lines multiple

78
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.190
functions into the same plot.

79
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:32.890
And of course we're going to need a label so we can differentiate all the different lines and that's

80
00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:37.220
going to be the latex version of f.

81
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.670
Now this is fine.

82
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:46.000
You can define this first plotting object here outside the loop and then inside the loop you just extend

83
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.050
the use this method extend which means to add more lines to this plot that P refers to.

84
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.540
However I'm going to show you a different way to set this up.

85
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.710
So I'm going to write if I equals zero.

86
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.220
So this happens on the very first iteration of this loop.

87
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:11.350
So on the first iteration of this loop that's when we actually generate the first feature of this plot

88
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:20.680
the first line in this plot else then we are going to extend it if I is not equal to zero which means

89
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:26.470
basically if we are already moving through this loop after the first iteration.

90
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.820
Now sometimes it's easier to setup code this way.

91
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:32.250
So you get everything inside the for loop.

92
00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:38.470
Sometimes it's easier to setup code the way that I showed before where you start initializing some features

93
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.190
of the plot before you get into the loop.

94
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.910
But it's good to know about this possibility in case it's useful in the future.

95
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:46.220
All right.

96
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:57.920
Anyway Simplot F and then show equals false and then again label equals him that latex F..

97
00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:04.750
Now here I'm gonna run into the same problem that I had up above which is that if I don't update f then

98
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:10.500
I'm actually just re plotting the same exact function over and over and over again.

99
00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:18.620
So therefore what I want to do is redefine F to be the derivative of f Okay.

100
00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:22.270
And then let's say P show.

101
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:26.280
And of course I added a sum line labels here.

102
00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:31.340
So I need to write P that legend equals true.

103
00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.940
Okay so let's run this.

104
00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.830
Okay so the error is on this line.

105
00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:42.560
And actually this error comes from putting an end parentheses too early so you can see that the way

106
00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:50.750
that I've set this up now which is wrong accidentally is that the label actually goes into the second

107
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:51.590
argument.

108
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:57.500
The second input of the extend function which is not what it's supposed to be the label is supposed

109
00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.660
to be associated with Simplot.

110
00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:01.810
All right.

111
00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:09.170
Now let's try this okay so it's kind of a nice looking pattern I guess.

112
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:15.780
But we can't really see which lines correspond to which and they kind of cycle through a bit too much.

113
00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:16.500
So let's see.

114
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:25.070
I'm going to change the x axis limit from let's try minus three to three and see how that looks.

115
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:25.380
Okay.

116
00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:27.610
So that looks a little bit better.

117
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:33.390
Now we need to adjust the colors to make sure that these are actually differential from each other.

118
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.610
So how should we set the colors.

119
00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:40.800
Well we have four different lines so we need to have four different colors.

120
00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:43.080
Now there's a couple of ways that you could set this up.

121
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:51.420
We could come up with some variable like this and say you know black red blue green and then here I

122
00:09:51.420 --> 00:10:00.210
can say line color equals colors and then the ISF element in colors.

123
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:04.590
So that's going to work of course it doesn't work for these other lines because I haven't put it here

124
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:06.510
but I would like to change this.

125
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:11.430
I would like this to be a little bit more dynamic to be based on AI itself.

126
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:20.040
So what I'm going to specify is that the colors should be I divided by and let's try the maximum value

127
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:20.310
here.

128
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:26.670
So I divided by three I divided by three and I divided by three.

129
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.780
So let's see what this is going to look like.

130
00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:36.270
So copy and then also have to put that in here making sure I don't make the same mistake twice of putting

131
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:41.410
this line color after the end of the Simplot function.

132
00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.510
So it looks like we're missing a line.

133
00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:49.700
Actually what's happening here is that the sign the line for sine is white.

134
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:54.640
You can actually see it's broken here in here as it crosses through these functions.

135
00:10:54.960 --> 00:11:01.110
OK so dividing by the maximum number of iterations isn't good because then we end up with a number of

136
00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:03.950
one which is pure white.

137
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:07.050
So maybe let's try dividing by five.

138
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:13.410
Maybe that looks better than should be consistent here.

139
00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:14.910
OK.

140
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:19.590
That looks a little bit better except now they're still a little bit hard to distinguish because they're

141
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:21.220
all grayscale.

142
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.070
What if we would do something like this.

143
00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:28.820
What if I made the middle one which corresponds to green divided by three.

144
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:29.880
Huh.

145
00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.280
Now this is looking better.

146
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:40.000
Now we can see all four lines and they all have a nice shade of green in this video.

147
00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:46.370
You learned about the cyclic nature of the derivative of sine and cosine and I hope you got a bit of

148
00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:51.060
a review about simply plotting it maybe you also learned a couple of new things.

149
00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:58.160
Of course there is an exercise associated with this video but in the interest of time I didn't want

150
00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:04.250
this video to go on forever so I decided to put the exercise into the next video.

151
00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:05.690
So stay tuned.

152
00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:06.070
Go.

153
00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:07.810
You know get a sip of water or whatever.

154
00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:11.870
Come back with your thinking cap on and get ready for the exercise.
