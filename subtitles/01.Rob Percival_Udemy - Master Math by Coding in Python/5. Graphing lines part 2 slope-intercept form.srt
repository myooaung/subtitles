1
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:09,070
Continuing along with the discussion of how to plot lines in Python.

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,240
In this video I'm going to show you a different way of plotting lines.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:19,440
And that is the slope intercept form the slope intercept form essentially looks like this and that is

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:26,830
the way that you are normally presented with lines in math and also in statistics.

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:35,430
So you often think about the equation of a line as being Y equals M X plus b so X of course is the x

6
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,630
axis here and M is usually called the slope.

7
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:45,510
And that basically just tells you how much you have to go up for each unit that you go over.

8
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,850
So it's sometimes called rise over run but it's basically just the tilt of this line if it's positive

9
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:51,930
it's going upwards.

10
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:58,500
If it's negative it's going downwards and then we have this other parameter here B which is often called

11
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,580
The Intercept.

12
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:07,110
And that basically just corresponds to where the line goes through the x axis when the y axis equals

13
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,040
zero.

14
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,280
And then you can see from the equation.

15
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,860
So when x equals zero then this term goes to zero.

16
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,340
So then you just have Y equals B.

17
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,380
So what x equals zero then Y equals B.

18
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,170
So no big surprise.

19
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,820
We will need the map plot lib that pie plot module in this video.

20
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:27,850
Okay.

21
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,750
And so I'm just gonna put a comment up here as a reminder.

22
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:38,630
So the goal is to draw a line using the formula Y equals M X plus B.

23
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,600
So let's say that our x values will go from minus five to plus five.

24
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,310
So the line is gonna be drawn from minus five to plus five on the y axis.

25
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:53,800
And then I'm going to specify m to be two and b to be 1.

26
00:01:53,820 --> 00:02:01,890
Now you might think that it should be something as simple as writing out Y equals M times x plus B.

27
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,390
That certainly seems like it should be the right answer.

28
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:12,090
However if you run this code you'll get a strange error it's a type error and python is saying can only

29
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,850
concatenate lists to list not integers.

30
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:23,610
And essentially what's happening is that this variable x is a list and so it's not really possible to

31
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,400
do these mathematical operations on a list.

32
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,970
The way you expect it to work like this now it is possible to get a form like this using num pi and

33
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,350
I'm going to show you that in a moment in the next cell.

34
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:43,980
But what I want to do now is show you the non num pi method of solving this problem.

35
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:49,340
So what I'm going to do is specify y to be two points and these can be any two points.

36
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,850
You know not zero zero.

37
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:57,690
These are just initialized some random numbers I'm just basically creating a two element vector for

38
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,450
y and then when I'm going to do is essentially evaluate this equation here.

39
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:09,720
One point at a time rather than evaluating this all in one line of code.

40
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:18,210
So in the previous video I was doing something like 4 x i in X but now what we need to do is specify

41
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:21,600
these values for y in indices.

42
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:28,960
So we need to specify that the first point in Y is going to be m times the first point in x plus B.

43
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:36,240
So it turns out that this is not very useful because I need to say something like the X I if element

44
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:42,980
in Y is going to be equal to m times X I plus B.

45
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:48,810
Now the problem is this is not going to work because on the first iteration we are trying to access

46
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:52,310
the minus fifth element of Y.

47
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,470
In fact here we want to access the first element of Y and then the second element of Y.

48
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:05,520
So the way to solve this I'm going to set this back to being I so I can stay in range 0 2 the length

49
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,010
of x.

50
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:15,870
So now instead of this looping variable I being the actual values in X it's going to be integer starting

51
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:21,640
at zero and going up to the length of X or actually 1 minus the length of x.

52
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:27,010
So therefore this becomes y x y.

53
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:34,530
And now we specified x and y so I'm gonna say print x come away so X is well x is the same thing it

54
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:40,130
was before but importantly Y is now minus 9 and 11.

55
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:44,850
So this is the value of Y at x equals minus 5.

56
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:48,950
This is the value of Y at x equals plus 5.

57
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:49,420
Okay.

58
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,700
And now what we can do is plot these two.

59
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:59,770
So now I can say put that plot X comma Y.

60
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:06,990
Now notice that in this case this actually is the correct formatting because the variables x and y here

61
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,430
are not individual points.

62
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:11,210
This is not point one and point two.

63
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,560
These are the x coordinates and these are the y coordinates.

64
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:15,910
Okay.

65
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:21,600
So what I want to do now is spend a moment to make this plot look a little bit nicer.

66
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:25,020
So some of these things you've already seen before.

67
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:30,990
So axis square and I'll put a grid on let's see how this is starting to look.

68
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,810
Okay it's getting a little bit better and now I want to change the x and y axis limits because I think

69
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,430
it looks a little bit awkward here.

70
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,890
But what I want to change the limits to is basically just the ends of the line.

71
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:46,160
So I want the line to fill up the entire plot.

72
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,980
So I'm going to write BLT.

73
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:57,180
X lim x and peel teed up y Lim y and actually know what this is.

74
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,980
I'm not really happy with this Y limit.

75
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,850
Let's try something a little bit creative here.

76
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:07,680
I'm going to set the Y limit to be the x axis limit as well so that's gonna give us a nice square plot

77
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,820
here.

78
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,020
Okay.

79
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,710
So now I'd like to draw black lines on the 0 lines here.

80
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:16,170
Just like I did before however.

81
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:21,020
Now I don't want to have to specify what these lines are appropriate.

82
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,590
I want to be able to draw this information from the Axis itself.

83
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,790
So let me show you what I mean by that I'm going to write.

84
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:33,680
Access equals BLT dot GC A get current axis.

85
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,750
You remember I introduced you to this idea in a previous video.

86
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:46,820
So now from this variable axis I can access multiple features of this plot including so for example

87
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:52,160
as just print out axis dot get X limb.

88
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:58,320
So now this tells me that the x axis limit is minus five to plus five.

89
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:03,320
Now on the one hand that's not so surprising because that's what I set it to appear according to what

90
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,570
I specified X to be up here.

91
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:11,540
But being able to access this information is really useful because now I can make the lines a little

92
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:20,270
bit more dynamic so I can say that I want a line that has the x axis coordinates from minus five to

93
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:26,680
plus five or whatever the x axis limit happens to be and then the Y is going to be 0 0.

94
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:31,460
And now I'm gonna specify this as a dotted black line like this.

95
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:31,720
All right.

96
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,760
So this is for the horizontal line.

97
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:37,070
We need a vertical line as well of course.

98
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:42,910
And so that is almost exactly the same code except here.

99
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:48,910
We need to specify that we want to grab the y axis limit instead of the x axis limit.

100
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,350
Okay so this is looking pretty good.

101
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:56,960
There's one more thing that I would like to add to this plot and that is a little legend a label up

102
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,580
here that would tell us the actual formula for this line.

103
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,560
And so to do that I've also introduced this in a previous video.

104
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:08,740
But it's one of the options for plots peel teed up plots.

105
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:16,280
You would type label equals and then whatever would be the string that you want to appear in the legend.

106
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,440
So y equals.

107
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,540
Now I could just hard code this I could write two x plus one.

108
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:28,670
But what if we wanted to change these values here then we would also have to manually change these values

109
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:29,300
here.

110
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:38,930
So a much better solution is to say percent s x plus percent s and then I'm going to substitute in for

111
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,210
those percent S's.

112
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:45,380
It's going to be m comma B all right.

113
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,410
So now I'm going to run this code.

114
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,270
We still don't see a legend.

115
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,800
And that's because we haven't activated the legends.

116
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:57,030
We have to activate the legend by typing appeal to the legend.

117
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:57,920
All right.

118
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:58,870
And then we see this.

119
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:05,600
And now this is a pretty useful tool because you can start changing these parameters these two parameters

120
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,450
of the line to see how the plot changes.

121
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,090
So let's say minus have a point three.

122
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,930
And how about point 1.

123
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:21,140
Okay so now we get a line that is negative it has a negative slope and you can see it s it's not exactly

124
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:26,070
at the origin it's a tiny tiny smidge above the origin here.

125
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:26,480
All right.

126
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:33,470
So I promised that I would show you the NUM pi solution for this problem here.

127
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:39,210
Now there is nothing wrong with generating the variable y one point at a time like this.

128
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:43,650
However it's also useful to know how to do this in one go.

129
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,610
And so for this we need the NUM pi modules.

130
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:56,870
I'm going to import num pi as MP and then I have to run this code again and essentially the trick is

131
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:02,100
simply to convert this X from a list into a num pi array.

132
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:07,670
So I'm going to write y equals m dot x plus B.

133
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,560
Now we already know that this doesn't work on its own.

134
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:19,730
However if the variable x gets converted from a list which it currently is into a num pi array.

135
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:24,970
So we see an array and then this is going to work.

136
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:33,110
And the result is exactly the same the exercise for this video is basically to produce this plot.

137
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:39,980
You can see that there are two lines being drawn here with a friendly little informative legend here

138
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,790
that tells us the formulas for these two lines.

139
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:50,630
So this blue line here is Y equals point seven times X looks a little strange here to say plus minus

140
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,190
two.

141
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:54,760
But that means that the intercept is minus two.

142
00:10:54,890 --> 00:11:01,220
And here the orange line is minus one point two five times x plus point seven five.

143
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:01,520
All right.

144
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,080
So this is your task.

145
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:09,210
Implement these two equations in Python and produce a plot that looks like this including the legend.

146
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:17,490
So now I'm going to switch to Python and show you how I came up with a solution to this exercise.

147
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:17,850
All right.

148
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,910
So let's make a new cell down here.

149
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,130
So I'm going to create a couple of lists here for all the parameters.

150
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:29,970
So first of all let's set X to go from minus five to plus five.

151
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:36,650
And then I'm gonna come up with an an also a list for the m and b parameters or the slope and intercept

152
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,010
parameters.

153
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:47,210
So the first equation was point seven for M and the first equation value of the intercept was minus

154
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,170
two.

155
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,970
And then the second equation was minus one point two five.

156
00:11:53,240 --> 00:12:00,340
And the second equation intercept was point seven five or three fourths.

157
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:00,710
All right.

158
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:05,600
And so now with this information I'm going to basically draw a line like this.

159
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,640
Now it has to be two lines.

160
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,450
Now you could do this in two separate lines of code.

161
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:13,430
You could say why one equals and y two equals.

162
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,300
Totally fine.

163
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:19,640
However that wouldn't really scale if we wanted to add more lines let's say there is another line with

164
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,570
M equals 3 and b equals also 3.

165
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,160
All right.

166
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,480
You know I said three but I wrote two.

167
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:31,150
But anyway the point is it's good to have code that is scalable.

168
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,670
So therefore I'm going to do the rest of this in a for loop.

169
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:41,390
So what I'm going to do is loop over the length of M and that's going to allow me to draw a different

170
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:46,190
line inside this for loop for each set of parameters.

171
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:57,310
So for I in range 0 to length of M we want to first of all come up with the formula for Y.

172
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:06,170
So that was Y equals M and now it's the ISF element in m times X except this has to be converted into

173
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:10,570
a num pi array plus B.

174
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,720
And then of course it's the element of B.

175
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:19,460
So before getting any further and actually doing some plotting I'm just gonna run this code and check

176
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:23,090
for any errors and I didn't see any errors in fact nothing printed out.

177
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:26,720
So that's a good sign when you don't see any errors of course.

178
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,230
That doesn't mean that there's nothing wrong with your code.

179
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,920
It doesn't mean that your code is perfect.

180
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:33,100
However it doesn't mean that you don't get any errors.

181
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,450
So that's an encouraging sign.

182
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:36,620
Okay.

183
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:43,130
And then I'm gonna say P L T dot plot and now the X is going to be X the y coordinates will be the y

184
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:47,810
coordinates and then I'm also gonna have to come up with a label.

185
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:54,950
But for right now I think I'll just set this to be I because I just want to make sure that this plot

186
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:58,970
is looking good before getting too much further.

187
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:05,000
I've mentioned several times before in this course that it's generally good to work on your code piecemeal

188
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,990
so you write a little bit of code and then you test it and then you write a little bit more code and

189
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,850
then you test it and so on.

190
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,050
All right.

191
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,080
And this looks pretty good.

192
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:18,860
We see the two lines they intersect and it roughly looks like what the plot in the slides look like

193
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,870
that I showed a moment ago.

194
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:21,150
OK.

195
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:31,670
So let's set this label to b y equals then this is gonna be replaced with the M X plus and then another

196
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,220
replacement for B.

197
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:42,850
So then this has to be the F element in M and then the F elements in B.

198
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,430
All right.

199
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:48,720
And then we can activate the legend.

200
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:49,240
All right.

201
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,290
So this is starting to look good.

202
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,810
And in fact this is mostly the end of the assignment.

203
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:59,000
There is a couple of other lines of code that you could add to make this plot look more like the plot

204
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,750
that I showed in the slides which is actually this.

205
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:07,760
So I'm really just going to copy and paste.

206
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:08,420
Let's see.

207
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:15,260
If I'm lucky enough that I will be able to just run this and all right.

208
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,550
This looks pretty good.

209
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:24,350
Now you may think that this was just a weird excuse to generate an X on a plot and X does happen to

210
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,970
be a pretty good letter but in fact this is more important than this.

211
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:34,970
When you get to solving systems of equations you will learn that a system of equations like this so

212
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:38,390
a pair of equations has a solution.

213
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,780
When the graph of those two equations shows that they intersect at a point that in fact this point here

214
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:48,480
is the simultaneous solution to both of these equations.

215
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:54,140
So not really going to talk about that yet in this course that comes up later but I just want to give

216
00:15:54,140 --> 00:16:00,080
you some insight into why this kind of an exercise actually is pretty important.

217
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:06,710
So the main goals of this video and the last video were to show you how to draw lines in Python.

218
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,740
And now you know two approaches for drawing lines.

219
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:17,060
You can specify the start and stop points on the x and y axes and you can start from the equation y

220
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:21,440
equals M X plus B for two points and then draw the line that way.
