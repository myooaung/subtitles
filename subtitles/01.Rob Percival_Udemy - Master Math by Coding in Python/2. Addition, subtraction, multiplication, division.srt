00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:08,600
The goal of this video is to learn how to use Python to implement basic arithmetic.
1

2
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:15,110
Essentially we are going to use python as a calculator and it's easier than you might think.
2

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,730
So let's jump straight into it.
3

4
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:25,880
Once you have a fresh Jupiter notebook open you can click inside this small window here and then write
4

5
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,710
out some arithmetic equations just like you would with a calculator.
5

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,410
So let's say for example four plus five.
6

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:40,070
Now I know that the answer has to be nine because I am a genius mathematician and to confirm that the
7

8
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,180
answer is going to be nine.
8

9
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:47,860
I'm going to press on keyboard control and then enter and that gives me an output of nine.
9

10
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,470
And you can change these numbers as you like.
10

11
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,870
So I could set this to be four plus eight.
11

12
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,430
I'm just overwriting the five with an eight.
12

13
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:01,800
And again I press control enter and now I see that four plus eight is twelve.
13

14
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,300
Now I want another one of these input bars here.
14

15
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:11,230
So I'm going to press shift enter instead of control enter and that will evaluate this equation and
15

16
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:16,510
it will also give me a new line here and now I'm going to show you that you can add multiple numbers
16

17
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,360
at the same time.
17

18
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,430
Let's say four plus 1 and this is going to give me five.
18

19
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,720
But then I'm going to say plus five.
19

20
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,570
And so that result should be 10.
20

21
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,530
So that's for addition.
21

22
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:31,360
Now we get to subtraction.
22

23
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,090
And again it's exactly how you think it should work.
23

24
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,240
But with the minus sign instead of the plus sign.
24

25
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,470
So I'm going to say let's go five minus three.
25

26
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:44,390
And now I press control enter and that gives me a two.
26

27
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:51,940
So far pretty easy. One thing I would like to point out already is you'll notice that spaces are not
27

28
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,130
important here.
28

29
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,170
You will see later when we get to control statements like if statements and for loops that sometimes
29

30
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,910
in Python spacing is important.
30

31
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,440
But here spacing is not important.
31

32
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:10,970
So I can say with no spaces or with spaces I can even have lots and lots of spaces.
32

33
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:16,100
This is probably too many spaces but the answer is still two.
33

34
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,650
All right.
34

35
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:20,160
Now let's move on to multiplication.
35

36
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:25,690
Now you might think that multiplication should be something with an X because this is probably how you
36

37
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:31,960
would write it down if you're writing down three times three on a piece of paper or if you see the expression
37

38
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:36,570
three times three in a textbook then it's going to be written down with an x.
38

39
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:43,240
However that is not the correct way to do it in Python and you can see you when I tried to run this
39

40
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:46,450
so by pressing control enter.
40

41
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,700
We see this error message.
41

42
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:53,950
So it says there's an error and it shows me this little carrot here indicating where on the line the
42

43
00:02:53,950 --> 00:03:00,160
error happens and the error message says Syntax Error Invalid syntax.
43

44
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,730
Now sometimes in programming languages like Python the error messages are more useful, and sometimes they
44

45
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:08,950
are not quite as easy to interpret.
45

46
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:13,990
But in this case I know the problem: X is not the multiplication sign.
46

47
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:19,420
Instead the multiplication sign is an asterisk it's this little star here.
47

48
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:25,900
So now I'm going to press control enter and then we get an output of nine, which is indeed three times
48

49
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,000
three.
49

50
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:35,410
So far I've only been implementing one operation -- one arithmetic operation -- per line of code per cell
50

51
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:42,210
but you can also mix these together so I'm going to say three times three plus one.
51

52
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,700
And how about minus five.
52

53
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:50,920
So three times three is nine plus one is ten and then minus five gives me five.
53

54
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:54,750
And here you see the answer is five.
54

55
00:03:54,850 --> 00:04:00,460
Now if you're having multiple operators in the same line you have to be careful about something called
55

56
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:08,170
the order of operations. The order of operations is which arithmetic operator gets implemented first.
56

57
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:15,510
So this is three times three and then plus one and not three times three plus one which would be 12.
57

58
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,380
This would be three times four.
58

59
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:23,440
There's gonna be a whole separate video dedicated to order of operations and how to override order of
59

60
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,510
operations using parentheses.
60

61
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:31,600
So for now just keep in mind that order of operations is something important to keep in mind when doing
61

62
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,900
arithmetic with Python and I will talk more about it in a few videos.
62

63
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:43,930
The last arithmetic operation that I'm going to discuss in this video is division.
63

64
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:48,030
Now the way that division works is kind of like forming a fraction.
64

65
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:54,610
So what you want to do is convert every division into a numerator and denominator and make that be a
65

66
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,640
fraction and then you use this slash operator.
66

67
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,290
So for example three divided by four looks like this.
67

68
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:09,250
It's like you're writing out the fraction three fourths. So we can see that is point seven five and you
68

69
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:13,220
have to be careful that it's the forward slash and not the backslash.
69

70
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:18,790
So if you did the wrong slash if you did it this way then that's going to give you an error.
70

71
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,430
Again this is maybe not the most informative error but in this case I do know that we are trying to
71

72
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,780
do division.
72

73
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:32,870
So it seems reasonable to suspect that we might be using the other slash operator here.
73

74
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,470
So that looks nice.
74

75
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:41,620
The last thing that I want to point out before getting to the exercises for this video is using parentheses
75

76
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,680
for implementing arithmetic like this.
76

77
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:50,410
The main use of parentheses is to group certain numbers together.
77

78
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:55,770
There are other uses of parentheses in Python and you will learn about those later in the course.
78

79
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:02,690
So for example let's say we wanted to compute one plus three divided by four.
79

80
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:07,260
So if you would say one plus three divided by four.
80

81
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:13,260
The answer here is actually one point seventy five and that makes sense because python is grouping these
81

82
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:18,930
two together and then it's adding of the one. Again, that's because of the order of operations which you
82

83
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,690
will learn about later.
83

84
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:27,510
But if you want the one plus three to be in the numerator then you would use parentheses like this.
84

85
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:35,880
Now you are specifically telling Python to group these two numbers together in this operation and then
85

86
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,540
divide by four.
86

87
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,460
And it might even be useful to use the spacing here to indicate that.
87

88
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,990
Now we have one plus three grouped together divided by four.
88

89
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:52,950
And of course the answer here is going to be one because one plus three is four divided by four is one.
89

90
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:02,720
There are two exercises for this video and that is basically to implement these two expressions here
90

91
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,750
and figure out what the answers are.
91

92
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:12,500
So what I encourage you to do now is pause the video write out these equations in Python and make sure
92

93
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:18,350
you get the right answer. So pause the video, have a go at it, and then come back to the video and you can
93

94
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,570
watch me solve these two problems
94

95
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:23,550
okay.
95

96
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:27,100
So I'm going to give myself a new cell here.
96

97
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:31,440
So here was the first problem it was five minus...
97

98
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,440
and now I'm going to use parentheses just to make sure that we are doing the right thing.
98

99
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,820
So two divided by four times the fraction
99

100
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,990
three divided by five.
100

101
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,780
And the answer there is four point seven.
101

102
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:49,980
And then the second problem was four minus five divided by....
102

103
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:55,810
and this one's a little bit tricky because the wrong way to do this would be to say three plus five
103

104
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,060
times six.
104

105
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:01,120
And the reason why that's wrong it's sort of visually looks like it should be right.
105

106
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:07,390
But python is going to group these numbers together this operation together and then it's going to add
106

107
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,860
five times six.
107

108
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:15,680
But we want three plus five times six all to be in the denominator.
108

109
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:23,140
So now I'm going to put those in parentheses and that gives me a funny looking answer of minus zero
109

110
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:31,890
point 0 3 0 3 0 3 0 3 and so on is pretty funny number. So in this video I showed you how to implement basic
110

111
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:40,560
arithmetic in Python essentially using python as a calculator. Of course python is way way way more powerful
111

112
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:45,170
than just a basic calculator but that's the way to start. In the next video,
112

113
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,930
you're going to learn how to use variables in place of numbers.
113

114
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:54,690
And that's going to help bring you to a new level of using Python to learn mathematics.
