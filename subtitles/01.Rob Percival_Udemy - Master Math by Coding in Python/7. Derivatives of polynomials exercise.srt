00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:10,870
This video contains the exercise corresponding to computing derivatives of polynomials that you learned

2
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:18,010
about in the previous video and in particular what you want to do in this exercise is implement these

3
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,370
two functions f of x and G of X.

4
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,300
You can see these are two polynomials.

5
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:29,980
So implement these functions in simplify and then you want to demonstrate the product rule and the summation

6
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,120
rule of derivatives.

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,440
So what do these two concepts mean.

8
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:41,680
So if you wanted to add two functions so f of x plus G of X and then take the derivative of those functions

9
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:42,980
added together.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:52,570
So this is the quantity f plus g prime OR THE DERIVATIVE OF F plus G then that is simply f prime plus

11
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:53,940
g prime now.

12
00:00:53,950 --> 00:01:00,310
That's really great because mathematics sometimes just like life works simply and exactly the way you

13
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,120
think it should work.

14
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,080
So f plus g prime equals f prime plus g prime.

15
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,390
Now we get to multiplication on the other hand.

16
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:16,540
Mathematics also like life is sometimes not quite as simple as you naively expect it to be.

17
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,550
So f times geez.

18
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:26,320
So this function times this function and then the derivative of that is not equal to the derivative

19
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,980
of x times the derivative of G.

20
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:33,750
Instead it is equal to the derivative of x times G.

21
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:41,500
So the derivative of this function times this function not its derivative plus f times the derivative

22
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,520
of G.

23
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,740
So this is called the product rule.

24
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:52,060
So what you want to do is demonstrate the product rule so essentially go through these three equations

25
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:58,420
here and demonstrate that for these two functions this property whole or this I should say equality

26
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:03,410
holds this equality holds and this thing is not true here.

27
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:03,910
All right.

28
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:10,270
So switch to Python do a bit of coding and now I'm going to switch to Python and walk you through my

29
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,340
solution all right.

30
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:20,990
So we are going to need a variable X I'm going to say simple that symbols X and now I'm gonna start

31
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,130
by defining the two functions.

32
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:36,230
So f or f of x was three plus two times x minus five times x squared plus seven times X to the power

33
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,410
of four.

34
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:37,870
All right.

35
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,630
And then we have our second function G.

36
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:47,300
That was 4 times X squared plus X to the fifth power.

37
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:47,570
All right.

38
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:54,350
So as you know I like to run my code after running after writing a few lines just to make sure I haven't

39
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,330
already made mistakes.

40
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:56,800
So let's see.

41
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,570
So then we need the derivative of each functions.

42
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:10,430
I'm going to call that D X equals sim that diff of f and then D G equals since that diff of G and then

43
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:15,700
I also need a few other terms that are gonna simplify what I'm going to do in the future.

44
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,480
So I'm going to write the derivative of f times G.

45
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:30,470
So that is simple that diff of f times G said on multiplying the functions first and then computing

46
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:35,350
the derivative vs. computing the derivatives separately.

47
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:48,140
So that's going to be def times the G equals in that def of f time sim that def of G.

48
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:48,410
Okay.

49
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:54,110
So the whole point of this cell is basically just to setup all the possible variables that I will want

50
00:03:54,110 --> 00:04:01,910
to be using now that I have that I'm going to write out some later code to show some of these equalities

51
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,100
and see whether they hold.

52
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:10,690
Okay so let's start by writing display math and I'm moving on to start with a little bit of text here.

53
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:20,930
So I'm going to write with or without applying the product rules so this is going to be how things look

54
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:28,370
when you try to take the derivative of multiplied functions as the multiplication of the derivatives

55
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,150
of those functions.

56
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:35,620
So that's kind of like the the simple naive way that you think that the universe should work.

57
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,480
Let's see and then I'll put a little bit of space in here.

58
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:44,500
So this is going to be f times G primes.

59
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,620
So that's how I'm going to indicate the derivative here equals percent.

60
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,480
S Okay.

61
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:58,070
And now I want to replace percent s here with the derivative of f times G.

62
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,050
So that is this piece.

63
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,260
This simple object here.

64
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:06,900
So D F x g or f times G.

65
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:13,790
And then this should be the latex version to make it look nicer so sim that later.

66
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,090
Okay.

67
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:20,400
So we still have a bunch of product terms here multiply terms here.

68
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:29,340
So what I actually want to do is expand this and expand and that's going to simplify and get all of

69
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,380
these expressions out here.

70
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,820
So in other words multiply the two functions and then take their derivative.

71
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,580
Now the question is is that equal to this thing here.

72
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,430
Now without applying the product rule that is the simplistic way that you might think that it works.

73
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:54,170
So display math and then another quad just so you know I like to have a little bit of inventing here.

74
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:59,410
Whoops that's supposed to be single quotes and then like this.

75
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:09,290
So the question is when I say f prime times g prime and that is equal to.

76
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:17,400
And then on C I'll just copy and do a little bit of pasting here and now this variable is actually D

77
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,840
F underscore.

78
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:25,050
Times underscore DG okay I hope that makes sense what I'm doing here.

79
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:31,770
So I say without applying the product rule the question is whether this expression here is equal to

80
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:32,510
this expression.

81
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,890
And the answer is very clearly no.

82
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:35,310
Okay.

83
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:39,940
So now we are going to try applying the product rule that I just showed you.

84
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,980
So let's see.

85
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,980
I'm going to copy.

86
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,800
Actually I think I'll copy and paste all three of these lines.

87
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,840
So let's see this is with applying the product rule.

88
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,090
Now this part is the same.

89
00:06:54,090 --> 00:07:04,030
And then what I'm going to write here is F of prime times G plus f times g prime.

90
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,870
And now this is no longer the right thing here.

91
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,210
Instead I'm gonna need to write out a couple of terms here.

92
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:17,100
So this is going to be def times G plus f times the G.

93
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,190
Okay.

94
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,510
So now we are applying the product rule.

95
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:29,580
So the derivative of f times G is equal to the derivative of x of f times G plus f times the derivative

96
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,330
of G.

97
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:36,060
And that you can see in this example by matching up all of these numbers here and you can see that every

98
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,050
single one of them matches.

99
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:45,120
So this is a way to use python as a tool to reinforce the concept of the product rule.

100
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,560
And also I guess the summation rule but that one.

101
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,590
Oh wait I didn't actually apply this summation rule ups my apologies.

102
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,570
So let's also do that.

103
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,610
So we will write up here.

104
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,260
I'm going to put that variable here.

105
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:09,060
So that's going to be d of f plus GM and go do an underscore like this equals simple dot def of f plus

106
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:09,470
G.

107
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:16,370
So then the question is whether this term is equal to this plus this.

108
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:16,650
Okay.

109
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,130
So let's see here.

110
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,060
Going to write.

111
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:30,760
Display math and then f plus G and then prime equals percent.

112
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,080
Yes.

113
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,510
Let's see what it's equal to.

114
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:40,690
That's equal to sim that latex and then sim that expand.

115
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,040
And then that's this term here.

116
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:47,490
So D of f plus G.

117
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,510
So there we get this expression.

118
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,790
And now when I replace that for F prime.

119
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,180
Let's see.

120
00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:07,390
So this is going to be f prime plus g prime equals and then this is going to be the F plus DG.

121
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:07,750
All right.

122
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,630
And here we get the same answer.

123
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:15,220
So you can see that when adding functions the derivative is very simple you just add the derivatives

124
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:18,270
and when multiplying functions it's a little bit trickier.

125
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:27,170
You have to apply the product rule so in this and the previous video we exploit the derivative using

126
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:36,300
simple by using graphs in Python and using Python and latex as tools to help us understand the product

127
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,490
and some of different functions as it relates to the derivatives in the next video.

128
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:44,840
We're going to talk about derivatives of trigonometry functions.

129
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,200
So stay tuned.
