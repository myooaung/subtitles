1
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:11,200
In this video I'm going to introduce you to the idea of a system of equations.

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,840
If you're not already familiar with that.

3
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:20,560
And then I will explain that the key to solving a system of equations is to first convert that system

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,990
from a set of equations into a single matrix equation.

5
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:33,510
And in the exercise you will also see the three possibilities for solutions to a system of equations.

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,690
So what is a system of equations anyway.

7
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:41,140
Well it's just a set of coupled equations that might look something like this.

8
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:48,920
In this case in this particular example we have three equations and also three variables x y and z.

9
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:56,740
And the idea the reason why this is a system and not just three totally separate equations is that these

10
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,770
X's these Y's and these Zs are all exactly the same.

11
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:08,730
So any X that satisfies this equation also has to work for this equation and for this equation.

12
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,600
So these are coupled equations.

13
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,010
So how do you go about solving a system of equations like this.

14
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,790
If you're working with let's say two equations and two variables then solving a system of equations

15
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,140
can be pretty easy.

16
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,800
You just have to look at the numbers and make some educated guesses.

17
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,820
But for a larger system like this and for practical applications these systems of equations can get

18
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:34,900
huge.

19
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:39,430
It's really not feasible just to kind of try and guess and poke around a little bit.

20
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:45,670
So the solution is to convert this system of equations into a single matrix equation.

21
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,960
So that looks like this.

22
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,730
So here you see a matrix of vector equals another vector.

23
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,710
So this matrix comes from the coefficients on the left hand side.

24
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:00,790
So you can see all of the numbers that are multiplying these variables are the coefficients.

25
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,910
So the first row is two one minus one.

26
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:10,750
And here you see two one minus one and so on down here you have three four and two three four two and

27
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,030
one minus five and minus two.

28
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,560
And that you see here.

29
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,020
So this is the matrix of coefficients.

30
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,350
Here you see the vector of the variables.

31
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,900
So in this specific example there are three variables.

32
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:28,900
So you see one two three variables here and this is a vector on the right hand side of the equation

33
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:35,130
of the constants These are called the constants so 1 13 0 and that's just copied over here.

34
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:42,850
Now we can actually just rewrite this in a more general form by calling this matrix X. capital X. This

35
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:47,590
matrix beta and this matrix or this vector Y.

36
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:55,420
So in other words what we've done is convert this system of equations into a single equation where we

37
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,240
have matrices and vectors.

38
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,890
So here you see this form again.

39
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,430
So x times beta equals Y.

40
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:12,130
Now X is some matrix of known numbers Y is also known numbers but beta contains the unknown coefficients

41
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,420
X Y and Z.

42
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,430
So how do we solve for beta.

43
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,630
Well I actually introduced this concept to you in a previous video.

44
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:25,600
I think it was two videos ago where I talked about the matrix inverse and why we need a matrix inverse

45
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:29,500
now in this specific example that I showed here.

46
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,650
This is a three by three matrix.

47
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,060
So this matrix actually is in vertical.

48
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,310
We can compute x inverse and then solve for beta that way.

49
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:46,950
But we also need a more general solution that's going to work even if we have a rectangular shaped matrix.

50
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:52,540
So for example if you would just add a fourth equation here a fourth couple the equation.

51
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:58,710
Now this matrix is no longer in vertical and yet we still need to solve for beta somehow.

52
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,220
And that's where this solution comes in.

53
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:09,800
So it turns out that this solution so X transpose X and then this whole thing inverted times X transpose

54
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,960
times the vector Y.

55
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:19,190
So this is a general solution that will work regardless of whether x is square or rectangular.

56
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,780
This is called the least squares solution.

57
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:28,370
This is perhaps one of the most important equations in all of statistics the least squares solution.

58
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:36,740
It is the underlying solution to regression and Nova and general linear models and so on.

59
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:42,650
Now going through the proof that this really is the right solution and then it's the best way to solve

60
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:49,430
for b is a little bit outside the scope of this video it's not a terribly difficult proof but it's something

61
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,590
that takes a little bit more time to work through.

62
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:59,180
Instead what I want to focus on now is showing you how to implement this kind of a solution in python

63
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,980
what I'm going to do here is create exactly the system that I showed you in the slides.

64
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:15,000
So I'm gonna create the matrix X so that is a matrix it's a known pi array and it has three rows.

65
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,720
So this is gonna be the first row the second row and the third row.

66
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,650
And then the first row was to come one come up minus one.

67
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:27,490
The second row was three come a four comma two.

68
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:33,280
And the third row was one minus five and minus two.

69
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:38,230
So this was the matrix X and then we have the vector Y.

70
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:46,510
And that was 1 13 and 0 and then the idea was we need to solve for beta.

71
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,040
So how do we solve for beta.

72
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,860
So I'm going to do this in two ways.

73
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,630
And in fact maybe I'll call this beta 1.

74
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:58,780
So Lin LJ that in so what I'm gonna do first is implement the formula directly that I showed in the

75
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,590
slides.

76
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:12,640
So that was X transpose matrix multiplication with X and then matrix multiplication X transpose times

77
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,720
vector y.

78
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:14,750
Okay.

79
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:20,170
So I ran this cell and we don't get any errors so that's good I didn't make any silly little typos and

80
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,060
let's see what this result happens to be.

81
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:27,930
So Beta 1 so the solution happens to be 3 minus 1 and plus 4.

82
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:34,570
And if you like what you can do now is pause the video and go back to the slide where I showed the system

83
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:42,610
of equations and prove to yourself that when x equals three y equals minus one and z equals four That

84
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,520
all three of those equations are true.

85
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,720
Okay so this is a rather long way to write it out.

86
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,780
It turns out there's a shortcut which is also computationally more stable and that is I'll call that

87
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:02,330
beta 2 and that is to use known PI that Lin ouch dot solve.

88
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:10,030
So we are solving for a system of equations and then you simply input the coefficients matrix X and

89
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,130
the constants vector Y.

90
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,950
So this was the left hand side of the equation the right hand side of the equation and the output of

91
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:23,070
this solve function is going to be the data value and let's print this out.

92
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,120
So Beta 2 now.

93
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:32,350
No surprise we get exactly the same solution whether we use this method or this method.

94
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:38,890
Now in practice this method is better not only because it's fewer characters to write out but also because

95
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:45,790
here we are explicitly inverting this matrix and Matrix inversion is something that's best avoided whenever

96
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,690
possible.

97
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:54,340
So Python has advanced numerical processing libraries that actually figure out how to solve this set

98
00:07:54,340 --> 00:08:03,110
of equations without using the explicit matrix inverse the exercise for this video is to implement these

99
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:10,220
three different systems and compute their results analytically as I just showed you in Python and also

100
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,380
geometrically by plotting.

101
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,460
So what do you want to do here.

102
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:20,210
So what you want to do is first implement each of these systems of equations as matrix vector equations

103
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,590
in Python.

104
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,430
So I already showed you how to do that.

105
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:27,100
In that example of a three by three system of equations.

106
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,470
So three equations in three variables.

107
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,960
And this is even a little bit easier because here you have two equations in two variables.

108
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,490
And just note that this is a system.

109
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:41,090
This system is totally separate from this system.

110
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:45,450
That's why I call this X1 and X2 and X3.

111
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,340
So these two are the same.

112
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:54,140
These two are the same x2 and x 2 These two are the same because this is its own system but the solution

113
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:59,150
to this system is not going to be the same as the solution to this system.

114
00:08:59,180 --> 00:08:59,480
Okay.

115
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,370
So implement these three systems.

116
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:05,790
That's part 1 part 2 is to solve for x and y.

117
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:12,710
And again each of these systems needs its own separate solution and then part 3 is to draw lines for

118
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,940
each equation.

119
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:23,540
So each of these equations can be represented as a line in a two dimensional space so an x y axis and

120
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,750
to get that to work to be able to plot this in a line.

121
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:32,960
You're gonna need to do a little bit of algebra first and that's because this is not the typical expression

122
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,190
that you see for a line.

123
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:40,330
Typically you see the form of Y equals M X plus B.

124
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:44,920
And of course I had a couple of videos about this in an earlier section of the course.

125
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,990
I think it was algebra 2.

126
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,950
So you're gonna need to do a little bit of conversion to be able to plot lines but once you do you can

127
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,440
see that there's two equations.

128
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:58,670
So for each system there's going to be two separate lines on the plot.

129
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,030
All right.

130
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,560
So good luck.

131
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,270
Switch to Python write some code.

132
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:08,660
This exercise is a little bit more challenging than many the other sect exercises in this course but

133
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,370
I believe that you can do it.

134
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:22,670
I am going to start by creating the variables x 1 and why 1 and x 2 and Y 2 and so on so x 1 was a known

135
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,420
pi array.

136
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:31,450
So a matrix and it's going to have 2 rows and in fact I think to make this even easier for myself I'm

137
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,960
going to write out this like these shells.

138
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:42,800
So this is X and Y and then I'm going to copy and paste and so then it's gonna be easy for me to replace

139
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,780
this with system 1 system 2 and system 3.

140
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:57,380
So let's see system 1 was the first row was 3 minus 1 and the second row was minus 1 1 and then why

141
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,850
it was 6 and 2.

142
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:05,220
Okay then we get to System 2 that had coefficients 3 comma minus 1.

143
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,530
You can see that a lot of these systems are pretty similar.

144
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:12,410
They're not exactly identical but they are pretty close to each other.

145
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,660
This was six comma three four why.

146
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:22,060
And then here we had and I believe this one was exactly the same as system two in terms of the coefficient.

147
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:27,640
So one point five comma minus point five.

148
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,610
And then this was 6 and 2.

149
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,780
So in fact the only difference between system 2 and system 3 was this one number here.

150
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:37,150
All right.

151
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:48,010
So that is all of our x's and y's and what I'm going to do next is generate the plot and solve for the

152
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,680
solution for each one of these systems separately.

153
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,560
So let's go for Case 1.

154
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,670
So this is set 1.

155
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,320
So the first thing I'm going to do is plot.

156
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:05,890
So we need to convert to Y equals M X plus B format.

157
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,120
So this one is a little bit tricky to figure out but I hope you managed to solve it.

158
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:20,310
So I'm gonna call this variable y y 1 because this is going to be the y coordinates for equation y one.

159
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:31,620
So if you write this all out it turns out to be x 1 0 0 divided by x 1 0 comma 1 times.

160
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:43,470
Well we need to specify some X limit which I haven't yet specified plus y 1 0 divided by x 1 0 comma

161
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,260
1.

162
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:44,660
Okay.

163
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,020
So let me create an X limit variable here.

164
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:56,670
So we are going to draw the plots on the x axis from zero to 10.

165
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:57,060
Okay.

166
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,730
So let me take a moment to explain what this equation means.

167
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:07,630
Essentially we need to convert this equation into Y equals M X plus B.

168
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:14,590
And so the way to do that is to subtract the coefficient for x 1 from both sides so we say minus.

169
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:21,430
In this case 3 x 1 and subtract that from both sides and then divide by whatever is the coefficient

170
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,570
on y one.

171
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:30,520
So then this entire right hand side of the equation needs to be divided by the coefficient for y one.

172
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,030
And that's what I'm doing here.

173
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:43,230
So this is the minus X coefficient here and then I'm dividing by the Y 1 coefficient here.

174
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:43,480
Okay.

175
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,890
So this was for the first equation in system 1.

176
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,070
So then I'm going to copy and paste this for the second equation.

177
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:58,840
So the second equation is exactly the same code except we use the second row instead of the first row.

178
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:03,270
So I'm just replacing these first zeros with ones okay.

179
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:08,350
And again run the cell C that I didn't make any silly typos to get Python errors.

180
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:18,070
And now let's generate the plot so I will write P L T dot plot x limb and y y 1 and let's make this

181
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:27,940
a blue line and the label is going to be equation 1 and then copy paste all of this stuff is the same.

182
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,640
Well a lot of it is the same.

183
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,720
I'm gonna make it a red line and this is now equation 2.

184
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,230
Okay.

185
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,120
And then I'm going to activate the legend.

186
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:45,070
I'm going to make a grid and let's see what this thing looks like.

187
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:45,370
All right.

188
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,220
This is pretty interesting.

189
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:53,170
It looks like these two lines corresponding to these two equations actually meet they cross each other

190
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:56,040
right here and that is no coincidence.

191
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:03,340
It turns out that if you draw a line corresponding to each of the equations in a system of equations

192
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:09,640
then the solution to that system of equations is exactly where the lines cross each other.

193
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:15,680
So the solution here is you know X equals 4 and Y equals.

194
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,020
Maybe this is 6.

195
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:20,630
Okay so let's see what the exact solution is.

196
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:26,350
So I'm going to solve the system.

197
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:37,300
So I'll call that B for beta equals and Peter Lin alleged solve and then this is x1 and y one and when

198
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:45,970
I'm going to do now is both print out the solution and I'm also going to put a draw a dot on this plot

199
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:56,620
where the solution is so P L T dot plot and this is going to be the x component of B and the y component

200
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:04,180
of B and let's make this a black circle and I'll make this a nice big circle and then we have to give

201
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:08,020
this a label and the label is going to be the solution.

202
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,660
All right that was pretty cool.

203
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:17,030
So the solution turns out to be for 6 and we see that that solution geometrically is the location where

204
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:19,490
these two lines intersect.

205
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:20,270
Very nice.

206
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:29,960
So now what I'm going to do is just copy and paste all of this code because System 2 is essentially

207
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:35,360
the same so the code is of course all the same but we just need to be really careful about changing

208
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:42,770
all of these ones into twos so this becomes a two that becomes a two.

209
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:49,490
Here and here and I want to be really careful to check that I don't need this anymore.

210
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:56,790
I almost missed this one has to be 2 and 2 also super important and everything else looks good.

211
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:57,560
Mm hmm.

212
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,210
Here we get an error.

213
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:05,390
This says singular matrix and we only actually see one line here so what is going on.

214
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:12,260
Let's see first of all I'm going to just comment out this code so we can take a closer look at what's

215
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,330
going on here.

216
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:18,980
I'm going to change this from a solid red line into a dashed red line.

217
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:25,400
And the reason why I did that is so you can see that both of these lines are oversight are overlapping

218
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:30,110
So in fact these two equations are exactly the same.

219
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,470
And that's actually visible when you just look at them.

220
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:39,080
Maybe you notice this or maybe you hadn't noticed it yet but if you take the second equation and multiply

221
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,040
it by 2 you're going to get exactly this equation.

222
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,310
So what does that mean.

223
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:49,020
That means that there is an infinite number of solutions to this system.

224
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:55,130
There is no unique solution because you know the solution is where these two lines intersect.

225
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,290
But these two lines intersect everywhere.

226
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:02,170
In fact there isn't a single point where these two lines do not intersect.

227
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:02,450
Okay.

228
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,850
So in fact nothing went wrong here.

229
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,470
We didn't make any coding errors.

230
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,010
We didn't do anything wrong.

231
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:11,420
This is simply a degenerate system of equations.

232
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:17,750
It has an infinite number of solutions and therefore it's not actually a terribly interesting set of

233
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,610
system of equations.

234
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:24,560
Okay so let's see what's going on with the 3rd system.

235
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,420
So again all of the code is the same.

236
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:36,080
We just need to be really really careful about changing all of these ones to threes where appropriate.

237
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,190
So let's see there.

238
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,020
And in solving.

239
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,690
And let's see what's happening here.

240
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,280
Oh another error.

241
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,040
Mm hmm.

242
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:45,200
Another singular matrix.

243
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:51,170
And here we get a slightly different picture now the two lines corresponding to these two equations

244
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,280
in this system are parallel.

245
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,980
They never touch.

246
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:59,240
So that means that there is no solution to this system of equations.

247
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,220
This system of equations does not have a unique solution.

248
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:13,810
There is no set of x and y values that can simultaneously satisfy both of those equations I hope you

249
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:17,430
found this lecture interesting and insightful.

250
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:25,810
I covered a system of equations how to solve a system of equations by converting it into a matrix equation.

251
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:32,740
And in the exercise you saw the three possibilities for solutions to a system of equations.
