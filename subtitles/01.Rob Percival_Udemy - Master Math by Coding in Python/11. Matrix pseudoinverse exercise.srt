1
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:09,830
This video follows up on the previous video about computing the matrix inverse.

2
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:16,310
In this video I'm going to extend that and also get into the exercise by talking about something called

3
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:17,770
these pseudo inverse.

4
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:22,680
So these pseudo inverse is an alternative procedure to the inverse.

5
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:28,310
And it's basically what you apply when you don't have a fully in vertical matrix.

6
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:34,420
And the idea of a pseudo inverse is that it gets you as close as possible to a full inverse.

7
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:40,760
And it's not necessarily a full inverse in some cases these pseudo inverse actually does act as a full

8
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,660
inverse.

9
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:48,780
And in other cases the pseudo inverse is basically just like the best approximation to a full inverse.

10
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:55,130
These pseudo inverse is often indicated with an asterisk or sometimes with a dagger in the superscript

11
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,670
instead of a minus one.

12
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,650
So what you want to do in the exercise for this video is compute the pseudo inverse and make images

13
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:12,090
of a and a inverse pseudo inverse and a times a pseudo inverse for the following two matrices.

14
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:18,680
First of all a five by five matrix or a matrix with five rows and five columns that contains random

15
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,290
integers between minus five and plus five.

16
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,580
So it's going to be lots of fives in this matrix.

17
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:31,610
And importantly you want to set the first column to be equal to the second column and then the second

18
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:38,780
case the second exercise here is to create a five by seven matrix of Gaussian distributed random numbers

19
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:44,070
are normally distributed random numbers and compute it's pseudo inverse.

20
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:49,910
Now I haven't actually told you how to compute these pseudo inverse in Python so you are going to have

21
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:55,590
to do a little bit of guesswork maybe a little bit of Internet searching but it shouldn't be too difficult.

22
00:01:55,610 --> 00:02:01,730
You have to just figure out what is the name of the function that computes these pseudo inverse.

23
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,120
All right.

24
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:09,940
So now is the opportunity to pause the video switch to Python rights and code explore these pseudo inverse.

25
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:18,650
And now I'm going to switch to Python so let's get started by creating a new cell down here.

26
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,720
Actually I don't really like looking at all these error messages.

27
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:29,720
So I think I'm going to just fix this very quickly because this is a much nicer screen to look at.

28
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,230
Let's see.

29
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:35,880
So we want m equals five AND THEN A it's gonna be our random number.

30
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:43,040
So it's going to be random that Rand end and then minus.

31
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:49,890
I think I'll even do it this way minus M to M plus 1 and then it's going to be an m by m matrix.

32
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,010
Today is the day of the m.

33
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:55,220
I hope you use the word the letter M a lot today.

34
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:55,490
All right.

35
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,820
And let's just see what this matrix looks like.

36
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,090
Okay.

37
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,240
So it's a five by five matrix and lots of numbers you can see the smallest number is minus five the

38
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,740
largest number is five.

39
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,870
So that looks pretty good.

40
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:17,120
Now what we want to do is set the first column to be a a repeat of the second column and so we actually

41
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,280
did that in the previous video.

42
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:26,570
So that's something like this and now we print printed again and you see that all these numbers look

43
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,090
random.

44
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:31,220
And then this column is the same as this column.

45
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:31,520
All right.

46
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:38,260
So we already discovered in the previous video that this matrix does not have an inverse.

47
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:44,420
And in fact if you try to compute a inverse what am I doing here.

48
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,620
Lin announced that in.

49
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,450
We are going to get an error message.

50
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:48,900
OK.

51
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:55,330
However we can compute a pseudo inverse and the function is actually pretty straightforward.

52
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,710
It's p enough and you just input the matrix.

53
00:03:59,720 --> 00:03:59,880
OK.

54
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:06,980
So I'm going to call this a P in because this is these pseudo inverse and let's have a look at this

55
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:12,980
thing Woops I meant to write print P in.

56
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,080
There you go.

57
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:14,890
Okay.

58
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,400
Well you know it still just looks like a random collection of numbers still.

59
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:25,710
It is difficult to or basically impossible to look at this matrix and just by I say something about

60
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:31,190
the relationship between this matrix the pseudo inverse and the original matrix.

61
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,240
Now let's see what these look like.

62
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:43,560
So I'm going to set up another figure with three subplots or subplots one by three and then just like

63
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:54,270
in the previous video I'm gonna set the first subplot to show a and the title is going to be that title

64
00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:01,350
a and then a little bit of copy paste.

65
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:06,150
So this is the second or the third subplot.

66
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,360
And the second subplot and here I'm going to show a P in.

67
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,750
So this is going to be a.

68
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:18,980
And then with later coding an asterisk in the superscript.

69
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:25,770
And actually let me I would I'm curious to see what these look like before moving on.

70
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:26,170
Okay.

71
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,030
So here we have a.

72
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,360
And the pseudo inverse of A.

73
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:30,640
All right.

74
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:38,380
So now let us compute the matrix times its inverse of eight times a P in.

75
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:45,430
So and then this is going to be a little bit of copy paste here.

76
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,300
All right.

77
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,270
Pretty interesting this thing.

78
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,860
Whoops I see I made this same mistake again.

79
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,760
This has to be an ad symbol for matrix multiplication.

80
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,260
Okay this looks more like what I expected.

81
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:02,330
So you can see that this is definitely not the identity matrix.

82
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:07,330
However you can also see that it's like it's trying to look like the identity matrix.

83
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:12,990
You can see that the diagonal is large and the off diagonal elements are smaller.

84
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,040
So let's also see I'm going to print this out so we can see what this looks like.

85
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,770
Let's see print this out here.

86
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,710
And I don't really care about printing out this matrix.

87
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:23,840
Okay.

88
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:28,720
So this matrix is a times these pseudo inverse of A.

89
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:34,960
And if you look at the diagonals in fact you know what I'm gonna do to make this more clear I'm going

90
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,190
to say none pay it up.

91
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:41,500
Round and round this to let's say one significant digit.

92
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:41,790
Okay.

93
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:47,890
Now when you look at this matrix you can see the diagonals here this is one close to one not really

94
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,740
close to one and exactly one.

95
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,030
And this one is close to one.

96
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:57,610
And the off diagonal elements are not exactly zero but you can see that they round to zero when looking

97
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,880
at one significant digit.

98
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:00,140
Okay.

99
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:06,760
And now if we do let's say two significant digits you can still see that you know this matrix is trying

100
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,370
to be the identity matrix.

101
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,900
It's just not quite good enough.

102
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,170
All right.

103
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:17,440
So I would like to get rid of these tick marks so I'm going to remind you of a little trick that I've

104
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:23,350
introduced you to before and that is basically by treating this axis as an integral.

105
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:31,090
So I'm going to loop through this should say in going to loop through all of the axes individually and

106
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,270
turn off the axis.

107
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,890
So there you go.

108
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,580
So this was the first part of the exercise.

109
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:44,770
The second part of the exercise was to create a five by seven matrix.

110
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:50,500
So we we want to comment on this part because we don't need to change the relationship between the columns

111
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:54,070
but I am going to make this m plus two.

112
00:07:54,070 --> 00:08:00,340
So this ends up being a five by seven matrix and we will also print this thing out.

113
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:01,650
Okay.

114
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,420
So here you see what this matrix looks like.

115
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:09,020
It's definitely not a square matrix harm but this is interesting.

116
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:14,650
It looks like when we compute these pseudo inverse of this matrix and multiply the matrix by its pseudo

117
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:19,300
inverse we still get exactly the identity matrix.

118
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,910
So that is pretty interesting.

119
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:25,600
And we can also confirm that if we tried to do this with the regular inverse.

120
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:32,650
So not these pseudo inverse then we get an error and it says well it's not possible to compute the full

121
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,200
inverse of this matrix.

122
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:41,530
However it turns out that for this kind of a matrix A times A pseudo inverse still gives us the proper

123
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:46,670
identity matrix Oh and you know I just realized that I I failed.

124
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,040
I didn't do this exercise correctly.

125
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,750
The exercise was actually supposed to be to create Gaussian distributed random numbers.

126
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,640
That is actually something like this Rand and.

127
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,470
Okay.

128
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,230
I hope you caught that mistake nonetheless.

129
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,560
That doesn't change the end conclusion.

130
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:12,550
We still see that a random numbers matrix times it's pseudo inverse.

131
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:20,240
Even if that original matrix is not in vertical because it's not square these pseudo inverse times the

132
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:27,840
full matrix does give us the identity matrix in this video and the previous video you learned about

133
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,040
the matrix inverse and you also learned about these pseudo inverse.

134
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:39,510
I introduced you to y a matrix inverse is necessary basically to solve equations matrix equations.

135
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:43,250
I showed you the two conditions for a matrix to have an inverse.

136
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:50,040
So it has to be square and every column has to be unique and I introduce you to the idea of a pseudo

137
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,860
inverse.

138
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:57,240
Now obviously there is a lot a lot a lot more that can be said about the matrix inverse and the pseudo

139
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:03,660
inverse but I hope you found that this video and the previous video was an interesting introduction

140
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,910
to the concept of the matrix inverse.
