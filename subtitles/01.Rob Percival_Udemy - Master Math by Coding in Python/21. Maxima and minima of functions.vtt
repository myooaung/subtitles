00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:10.720
In this video I'm going to show you how to identify the maximum points and the minimum points of a function.

2
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.760
Those are also called maxima and minima in plural and together these are called the extreme.

3
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.330
So the extreme points of a function.

4
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.370
So basically here's what that looks like.

5
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:28.260
Imagine you have some graphs some function that looks like this or maybe it looks like this.

6
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.730
And what we want to do is identify the maximum so the largest point and the minimum which is the smallest

7
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:35.440
point.

8
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:35.930
All right.

9
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.890
So let's switch to Python and just immediately dive right in.

10
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.610
I'm going to be using some functions in the known pi module and then I'm also going to be doing some

11
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.170
plotting some importing the matte plot lib pi plot module.

12
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:58.140
So before getting to the interesting mathematical functions I want to show you how to identify the Maxima

13
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.570
and minimum of a list of numbers.

14
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.530
So start by creating a list.

15
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.160
So let's say about minus four and five point five.

16
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:13.530
And just go for one in three that I say three I meant to say two.

17
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.400
So the question is what is the maximum in this list.

18
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.290
What is the largest value in this list.

19
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.950
Now obviously you just look at these numbers and you can see that it's 5.5 but we need a better way

20
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.110
a more algorithmic way to identify the maximum.

21
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:34.310
And that's because you might have a really really long list of numbers maybe you have a list of numbers

22
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.290
that's imported from a dataset or generated from some mathematical function.

23
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.540
So it's not really sufficient or it's not scalable just to look at this thing and determine what the

24
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.190
maximum is.

25
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.210
So we can find the maximum using the NUM pi function Max.

26
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:58.010
So you just input the list or the array the variable and that tells you what the largest value is.

27
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.580
So no big surprise there.

28
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.140
I'm gonna set the output of this to be a variable called Max Val.

29
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.460
Okay.

30
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.150
But now the question is where is this maximum value located.

31
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.770
Now obviously you know what this little toy example you can just look at it and you can say well it's

32
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:16.900
the second number.

33
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.820
So it's index number one.

34
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:26.510
However if you would try to write list Max Val this is going to produce an error and the error says

35
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:36.200
that list indices must be integers or slices and that's actually pretty sensible because it is not possible

36
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.730
or doesn't even make sense to talk about the 5.5 ith element of this list.

37
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:49.250
So we need a way not only to identify the maximum value but also identify the location where that maximum

38
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:59.600
value occurs and to do that we use another function called end p dot ARG Max and the ARG is for argument

39
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.110
not argument like getting into a fight with someone but an argument is kind of an old school math term

40
00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.140
for the output.

41
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.830
Okay.

42
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.350
So now ARG Max list tells us the number one.

43
00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.200
So what does this mean.

44
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.650
Obviously this is not the maximum value.

45
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:21.290
Instead this is the index into this list where the maximum value is found.

46
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:27.680
So now I'm going to call this variable Max Val Ida X for index and now I can write list.

47
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:37.880
Max Val Ida X and this tells me that the element in the position Max Val Ida X is the maximum value.

48
00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:38.210
All right.

49
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:45.020
So with that as a background let's move on to some interesting mathematical functions.

50
00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:51.020
Oh and I didn't go through minimum but that's actually exactly the same you just type men and ARG men

51
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.640
instead of Max and arc Max.

52
00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.050
Otherwise the concept is exactly the same.

53
00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.350
All right.

54
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.500
So I'm going to make an interesting looking function.

55
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.270
I think it's interesting looking I hope you agree it is a cosigner.

56
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.600
The cosine of X plus the square root of x.

57
00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.880
So what is x here.

58
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:22.150
Well let's define x to be linearly spaced numbers from 0 to 2 times pi and let's go for 20 points.

59
00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.630
Okay.

60
00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.630
And now I'm going to make a plot.

61
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:31.820
So BLT dot plot x by F of X and then show the plots.

62
00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.070
All right.

63
00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.800
Now the maximum of this function is actually located all the way up here it's the very last point.

64
00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.050
I think that's slightly less interesting.

65
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:47.930
So what I'm going to do is actually flip this entire functions I'm going to say minus but not just minus

66
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.590
the cosine part minus the entire function.

67
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.200
So now we get this function and this is the maximum here.

68
00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:03.000
So now let's identify the maximum value and the index at which that maximum value occurs.

69
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:12.770
So say I call this f Max Four function Max that equals num piled up Max function and F Max Ida X equals

70
00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.470
num pi dot ARG Max F X okay.

71
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.220
And now before worrying about plotting I want to print these out just to make sure that we are getting

72
00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.570
sensible results and not making any errors.

73
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.930
Okay.

74
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:35.630
So f Max is minus point seven and that seems pretty plausible based on the y axis here and F Max Ida

75
00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:36.800
X is 9.

76
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.480
Now remember this is not the value here.

77
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.900
This is the value of X. This is the vector x that goes from 0 to 2 pi.

78
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:51.910
So 9 is telling us that it's the ninth index which is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9.

79
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.880
So I guess at this point here.

80
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.290
All right.

81
00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:01.070
So now what I want to do is plot a dot on that maximum value and actually first I want to make sure

82
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.330
that this is going to be.

83
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.390
Let's make this blue circles with lines connecting them.

84
00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:06.190
Okay.

85
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:15.350
So then I'm gonna write P L T dot plot so the index f Max Ida X by the maximum value which is f Max

86
00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.970
and let's make this a red square.

87
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:23.300
Now before I run this code I would like you to think about whether this is going to work or whether

88
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.460
it's not going to work now based on the fact that I even asked you that question.

89
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:32.750
You can probably guess that it's not going to work although it's not going to crash.

90
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.340
This is not an invalid line of code.

91
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:41.470
There's nothing wrong with this code in terms of pure coding but it's not going to give the right answer.

92
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.260
In fact it plots a dot all the way over here.

93
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:51.950
And what I've done wrong is I'm just plotting the index but really this is the index into the x axis

94
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.570
coordinate so x.

95
00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:03.230
So in fact this has to be X and then the F Max idea axis index into the variable x.

96
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.760
All right.

97
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.960
And now that looks pretty good.

98
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:11.570
I see it was this point not this point because I was counting from one here in count instead of counting

99
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:12.240
from zero.

100
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.860
Typical mistake.

101
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:20.750
So now I'd like to go through one more example in this case using the minimum function.

102
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:28.670
So here I'm going to generate the function f of x to be a polynomial so this is going to be X cubed

103
00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.800
plus X to the fourth power.

104
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.150
And now here I want X to be different.

105
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:37.400
X is not going to be in radians.

106
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:42.990
This is in radians because this is a trigonometric function here I'm gonna specify X to be.

107
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:53.210
Let's just go from minus to minus two to plus two in how about fifty one steps because 50 is a pretty

108
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:54.330
boring number.

109
00:07:54.590 --> 00:08:04.110
So let's start by plotting this function P.L. teed up plot x by F of X again with blue circles.

110
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:07.330
And here is what that function looks like.

111
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.920
Now you don't really see where the minimum is right.

112
00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:16.490
It looks like this function goes up on the left it goes up to the right and it just kind of generally

113
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.090
looks flat down here.

114
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:25.520
However there is an actual minimum in here it's just not visibly apparent when looking at the function

115
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.330
with this y axis scale.

116
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:35.300
So I'm going to change the scale to be able to zoom in here so P L T that X line let's change the excellent

117
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:38.710
to go from how about is going to be somewhere around here.

118
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:42.930
So let's go from minus one point to two.

119
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.460
Maybe I'll do How about zero.

120
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:50.170
All right so you still don't really see that there's a clear minimum point.

121
00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:53.150
And again that's because of the y axis.

122
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:57.610
So let's also change the y axis BLT the X Lim.

123
00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:03.550
And let's set that one from minus point to two plus point two.

124
00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:06.700
Now you can see that there is a minimum here.

125
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:11.990
I'm going to stretch this out a little bit past zero about point five okay.

126
00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.300
So this is starting to look pretty interesting now.

127
00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:20.180
You can definitely see where the minimum point is it's over here and now you just have to be careful

128
00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:24.160
with the interpretation because I cut off part of this graph.

129
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:32.420
So in fact this point here is not the zero one two three four fifth element or index number five because

130
00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.330
there's a bunch of other points off here to the left.

131
00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:35.620
All right.

132
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:41.060
And now just in the interest of variability I'm going to do this in a slightly different way so I'm

133
00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:46.340
gonna plot the minimum point in a slightly different way from how I did it here up here.

134
00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:54.770
I computed the maximum value and the maximum index here I'm only going to compute the maximum value.

135
00:09:54.920 --> 00:10:06.640
Sorry the maximum index so F men Ida X equals num PI that ARG Min F X now a question is if I don't actually

136
00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:11.500
extract the value using the main function how can I generate this plot.

137
00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:14.410
How can I put a dot here on the minimum value.

138
00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:22.600
So the way that I'm going to do that is by indexing not only on X. But also indexing on y indexing the

139
00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.540
function so P L teed up plot.

140
00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:31.430
So we want this is still going to be F by F of X and it's going to be a red square.

141
00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:40.900
However we only want one specific point in X and that is f man Ida X and the exact same index of f of

142
00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:44.670
x F men Ida X like this.

143
00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:45.820
All right.

144
00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.090
So that works and that looks pretty good.

145
00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:54.040
And you know I think I'll even crop this a little bit lower just so it's even more apparent that this

146
00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.080
is the real minimum.

147
00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:59.930
So let's set this to be zero Mm mm mm.

148
00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:03.600
Still looks like both of these are like competing for the smallest number.

149
00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:07.130
How about minus point once times with these functions.

150
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:09.020
You really have to zoom in pretty closely.

151
00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.890
Let's call this one point two.

152
00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:12.190
Okay.

153
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:17.780
Now you really see when you zoom in super duper a lot you really see that this is definitely the minimum

154
00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:20.000
point.

155
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.960
And with that as background knowledge you are now ready to complete the exercise for this video.

156
00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:33.620
The exercise for this video is to implement this function minus the cosine of X minus the square root

157
00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.510
of x in the domain.

158
00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:41.170
So with the x values going from zero up to this looks like it's about thirty eight or so.

159
00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:45.430
This turns out to be 12 pi if you want to reproduce this graph exactly.

160
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:53.150
You have to go up to 12 pi and then what you want to do is find each of these individual local peaks.

161
00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:57.300
So previously I showed you how to find the global maximum.

162
00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:01.670
That was just the one largest point of the function here.

163
00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:06.950
You want to find all of the local maxima and the hint is that you use the function.

164
00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:08.180
Find peaks.

165
00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:14.690
Now that's actually not so much of a huge help for you because I didn't tell you or I'm not telling

166
00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:18.120
you where to find the find peaks function.

167
00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.320
So it's in some modules somewhere you have to figure that out.

168
00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:26.390
And I'm also not going to tell you how to use this function you have to figure that out as well.

169
00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:28.010
All right so pause the video.

170
00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:34.250
Figure out how to use the fine peaks function and reproduce this plot based on this function.

171
00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:39.350
And now I'm going to switch to Python and I will show you how I solved this.

172
00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:48.250
You have probably discovered that the find peaks function is located in the CI pi signal module.

173
00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:54.470
So from side by signal import the find peaks function.

174
00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:54.750
All right.

175
00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:58.380
So let's start by specifying the X range.

176
00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:00.180
So that's num pi.

177
00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:04.020
Lynn space 0 2 12 times pi.

178
00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:08.780
And let's go How about two hundred and eleven.

179
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:14.870
Now let's go for two hundred and thirteen linearly spaced steps between 0 and 12 pi.

180
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:24.550
So then the function is going to be minus cosine of X minus the square root of x.

181
00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:24.920
All right.

182
00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:31.490
So before worrying about this fine peaks business I'm going to generate a plot just to make sure that

183
00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:37.920
I haven't made any errors and I'm getting the right answer so far.

184
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:43.350
Visualization of data and in particular mathematical functions is super important.

185
00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.550
The importance cannot be underestimated.

186
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.820
All right.

187
00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:50.980
So this is looking good it looks like the function that I showed in these slides.

188
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:51.910
All right.

189
00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:55.380
So now let's have a look at this fine peaks function.

190
00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.160
So I'm gonna call his output variable peaks.

191
00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:08.210
A misspelling peaks intentionally peaks equals find peaks of X and I want I want to do is print out

192
00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.520
peaks to see what this thing looks like.

193
00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:11.220
Okay.

194
00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.550
So it's empty.

195
00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:19.070
But that's because there are no local peaks within X but that's actually because that was a stupid little

196
00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:19.460
mistake.

197
00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:23.050
So it's really f of x where we're looking for peaks.

198
00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:30.200
So it looks like this variable peaks is a tuple so you can see the parentheses here and there's two

199
00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:37.390
items in here one is an array and this looks like it could be the indices of the maximum values x.

200
00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:43.520
Clearly not the maximum values themselves because all of the or the entire function is negative.

201
00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:49.460
And then there is a second element here which is just empty it's a dictionary and it turns out that

202
00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:50.420
it's empty.

203
00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:56.780
Now you could put the cursor inside the parentheses here and press shift tab on the keyboard and get

204
00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.960
more information about this function.

205
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:05.540
Now of course as always I encourage you after this video to spend some time going through this function

206
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:11.630
if you plan on using something like find peaks you can see what are the properties of this dictionary.

207
00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:17.960
So this is the second output and that basically provides a bunch of information based on some additional

208
00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.500
inputs that you are allowed to specify.

209
00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:24.830
So there are many additional inputs that you can specify into this function.

210
00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:29.100
And I'm not so I'm basically leaving everything at the default settings.

211
00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:36.050
Okay so what that actually means is that the peaks themselves are not in the variable peaks they are

212
00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:40.550
in fact in the first element of the variable peaks like this.

213
00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:46.040
So we have to access peaks and then the zero f or the first element.

214
00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:46.370
All right.

215
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.750
So let's do that.

216
00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:50.000
So BLT dot plot.

217
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:57.220
So then again I want to plot f r x by F of X and this should be a circle.

218
00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:05.430
And now instead of accessing all of the elements and X we just want peaks and then the zero so the first

219
00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:11.640
element from the variable peaks the output of the fine peaks function and then I'll just copy and paste

220
00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:13.740
this here.

221
00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:15.140
Oh right.

222
00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:16.680
So that's pretty cool.

223
00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:24.980
We've identified all of the local maxima of this function in this video you learned about maxima and

224
00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:32.360
minima you learned how to identify maxima and minima using these functions Max an arc max and min and

225
00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:39.290
Armin and you learned about this function find peaks which is in the spy module.
