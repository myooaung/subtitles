00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:10.860
I have previously in this course introduced you to the concept of polynomials and how to work with polynomials

2
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:19.230
in Python polynomials are super important in abstract math and even more important in many areas of

3
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.850
applied mathematics.

4
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.790
So therefore you will see polynomials coming up over and over again throughout this course and in this

5
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:27.270
video.

6
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.490
I'm going to show you about the roots of a polynomial what the roots mean.

7
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.710
Now you might be thinking that the roots of a polynomial are the pieces in the ground and that's how

8
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.320
the polynomial gets its water and nutrients and so forth but actually roots refers to something a little

9
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.840
bit different.

10
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:45.150
All right.

11
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:51.180
And I'm also going to tell you about something that's important to understand when working with mathematics

12
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.990
on computers and that is called Computer rounding error.

13
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.340
All right.

14
00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.390
So here we have our polynomial and I'm just going to give you a quick reminder.

15
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.200
So this whole thing is a polynomial because you have some numbers out front and then you have numbers

16
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.600
being each of these numbers being multiplied by increasing powers of the variable.

17
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.170
In this case it's X..

18
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.970
So a little bit of terminology These are called the coefficients.

19
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.360
So a zero a one a two up to a N and the order here is really important.

20
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:33.450
So a one multiplies that coefficient a one multiplies X to the power of one and a zero actually multiplies

21
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.150
X to the power of zero.

22
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:42.330
It's not explicitly written in here but there is an X to the zero up here of course X to the zero is

23
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.830
one.

24
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.630
So a 2 is X squared and up to a end to the power of a n.

25
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.900
Right.

26
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.330
So these are called the coefficients and the X terms here are sometimes called the variable there sometimes

27
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.630
called the in determinants.

28
00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.140
I don't know how often people use this term I think more often people use the variable.

29
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.020
Okay so then what is the root of a polynomial.

30
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.090
What are the roots of polynomials.

31
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.590
It's actually really simple.

32
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.090
All you do is you take this polynomial you set it equal to zero.

33
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.220
Now sometimes that involves doing a little bit of arithmetic you know sometimes you might have to move

34
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.310
a couple of terms onto the other side of the equation but you get the entire polynomial on one side

35
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.420
of the equation and zero on the other side of the equation.

36
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:33.540
And then you just solve for x and when you solve for x the solutions for x are called the roots of the

37
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.140
polynomials.

38
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.610
So roots of polynomials are important in many areas they crop up for example in linear algebra when

39
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.650
computing eigenvalues.

40
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.940
All right.

41
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.490
So let's switch to Python and essentially what I'm going to do is implement a fairly simple polynomial

42
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:58.930
and I will show you how to compute the roots of the polynomial using num pi so we are definitely going

43
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.070
to be using none pie.

44
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.640
In fact we're also going to be using simple.

45
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.870
So let me already import some PI as Sim and so simple.

46
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:15.160
And display in math I'm basically just using for printing out information so I'm also going to write

47
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:24.100
from I Python dot display import display comma math.

48
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.640
All right.

49
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:31.690
So let's import all of these modules and now the polynomial that I want to find the roots of.

50
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.910
Let's call this the polynomial.

51
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:43.470
This is going to be three X squared plus two X minus one.

52
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.180
Now of course this is not Python code.

53
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:52.310
This is like math notation slash it would be you know something like how you would write it out in latex.

54
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.810
This is actually just for us to see this.

55
00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:02.890
So what I'm going to do using num pi is first just define the coefficients.

56
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:03.910
So how do we do that.

57
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.200
I'm going to say.

58
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.370
Now what are the coefficients of this polynomial.

59
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.820
So in general the three coefficients are minus one 2 and 3.

60
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:23.590
But the way that these have to be listed in Python is to write them in order in descending order of

61
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.680
the largest power of x are of the variable.

62
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:34.360
So in fact the way that we need to write this is three comma two comma minus one and that is super important

63
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:41.950
to remember because inputting the coefficients in this order is very very different from a polynomial

64
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.130
where you would import it like this minus one two three.

65
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:53.470
So the numbers of course are the same but in fact this set of coefficients interpreted by num PI will

66
00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.940
actually mean minus X squared plus two X.

67
00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.200
So that would be the same plus three.

68
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:00.150
Okay.

69
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.630
So that order is important to keep in mind and then to compute the roots.

70
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.610
It's actually pretty simple you just type N.P. num pi dot roots.

71
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.360
That's the function and then you input the vector of coefficients.

72
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.620
Okay.

73
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:14.830
So what are these roots.

74
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:15.900
Let's see.

75
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.700
I will print them out.

76
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.800
So here are the roots.

77
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.020
Ha.

78
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.310
Okay.

79
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.580
So there's two numbers here.

80
00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.730
That means that there are two routes to this equation.

81
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:30.540
There are two solutions to setting this polynomial equal to zero.

82
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.280
Now this looks like a pretty simple number so we can even confirm this algebraic CLI right here in our

83
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.260
head so minus 1 squared is 1.

84
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.580
And then one times three is three.

85
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.270
So then we get three two times minus one is minus two.

86
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.630
So three minus two is plus one minus one equals zero.

87
00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.090
So all right that one works.

88
00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.850
Okay.

89
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:58.270
And what I want to do now is use simplify and display and some later coding just to print out this stuff

90
00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.920
a little bit nicer.

91
00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:07.000
We need to start by creating an equation for this polynomial and actually maybe I'll call it p 0 4 poly

92
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.630
maybe p n polynomial that looks nice.

93
00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:17.080
So that's three times X squared plus two times x minus one.

94
00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.020
So is this going to work or is this going to give an error.

95
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:29.800
You guessed it it's going to give an error because we haven't created a variable X yet so x equals some

96
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.580
dot symbols x.

97
00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.030
Okay.

98
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.170
And now I can run this again.

99
00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.300
I don't get any errors.

100
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.280
So here's our polynomial.

101
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:44.860
Now what I'm going to do is loop through these two numbers so basically all the routes and just print

102
00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:52.000
out the individual route and then I'm also going to solve this equation using the routes and substituting

103
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.350
in for this for x in this polynomial.

104
00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.480
This simple object here.

105
00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:03.840
So for i in routes what I'm going to do is display.

106
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:12.700
And then I want to say something like at X equals and then percent G for you know each individual route

107
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:19.510
and then I want to write the equation printed out here and then solve for the equation.

108
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.890
So that's then going to be another number.

109
00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:22.130
Okay.

110
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.170
So let's see what replacements we need to do in here.

111
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:30.370
So this first replacement percent G was the first root which is variable I hear.

112
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:31.880
So that's I.

113
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.060
And then this one was the expression.

114
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:44.470
So that s p n and of course that needs to be converted into latex so Sim dot latex p n and then this

115
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:52.820
substitution here I want to be I want this to come from actually substituting in the root that we solved

116
00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.440
here that num pi told us here into this equation.

117
00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.790
So that's going be the polynomial subs.

118
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:04.960
Now I'm substituting variable X and its root I.

119
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.210
All right so I'm gonna run this code see how this looks all right.

120
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:13.670
So it's kind of there all the information that we need is there but it doesn't really look very nice

121
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:13.970
here.

122
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:21.410
So what we need to do you will recall from previous sections is actually explicitly tell the math function

123
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.070
and late in general that we want this to look like text.

124
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:31.950
I'm going to say slash slash text and then in curly brackets and let's try that here.

125
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:32.400
Okay.

126
00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.560
Run it again.

127
00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:33.790
Okay.

128
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:34.940
That looks a little bit better.

129
00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.910
So at X equals minus one.

130
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:39.380
This is just a little too close.

131
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:40.700
I want to put in a space here.

132
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.770
How about slash slash quad.

133
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:44.440
All right.

134
00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:47.780
That gives us a little bit more room and I think this looks pretty good.

135
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:52.670
So at X equals minus one three X squared plus two X minus one equals zero.

136
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:54.680
And on that we already confirmed up here.

137
00:08:54.780 --> 00:09:00.350
So let's look at what's happening here now at X equals point 3 3 3 3 3 which is what the other route

138
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:08.390
is this equation solving four point three three three into X doesn't seem to equal zero.

139
00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:09.860
So what's going on here.

140
00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:16.040
Was I lying to you when I told you about what the root of a polynomial means or is there something weird

141
00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.360
going on with the computer here.

142
00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.150
Now I assure you I didn't lie to you.

143
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:21.740
I never lied to my students.

144
00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.740
Sometimes I joke around but I never tell lies.

145
00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:31.370
Now I haven't yet introduced you to scientific notation but you might already be familiar with scientific

146
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:34.880
notation on computers and what this number really means.

147
00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.430
This is not actually the number minus five.

148
00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:41.870
This is the number minus five times 10 to the minus 17.

149
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:44.840
That's what this e minus 17 business means.

150
00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:48.550
So this is actually zero point zero zero zero zero.

151
00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:52.940
And so on for 17 zeros and then there's the five down here.

152
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.870
So this is a tiny tiny tiny tiny number.

153
00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:03.450
It's not exactly zero but it's as close to zero as the computer is capable of representing.

154
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:10.040
And the problem here is that this root the true root to this equation this polynomial is actually one

155
00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:10.780
third.

156
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:12.440
But this is not one third.

157
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:16.430
This is a really close approximation of one third.

158
00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:24.410
And so because this is not exactly one third when you substitute this number in to this equation here

159
00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:31.810
the result is not going to be exactly zero it's gonna be extremely close to zero but not exactly zero.

160
00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:37.850
So in general whenever you see a number on a computer when you're doing math and that number is really

161
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:43.040
tiny but you expect it to be zero if it's something like you know minus 15.

162
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:52.820
So e minus 15 or minus 16 or minus 17 you can consider that to be zero plus computer rounding error.

163
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:59.870
So in this video I told you about the roots of polynomials I told you how to use num pi to extract the

164
00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:04.270
roots of polynomials and printing them out in a simple way.

165
00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:09.170
And I also told you a little bit about computer rounding error which is pretty important when you're

166
00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:17.980
doing mathematics in Python or really any numerical processing software and computers don't runaway.
