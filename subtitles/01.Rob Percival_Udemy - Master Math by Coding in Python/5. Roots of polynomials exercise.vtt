00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:09.760
This video is a follow up to the previous video on routes of polynomials here.

2
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:15.410
I'm gonna go through the exercise for this video so it's probably a good idea to watch the previous

3
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.470
video before going through this one.

4
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.810
If you haven't already and I actually want to start this video by going back to this polynomial that

5
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.390
I discussed in the previous video.

6
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:33.740
So this was a degree to polynomial because the highest power here was X squared X X the power of two

7
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.770
and then it was kind of curious that we got two routes to this equation.

8
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.350
Now that is not a coincidence at all.

9
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.480
It turns out that in tenth degree polynomial has n roots.

10
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:54.740
So this is a s a degree to polynomial and there are two routes and basically the goal of this exercise

11
00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.470
and I'll show you exactly what I want you to do in a moment but it's really to explore this principle

12
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.670
that an end degree polynomial has n roots.

13
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.340
That's actually something really important.

14
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.420
It's called the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra and that's what we are going to explore.

15
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:19.310
But before getting to the details of the exercise I just want to point out that this is a degree to

16
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.160
polynomial if you would remove this term.

17
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:29.020
It's a degree 1 polynomial because Implicit here is to the power of 1 x to the power of 1.

18
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:36.830
And then if you would remove this term this actually becomes a degree 0 polynomial because this is implicitly

19
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.650
X to the power of zero.

20
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.150
And here of course anything to the power of 0 is 1.

21
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:49.550
So the highest power of the variable that we have in here is zero so therefore this is a zero degree

22
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:50.740
polynomial.

23
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.020
It actually does have one coefficient but the degree of the polynomial is zero.

24
00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:05.210
And with that in mind your goal in this assignment is to generate degree and polynomials and compute

25
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:12.260
the roots and then count the number of roots and then print them out in a message in a list that looks

26
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.580
something like this.

27
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:21.110
So you loop from degrees zero up to degree 9 polynomials and then of course you are going to see what

28
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.590
these numbers are here.

29
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.210
So again the goal is to just come up with some random polynomial.

30
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.570
It doesn't actually matter what the coefficients are.

31
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.550
Doesn't matter what the numbers are.

32
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:38.180
It just matters how many coefficients there are and then keep in mind again that a degree zero polynomial

33
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.910
has one coefficient.

34
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:49.130
So therefore a degree 5 polynomial actually has 6 coefficients 5 of them are multiplying x 2 increasing

35
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:55.580
powers and one of the coefficients is actually the one that multiplies X to the power of 0 which just

36
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.310
means that that coefficient is just hanging out on its own.

37
00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.970
All right.

38
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:06.860
So pause the video work through this assignment and see if you can confirm the fundamental theorem of

39
00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.120
algebra.

40
00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.660
All right so I am going to get started in a new cell down here so let's see.

41
00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:23.900
I'm going to start a loop is gonna be a for loop in range 1 to eleven and I'm going one to eleven because

42
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.420
I want to get the numbers 1 through 10 and I want to get the numbers 1 through 10 because that's always

43
00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:35.400
how many coefficients I will need to get polynomials of degree 0 up to degree 9.

44
00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.410
And that's because a degree 0 polynomial actually still has 1 coefficient.

45
00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.790
All right.

46
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.250
So let's get started.

47
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.290
So now the question is what should we make these costs now.

48
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.230
You know you can do this in a slow way.

49
00:03:50.230 --> 00:04:00.380
You could say like quests for a FS 4 for a 0 degree polynomial equals ones that just come up with a

50
00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:06.500
random coefficient 1 and then cohorts for a 1 degree polynomial is let's say 3 and I don't I'm just

51
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.320
making up these numbers and so on but this is this is not really a scalable method.

52
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.110
This is not a this solution could work but it's not really a great solution.

53
00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:23.690
So what I'm going to do is just generate new coefficients inside this loop and that's because as I mentioned

54
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.890
we don't actually care about the values the actual numbers of the coefficients.

55
00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.450
We only care about how many coefficients there are.

56
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:40.520
So I'm gonna make this really simple and I'm just gonna say num pies NPD at a range from 1 to i plus

57
00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.250
1.

58
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.160
And actually before even going further than let me I'm going to print this out for you so you can see

59
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.110
what this looks like.

60
00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.090
These are now all of the coefficients.

61
00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:59.060
So here is our first element in this loop which is producing a zero order polynomial or a degree zero

62
00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.470
polynomial.

63
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.860
And this is in the second iteration of the loop.

64
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:12.340
Now we get a degree to polynomial and so on up to a degree 9 polynomial Now let's see I went to print

65
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:19.330
a degree dash and then we're gonna replace this with the uh with the.

66
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.330
No I.

67
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:33.770
So the I polynomial polynomial has uh substitution here roots.

68
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.450
Okay so now how am I going to go about working through this substitution.

69
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:43.270
So remember that a degree zero polynomial actually has one coefficient.

70
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:52.500
So that means that the length of coats minus one corresponds to the degree length of cliffs and then

71
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.990
minus one and then for the number of routes we can use.

72
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.630
Basically this function that I showed you up here so and Pi dot roots num pi dot roots but then of course

73
00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:08.460
we don't actually care about the roots themselves we just care about how many there are.

74
00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:16.560
So I'm going to say in case this in the function length I too many parentheses here C I think it's like

75
00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.750
that.

76
00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.080
Yeah.

77
00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.890
All right.

78
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.060
Okay.

79
00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:26.730
This error message says object of type function has no length of course the function roots itself doesn't

80
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:27.850
have a length.

81
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.410
We don't care about the function we care about the output of the function.

82
00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.780
So I have to input costs.

83
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:34.200
All right.

84
00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.760
Now let's try this again.

85
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:40.020
Okay so a degree zero polynomial has zero roots.

86
00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:45.540
And in fact the rest of these answers are starting to get pretty boring because the degree of the polynomial

87
00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:49.510
is the same as the number of roots.

88
00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:55.530
So in this video with the exercise in the previous video on the roots of polynomials you learned about

89
00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:00.680
the roots of polynomials and how to compute the roots in python using num Pi.

90
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:08.100
And in this exercise we confirmed the fundamental theorem of algebra which is that a degree in polynomial

91
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.860
has n roots.

92
00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:15.990
We are going to continue working with polynomials and roots in the next video and in fact the next video

93
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.040
is going to contain a really important polynomial.

94
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.380
And that is called the quadratic equation.
