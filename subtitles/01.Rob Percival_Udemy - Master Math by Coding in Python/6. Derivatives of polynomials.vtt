1
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.740
Let's talk about derivatives.

2
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:15.670
This is a major topic in calculus and in fact a first semester course in calculus might spend one half

3
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.870
or maybe even close to the entire semester just talking about derivatives.

4
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.360
So obviously I'm not going to do it.

5
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.020
Total justice just in the next five minutes or so.

6
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.040
Nonetheless I will tell you a little bit about what a derivative means.

7
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:36.130
A couple of different ways of indicating the derivative and doing it in latex.

8
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.600
And of course how to compute derivatives in simple.

9
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:47.390
And most importantly I will show you how to use python as a tool for understanding concepts in calculus

10
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.880
in particular the derivatives of products and sums.

11
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.720
So here you see two functions.

12
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.770
These are not derivatives.

13
00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.400
These are functions that you have encountered in the past few videos in this section of the course.

14
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:07.850
Now when you look at a graph like this that shows you the value of the function at each value of X but

15
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.810
for a derivative we don't actually care about the value of the function itself.

16
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.300
What we care about is how the function is changing over time.

17
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.550
So notice that here the function is decreasing with increasing x.

18
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.180
So I call this time I often think about these as functions of time but of course this dimension doesn't

19
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.890
have to be time.

20
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.530
But anyway notice the function is decreasing as it goes to the right.

21
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.970
So therefore the derivative here is going to be negative here it's decreasing slowly it's gradually

22
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.000
going down.

23
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.560
So the derivative will be negative but small.

24
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.140
And here the function is going down really really fast.

25
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.860
So the derivative is going to be negative and large.

26
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:58.100
And here is an interesting case because the function itself is positive but it's still going downhill.

27
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.770
So the derivative is actually still negative here even though the function itself is positive.

28
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.880
All right.

29
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.290
So there's a lot to learn about derivatives in this video.

30
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.190
I'm going to tell you the rule for computing the derivative of a polynomial.

31
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.220
Let's start with a few examples.

32
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:23.060
So first of all a derivative is often indicated using this notation so d divided by D X. Sometimes It's

33
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.270
written D F over d x and it's often said D by D X..

34
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:35.840
So you would pronounce this object here as d by D X. So the D is for the derivative or the differential.

35
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:43.190
So the derivative of x squared is two times X to the power of one of course this one is implicit.

36
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.990
You could also drop this.

37
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:53.090
So let's raise this to a higher power the derivative of x two the three is three times X squared.

38
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.830
I wonder if you're starting to notice a pattern here.

39
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.740
Let's look at one more example.

40
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:06.380
Let's start from the function three times x cubed and there the derivative is nine times X squared.

41
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.020
So I hope you can start seeing the pattern here.

42
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.510
In fact there is a specific rule for computing the derivative of a polynomial.

43
00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.420
And that rule looks like this.

44
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:22.100
So a times X to the power of n where a is some coefficient.

45
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.600
So it's just a number like here a would be equal to three and then the derivative is.

46
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.880
You still get eight times n but now in the power you're n hour sorry eight times x.

47
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.700
But in the power you have and minus one and then the n comes up frontier and multiplies the a let's

48
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:48.800
switch to Python and see how this gets implemented as we often do in these videos we are going to be

49
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:55.920
using simply num pi map plot lib and display and math for the latex printing.

50
00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:04.070
So let's start by importing a or creating a symbolic variable X and then I'm gonna say F of X equals

51
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.280
X squared.

52
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.910
It's a pretty simple function.

53
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:15.260
Now I write simple diff that is the simplify function for computing the derivative it's for diff because

54
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:22.640
on computers or in discrete numbers we often think of the derivative as being a difference the differential.

55
00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.870
Okay.

56
00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.520
So we get the answer of 2 x as I indicated in these slides.

57
00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.480
Now I want to show you how to indicate the derivative using LaTeX.

58
00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.310
In mathematics there are several different notations for indicating the derivative.

59
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.590
And I'm going to show you three of the most commonly used ones.

60
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:49.340
So one comes from lightning so it's called Lightning s notation and all these different notations are

61
00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:55.670
named after famous mathematicians who were really important for the development of calculus.

62
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.320
So that looks like this display math.

63
00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:06.670
And then we have f of x equals percent s and let me just start off by filling in some of these details.

64
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.610
So this is gonna be some latex F of X..

65
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:11.230
Okay.

66
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.290
So we see F of X equals X squared.

67
00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.590
And now I want to write with a bit of a space here.

68
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.950
So quad.

69
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:24.590
Now I'm gonna write the likeness notation which is what I showed you in these slides already.

70
00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:35.780
So that is def over the X and sometimes the f is omitted here but D F by D X equals percent s.

71
00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:43.550
And now we have to add another substitution and that is going to be the late tech version of Sim that

72
00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.770
def f and actually you know I'm gonna be using this quite often.

73
00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.050
So it's probably a good idea to make this be a variable.

74
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:57.220
I'm going to call this D F X equals the derivative of F of X.

75
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:04.730
So that will simplify this code a little bit by the way you notice I had one parentheses too many here

76
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.210
and you see that Python colors it in red.

77
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:14.000
So that lets me know that there is one too many parentheses at the end.

78
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.460
Of course I have to run this code first and now.

79
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.790
Okay.

80
00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.680
Now this looks good so we see F of X equals X squared.

81
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:27.270
The derivative of x or of f of x equals two X.

82
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.560
Okay.

83
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.030
So this is the life and its notation.

84
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:38.490
And then we also have another one called low branch notation and that one is basically the same.

85
00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:39.810
It looks a little bit different.

86
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.750
Now it's important to realize that the actual derivatives are always the same we're not computing the

87
00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.550
derivatives any differently.

88
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:52.840
This is just about commonly used notation for indicating the derivative.

89
00:06:52.950 --> 00:07:00.750
So the Lagouranis notation is to put a single quote After the function and that indicates the derivative.

90
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:06.060
However a single quote in Python is actually used to demarcate these strings.

91
00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.510
So we use a slash quote.

92
00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:10.130
And notice the colouring here.

93
00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:16.740
So without the slash Python actually thinks that this goes outside the string and then all of this stuff

94
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:22.490
is in another string which we haven't actually closed with another single apostrophe.

95
00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:30.150
So use the slash operator as like an escape character to let Python know that the next character is

96
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.390
going to be something special.

97
00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.630
So let's see how this looks.

98
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.360
Okay.

99
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:35.460
So that looks like this.

100
00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:40.040
You can see it's a little bit more compact compared to this notation.

101
00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:47.190
And people often would pronounce this as prime so you would say F prime equals to X or the derivative

102
00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:49.540
of F for F prime.

103
00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:52.270
Okay so that's the Lagrange notation.

104
00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:56.970
And the last thing that I'm going to show you is called Newton notation.

105
00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.590
Newton notation.

106
00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:05.190
So this is very pan-European here we have the German notation the French notation and then we get to

107
00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:07.160
the English notation.

108
00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:13.730
So now the Newton notation has the F with with dots on top of it.

109
00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:18.540
And that gets indicated using dot and then an F. Scott

110
00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:26.930
like this though it's a little bit harder to see what you can see there is a dot on top of the F and

111
00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.990
that's indicated in latex.

112
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.290
Using this function slash dot.

113
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:39.680
Now in practice I think you see this new note Newton notation less often in mathematics and in engineering

114
00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:43.200
and I think that's mainly because it's just a little harder to see you know.

115
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.300
Is this really a dot.

116
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.850
Or is there just a little smudge on your laptop screen anyway.

117
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:53.280
But certainly the life knits and Lagrange notations you will see pretty often.

118
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:53.640
All right.

119
00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:59.000
So that's for indicating a derivative using LaTeX and python.

120
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:06.000
And what I want to introduce you to now is generating plots of a function and its derivative in simple.

121
00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:13.190
So I'm going to be using some simple function some simple plotting functions that I haven't used a whole

122
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:16.900
lot in the course although I have introduced you to these functions.

123
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:22.190
And this simple approach to plotting in the function on graphics.

124
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:27.100
So I'm going to be frequently using simplified dot plotting dot plots.

125
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:34.160
Now this is quite a lot to write out so therefore I'm going to simplify my life a little bit by writing.

126
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:35.530
Import simple.

127
00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:38.610
Dot plotting that plot as Sim plot.

128
00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:45.710
So now I can just write Simplot and that will be a shortcut for all of this business okay.

129
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:47.730
So I'm going to come up with a different function.

130
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:55.290
This is going to be three minus X cubed and let's see what this function looks like and what its derivative

131
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.790
looks like.

132
00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:03.190
So let's first generate the plot of the function on its own so I will say Simplot the function.

133
00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:07.320
And then the second input you might remember was the variable and the range.

134
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.600
So let's go from minus five to plus five.

135
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:16.200
And I'm going to say show equals false and then actually I'm going to immediately show the function

136
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.170
here.

137
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:22.320
So it might seem a little weird to have this show equals false and then show here but I'm going to be

138
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.990
filling this out with more options here.

139
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:26.340
All right.

140
00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.350
So here you see what this function looks like.

141
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:31.230
This is 3 minus X cubed.

142
00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:37.310
So you see the minus X cubed here and this three is essentially just shifting it a little bit.

143
00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.990
Now I want to add another plot to this.

144
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:50.040
So p that extend and I'm going to extend this plot by also plotting Sim plot the derivative of the function

145
00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:59.040
which is simple dot diff of effects and then again I need to specify the variable and the range although

146
00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:03.400
actually this isn't really totally necessary because it added on to this plot.

147
00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:08.370
So we will just inherit the variable and the limits from the above plot.

148
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.550
But anyway and then still show equals false.

149
00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:12.780
Okay.

150
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.010
So let's see what this looks like.

151
00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:14.860
Mm hmm.

152
00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:22.530
Well I mean we already made this plot of F of X 4 so I know that this is the main function and this

153
00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:27.390
is the derivative but it would be nice to have these be two different line colors.

154
00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:37.760
So I'm going to specify that the second plot object which is the derivative has a line color equal to

155
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:38.580
let's go for red.

156
00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.010
Keep things simple.

157
00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.390
And now of course we need to add some legends.

158
00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:51.360
So p zero dark label equals and I'm gonna say using a dollar sign for Python coding.

159
00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:54.200
F of X equals percent.

160
00:11:54.310 --> 00:12:02.270
S and then replace that with Sim later back of the function.

161
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:09.030
So that was for the first plot object and then we get the second plot object and that was seemed like

162
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:15.750
it and then the sim that diff and I suppose at this point I probably could have also created a variable

163
00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.530
for the derivative of the function.

164
00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.760
But that's okay let's see.

165
00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:26.430
So now I need to activate the legend so make the legend true.

166
00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:31.740
And now this is looking pretty good except I would like to zoom into this function a little bit more

167
00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:34.660
so I'm going to indicate the ranges.

168
00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:39.470
So p that y Lim equals Let's go.

169
00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:46.340
Well it's hard to know exactly what it should be let's try minus 10 two plus 10 all right.

170
00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:47.220
This is looking good.

171
00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:53.940
I think all this is a pretty good zoom although now you can see the x axis you know most of the action

172
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:59.520
on the x axis is happening from let's say minus three to plus three.

173
00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:08.670
Maybe I'll change these boundaries here to three and three and I think I'll even just delete this altogether.

174
00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:10.260
Let's see how this looks.

175
00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:10.640
Huh.

176
00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:10.940
Okay.

177
00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:15.270
Well I still need to change the pitot X limb here.

178
00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:17.820
So let's get this from minus three to plus three.

179
00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:19.290
Okay.

180
00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:25.020
So this is looking interesting and like I said in this slide it's pretty interesting to see that although

181
00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:31.260
the function is positive here the function is moving negative so therefore the derivative is negative.

182
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:37.740
However this function is slowing down so it's not moving negatively so fast.

183
00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.570
So therefore the derivative is actually getting larger.

184
00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:44.400
Here are the function doesn't move at all on the y axis.

185
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.450
So there is this point here where the function is going straight across.

186
00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:55.380
On the exact on the y axis and therefore the derivative touches zero and then the function starts going

187
00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.810
negative more and more steeply.

188
00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:05.270
So the derivative is also becoming more and more negative I discussed the derivative and in particular

189
00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:12.340
derivatives of polynomials and you saw how to indicate the derivative and how to compute the derivative

190
00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:14.470
using LaTeX and simple.

191
00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:20.360
Don't go away in the next video there's going to be an exercise and there you will get to use python

192
00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:27.680
as a tool to help you understand a couple of important rules about the derivatives of multiple functions.
