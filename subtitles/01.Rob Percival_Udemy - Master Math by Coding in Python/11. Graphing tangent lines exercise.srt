1
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:11,120
This video contains the exercise that follows up on the previous video on computing Tangent lines.

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,790
So if you haven't already watched that video then it's probably a good idea to go through that video

3
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,300
before going through this exercise.

4
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:25,550
So the goal of this exercise is essentially to produce a graph that looks like this.

5
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:32,780
This is a graph of Tangent lines to a function x squared and I think it's a beautiful example.

6
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:40,220
Yet another example of an intersection between aesthetic design so art and mathematics in this case

7
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,480
calculus.

8
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:48,020
To me this looks like some abstract eagle that is flapping its wings and zooming in for the kill.

9
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:52,520
In fact I wasn't sure whether it looked better with the white background or without any background like

10
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,110
this.

11
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,970
Maybe you can let me know in the comments.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,640
All right let's get back to work.

13
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:02,090
There are two exercises are two components to this exercise.

14
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:10,790
The first is to create a python function that returns a tangent line given three inputs so a function

15
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,290
itself.

16
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:18,140
And this has to be the mathematical function a simple expression a point at which to compute the Tangent

17
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:18,530
lines.

18
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:25,340
I'm calling that X of A and domain bounds the domain bounds here I'm referring to you know the the smallest

19
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,250
and largest point on the x axis.

20
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:35,260
Okay so once you've created this python function then you can use that function to create this graph.

21
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:41,690
And this graph is generated using the function F equals X squared you can actually see that in this

22
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:47,170
black line here that's the X squared at points for computing the tangent.

23
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:52,400
So x of a ranging from minus to two plus two.

24
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:52,700
All right.

25
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:56,120
So now as with all of the exercises.

26
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,080
This is your opportunity to pause the video switch to Python.

27
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:06,080
Write some code see if you can reproduce exactly this figure this graph or at least one that looks very

28
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,000
close to it.

29
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:12,350
And when you're ready come back to the video and then I will show you how I solved this problem.

30
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:20,300
To produce that graph I'm going to use the simple AI module num pi module and matte plot lib.

31
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,290
So let's get started.

32
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:27,560
I'm going to start by creating the function so I'll call this compute tangent.

33
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,370
That seems like a pretty good name for a function that's going to compute the tangent.

34
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,350
So I said we need three inputs.

35
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:41,220
The function the point at which to compute the function and the bounds which I'll call B and D S for

36
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,600
the boundary points on X..

37
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:52,840
So let's start by defining the derivative and values at point X..

38
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,500
Sub a.

39
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,200
So let's see.

40
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:02,970
So we already have the function from the input so we can compute the derivative as some dot diff of

41
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:08,040
f and then we need the value of the function at point A.

42
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,370
And actually I think I meant to call this x sub A.

43
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:17,860
The value of the function at point X of a and the value of the derivative at point X of a.

44
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,020
So I will call this F A equals f that sub.

45
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:26,800
So we are substituting for X the value of a.

46
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,980
And now as I'm going along writing this function you have to notice that I'm making some assumptions

47
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:38,200
so I am assuming that these symbolic variable in the function f is called X..

48
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,770
So it's always important to keep these kinds of assumptions in mind.

49
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,110
Okay.

50
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:49,680
And then I need DFA and that is def subs X at X A.

51
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,110
So again this is giving me the derivative of the function.

52
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:57,790
This gives me the value of the function at point X equals X obey.

53
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:05,490
And this variable is going to give me the value of the derivative of the function at point X equals

54
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,150
X A.

55
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:07,070
Okay.

56
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:14,100
So then we need to evaluate the tangent tangent line so let's see.

57
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:22,350
So I need to create an x axis vector on which to evaluate the tangent line and that is going to be linearly

58
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,780
space numbers between the.

59
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,850
Basically the first and second point in this vector.

60
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:36,050
So here is another assumption and I'm assuming that this input is going to be a list of two elements.

61
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:44,490
So we are going to go from B and D S zero up to B and and d s 1.

62
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:44,880
Let's see.

63
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,390
Like this and let's go in two hundred steps.

64
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,170
Okay.

65
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,600
And so now I have all of the components that I need to create.

66
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:59,400
The tangent line now what I could do is create another variable called tangent line and then return

67
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,840
tangent line.

68
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:07,260
However because I only need to use this variable to return it I'm actually not even going to create

69
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:13,960
that variable I'm just going to compute the tangent line directly after the return statement here.

70
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:20,820
So you will recall from the formula that I explained in the previous video that the tangent line is

71
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:32,400
graded as the slope which is D F A times the x variable shifted by the point X A plus the Intercept

72
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,260
which is the function evaluated at point X of a.

73
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:42,690
So that was FAA getting a little confusing to talk about these F's and A's everywhere.

74
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,350
All right.

75
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,050
So let's run this so we don't get any errors.

76
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:53,700
Now I'm gonna need to run this next out in a loop in order to create a lot of Tangent lines to plot

77
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:53,960
them.

78
00:05:54,420 --> 00:06:00,750
However before getting full on into the loop I want to just run this code once just to make sure that

79
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,720
it's working.

80
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,240
So let's start by defining the function.

81
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:09,140
I'll call that variable F and that's going to be X squared.

82
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,000
So now I haven't yet created X.

83
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:17,050
Let's say X equals symbols symbols and then x.

84
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,970
So now what I need is a vector of X points.

85
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,180
So I'll call it X X equals known pi.

86
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:29,240
Lynn space and let's go from minus two to plus two.

87
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,500
Essentially because that's what I said to use for the value of X A.

88
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:37,080
In these slides OK.

89
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:41,640
Now it's no coincidence that I'm using two hundred points here and two hundred points here.

90
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:49,240
In fact I'm also making another implicit assumption that there's going to be two hundred points to compute

91
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,790
or to evaluate for the tangent line.

92
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:59,380
Now another way you could have set this up would be to directly import x x here and then get the tangent

93
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,990
line directly from that third input.

94
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,880
However that's what the instructions say.

95
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,350
And you know I always stick to the instructions anyway.

96
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:08,480
Okay.

97
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:16,450
So let's try running this I'm going to get tan line tangent line equals compute tangent and then we

98
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:21,600
need to input F and x sub a which I haven't actually created yet.

99
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:26,740
But let's just say it's the value of 1 the point 1 and the bounds.

100
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:33,590
I'm going to say that this is going to be X X the first points and then the last point.

101
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:34,390
Okay.

102
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:39,880
So I just ran this cell which means it called this function and I haven't seen what the output is but

103
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:46,280
at least it didn't give me any explicit coding errors so I'm already pretty happy about that what I'd

104
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:54,560
like to do now is make a plot of this function and this tangent line and once I see those two graphs

105
00:07:54,590 --> 00:08:00,990
then I will feel good about myself and then I can go through and finally finish this exercise.

106
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:11,480
So let's see I'm going to convert this function into a evaluate able function I'll call that f fun equals

107
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:21,670
simple land defy x F and that's going to be evaluated at all of the points in X X that I specified here.

108
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,160
Okay.

109
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:29,320
So now this is a vector of points of numbers that I can plot alongside this tangent line.

110
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:41,630
So let's say P L teed up plot x x by fun and then P L teed up plot x x by 10 line and then let's see

111
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,670
what this looks like.

112
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,240
All right.

113
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,130
Very nice very comforting.

114
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:50,560
This looks exactly like the plot that we made in the previous video.

115
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:50,930
Okay.

116
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,470
So now I feel confident that I've done everything the right way here.

117
00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:03,150
So now what I'm going to do is run through a loop over all of the points in x sub a.

118
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:06,640
Now I haven't created a variable here for X of a.

119
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:13,450
However it actually is pretty sensible just to use all the points in X to be the x sub A's.

120
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,240
So I'm going to say for me we'll call this a.

121
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:25,940
So for a n x x what we want to do is get the variable y and that's going to be compute tangent we input

122
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:34,880
f we input the point a and we input the boundaries which is x x and then the first point and the last

123
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,760
point and then what do we do with this thing.

124
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,610
Well we want to plot it of course.

125
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:45,410
So I'm going to say P L T dot plots X X by Y.

126
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:52,860
And let's see if we can get rid of this and let's just see how this is starting to look all right.

127
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,290
This actually looks pretty neat.

128
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:57,930
It doesn't quite look like what I showed in the slides yet.

129
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,500
We're gonna make it look better but it already looks pretty cool.

130
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,830
So you can kind of see the function here.

131
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,010
X squared let me adjust this plot to make this look a little bit better.

132
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:15,600
So first of all I'm going to set the axis to be square and then I'm going to change the axis limits

133
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,780
to go from.

134
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:18,150
How about on the x axis.

135
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:23,700
Well it makes sense to go from minus two to plus two on the x axis because of what we specified up here

136
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,440
and the y axis.

137
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,030
I think something like minus one to three is gonna look good.

138
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:39,000
And now we don't need this axis to be visible so I'm going to turn that axis off and there's another

139
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,030
one of these typos that I've made a million times.

140
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,290
Hey now this is looking great.

141
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,820
This looks really nice.

142
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,790
It's not quite perfect.

143
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:54,510
It's not quite yet what we need because the colors are off but otherwise the plot itself looks good.

144
00:10:54,510 --> 00:11:00,870
Okay so now getting this plot to look exactly like how I created it is a little bit tricky and I'm just

145
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:04,550
going to show you what took me a little while to figure out.

146
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:11,610
So I'm going to specify the color so I'm going to specify the RG b coordinates for this color and the

147
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:23,190
way that I set this up was to be a V S A divided by 3 a B.S. of a divided by 4 and then a B.S. a divided

148
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,830
by 2.

00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:32,820
And so essentially what this is doing is setting the color to be mostly blue and a little bit less red

150
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,570
and even less green.

151
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,990
And then the purpose of having this be a B.S. is first of all that color coordinates have to go from

152
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,040
zero to ones.

153
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,790
They can't be negative whereas this looping variable a can be negative.

154
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:54,210
And secondly setting this to to be absolute values is also going to produce a curve in color space.

155
00:11:54,210 --> 00:12:01,980
And that is how I got this to be a nice floating shade or alternating shades of purple going from purple

156
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:09,270
here down to it gets a bit black here and out here and then back to Purple again as we get two numbers

157
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:17,950
that are say intersection points that are further away from the origin like this Well that does it for

158
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:24,730
this video you learned about the tangent line to a function in this video and also in the previous video

159
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:28,580
where I focus more on the math and the elementary implementation.

160
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,490
And most importantly you made another beautiful plot.

161
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:38,830
And as I've mentioned in previous exercises where we make really nice looking plots I challenge you

162
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:44,140
to make a nicer more beautiful more interesting looking plot than this one.

163
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:49,150
And when you make it please post it to the Q and A forum so I can see it and give you the praise that

164
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:49,840
you deserve.
