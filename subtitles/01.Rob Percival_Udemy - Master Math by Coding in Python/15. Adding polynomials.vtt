00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:11.030
In this and the next several videos you are going to learn all about polynomials and working with polynomials
1

2
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.730
in Python.
2

3
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:19.010
I am super excited about these videos, not only because I'm super excited about all the videos in this
3

4
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.700
course, but because polynomials are really great.
4

5
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:29.120
First of all the word polynomial is a lot of fun to say :D  
But also polynomials are really important in
5

6
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.450
math.
6

7
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:35.780
They are important in applied mathematics are important in engineering applications and they're also
7

8
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.550
important in more abstract math. Polynomials have lots of great qualities.
8

9
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.200
They're all over calculus.
9

10
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.730
And anyway I could go on and on.
10

11
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.790
So what is a polynomial?
11

12
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.580
What are these amazing amazing things??
12

13
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:56.390
A polynomial is an expression that has a form that looks something like this, where you have some numbers
13

14
00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:03.490
that are called coefficients multiplying some variable and here it's called x raised to higher powers.
14

15
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.010
So a zero a one a two all the way up to a n.
15

16
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.900
These are just individual numbers.
16

17
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.260
Maybe this is six or maybe this is three point two and the X is some variable and you can see that the
17

18
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
variable gets increased to higher powers.
18

19
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.240
Now, the number of total powers,
19

20
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:28.340
so the highest power of x or whatever the variable is, is called the Order of the polynomial or it's
20

21
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.880
also called the degree in fact I think in Python It is called the degree not the order.
21

22
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.200
So this would be an N degree polynomial.
22

23
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:37.450
Okay.
23

24
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.520
So here you see a couple of examples, two examples.
24

25
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.540
So here the coefficients are three and five and five-sixths and twelve point four.
25

26
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.880
And you can see that the degree or the order of this polynomial is three.
26

27
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.290
Here you see another example.
27

28
00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:00.200
Now polynomials don't necessarily need to have every single power, that you can see here.
28

29
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.900
So there is no a zero here.
29

30
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.140
There's no individual number not attached to the X.
30

31
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.280
And there's also no x squared in here.
31

32
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.890
Still, this is a third degree polynomial or a degree three polynomial.
32

33
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.100
So that's what a polynomial is.
33

34
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.330
What you are going to be doing in this video is learning about adding polynomials to each other.
34

35
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.240
So this is one polynomial; this is the other polynomial that I showed on the previous side.
35

36
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.260
And now, how do you add these things together?
36

37
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.880
Well, it's pretty straightforward.
37

38
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.310
What you have to do is look for all of the "like" terms.
38

39
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.970
So you look for the terms that have the same degree or the same power on the X or whatever the variable
39

40
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:41.630
is.
40

41
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.790
So for example minus 5 x and plus 2 x.
41

42
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:53.180
So these can be combined into minus three x and then over here we have twelve point four X cubed and
42

43
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.610
just regular x cube these are both positive.
43

44
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.650
So you add these together that becomes thirteen point four X cube.
44

45
00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:08.590
So the end result of the addition of these two polynomials is this number. In this video we are going
45

46
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.590
to be using the sympy module as well as the display and math function so I'm already importing
46

47
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.120
all of these things here.
47

48
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.380
OK.
48

49
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.720
So we are going to need a symbolic variable.
49

50
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.680
How about we use x.
50

51
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.080
I've already explained before that I happen to be fond of the letter X.
51

52
00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.300
Okay.
52

53
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.320
So let's come up with a first polynomial.
53

54
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:40.510
So how about two times X cubed plus x squared minus X. That is our first polynomial.
54

55
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:51.020
And then the second polynomial will be X cubed minus X to the fourth minus four times X squared plus
55

56
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.730
squared.
56

57
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.420
Okay.
57

58
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.440
So let's start by printing.
58

59
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.860
How about just p1, polynomial one.
59

60
00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:57.130
All right.
60

61
00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.260
So this seems fine, but it's not...
61

62
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.840
it doesn't look really nice.
62

63
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:07.120
You know by this point in the course that I like to print these out to make them look nice.
63

64
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.310
So display math.
64

65
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.460
Now we need to convert this into latex.
65

66
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:13.030
All right.
66

67
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.620
This looks pretty good.
67

68
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.810
And now let's also have a look quick look at p2, polynomial two.
68

69
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:19.930
So there you go.
69

70
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:29.140
Now notice that sympy is actually reordering the polynomials to put the terms with the largest coefficients
70

71
00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.720
or sorry I mean the highest powers, to be in the first position.
71

72
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:41.290
So here I wrote minus X to the fourth in the second term and sympy just rearranged it to have the highest
72

73
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.280
power coming first and then decreasing powers as we go along.
73

74
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:51.720
So now let's see what happens when I write P1 plus P2.
74

75
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.660
So notice that these two are... actually you know it's even a better idea.
75

76
00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.040
I'm going to write this out.
76

77
00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.170
I'm going to write out the whole thing.
77

78
00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.510
So let's say math.
78

79
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:06.130
Percent x plus percent S equals percent s.
79

80
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.370
Okay.
80

81
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.870
And now I'm going to replace this with a bunch of latex codes.
81

82
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:18.820
There's going to be sympyt dot latex for p 1 and then sympy dot latex for p2. And then the addition of
82

83
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.720
them oops.
83

84
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:21.190
Right.
84

85
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.550
No comma over here.
85

86
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:24.190
All right.
86

87
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.380
This was a mistake.
87

88
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.400
I hope you caught that before I did.
88

89
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.730
That should be p2 not just the number two.
89

90
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:35.040
All right so here it's kind of hard to see what was polynomial one and polynomial two.
90

91
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.570
So actually let me put some parentheses around here.
91

92
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.370
These parentheses of course are not mathematically necessary.
92

93
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.300
They're not necessary for code.
93

94
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:50.170
They're only here for ease of visual interpretation of the equation.
94

95
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.760
So here's polynomial 1 polynomial 2 and there are some.
95

96
00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:00.460
Now notice that there is only one term here that is to the fourth power.
96

97
00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.850
And there are two terms that contain X cubed and that's x cubed on its own.
97

98
00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:12.270
And then two X cubes. So you add those together and you get three X cubed.
98

99
00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.540
And then we can also subtract them, so I'm going to say minus over here.
99

100
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.390
And of course we need a minus over here.
100

101
00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:22.180
And now we get a different result. In particular,
101

102
00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:29.070
this is now just X cubed because this is 2x cubed. This... you always have to be mindful with
102

103
00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.880
these minus signs here.
103

104
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:38.570
So this is plus X cubed but then there's a minus sign that applies to the X cubed term here.
104

105
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:43.790
So this is one way to create polynomials in the sympy module.
105

106
00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:50.440
I want to show you another way because this is going to turn out to be pretty useful for some applications
106

107
00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.200
in particular for the exercise at the end of this video.
107

108
00:06:53.740 --> 00:07:01.570
So I'm going to use sym dot poly and then the input into this poly function will be the polynomial.
108

109
00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:11.020
So for example how about two times X cubed plus x squared minus X.
109

110
00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:11.280
All right.
110

111
00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.590
So let's see what this thing is.
111

112
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.970
First of all, I'm going to type type to see what the class is.
112

113
00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:23.210
So the class of this variable is a poly poly poly... there's poly's all over the place.
113

114
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.130
So this is a polynomial.
114

115
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:26.500
And let's see what this looks like.
115

116
00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:34.390
So you can see this is the function poly and here's the function and the main variable is X and the
116

117
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:43.270
domain is Z which basically just means that the coefficients or these numbers here are all integers.
117

118
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.210
So you don't have to worry about the domain for now.
118

119
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:46.420
All right.
119

120
00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:50.910
So what can we do with a poly class?
120

121
00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:54.450
So one thing we can do is substitute for x.
121

122
00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:59.890
Now previously you learned how to do this, that was like subs... but now with the poly
122

123
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:09.040
class, it works a little bit differently. We can say poly or sorry p1 dot eval and let's say zeros.
123

124
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.900
That's a pretty simple one to compute in our head.
124

125
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:16.330
So essentially we're substituting for X, the input here, which is zero.
125

126
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:21.390
So of course when x equals zero we get zero as a result.
126

127
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:31.480
Another method that we can apply here is called P1 -- the polynominal variable -- coeffs without the
127

128
00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.620
zero.
128

129
00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:38.050
So this returns a list and the numbers in this list are 2 1 minus 1.
129

130
00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:40.470
So what could this possibly mean.
130

131
00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:42.720
Yes I'm sure you guessed it correctly.
131

132
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:46.610
These are the coefficients on the polynomial, so here is 2.
132

133
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:52.840
Now you don't actually see the one in here but it's here implicitly one and here it's a minus one because
133

134
00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.780
I'm subtracting x.
134

135
00:08:54.850 --> 00:09:02.170
Now notice that the order of the coefficients is not the same as the order that they are presented in
135

136
00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:02.440
here.
136

137
00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.330
So for example if I would say
137

138
00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:07.910
X squared.
138

139
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:13.940
So if I put the x term first and then the x term I say the X squared term first and then the x term
139

140
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.730
and then the X cubed term.
140

141
00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:24.770
Now the coefficients are the same and that's because, as I mentioned up here, sympy internally is going
141

142
00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:32.900
to reorder the polynomial so that the largest coefficient terms or the highest order terms are first
142

143
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:43.550
The exercise for this video is to first implement these polynomials, these three, as a list in Python.
143

144
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:44.830
So this is the first.
144

145
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:46.500
The second and the third.
145

146
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:51.560
So implement these as a python list and then you after loop through and for each of them you have to
146

147
00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:55.400
calculate the degree of the polynomial.
147

148
00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:59.190
And if the degree is even then you sum the coefficients.
148

149
00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:04.050
And if the degree is odd then you count the number of coefficients.
149

150
00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:08.590
So for example the degree of this polynomial is 2.
150

151
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:12.240
So we would sum the coefficients the coefficients are 1 and 2.
151

152
00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:20.510
So it would be 3 and here in this polynomial the degree is odd because the largest term is X to the
152

153
00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:22.230
power of three.
153

154
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:23.560
So the degree is odd.
154

155
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.760
And then we just count the number of coefficient.
155

156
00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:31.330
So in that case the answer would be two although the coefficients are minus 1 and plus 4.
156

157
00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:31.790
All right.
157

158
00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:39.770
Now I haven't actually told you how to compute the degree of a polynomial in Python but I think you
158

159
00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:46.630
can figure it out by knowing that the term for this thing the highest power is called the degree.
159

160
00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:46.970
All right.
160

161
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.210
So good luck.
161

162
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:52.210
Now is your chance to pause the video work through this assignment.
162

163
00:10:52.340 --> 00:11:00.280
And of course I'm going to now switch to Python so you can watch me work my way through this all right.
163

164
00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:01.210
Let's see.
164

165
00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:04.710
So I'm going to start working in this cell.
165

166
00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:11.380
So the first thing that I'm going to do is create a list of polynomials. Let's call this polys. Remember,
166

167
00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:14.200
a list has these square brackets like this.
167

168
00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:14.560
Okay.
168

169
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:22.060
So I'm going to make sure these are all of class poly, so that's sym dot poly and then that first one
169

170
00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:27.700
was two times X plus X squared.
170

171
00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:40.480
And then we had some dot poly poly the next one was minus X cubed plus four times x and then the third
171

172
00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:51.610
one was in the poly that was X to the power of five minus X to the power of four plus one over four
172

173
00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:55.560
times x plus four.
173

174
00:11:55.570 --> 00:12:00.850
Now this term just to be clear this term was actually X over for like this.
174

175
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:04.490
However, multiplication takes priority over division.
175

176
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:11.410
Remember the order of operations was PEMPAS, so multiplication comes before division.
176

177
00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:18.060
So in fact writing it this way is the same as saying 1 over four times x although now that I see it
177

178
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:20.980
written out I think this is a little bit clearer.
178

179
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:21.430
Okay.
179

180
00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:25.650
So, I ran this, we didn't get any errors so that's a good sign.
180

181
00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:28.330
Now what we need to do is loop through these.
181

182
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:35.600
I'm going to say for poli in polys and then what do we want to do.
182

183
00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:43.090
So we need to extract the degree of the polynomial and determine whether it is even or odd.
183

184
00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:48.410
So it turns out that getting the degree is pretty straightforward. In fact I think I'll show it to
184

185
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:48.790
you up here.
185

186
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:56.560
So here was P1 and so the degree we know by just looking at this thing that it's a degree 3 polynomial
186

187
00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:04.930
so I'm going to say print P1 dot degree and that tells us that it's three.
187

188
00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:05.230
Okay.
188

189
00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:12.560
So then we have a poly poly that degree.
189

190
00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:16.890
Now how can we tell whether this is an even number or an odd number.
190

191
00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:24.370
Now you might remember from a couple of videos ago I showed you how to use the modulus or the remainder
191

192
00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:28.910
after division to determine whether a number is odd or even.
192

193
00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:35.860
So that was the function in the numpy toolbox called mod and then divide by two and we test whether
193

194
00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:37.930
that is equal to zero.
194

195
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:40.960
So that was a method that I showed previously and this works.
195

196
00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.480
This is a great solution and there's nothing wrong with it.
196

197
00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:50.050
However I haven't actually imported numpy and I am too lazy to import numpy right now, so therefore
197

198
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:56.150
I'm going to show you a different approach which is equivalent to this.
198

199
00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:03.610
Actually let me leave this up here and then I will show you this so I can also say poly dot degree and
199

200
00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:07.810
then use a percent sign two equals zero.
200

201
00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:09.940
So these two lines are equivalent.
201

202
00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:17.060
The percent sign is also computing the modulus or returning the modulus after division by 2.
202

203
00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:18.400
Okay.
203

204
00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:23.140
So if this is the case then that means that this number is even.
204

205
00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:31.670
And then when the number is even we say the degree is even.
205

206
00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:38.190
And the coefficients sum to, and then percent G.
206

207
00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:47.420
And then we want the sum of the polynomial coefficients.
207

208
00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:53.450
So this code is not yet finished, however I want to run and already to see if we've made any mistakes
208

209
00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.350
or if we got the right answer.
209

210
00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:59.570
Okay, so uh okay this is this was not intended :(
210

211
00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:03.440
Sometimes I make these mistakes on purpose just to make sure you are paying attention.
211

212
00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.680
This was a careless mistake on my part.
212

213
00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.870
I didn't even put the if statement in here.
213

214
00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:09.280
All right.
214

215
00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.310
So this looks good.
215

216
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:14.410
This says the degrees is even and the coefficients some 2 3.
216

217
00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:20.600
So that part is kind of accurate except we don't know which polynomial this was corresponding to.
217

218
00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:25.400
So we can see by looking at it that only one of them actually is even.
218

219
00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:27.080
So that part makes sense.
219

220
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:31.000
But I would like to put the actual polynomial in here.
220

221
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:34.290
So let's say the degree of.
221

222
00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.280
And then I'm going to say percent
222

223
00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:36.800
s.
223

224
00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:41.210
And here I want to replace this with the expression.
224

225
00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:44.360
So I can do it this way, I can say poly.
225

226
00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.160
However, that's returning this really long thing.
226

227
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.080
And actually I only want this.
227

228
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:59.490
So the method to extract just this part, just the actual polynomial, is dot as expr.
228

229
00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:03.940
So essentially I'm converting this into an expression.
229

230
00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:08.810
So this polynomial object as an expression.
230

231
00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:09.200
All right.
231

232
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:13.700
So the degree of X squared plus two X is even.
232

233
00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.880
And the coefficients some two three.
233

234
00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:17.780
Great.
234

235
00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:20.580
So that is part of the solution.
235

236
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.740
And then the other part is we have to say else,
236

237
00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.330
so if that is this is not the case,
237

238
00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:36.620
if the degree is odd, then we want to print the degree of percent S is odd.
238

239
00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:44.350
And there are some number of coefficients.
239

240
00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:44.990
All right.
240

241
00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:52.460
So then let's see we want again poly dot as expr, and then the second one is we just want to count
241

242
00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:53.970
the number of coefficients.
242

243
00:16:53.980 --> 00:17:02.180
So then we can say len for length and then poly dot coeffs. Great! ...oops not so great.
243

244
00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:08.350
I'm missing a parenthesis on coeffs. All right.
244

245
00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:10.480
So this is starting to look good.
245

246
00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:15.820
I'm going to say that this is now finished in the interest of time. But of course if you would like one
246

247
00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:20.740
thing you could do to make this look a little bit nicer without really changing that solution would
247

248
00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:27.130
be to get all of this to work in latex so that you get a nice printing of the polynomial so it looks
248

249
00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:29.290
a little bit more like this.
249

250
00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:35.680
So in this video I gave you a reminder of what polynomials were and I introduced you to working with
250

251
00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:43.480
polynomials in Python and extracting information out of Python and adding and subtracting multiple polynomials
251

252
00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:50.680
in the next several videos we will continue on our exploration of working with polynomials in Python
252

253
00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:52.780
and I look forward to seeing you then.
