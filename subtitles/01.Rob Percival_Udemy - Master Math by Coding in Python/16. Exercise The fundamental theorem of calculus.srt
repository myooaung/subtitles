00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:09,000
When you are studying calculus you will come across something called the fundamental theorem of calculus

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,830
which has two parts.

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:17,640
The first part is essentially saying that the derivative and the integral are opposite of each other.

4
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,350
And that's usually expressed in some formula that might look something like this.

5
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:28,170
So the derivative of a function and then the integral over the derivative of the function gives you

6
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,660
back the original function itself.

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,890
You might also see it written the other way.

8
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,610
So first you integrate over a function and then you compute the derivative of that integral and you

9
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,070
get back the function itself.

10
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:47,160
Now there is actually a little bit of ambiguity in here because when you compute the integral you also

11
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:53,070
get a constant at the end a constant term but ignoring the constant term for now.

12
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:59,080
Basically this is saying that integration and derivation are the opposite of each other.

13
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:06,960
And so your goal in this exercise is to illustrate this concept using a specific function and that is

14
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,000
two times X cubed plus the sign of X..

15
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,330
So what you want to do is implement this function in python in simple.

16
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:23,010
And then take the derivative of the function like this and then take the indefinite integral of the

17
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,260
derivative of the function and hopefully if you haven't made any coding errors then you will get back

18
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,690
the original function which is of course this thing.

19
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,230
All right.

20
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,850
So switch to Python and have a go at this.

21
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:41,630
And now I'm going to switch to Python and show you how I went about solving this let's see.

22
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:50,830
So we will need a symbolic variable so x equals symbol symbols X and then we define the function.

23
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:57,770
So that was two times X cubed plus the sign of x.

24
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:58,420
Okay.

25
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,900
And now what I want to do is create new variables for the derivative of the function.

26
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:03,760
So simple.

27
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,880
Def of X and for the integral of the function.

28
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,750
Sorry the integral of the derivative of the function.

29
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:19,890
So this is going to be the integral of D F and that equals sim that integrate integrate.

30
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:27,770
D f Okay so now we have the three variables I just ran this cell and confirm that we didn't get any

31
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,240
python error messages here.

32
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,650
And so now what I'd like to do is basically display some of these.

33
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:41,990
So I'm going to start by displaying the original function so let's see that is F of X equals.

34
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:47,260
Percent s and then percent Sim the latex f.

35
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,330
Let's see how that looks.

36
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:49,010
Okay.

37
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,280
So this is the original function that we start with.

38
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,600
And then I want to show the derivative of this function.

39
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:02,270
So let's call that f prime equals.

40
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:08,330
And then we have to change this to def and then it's worth just taking a second to confirm this in our

41
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:08,610
head.

42
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,470
So the derivative of two times X cubed.

43
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,110
Well we take down the three.

44
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,450
So that's gonna multiply the two and give us six.

45
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:20,600
And then we have X to the power of one minus the original power.

46
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,940
And so that's 2.

47
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,660
And then the derivative of sine is cosine.

48
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,560
All right.

49
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,570
And now we want to show the integral of the derivative.

50
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:33,410
So that is going to be slash slash inch.

51
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:39,860
And then I'm gonna put this in parentheses just to facilitate visual grouping here and then add the

52
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,190
D X that's important to add.

53
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:47,630
And then we want the integral of the derivative of the function.

54
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:47,860
Okay.

55
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:54,530
So then here we see the integral of the function derivative equals to X cubed plus sine of x.

56
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,910
And amazingly enough that is our original function.

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,180
And as I mentioned in the previous video you have to be a little bit careful because technically formally

58
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:13,220
there should be a plus C after here but simply it doesn't show it so in this video and in the previous

59
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:19,850
video I introduced you to the concept of an integral which is all about finding the area under some

60
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:20,320
curve.

61
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:27,250
And it's basically implemented as adding together a lot of really really tiny thin slivers of bars.

62
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,300
You saw how to compute the definite and indefinite integral in Python.

63
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:38,570
And in this exercise you saw that the integral is the inverse of the derivative which is also known

64
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,780
as the first part of the fundamental theorem of calculus.
