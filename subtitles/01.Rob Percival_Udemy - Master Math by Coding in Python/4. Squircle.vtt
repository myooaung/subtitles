00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:10.020
You know when I create this course and all of my other courses I try not to make mistakes.

2
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.050
But of course I'm only human.

3
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.670
I am known to make mistakes.

4
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:21.250
So you might be looking at this slide and shaking your head in despair at what a bizarre typo I've made

5
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.460
here.

6
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.020
This must be a mistake.

7
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.220
I'm trying to write square or circle.

8
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.230
What in the world is a squiggle.

9
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.380
Well it turns out a squirrel is a real thing.

10
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.140
It's an actual legit object.

11
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.440
It is not a mistake.

12
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.800
And the goal of this video is to show you how to discover what a squirrel is.

13
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.620
And then of course you're going to create a squirrel in Python.

14
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.250
So here's what you want to do.

15
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.530
Go to this Web site.

16
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.620
Math World dot Wolf from dot com.

17
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.810
When you go to this Web site this is a great Web site for mathematics by the way you can find formulas

18
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:07.590
for lots and lots and lots and lots of mathematical objects including a lot of Trig and geometric objects.

19
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.860
OK.

20
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.250
So go to this Web site.

21
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.440
Math World dot Wolfram dot com and find the formula for a scorecard.

22
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.100
So you are I'm sure great at using the Internet.

23
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:25.860
So it won't be too hard to get to a formula for a squiggle but you will need to work with that formula

24
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.840
a little bit so you will need to use a pencil or a pen and a piece of paper.

25
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:40.180
Do a little bit of algebra and figure out how to convert that formula into a set of x y coordinate points

26
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.780
that you can then implement in Python and plot.

27
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.940
So that's really the main goal of this video is to produce a squiggle.

28
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.740
All right so here we are in a web browser at Wolfram math world the Web's most extensive mathematics

29
00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.810
resource according to wolfram.

30
00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:59.630
Hey guess what.

31
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.130
Not really sure how they verify this.

32
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.390
OK.

33
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:10.330
So I'm going to type in a score goal like this and we get the first result is circle.

34
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.510
So let's see here is a circle you can see it is not exactly a circle.

35
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.470
It is not exactly a square it's a circle.

36
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.130
And this is pretty interesting we see already right at the top.

37
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.420
We get this formula.

38
00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:32.140
So the formula for a circle actually looks pretty similar to the formula for a circle and buttocks except

39
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:40.630
here this is X to the power of four plus y to the power of four equals a to the power of four and a

40
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.820
is you know a measure of the radius here.

41
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.060
So it looks a bit similar to a circle.

42
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:52.510
Now the thing is this is not a function that can be directly implemented in Python for making graphics.

43
00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.000
And the reason is that you will need to isolate X and or Y in this.

44
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.780
So you're gonna need to do a little bit of paper and pencil work on your own to convert this into an

45
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.170
expression for X and an expression for Y.

46
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.120
And I'm not going to tell you how to do that although of course I will show you my solution.

47
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.540
Okay.

48
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.980
And there's a lot of other stuff here.

49
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.770
So the the curvature the arc length and all sorts of other interesting mathematical properties you can

50
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.120
read a lot more about it if you want to get deeper into the weeds.

51
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:30.700
But this is really the main formula that you need for this video before switching to Python.

52
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:37.060
I want to show you a little bit more about browsing around this Web site so you can see how we got here

53
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.640
how we got to a squiggle.

54
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.810
So there are pages for geometry and then sub pages for plain geometry.

55
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.690
Here's one for curves and plain curves.

56
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.000
So that's pretty interesting.

57
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.130
I'm going to click here.

58
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.750
This is a list of all the plain curves that they discuss on this Web site.

59
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.100
So we can for example go to the Soyuz is going to be five of these things called AIDS.

60
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:07.850
Here's an interesting one the Sicily of diet please if you study for example differential geometry.

61
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:13.160
This is one of the first puzzles that you will come across in differential geometry.

62
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.800
So this called the Sicily of diet please.

63
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.410
It's a kind of interesting looking curve here.

64
00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.860
It's this red line here.

65
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.780
And we can find also the formula here.

66
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:29.600
So X and Y equals so this is even easier to implement in Python compared to the squiggle.

67
00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.490
All right.

68
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.040
So we're not going to look at this.

69
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.020
We're not going to you know implement this here.

70
00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.460
I just wanted to show you all of these kind of interesting things that you can explore on your own at

71
00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.840
Wolfram math world.

72
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.530
And of course this is only one of many many Web sites that highlights mathematics.

73
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.870
All right.

74
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:55.690
So now I'm going to switch to Python and show you how I compute and implement a squiggle.

75
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.710
So let's see let me run this cell here.

76
00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.380
So we get known pi and map plot lib.

77
00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:08.960
So now what we get from that formula on the Web site was X to the power of four plus y to the power

78
00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.790
of four equals a to the power of four.

79
00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.140
Now to make things simple to start off with we can set a to be one.

80
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.350
Right.

81
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.270
Because we don't really care what the exact radius of this thing is.

82
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:28.910
And setting it to be one makes it convenient because one to the power of four is still just one.

83
00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.970
So that makes our mathematics a little bit simpler.

84
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:39.710
Now there's a couple of different ways that you can go about figuring out how to extract x and y coordinates

85
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:40.230
here.

86
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.950
What I'm going to do is specify that actually let me put this in a comment just to make sure that's

87
00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.240
you know it's clear that this is the mathematical formula.

88
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.750
This is not something that I actually want to run in Python.

89
00:05:53.750 --> 00:06:00.980
So what I'm going to do is actually specify that x is just linearly spaced numbers from minus one to

90
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:08.410
plus one let's say in two thousand steps and now I'm going to specify which is not t why.

91
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:14.050
So why is going to be so what do we set y to if we want to isolate y.

92
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:20.970
Well first of all we can subtract X to the power of four from both sides of this equation.

93
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.410
So that's going to look like this.

94
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:31.760
So now we get Y to the power of four equals one minus X to the power of four and then to isolate y we

95
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.580
need to take the fourth root over here.

96
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:40.130
So that's going to be to the power of one fourth like this.

97
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.380
And so in fact.

98
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:47.390
Well now you know I started off just wanting to make this as as math but it ended up being Python code

99
00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:47.790
anyway.

100
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.610
So I'll just move that over there.

101
00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:51.170
Okay.

102
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.190
So I hope that makes sense.

103
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:58.840
So now we have our X and our y and now let's plot this and see how it looks.

104
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:04.100
So X come a Y and I'll set this to be a thick black line.

105
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:11.810
So line with equals three and let's set the axis to be square.

106
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:16.320
And we also don't even need the axis at all so I'm gonna turn it off.

107
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.470
So party that show.

108
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:19.310
Are you excited.

109
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.410
I'm pretty excited.

110
00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.710
I have a little drum roll and so okay.

111
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.250
It looks like we have the sun.

112
00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:32.120
You know this is like a we if the sun were in the shape of a squiggle I'm not sure what the name for

113
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:38.290
a 3D squiggle is but if the sun were a three dimensional squiggle and it's just rising above the horizon.

114
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.100
That's what this looks like to me.

115
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.620
What is actually the the problem here.

116
00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:49.010
Well it isn't really a problem per say but the limitation what we're missing here is that there are

117
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:57.500
in fact two sets or a pair of solutions to this equation that it really is plus this thing and also

118
00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.320
minus this thing.

119
00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:08.300
So therefore what we need to do is actually plot this twice so I'm going to copy and paste and set this

120
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:14.360
to be the same value of x and then minus Y so I hope that makes sense.

121
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:19.790
The reason why this has to be plus and minus is for the same reason that if you say you know if you

122
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:25.370
want to solve for x in the equation x squared equals for the answer.

123
00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:31.570
The solution is that X equals plus two and X equals minus two.

124
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:33.260
So that's essentially what I'm doing here.

125
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:36.800
So I'm just specifying that this is negative y as well.

126
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:44.910
And voila we get our squiggle so I hope to have convinced you that a squiggle is a real thing it's not

127
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:46.620
just some weird mistake that I make.

128
00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:53.260
And then I felt like I needed to cover for myself by making up this whole new beast got us a squirrel.

129
00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.540
It's a real thing.

130
00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:59.720
And I also introduced you to the math world the Wolfram math World Web site.

131
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:05.430
If you were not already familiar with it then I encourage you to spend a few minutes exploring the Web

132
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:05.630
site.

133
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:12.780
It's a trove of interesting information and you've got some more practice solving for x and y using

134
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:14.160
paper and pencil algebra.
