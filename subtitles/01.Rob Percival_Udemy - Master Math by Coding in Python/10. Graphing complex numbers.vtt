00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:10.790
So far I've been taking a very algebraic approach to talking about complex numbers but complex numbers

2
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:17.180
also have an interesting geometric interpretation and that is what I'm going to introduce you to in

3
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.160
this video.

4
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:26.600
So a quick reminder a complex number is a number that has two parts a real part and an imaginary part.

5
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.610
Now because this number has two parts and the two are separate from each other.

6
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.770
In other words whatever number is in the real part has nothing to do with whatever number is in the

7
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:37.990
imaginary part.

8
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.620
We can actually represent this as a coordinate on a plane.

9
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.710
So imagine a coordinate system that looks something like this.

10
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.910
Now you've probably referred to this kind of graph before it's like a Cartesian axis where this would

11
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.070
be the x axis and the y axis but now I'm just going to call this the real axis.

12
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.250
It's typically indicated R E and the imaginary axis which is typically indicated I am.

13
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.270
So now this complex number can actually be conceptualized as a point on this plane.

14
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:17.600
So it's pretty simple we go to units over on the real axis and then three units up on the imaginary

15
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.530
axis.

16
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:25.400
So that gives us a coordinate here and then you can also think about this complex number as a vector

17
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.140
as a line that goes from the origin of this plane.

18
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.750
This real and imaginary axis plane to that coordinate defined by the complex number.

19
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:43.400
So this whole space is called the complex plane complex plane because it has a real axis and an imaginary

20
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.870
axis.

21
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:51.950
This geometric conceptualization of a complex number as a point on this complex plane leads to a lot

22
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.710
of really important applications of complex numbers in linear algebra in spectral analysis and the 48

23
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.850
transforms signal processing and so on.

24
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.980
So you will learn about these applications later on through your adventures in mathematics.

25
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:15.650
But for now I'm just going to introduce you to the idea of plotting a complex number on a plane in Python.

26
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:22.890
So we are going to use the number pi and map plot of Pi plot modules in this video.

27
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.400
So let's just start by creating a complex number.

28
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.850
How about two come a 3.

29
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.440
That's the one that I showed in the slides.

30
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.280
So let's see if the universe were a really lovely place.

31
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:41.060
Then it would be simple to plot complex numbers and it would just look something like this.

32
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.110
Huh OK.

33
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.750
So we do get a dot in a plane but if you look at the coordinates this doesn't match what the actual

34
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.950
numbers say.

35
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.490
So you would have expected that the number or that the coordinate would be at 2 come comma 3.

36
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.200
But this looks like it's at zero Comma 2.

37
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.400
And then we also get this warning here and it says discards the imaginary part.

38
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.200
OK.

39
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.830
So it turns out that the universe is not such a nice place and it's a little bit more involved to plot

40
00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.090
a complex number.

41
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.700
Fortunately it's still not so difficult.

42
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:20.900
So all we have to do is extract the real part and the imaginary part from this complex number separately.

43
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:28.790
So the appropriate way to plot a complex number is to extract the real part that goes on the x axis

44
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.600
and then the imaginary part of Z.

45
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.380
In this case the complex number.

46
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.890
And that gives us the imaginary part on the y axis.

47
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.560
So then you can see that this dot is indeed now located at 2 and 3.

48
00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.800
Okay.

49
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.420
So now I just want to spend a few more moments making this plot look a little bit nicer.

50
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.670
So let's call the x axis.

51
00:03:51.670 --> 00:04:00.410
Label real and the y axis label imaginary and let's put on a grid.

52
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.280
Let's see how this looks so far.

53
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.660
Okay.

54
00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.510
So this is looking a little bit better.

55
00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:11.150
The main thing that I want to do here is make sure that the center of the graph is that the origin of

56
00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.490
the complex plane.

57
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.900
So this center should actually be at 0 0.

58
00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.590
So to do that I'm going to change the axis.

59
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.890
Let's say about 4.

60
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:29.790
So we'll make it minus 44 on the x axis and minus 40 plus four on the y axis.

61
00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:30.130
All right.

62
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.000
So this is a pretty good start.

63
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:38.810
I went to do a little bit more now and that is to draw lines from the origin instead of just coordinates

64
00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.020
and actually you know maybe I'll just plot it right on top of this.

65
00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:49.100
So let's say so this plots the coordinate and now I want to plot a line that goes from the origin to

66
00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.130
that coordinate.

67
00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:57.800
So you will remember from how to draw a line that we start with the 2 x coordinates and then the 2 y

68
00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.340
coordinates.

69
00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.280
So the first x coordinate is zero.

70
00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.590
That's where the line starts and then the line ends well it ends at the real part which is exactly what

71
00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:07.300
we have here.

72
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:16.760
So I will write num pi real Z and then the y part goes from also zero because we start from the origin

73
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:24.000
and then that goes up to the imaginary part and maybe we should make this line also red.

74
00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.500
All right.

75
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.050
So that looks pretty good.

76
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.990
This is pretty similar to what I showed in the slides a few moments ago.

77
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.760
Now if you like you can positive video and add more to this.

78
00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:40.400
For example maybe you want to put thicker black lines along the zero axes.

79
00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:50.320
But I would say this is pretty good for now the exercise for this video is to generate two complex numbers.

80
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:56.900
So I call them here z 1 and said to the real part is minus three and minus one and the imaginary part

81
00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:57.850
is just I.

82
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:04.820
In both cases and then what you want to do is generate these two plots so this is essentially said one

83
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.490
plus Z two over here and Z one times Z two.

84
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:15.590
Over here you can see in both of these cases actually Z one and Z two are exactly the same lines right.

85
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.910
And it's just plotting said one.

86
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.820
So the addition versus the product of these two complex numbers.

87
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:23.210
All right.

88
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.330
So switch to Python positive video write some code to produce these two graphs.

89
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:35.090
And now I am going to switch to Python and you can watch me come up with a solution so let's start down

90
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.290
here with a clean.

91
00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:41.180
So first thing I'm going to do is write down these complex numbers.

92
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.720
So said one was n Peter complex minus three comma 1.

93
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:53.150
Remember if the imaginary part is 1 then the complex number is actually just written as an eye with

94
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:54.270
no number.

95
00:06:54.350 --> 00:07:00.640
So and then Z 2 was known Pi the complex minus 1 and 1.

96
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:01.290
Okay.

97
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:11.000
And then let's call this said maybe 1 p s p 2 for Z 1 plus you know even put that in there and that

98
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.250
equals simply said one plus said two.

99
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:14.550
Okay.

100
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:15.890
So now we want to plot.

101
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:17.870
So p all teed up plot.

102
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.090
Now this is gonna be pretty similar to the code we used up here.

103
00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:30.120
In fact maybe I'll even copy and paste this code so paste in I will let Python pick the right colors

104
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:35.790
and now we just have to make sure to change the variables so this is no longer Z it's actually said

105
00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:45.900
1 and I'm going to add a label so we get a legend so label equals z 1 and now I can just copy and paste

106
00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:47.790
and paste again.

107
00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:53.440
So this is for Z 2 and said 3.

108
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:58.950
That's said one plus the two and this one is said.

109
00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.430
And this one is said to.

110
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:08.570
This one is said two plus said two years have to be super careful when you are copying and pasting code

111
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:13.100
that you're not making any mistakes by omission.

112
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.340
For example this would be a pretty easy mistake to make.

113
00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:24.710
You correctly changed this variable here but you forgot to change this variable here all right.

114
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:30.140
And actually now I'm gonna run all the code in this cell just to make sure that it already looks good.

115
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:35.920
Okay so this is already working we don't see any errors but I want to adjust this plot a little bit

116
00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:38.430
so it looks nicer in particular.

117
00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:44.380
The most important thing to change is putting the origin of the complex plane into the center of the

118
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:45.310
graph.

119
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:52.600
And so I'm actually going to copy and paste some of this code down here and let's just see how that

120
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.640
looks.

121
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:58.370
Okay so that looks pretty good except the plots looks like it might be getting cut off here.

122
00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:01.050
So how about first of all let me write peel.

123
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:02.170
Data show.

124
00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:08.310
So how about I try maybe five instead of four.

125
00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:17.940
Okay so that part looks better and now I want to make this x axis square so peel the axis square and

126
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:25.760
then the last thing I'm going to do is activate the legend to make sure that we see the labels.

127
00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:26.010
Okay.

128
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.720
So I think this looks great.

129
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:32.380
This looks just like what we showed on these slides a moment ago.

130
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.880
Now fortunately the next part of the exercise is super easy.

131
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:43.590
All you need to do is copy and paste this into the next cell.

132
00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:47.650
And now I'm going to say said one times Z too.

133
00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:54.230
And this has to be replaced with multiplication and then did you do I think all this is the same except

134
00:09:54.290 --> 00:10:04.430
this will say times OK so we don't get any errors but somehow this line almost looks like it's the same

135
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.830
as this but in fact it looks like it's exactly the same as this part.

136
00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.650
So maybe I did something wrong here.

137
00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:15.500
In fact what I did wrong was exactly the mistake that I just warned you about.

138
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:19.660
I copied and pasted code and didn't change enough of the code.

139
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:25.860
So this is still said one plus said to some so plotting the same vector as above.

140
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.010
So this needs to be a T four times and this needs to be t four times.

141
00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:32.050
Okay.

142
00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:39.750
And now that looks really good in this video you got an introduction to representing complex numbers

143
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:40.970
geometrically.

144
00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:48.150
So on a graph I told you about the complex plane and I showed you how to plot complex numbers both as

145
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:54.060
points as coordinates and also as lines from the origin to those points in Python.
