1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,290
There are two exercises in this video.

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,440
This first exercise is actually pretty simple.

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,090
It's pretty straightforward.

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:16,650
All you have to do is implement these two formulas.

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:22,110
So translate these two formulas into Python code and then make a plot.

6
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:28,660
There is nothing particularly difficult or tricky about this but I think these are two interesting looking

7
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,290
functions so it's pretty neat to see what they look like.

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:37,810
The second exercise is a little bit more involved and there are some there's a little bit of problem

9
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,490
solving that's involved in this.

10
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:43,420
So essentially what you want to do is create a plot that looks like this.

11
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,220
So what are we looking at here.

12
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:52,840
So in gray you can see the unit circle and then you can specify some angle here I've specified seven

13
00:00:52,840 --> 00:01:00,730
pi over six and then I drew an arc in this thick black line there's an arc that ends in a dot that goes

14
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,170
from zero.

15
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:08,890
So from an angle of zero all the way out to this angle here is specified by seven pi over six.

16
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:15,700
And then what I've done is draw some lines to indicate the sine part or the sine component of this angle

17
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:22,720
and the cosine component of this angle and then also with these dotted lines here.

18
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:29,950
So again there's nothing in this figure that you don't already know how to do but it does take a little

19
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:35,170
bit of time to figure out how to get all the components to work and to look good together.

20
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,590
All right.

21
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:42,250
So switch to Python implement these two exercises and then come back to the video and you can watch

22
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,220
me walk through my solution.

23
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,860
So let's start with that first exercise.

24
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:55,790
I'm going to specify that the variable x which is going to be the theta that's gonna be linearly spaced

25
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:56,230
number.

26
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:03,220
Now I didn't actually give you a specific range for plotting these but I'm going to go from minus two

27
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:10,750
pi to plus two pi in let's say two hundred steps lots of twos around here.

28
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,010
Okay.

29
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:18,810
So we had two functions why one was to take a cosine and embedded in a sine.

30
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,170
So that was NPD.

31
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,470
So sign of X plus the cosine of X..

32
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:31,420
And then we had y two was basically the reverse of this.

33
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:39,130
So that was the cosine of X and inside the cosine is the sine function.

34
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,590
So now BLT dot plot.

35
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:50,350
Now previously in this course or I guess usually the way that I plot things is to have one line of code

36
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,090
per plot.

37
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,020
So I would do something like this.

38
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,470
Now there's nothing wrong with plotting it this way.

39
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,930
However it's also possible to put all of these on one line.

40
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:10,780
So here I'm specifying X and Y and then another X and Y and you can see that this also works.

41
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,700
This produces the same result.

42
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:19,030
Now sometimes it's easier to do it this way sometimes for like aesthetics for making the code seem easier

43
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,660
to write.

44
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:28,980
I prefer to have one line of Python code per line of plotting but it's a matter of personal preference.

45
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:29,190
All right.

46
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:38,560
So let me add a legend here now because I have these two lines of of these two plotting lines on the

47
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,400
same line of code.

48
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,850
I'm gonna put the legend in here.

49
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:55,480
So this is going to say the sign of X plus costs X and then the legend for the second line is cosine

50
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,200
of X plus the sign of X..

51
00:03:59,260 --> 00:03:59,650
All right.

52
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,240
So this looks pretty good.

53
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,700
And again the main point of me ask you to do this exercise was because I think these functions look

54
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,500
pretty neat.

55
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:16,320
So it's nice too to be exposed to this concept of embedding some trig functions inside other trig functions.

56
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,720
Now of course I encourage you to do all sorts of things to play around with this.

57
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,530
You can try you know what happens if we square the cosine here.

58
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,390
So that's kind of funny it looks a little wiggly.

59
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,080
Of course the legend does no wrong.

60
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:35,710
But but you are now free to continue playing around and of course that's the main point of this course

61
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:42,690
right to show you how to use python as a tool to explore concepts in mathematics.

62
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:42,970
Okay.

63
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:48,030
And just to make sure that this is totally legit.

64
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,610
I'm going to add the appropriate legend here.

65
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:51,910
All right.

66
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,970
So now we get to the second exercise.

67
00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:01,480
And as I mentioned this exercise isn't really difficult persay but there are a lot of moving parts.

68
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:08,950
So I'm going to start by specifying some theta as an angle so let's call that known pi it up Pi.

69
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:14,800
And I guess in the slides I did seven pi divided by six.

70
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,370
So let's also go for that here.

71
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:17,620
OK.

72
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:24,840
So we're going to need to do this in multiple steps so I'm going to start by plotting the unit circle

73
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:32,060
so to plot the unit circle I want to have a gray line that just goes around in a circle.

74
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:37,920
So appeal to you that plot and then this is going to be cosine of.

75
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,500
I didn't specify angles yet.

76
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:47,680
So let's say x equals known pi Lynn space from 0 to 2 pi and let's go for two hundred steps.

77
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:50,800
That's probably more than sufficient.

78
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:55,230
So here we say costs X by sign of X.

79
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:59,430
And now I want the color to be gray.

80
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:03,860
Okay and then let's see how this is looking so far.

81
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,190
Okay.

82
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:09,560
So I mean this is supposed to be a circle but it's plotted as an oval.

83
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,520
So let's fix this.

84
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:18,980
I'll say P L T to get current axis dot set aspect and I'll set that to be equal.

85
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:24,440
Now you'll notice that sometimes I use this code sometimes I say plot axis square.

86
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:29,110
Of course there are multiple ways to solve particular problems in Python.

87
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,910
And it's good to be familiar with different ways.

88
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:36,200
I'm sure there are also many other ways that I'm not using.

89
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,640
Okay so that's the unit circle.

90
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:45,410
I would also like to have some great dashed lines going across the zero coordinates here.

91
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,030
So I'm also gonna add that up here.

92
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:57,800
So I want the horizontal axis to go from x equals well minus one point one two plus one point one and

93
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,190
then that means the y coordinates will go from zero to zero.

94
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:05,970
This is going to be a dash line and the color is gray all right.

95
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,470
So that looks pretty good.

96
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:14,800
And then we need the vertical counterpart and that's going to be basically the same code.

97
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,690
I'm just going to swap the x and y coordinates here.

98
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,100
All right.

99
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,360
So that's looking pretty good.

100
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:26,950
The next thing I want to plot is the arc that's going to be that thick line that starts from here.

101
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:32,310
And it goes to whatever point is specified by this theta here.

102
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:32,820
So let's see.

103
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,460
Plot the arc.

104
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,800
So I'm going to plot a.

105
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:38,810
So what do we need here.

106
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,750
Well we need it's not just theta.

107
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,940
We need numbers.

108
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,330
We need angles that go from 0 up to theta.

109
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,000
So in fact that's going to look similar to this.

110
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:55,760
And I think I will just put it all directly inside the plot function instead of specifying it as a separate

111
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,990
variable like this.

112
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:03,580
So I'm going to write none paid out costs and now embedded inside there is going to be linear at least

113
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,330
based numbers from 0 to theta.

114
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:13,520
And you know if you don't specify any third input into the Lin space function the default value is I

115
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,360
think it's 50.

116
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,160
Let's see starts up num equals 50.

117
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:18,360
Yeah.

118
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:25,550
So without writing a third input that is equivalent to providing a third input of 50.

119
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:30,060
So let's see if that is going to give us a nice line.

120
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:37,740
So NPR sign of Lin space 0 2 theta.

121
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,530
Okay looking good.

122
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,930
So we see this line it starts here and it ends here.

123
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,220
That's all correct.

124
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,550
But I want this to be a thick black line.

125
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:54,770
So K and then line with let's set this to be about 3 0 all right.

126
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,970
That's looking good.

127
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,330
Now I want a vector that goes from the origin to this point here.

128
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:09,890
Remember that was also in the slides so P.L. teed up plot and now the x component is gonna go from zero

129
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,810
to costs of theta.

130
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:18,530
And the y component is gonna go from zero to sign of theta.

131
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,800
And this is going to be a black.

132
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,250
Now I could make this a dotted line like this.

133
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,470
However I already have this r dash line I meant to say I already have dash lines here.

134
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,670
So I think that looks a little bit confusing.

135
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:38,570
So therefore I'm going to use a colon to make this a dotted line all right.

136
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,850
And then we need a little a little ball sitting there.

137
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,760
So let's say let's see.

138
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,280
Well copy and paste this here.

139
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:53,090
So now instead of a line that starts at the origin we just want a dot at exactly this theta coordinates.

140
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:59,270
So that is going to be k 0 4 knockout.

141
00:09:59,300 --> 00:09:59,840
Just kidding.

142
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,390
Keto is for a black circle.

143
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,110
Very nice.

144
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,030
So we are getting there.

145
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,340
The last thing that we need.

146
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,840
Well not the last things a couple more things that we need.

147
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:14,210
The next thing I'm going to work on is getting these green and red lines in here.

148
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:23,960
So I'm going to call that plot the separate components and I see that s is the sine and cosine components.

149
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,580
So let's start with the sine part.

150
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:32,600
So the sine part is basically going to be a red line that goes along the y axis and then a red dotted

151
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,300
line that goes out to this point here.

152
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,370
So let's start with this red line first.

153
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:42,100
So that is going to be a line that goes on the x axis.

154
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,110
It's going to go zero to zero.

155
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:53,300
It doesn't go anywhere on the x axis and on the y axis it goes from zero to the sine component of theta.

156
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,890
And then this is going to be a red line.

157
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:57,350
All right.

158
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,970
So that looks pretty good.

159
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,020
And then I want a dotted line here.

160
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:06,770
So this is a little bit trickier because it's not going to look exactly the same here.

161
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,610
This is in fact a horizontal line.

162
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:16,670
So it's gonna be fixed on the y axis and moving on the x axis are changing on the x axis.

163
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,450
So we want people to eat up plot.

164
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:27,380
So the x component is going to go from zero to this point here and this point here on the x axis is

165
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,440
the cosine part.

166
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:39,110
So N.P. that costs of theta and then the y axis component is fixed and it's fixed at the sign of theta.

167
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:45,080
So any Pitot sine theta and P does sign of theta.

168
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:50,020
And then this is going to be a red dotted line all right.

169
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:52,210
That looks pretty good to me.

170
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,770
So now we basically need to repeat these two lines.

171
00:11:54,770 --> 00:12:02,280
But for the cosine part instead of the sine part so let's see so the blue line that goes out here is

172
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:09,720
going to be fixed on the x axis and on the y axis it's going to go from zero to cosine.

173
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,900
So going to do a little copy paste job here.

174
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,500
So let's see.

175
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:24,430
We want this to go on the x axis to cosine theta and then we'll make this a blue line.

176
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:25,120
All right.

177
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,400
Looking good.

178
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:31,100
And then let's see I think I'm not going to copy paste this I'll just write it again from scratch.

179
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:38,660
So BLT dot plot and now the x coordinates will go will stay at cosine of theta.

180
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:47,880
And Peter costs theta and the y coordinates will start from zero and then drop down to the y component

181
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,400
here which is known Pi the sign of theta.

182
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:56,490
And I said this to be a blue dashed line a dotted line sorry.

183
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,090
Very nice.

184
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,830
So the last thing that we need here is a title.

185
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:03,090
So I want the title to be.

186
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:07,890
So the title should essentially just say that theta equals.

187
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:11,300
And then whatever the theta angle is equal to.

188
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:14,170
So percent theta.

189
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:15,480
Okay.

190
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:21,930
So this is not exactly what I showed in the slides I showed in the slides that this was the Greek character

191
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:28,540
the Greek letter theta so that we know how to do we just need to convert this into latex code.

192
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:31,890
So let's see how this looks now.

193
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:32,210
All right.

194
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:37,190
So this looks better except what I actually input it here was seven pi over six.

195
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,520
And also what I showed in the slides was seven pi over six.

196
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,650
So to get that with the PI character and everything this needs to be in latex.

197
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:50,190
So I'm going to write some that later.

198
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:57,060
Now of course I haven't actually imported the simple AI module so I'm gonna have to go back up here

199
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:07,370
and import Sim pi as Sim run that code again and let's see keep our fingers crossed.

200
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,040
Oh.

201
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,600
That was very disappointing.

202
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,600
I was really hoping that this would have the PI character in here.

203
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,590
Now what is the problem here.

204
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:23,700
The problem here is that this variable theta although I'm specifying it in terms of Pi it's not actually

205
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,710
seven pi over six.

206
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:29,730
This is just an approximation of seven pi over six.

207
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:37,110
And that's because pi is an irrational number a computer cannot actually represent or compute exactly

208
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:37,720
Pi.

209
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:43,470
All it can do is estimate pi to some reasonable degree of accuracy.

210
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:49,860
So what we actually want to do here is be able to specify these angles symbolically.

211
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,080
So let's say first Sim.

212
00:14:52,080 --> 00:15:00,450
I don't know how you would pronounce this sim and that is going to be Sim dot pi times seven divided

213
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:01,660
by six.

214
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:11,580
And then I can change this to be FSM and now we get a nice looking title here.

215
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:16,050
However now if you want to change the angle if you want to plot a different angle you have to change

216
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,990
both of these lines which is pretty tedious.

217
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:27,270
So instead what I'm going to do is say that theta equals fist him but then I'm going to convert this

218
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,960
into a floating point number.

219
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,770
So now all I need to do first of all run this code just to make sure we didn't get any errors.

220
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:42,670
All you need to do to change this angle now is I just changed the four Sims so the symbolic representation

221
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,700
of this angle.

222
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:47,410
Let's say I want this three over 16.

223
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,760
So three pi over 16.

224
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,580
And now that changes the plot accurately.

225
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:53,920
All right.

226
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:57,920
So unfortunately this is still only like 98 percent finished.

227
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:06,580
The other 2 percent is to have a legend in here but you already know how to create legends in Python

228
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,130
graphics.

229
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:14,280
So I think I will let you complete that part on your own in this video and in the previous video you

230
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:20,640
got more experience working with trig functions in the video you learned about the importance of resolution.

231
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:26,600
And here you learned more about plotting in Python and working with trigonometric functions.
