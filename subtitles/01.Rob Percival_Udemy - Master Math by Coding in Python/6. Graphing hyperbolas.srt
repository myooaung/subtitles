1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,290
In the past several videos we've moved from circles to ellipses.

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,580
And now we are going to discuss hyperbole.

3
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,750
I'll show you the formula of a hyperbole.

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:21,090
Of course you'll get to see it in Python and at the end of the video you will get to see how to make

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,910
more really cool looking graphics using hyperbole.

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,540
So hyperbole.

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,940
Looks a little bit like an ellipse but it's like inverted.

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,240
It's like if you would flip in the lips.

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,060
So here is the center or the focus of the hyperbole.

10
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:41,550
And then you can see the hyperbole opens outwards from the center instead of closing around it.

11
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:48,660
So there are also two radii or two radial components that are parameters so that's a that's from the

12
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:55,470
center to one of these to the closest point in the hyperbole here or this would also be a here and then

13
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,790
there's a another component of the radius called B.

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,590
This corresponds to the radius and the y axis.

15
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:08,700
And it's a little bit harder to exactly map this length or this value be onto the hyperbole.

16
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:15,260
But it is related to how the tensions coming off of this hyperbole will intersect this line anyway.

17
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:23,360
If you look at the formula here it might look a little bit familiar from the video on ellipses.

18
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:30,420
In fact it's almost exactly the same formula as an ellipse except for this one term right here.

19
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,910
So to create the lips you write exactly this formula except this is a plus sign.

20
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,720
So when you add these two terms together you get an ellipse when you subtract these two terms you get

21
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,260
a hyperbole.

22
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:44,640
All right.

23
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:52,750
So let's switch to code and we'll see how to implement this like all the other videos in this section

24
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:59,610
we are going to use the number pi module and the plot a map plot lib dot pi plot module.

25
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,320
So I'm going to get started by writing some parameters.

26
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,320
So I picked out a few parameters that I think look reasonable for getting started.

27
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:11,770
So a and b are respectively 1 and point 5.

28
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:16,120
And H is 1 and k is 2.

29
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:25,420
So then we need to set up the mesh so capital X Capital Y equals num PI that mesh grid and then little

30
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:32,110
X little X and on working a little bit backwards here in general it's sometimes useful in code to work

31
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:37,300
backwards so you start with like a target line of code and then you you work backwards to figure out

32
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,290
what X has to be.

33
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:43,930
So X is going to be known pi Lynn's space.

34
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:50,350
And here you will recall from the previous videos in this course that I said that to be a variable called

35
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:56,020
X Lim so minus X Lim to plus X Lim where X Lim is for the Axis limit.

36
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,620
So then we need to define that variable.

37
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,880
And this is almost going to be the same as for the Ellipse.

38
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:15,940
So that was the maximum of A and B plus the maximum of the absolute value of each and the absolute value

39
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:16,840
of k.

40
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:22,450
Now the main difference here is that I want to have a little bit more room for the hyperbole to open

41
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,950
up within the axis.

42
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:28,260
So I'm gonna multiply this by two.

43
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:28,650
Okay.

44
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:34,090
And now I've written several lines of code here so I'm gonna just run the code in this cell just to

45
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,830
make sure that I haven't made any silly typos here.

46
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,420
So far no typos.

47
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:39,690
All right.

48
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,510
So now let's create the function.

49
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,640
So I will use I always use f x y.

50
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,220
How about hyperbole.

51
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:51,530
Hyperbole equals.

52
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:59,110
So this was X minus H squared five any more videos on this you've probably memorized this formula right

53
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,770
now.

54
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,120
So here is the key difference again between an ellipse and a hyperbole.

55
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:10,380
So this is a plus sign that creates an ellipse but we want a minus sign to create a hyperbole.

56
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:20,500
And then we do Y and then we shift y according to K squared and then we stretch y according to B so

57
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:28,560
H and K are shifting a and b are stretching and then of course we need the minus one.

58
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,110
All right.

59
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:39,730
And then we can draw a contour so P L T that contour X comma Y comma the function so high per blah and

60
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:45,250
then zero actually l I'll show it without the zero first just so we can see what this looks like.

61
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:45,510
Okay.

62
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,850
So here you see all of the contour lines are.

63
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,460
Well not all of them but several contour lines.

64
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,390
And what we want is really just this primary contour line.

65
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:01,240
And that is indicated with a zero here by the way it's also interesting to see what happens.

66
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:07,120
You know if you would write to for example then you're gonna see three lines here so three contours.

67
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:13,060
This is I mean this is like technically two separate lines but this corresponds to the same contour

68
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,400
because they have the same amplitude here at the same height.

69
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:17,760
OK.

70
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:27,790
So let's set this back to two and then I'm going to set the current axis that set aspect ratio to be

71
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:31,520
equal and peel to you that show.

72
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,930
Let's see how this looks.

73
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:33,360
All right.

74
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,440
This is starting to look pretty good.

75
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,730
And again it's also interesting to see how important that factor of minus 1 is.

76
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:46,300
In fact this is this hardly even looks like a hyperbole anymore because the lines are basically kissing

77
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,650
right here in the middle.

78
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:47,860
All right.

79
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,640
So I also want to plot a dot at the center.

80
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:59,140
So I'm going to write P L T dot plots then the center is h com a K and let's make this a green circle

81
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,550
like Oh is that starting to look pretty good here.

82
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:08,200
And I guess the last thing I'm going to do is draw a horizontal line at x equals zero and a vertical

83
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,990
line at Y equals zero.

84
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,330
So P L T dot plot.

85
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,010
Let's start with the horizontal line.

86
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:21,070
So for the horizontal line where is that going to go what are the x limits of this horizontal line.

87
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:30,280
Well well we want them is from X limb or minus accident plus axiom so minus X limb 2 plus X limb and

88
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:38,920
because this is a line that goes across the horizontal slice here at Y equals zero the y coordinate

89
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,340
stays zero all of time.

90
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:42,570
Okay.

91
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:47,860
So then let's make this a black horizontal dotted line like this.

92
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,750
All right.

93
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:55,260
So then once you get one the other line is generally pretty easy because you just need to swap the X

94
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,360
and the y coordinates here.

95
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:57,740
All right.

96
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:02,780
So I'm actually going to take this opportunity to illustrate something to you about Python plotting.

97
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,430
So here this line is black.

98
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:11,000
Because I wrote the K here so I could write are here and we'd get a red line.

99
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:17,430
But now I'm going to provide an additional input to the plot function and that's going to be color and

100
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,050
I'll make this gray so point eight point eight point eight.

101
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:25,800
So 80 percent red 80 percent Green 80 percent blue.

102
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,760
And notice that I already have a color specified here.

103
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,370
So who wins when there's a battle between R and point eight point eight point eight.

104
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,880
Who wins.

105
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,670
Well the answer is that the point eights have it.

106
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,170
They get to win.

107
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:47,820
So this optional input here for specifying the color is going to overwrite whatever you specify here.

108
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:48,150
All right.

109
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,680
And now I don't really like this.

110
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,940
This looks unbalanced.

111
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:55,650
So I am going to also paste the same color up here.

112
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,470
Then we get nice balance over here.

113
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:58,800
All right.

114
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,460
So I always think hyperbole is really neat.

115
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:05,280
And because I think hyperbole is look so neat.

116
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,490
I created an exercise for you to explore and neat looking at hyperbole as well.

117
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:14,640
So if you are looking at here is to hyperbole is here.

118
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:20,880
So two sets of lines the like these cyan ones here and the purple ones over here and that corresponds

119
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,860
to to hyperbole.

120
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,740
So how did I create these.

121
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,850
Well you already know the formula.

122
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,200
And so the rest you are kind of going to have to figure out on your own.

123
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,430
So I'm giving you a little bit of a hint here.

124
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:41,160
I set H and K both to be equal to zero which means that these high hyperbole as are centered at the

125
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,210
origin of the plot.

126
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:49,800
That also simplifies the code a little bit because you don't actually need to say X minus H in parentheses

127
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,940
you can just say h squared or site X squared and then Y squared.

128
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:55,310
Okay.

129
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:03,420
So what I did to create these hyperbole is is I varied the A and B parameters but I'm not telling you

130
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,620
what I vary them between.

131
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:08,090
So it was from between one number and another number.

132
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:13,770
And this might be the same number or it might be a different number compared to a you are going to have

133
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,610
to experiment and play around with that.

134
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:16,920
All right.

135
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,160
So now is your chance to switch to Python.

136
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:26,820
Pause the video and try to reproduce this plot all right.

137
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,550
So let's get started with a clean sell here.

138
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,390
So I used n equals sixteen hyperbole.

139
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:38,460
I created sixteen hyperbole is to make that plot that I showed you.

140
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:43,740
And then the values that I used for a and b were actually both the same.

141
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:49,160
So in fact I'm even going to simplify the code a bit more here by calling this variable a B.

142
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:55,660
So I created this as linearly spaced numbers between 1 and 5.

143
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,390
And of course there are and of them.

144
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:58,740
Okay.

145
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:05,520
So then let's see so little X is going to be known pi Lynn space we're using Lynn space an awful lot

146
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:08,040
in this section of the course.

147
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,700
Minus X Linda plus X Lim and a hundred steps.

148
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:18,750
And I just hardcoded X Lim to be eight here because I played around a little bit and that seemed to

149
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:23,100
be a good value for this exercise for this image.

150
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:23,790
Right.

151
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:30,040
So X comma Y equals and p dot mesh grid X comma x.

152
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:36,510
And then what I'm going to do is setup a for loop that's going to loop over the different hyperbole

153
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,600
is and I will and plot them.

154
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,260
So let's see.

155
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,970
So for i in range 0 2.

156
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:50,730
And so what I'm going to do is create the first hyper bla and actually let's just start with with one

157
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,180
and we'll plot it and see how that look.

158
00:10:52,180 --> 00:11:05,250
So x x squared divided by A B and then it's the eighth element in A B and that gets squared minus Y

159
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:12,140
squared also divided by a B squared minus one of course.

160
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:20,820
And then peel to that contour You guys must be getting so good at setting up these contours I'm sure

161
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,510
you could do them in your sleep by now.

162
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,210
So f 1 0.

163
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,140
Okay.

164
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:36,990
So now I'm going to say P L T THE AXIS off and peel to show you know actually when you're turning the

165
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:41,240
Axis off you don't actually need the x y here either.

166
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,850
Okay so this is getting somewhere.

167
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,570
Obviously we're not finished yet.

168
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:53,880
I'm gonna make sure that the aspect ratio is identical for the two axes to make this a square plot.

169
00:11:53,910 --> 00:12:00,870
So peel to the GCA forget current axis that set aspect is equal.

170
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:04,250
Okay this is looking a little bit better now.

171
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:12,360
So far we have these like horizontal hyperbole as I haven't actually told you how to create a vertical

172
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:12,950
hyperbole.

173
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:19,110
So how to create a hyperbole that opens up and down instead of to the left and to the right.

174
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:22,840
But I guess that you probably have figured it out by now.

175
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:28,710
And the solution the way that you do it is essentially by swapping X and Y because that's kind of what

176
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,880
you're doing here.

177
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,690
If you think about this geometrically.

178
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:39,780
You want to rotate this thing 90 degrees which is the same thing as swapping x and y so to create the

179
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,300
other contour.

180
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:50,730
I'll call that f to all you do is well you can move the Y to this side and you can say Y minus X but

181
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,860
just to make things a little bit easier.

182
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,780
Well I find it a little easier I don't know if you find it easier or harder but I'm going to keep the

183
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:04,030
X and the Y in the same order and just subtract the X and add the Y.

184
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,790
Okay so let's see how that looks now.

185
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,130
All right.

186
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,060
So this is starting to look good.

187
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:12,730
The last thing we need to do is get the colors to look good.

188
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:19,060
So I will just show you what I did for the colors so colors equals I.

189
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:22,550
Divided by n zero I divided by n.

190
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,540
So let's see what this does.

191
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:33,600
So when I is in the beginning of this loop so when I is a small number relative to n then this is basically

192
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,880
close to 0 0 zero.

193
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:39,420
In fact it starts off at zero zero zero which means it's gonna start off at black.

194
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:43,920
So the very first contour here is going to be black.

195
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:49,440
And then as I increases which means that we are going through this loop through more iterations in this

196
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:56,850
loop which also means that the radius parameter a and also B is getting bigger.

197
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:04,130
So the parabola is getting wider this angle here is getting wider then the red channel gets lighter.

198
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:09,690
The blue channel gets lighter and the green channel stays at zero.

199
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,220
So that's how this turns.

200
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:15,950
Like this kind of purplish color you could set this to be you know point eight.

201
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,930
And it would look quite a bit different.

202
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,860
This also looks nice actually.

203
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,370
Maybe I'll leave it like this for now.

204
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:22,230
OK.

205
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,300
So now I'm going to copy and paste.

206
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:31,350
And then what I did just to show you how I set this up in the picture in the code.

207
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:40,440
So then I set the R channels so the red channel to be zero and then green and blue were set to be increasing

208
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,030
from zero up to one.

209
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:50,220
And so that's how you get this line here as with previous videos if you feel a little bit inspired to

210
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:56,520
start making your own beautiful images based on what I showed you in this section and in this video

211
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:02,940
then what I encourage you to do is take a screenshot and when you should show me is first this picture

212
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,610
and then next to it your version.

213
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:11,430
So you should show this just to prove that you can really replicate my results and then you show your

214
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:15,270
new and improved version and post it in a Q and A form.

215
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:18,740
I will be very happy to see what you've come up with.

216
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:25,500
So in this video you learned about hyperbole is and a little bit more about using simple geometry to

217
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,800
make really interesting minimalistic graphics.
