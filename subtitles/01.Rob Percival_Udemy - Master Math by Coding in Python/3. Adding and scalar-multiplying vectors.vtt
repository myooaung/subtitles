00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:09.860
Now that you know what factors are and how to create them in Python it's time to start learning how

2
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.020
to work with them.

3
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.320
So in this video I'm going to introduce you to adding and subtracting vectors.

4
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.190
It's actually pretty simple it's pretty straightforward.

5
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:26.910
And I will show you about multiplying vectors by scalar which is often called vector scalar multiplication.

6
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.740
Now if you're not familiar with what a scalar is.

7
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:36.280
I'm also going to explain that and you will see why these are called scholars but essentially a scalar

8
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.720
is just a single number.

9
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.040
All right.

10
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.990
So let's get started adding two vectors is pretty easy.

11
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.180
It's exactly how you would expect it should work.

12
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:53.380
So to add this vector to this vector all you do is add each individual element or each corresponding

13
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.120
element in turn.

14
00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.970
So one plus two is three zero plus minus three is minus three and so on.

15
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:09.310
So needless to say two vectors can only be added together if they are the same size or the same dimensionality.

16
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.540
So this is a four dimensional vector and a four dimensional vector.

17
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.000
If this were only a three dimensional vector.

18
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.150
So imagine if you didn't have this one here then it would not be possible it would not be valid to add

19
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.610
together these two vectors because this fourth element here would.

20
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.430
Well you know he wouldn't have anyone to talk to.

21
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:37.210
So the addition just wouldn't be valid and subtracting two vectors of course is exactly the same concept.

22
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:44.590
You would just put a subtraction sine a minus sign here instead of a plus sine vector scalar multiplication

23
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.590
is also pretty straightforward.

24
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:56.230
So imagine V is some vector and Lambda This is a lowercase Greek letter lambda is a scalar so a scalar

25
00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.030
is just a single number.

26
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:09.910
So for example if vector V is this vector minus 1 0 1 and Lambda where just the number 7 then to implement

27
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:17.380
this operation scalar vector multiplication all you do is multiply these scalar by each element in the

28
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.950
vector individually.

29
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:26.140
So this operation will produce this result minus 7 0 and 7.

30
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.350
So now I'm going to switch to Python and I'm going to skip right to the vector scalar multiplication

31
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:40.080
because I'm going to talk more about the vector addition in a few moments and also in the exercise so

32
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:47.540
in python you will also learn why a single number is called a scalar in the context of linear algebra

33
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.920
so let's get started.

34
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:59.790
So what I'm going to do is actually create a vector let's call that vector V and this will be a num

35
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.300
pi array and let's set this vector to be about point five.

36
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.650
Come on one.

37
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.590
And now what I'm going to do is create a list of scalar.

38
00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.060
So it's gonna be a bunch of scholars.

39
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.470
How about 1 and minus point 5 and 2.

40
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.830
And just a regular point five.

41
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:26.480
And now what I'm going to do is show you in a plot this vector V Times each of these four scalar.

42
00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.990
So remember I'm not considering this to be a vector.

43
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.420
This is not a four element vector.

44
00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:39.290
It is a four element list in Python but in terms of linear algebra this is actually a collection of

45
00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.730
scholars.

46
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:41.070
Okay.

47
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:48.600
So for let's call this s I N S so this is going to be the looping index variable here.

48
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.650
S.I. let's create a new vector that is the scaled version of V.

49
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.430
And that equals s I times V and then I'm gonna plot this.

50
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.950
So SPL BLT dot plot everything is gonna be in standard position.

51
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:13.070
So the X coordinate will go from zero to S V zero and then the y coordinates will go from zero to S

52
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.410
V.

53
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:21.890
1 and I'm gonna set this to be a line with circles on both sides of the line and make sure it's a nice

54
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.980
thick lines a line with equals 3.

55
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:32.600
And then I'm gonna set the label to be essentially the value of this scalar so I'm going to do this

56
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:41.900
using LaTeX coding so lambda equals percent G and then this gets replaced with S I.

57
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:42.430
All right.

58
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.890
And then let's see how this looks appealed appeal to that show.

59
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:46.150
Okay.

60
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.100
So here you see it looks like one line but really this is actually four separate lines that are all

61
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.780
being plotted.

62
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:59.350
And before I take a moment to interpret this I just want to make this plot look a little bit nicer.

63
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.430
So make it square.

64
00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:08.540
I'll set the axis to go from minus three to plus three in both the x and y directions and let's see

65
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:14.110
help pull the put a grid on and of course we need to activate the legend.

66
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.660
All right.

67
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.600
I love watching these nicely formatted graphs just pop up before my eyes.

68
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.700
So let's see what we have here.

69
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:28.670
So when lambda equals 1 so lambda is the scalar that's the blue line which is kind of hidden behind

70
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:29.860
here but you see it here.

71
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:35.170
This is just the original line of course because we're multiplying this vector by the number one.

72
00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.380
So it doesn't change anything.

73
00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:44.570
So they're the coordinates are minus our side point 5 and 1 so that you see here and here is the origin.

74
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.050
So notice what happened when lambda was negative.

75
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.680
So he said minus point five.

76
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:55.040
And these the vector actually turned around and went the opposite direction although it's kind of still

77
00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:02.480
on this one line you can imagine there's like this infinitely long line here and all these scaled versions

78
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.960
of this vector are lying on that line.

79
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.670
And when the scalar is negative it turns the direction of the vector around.

80
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.030
So it's like going the other way across zero.

81
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:18.920
And then I multiply it by two and it gets in the same direction but twice as long.

82
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:25.790
And that's a general feature of scalar vector multiplication that the scaled version of the vector will

83
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:32.720
never change direction so it never points off this way or this way the direction doesn't change but

84
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.760
the length of the line will change.

85
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.850
So we can get longer where it can get shorter.

86
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:43.280
It can point negative but it's still on the same line even if it's going negative.

87
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.780
So that's for vector scalar multiplication.

88
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.640
What I'd like to show you now is addition.

89
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:58.970
So let's create two vectors of color is v 1 and let's say this is like minus 1 and 2 and v 2 all set

90
00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.000
to be one and one.

91
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:08.540
And so what I'm going to do now is show you three different ways of adding these factors together just

92
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:15.390
to show you a bit of variety so I'll call this some vector V three and then I'm going to call this one

93
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:20.180
V Three a because there's gonna be three different versions.

94
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.410
So V one plus V 2.

95
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.850
That's pretty straightforward.

96
00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:35.700
V 3 B is going to be num PI that add v 1 comma v 2 and now 4 v 3 C I'm initially going to set this to

97
00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.050
be zero.

98
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:45.210
So I'm going to initialize it as a num pi matrix of just zeros and then when I'm going to do is basically

99
00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:50.280
loop through all the elements in these factors and add them up individually.

100
00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:58.530
So for I in range of 0 to 2 and I'm using 2 here because these are two dimensional vectors they have

101
00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:06.490
two elements in them v three C and then we want the IAF element or C there's a little typo here.

102
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:13.530
Let's say I equals V 1 I plus V 2 I.

103
00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:20.760
So you can see I'm adding together all of the corresponding elements to get the resulting or the corresponding

104
00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.020
element in the resulting vector.

105
00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:27.410
So this is the mechanism that I showed you in the slides.

106
00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:27.870
All right.

107
00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:36.840
And let's see now I'm going to print v 3 a v 3 b and v 3 C.

108
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:43.710
Now it's no surprise that these are all exactly the same result the formatting looks a little bit different

109
00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.100
but that doesn't matter.

110
00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.270
These are all the same results.

111
00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:51.000
Now in practice this is actually not really very good programming.

112
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.750
You don't want to have to use three lines of code for what you can easily accomplished in one line of

113
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.290
code either this way or this way.

114
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:05.850
However I do think that when you're learning math especially in the beginning of learning math and using

115
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:13.440
code to learn math it's interesting and insightful to see these kind of low level mechanistic details

116
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.450
being implemented at least once.

117
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:23.820
And then of course in practice in the future you would use either this method or this method so I just

118
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:29.350
explain to you how to add two vectors algebraic CLI like this.

119
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:36.300
So this vector plus this vector equals this vector and you just add them up each corresponding element

120
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.620
at a time.

121
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:45.120
What I want to do now right before the exercise is show you how to implement vector addition geometrically

122
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:49.620
so the geometric interpretation of vector addition.

123
00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:53.040
So here is this yellow vector that's the vector 1 2.

124
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.600
And here's the blue vector 2 1.

125
00:09:55.950 --> 00:10:03.600
So to add these two vectors geometrically what you do is you take one vector and you slide it on this

126
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:11.100
plane so you slide it such that the tail of this vector goes up to or starts at the head of the other

127
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:11.670
vector.

128
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.430
So that's going to look something like this.

129
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.320
You can see I'm just taking this blue vector.

130
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.330
Now it's not a fundamentally different vector.

131
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.530
It's just in a different location.

132
00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:26.730
It's still going to units over and then one unit up.

133
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:32.880
So it's still the vector to one but I displaced it I've moved it so that the tail of the blue vector

134
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.570
starts at the head of the yellow vector.

135
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.820
And then you can see that we can draw a line or a vector that goes from the tail of the yellow vector

136
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.880
to the head of the blue vector.

137
00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:50.400
And that line is these summed vector and you can see that also here from reading off the graph.

138
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.540
So that's three units over and three units up.

139
00:10:54.540 --> 00:11:00.060
So this is the geometric interpretation of vector addition.

140
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:06.870
And that leads to the exercise which is to confirm that the geometric and algebraic interpretations

141
00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.330
of vector addition converge.

142
00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:14.910
So what you want to do is start with these two vectors so vector v 1.

143
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:24.120
I call this v 1 here is minus 1 2 vector 1 is 1 1 and then you add them up and of course you're going

144
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:29.970
to get 0 3 algebraic leaches just from adding each corresponding element and then you want to generate

145
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.530
a figure that looks like this.

146
00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:41.370
So make sure that v 2 starts at the head of v 1 and then you should be able to confirm that this vector

147
00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:48.850
here these some vector does indeed go from the tail of the first vector to the head of the second vector.

148
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:49.250
All right.

149
00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:55.800
And then of course you should be doing this using variables and num pi arrays not just manually entering

150
00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.370
in all of these individual coordinates.

151
00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:58.730
All right.

152
00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:05.240
So now's your chance to pause the video confirm that the geometric and algebraic perspectives converge.

153
00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:12.770
And now I'm going to walk you through my solution so we already have our two vectors created here.

154
00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:14.710
So V1 and V2.

155
00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.890
So that saves us a little bit of time.

156
00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:20.740
So I'm gonna start by making some plots so plot.

157
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:26.200
Let's see zero v 1 and actually you know what I think I'll do.

158
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:33.360
I'm gonna start by plotting all three of these vectors in the standard space.

159
00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:34.540
So let's see.

160
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:44.000
Let's make this uh a nice thick line and set the label to be in later coded.

161
00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:45.630
V 1.

162
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:51.740
And I'm just using later coding here just so this one here becomes a subscript of V.

163
00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:56.180
Okay so that's for v 1 and then copy paste paste.

164
00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:59.990
So now we have the 2 and v 3 A.

165
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:07.970
Of course v 3 A is equal to V 3 B is equal to V 3C but uh I'll just use v 3 8 here.

166
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.680
Okay so that's 2 and then 3 and let's see what this looks like.

167
00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:18.100
Okay so here we get our 3 vectors.

168
00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:24.800
Now they're all in standard space so this is not what the exercise requested of us but I just want to

169
00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:30.760
make sure that I can get all three of these vectors in the same plot and make the plot look nice.

170
00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:31.800
Let's see.

171
00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:40.700
P L T the axis square and then set the axis to be about minus two to plus two.

172
00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:49.220
And then so minus two to plus two on the x axis is good minus two two plus two on the y axis isn't going

173
00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:49.820
to be good.

174
00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:51.820
It's gonna cut off this green vector.

175
00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:55.860
So how about minus two to plus four.

176
00:13:56.090 --> 00:14:01.620
And of course we need the legend and the grid.

177
00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.090
All right.

178
00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:05.830
Looking good.

179
00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:13.880
So now what I want to do is shift V2 so that the tail starts at the head of V1.

180
00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:20.460
And now the way to think about that is implicitly when plotting V2 you can also write plus zero here.

181
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:29.150
So now by writing plus zero here what I'm actually doing is shifting the x coordinates by zero and shifting

182
00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:30.860
the y coordinates by zero.

183
00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:38.330
Now obviously for shifting by zero that does nothing but it's a very very small step from this concept

184
00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:45.710
of shifting the entire vector by zero to shifting the entire vector by v 1.

185
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:54.500
So now I've shifted the x axis coordinates by the x axis coordinate a V1 and I'm shifting the y axis

186
00:14:54.500 --> 00:15:02.230
coordinates of V2 according to the y axis coordinate of the one like this.

187
00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:02.940
All right.

188
00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.580
And it's as simple as that.

189
00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:09.020
That's how you would move this other vector around.

190
00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:09.290
Okay.

191
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:13.080
And then the last thing I want to do is print this out in latex.

192
00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:14.120
So let's see.

193
00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:18.910
Display math and I'm going to set this to B.

194
00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:23.500
Percent x plus percent x equals percent.

195
00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:27.450
S so that's going to say v 1 plus V 2 equals V 3.

196
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:34.870
Of course with not with these letters V and the underscore number but instead with the actual results.

197
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:37.380
So now of course to do this.

198
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:45.380
So we need to set this to be converted into simple objects and then converted into latex code.

199
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:51.260
And just to make the code a little bit nicer I'm going to say SDR 1 actually.

200
00:15:51.310 --> 00:16:01.820
I'll maybe I'll even say just S1 equals sim that later OK and then Sim does simplify and then V1 so

201
00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:09.570
I think this is a little bit nicer because now here I can just write S1 and then S2 and S3.

202
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:12.420
So that makes this code a little bit more compact.

203
00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:19.610
It's a little bit easier to read compared to if I had to put this you know all of this code in here

204
00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:20.950
three times.

205
00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:26.800
So let's see that's two and that was three a whoops.

206
00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:28.570
Copy paste mistake.

207
00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:34.830
How many times in this course have I warned you to be super careful when copying and pasting code.

208
00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:39.810
This is one of those things where you know I do as I say not as I do anyway.

209
00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:47.000
So this is looking good and I would call this a successful completion of this exercise.

210
00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:53.560
So that concludes this video in which you learned about adding vectors and multiplying vectors by scalar

211
00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:57.190
is both algebraic CLI and geometrically.

212
00:16:57.190 --> 00:17:04.000
The next video is going to feature the dot product which is perhaps the single most important operation

213
00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:06.190
in all of linear algebra.

214
00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:08.590
So put on your thinking cap.

215
00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:13.480
Drink some tea or some coffee or some juice and I will see you in the next video.
