00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:08,030
This video contains the bug hunt for the section probability.

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,100
So if you haven't already.

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:16,520
Then now is your chance to open up this file here the bug hunt file and go through all of this code

4
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:21,080
and see if you can find and fix all of the errors.

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:28,880
All right so I'm going to start by running this salt import num pie and map plot lib and let's see what

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,450
we're doing here.

7
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:33,080
This says show the the plus probability distribution.

8
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:37,180
So the LA plus probability function is an interesting function.

9
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:44,180
You can see it's it looks a bit like e to the minus X and this is a function that we've looked at in

10
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,870
earlier sections of the course.

11
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:53,480
Probably Algebra 1 or algebra 2 anyway except that it's not exactly e to the minus X. It's E to the

12
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,990
minus of the absolute value of X..

13
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:01,080
So here's what that function looks like it's a pretty interesting looking function.

14
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:08,510
So I don't see any coding errors and the plot kind of seems okay except this says probability distribution.

15
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:12,230
The y axis label is probability.

16
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:19,210
So that means if this is really a probability distribution then all of the values should sum to 1.

17
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,840
However we can see that in fact the largest value is 1.

18
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:31,290
So there is no way that this entire function sums to 1 and we can even print that out so print.

19
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:37,880
I want to write some of data and that's definitely larger than 1.

20
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,540
So let's see what we need to do is normalize the data.

21
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:48,770
So I'm gonna say data equals data divided by some of data.

22
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:52,340
So now these sum over all the data points is 1.

23
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:56,930
And that means that this in fact is a probability distribution.

24
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:00,220
All right let's have a look at the next cell.

25
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:04,670
So this says a shifted and stretched normal distribution.

26
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:08,330
So let's see we are creating a normal distribution.

27
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,880
Normal random points and then doing some plotting.

28
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,110
So let's see what is going wrong here.

29
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,510
Mm hmm.

30
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,650
Okay so we get some data points it certainly is normally distributed.

31
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,600
Let's see what this red line is supposed to be.

32
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,830
So this red line is supposed to be the shift parameter.

33
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:31,160
And remember the shift parameter corresponds to the offset which should be the mean of the distribution.

34
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,400
Now this is definitely not the mean of either or of this distribution.

35
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,600
So what is the problem here.

36
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,820
Well the problem here is actually pretty straightforward.

37
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,160
We just have the two parameters swapped.

38
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:51,630
So we are supposed to multiply by the stretch parameter and then add the shift parameter.

39
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,000
Okay.

40
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,910
So there you go.

41
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,630
That looks a lot better.

42
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,610
Let's see what we have next.

43
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:01,570
Here we are generating data from various distributions and then some.

44
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:05,220
This sounds an awful lot like the central limit theorem.

45
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:10,130
So let's see we are creating two signals and this is a cosine.

46
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:15,350
This is uniformly distributed random numbers that get squared.

47
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:21,200
And then here it looks like we are means centering this distribution and then creating a signal from

48
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:21,640
the to the.

49
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:21,930
Okay.

50
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,760
Let's just run this code and see what happens.

51
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:25,250
Okay.

52
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,050
Again no explicit Python errors.

53
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,760
Here we see the.

54
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,330
Okay so I already see the first error here.

55
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:36,600
This is sine wave but it's actually a cosine.

56
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:42,420
Now the relationship between sine and cosine is merely a phase difference.

57
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:49,770
But still it's more accurate to write this as a cosine wave rather than a sine wave anyway.

58
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,500
So here's the cosine and its distribution that seems correct.

59
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,570
The squared uniform numbers and their distribution.

60
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,340
That also seems correct.

61
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:04,120
We can think about these numbers being from 0 to 1 and when we square them.

62
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,450
Remember that number is greater than 1 get large when they're squared.

63
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:12,180
But numbers between 0 and 1 actually get smaller after they're squared.

64
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:16,790
So it does make sense that the distribution would shift towards smaller numbers.

65
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,160
So and then we have the combined signal.

66
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:25,130
And based on the central limit theorem we would actually expect this distribution and the distribution

67
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:32,660
of this combined signal to be closer to a gaussian to approach or tend towards a normal distribution

68
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,210
relative to either the distributions individually.

69
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,310
So let's see what's going on here.

70
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:44,210
So what's going on here is happening in this line and what I'm actually doing or what this code is doing

71
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:50,960
is summing these distributions which is not the way that we are supposed to approach the central limit

72
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,770
theorem.

73
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:57,470
Instead we have to compute the histogram of these sum signals not the sum histogram.

74
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,790
So let's see let's do that here.

75
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,340
I'm going to add another line.

76
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,530
So this is going to say histogram data.

77
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,070
I think that's what HD stands for histogram data.

78
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:19,520
3 and I'll make this sig 1 plus Sig 2 and then here this is going to be HD 3.

79
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:20,180
Okay.

80
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,040
And let's have a look at this.

81
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,600
All right.

82
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:29,540
So this is also not really a full Gaussian distribution but you can see that relative to these distributions

83
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,540
it certainly looks more normal.

84
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,470
It's tending towards a normal distribution.

85
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:35,800
Okay.

86
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,910
Let's have a look at this one which is the last one.

87
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,150
So this is called a dumbbell curves.

88
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,020
That's pretty interesting.

89
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,470
I'm curious to see what this dumbbell curve looks like.

90
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:46,340
Okay.

91
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:54,970
And here we get some errors and the error says X and Y must have the same first dimension but have shapes

92
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,760
1000 and 2000.

93
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,610
Let's go back and have a look at this thing.

94
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:09,280
So it looks like we create X to go from minus one to plus two in 1000 steps and then why is appending.

95
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,780
So we are concatenate.

96
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,990
Two things we're contaminating this function.

97
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:19,130
So this is X squared times the square root of 1 minus X squared.

98
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,750
And then we have minus X.

99
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,050
Okay.

100
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:29,860
So it actually it turns out that this function is the same as this but that does mean that X is not

101
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,290
the same length as y.

102
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,200
So why is in fact twice the length of x.

103
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:40,490
So because why is the concatenation of two functions of x.

104
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:45,920
I'm going to create another variable I'll call that x x and that's going to be num pi.

105
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:53,780
Append X comma X and then here I plot x x by y OK.

106
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,110
Mm hmm.

107
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,600
That's a pretty neat looking function.

108
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,490
You can see why they call it a dumbbell function.

109
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,660
Let's see what is this warning about invalid value encountered in square root.

110
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:09,620
So now we have to think back to our math skills and try and figure out what's going on here.

111
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:15,650
So we have here the square root of 1 minus X squared.

112
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:20,120
Now the square root is not going to return a real valued result.

113
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:30,270
If what's inside the square root is negative but when X is larger than 1 or less than minus 1 then this

114
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:34,280
term here is going to be larger than this term than the number one.

115
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:39,030
So therefore everything inside the square root is going to be negative.

116
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,670
So I don't think this is actually the appropriate range.

117
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:49,210
I think an appropriate range for this dumbbell curve for this function is minus one to plus one.

118
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:49,540
Okay.

119
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,460
So that is looking better we don't get a warning here.

120
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,540
But now we do get an error it says S.A. not defined.

121
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:03,160
So S.A. you remember from the previous few videos this is the Seabourn module.

122
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,300
So that one is pretty easy to fix.

123
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:12,330
I think I'll actually go all the way back to the top and import that here.

124
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,040
So let's see.

125
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:24,120
Import sea borne as S.A. so run this code again and let's try to run this code and see so it looks like

126
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,950
we are creating.

127
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:25,840
Okay.

128
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,980
Brain I don't know if that's a valid type of plot.

129
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:36,060
Let's see how that kind must be either scatter regression residual Katie or hex.

130
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:38,030
So we don't get a plot here.

131
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:44,640
I think this is supposed to be a joke not scatter brain but scatter.

132
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,520
So here we get the original function drawn out in map plot lib.

133
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:56,880
And then here we see what's supposed to be a two dimensional histogram of the same function.

134
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,620
But somehow this doesn't look quite right.

135
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,970
Let's see what's going on here.

136
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,140
Aha.

137
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,800
So here this is plotting Y by Y.

138
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:09,000
So in fact it's really just the you know the unity line here.

139
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,900
This is not correct.

140
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:14,100
We have to plot X X by Y.

141
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,200
Let's see how this looks.

142
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:16,990
All right.

143
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,270
Now this is looking better.

144
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:26,790
So here you see the joint distribution of the dumbbell function over values of x and over values of

145
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:27,600
Y.

146
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:35,160
And it's also pretty interesting to see the marginal distributions that on the x axis the data are perfectly

147
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,780
uniformly distributed.

148
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:43,980
Now that's really not so surprising because this is X X just goes linearly spaced steps from minus one

149
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,090
to plus one.

150
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:51,540
And on the y axis you see that there's this kind of multi peak tri Facebook distribution where we have

151
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:58,230
a large clustering of values at the top end and at the bottom end and towards the center.

152
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:04,140
And with that that concludes this bug hunt for the section on probability theory.

153
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,470
I hope you found this interesting and enjoyable to work there.
