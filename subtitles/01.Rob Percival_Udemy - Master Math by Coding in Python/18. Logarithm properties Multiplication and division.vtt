00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.750
Do you believe in magic.

2
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:12.030
Well the logarithm allows you to do something in mathematics that seems like magic.

3
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:20.570
In particular the logarithm allows you to convert multiplication into addition and division into subtraction.

4
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.590
That is pretty magical.

5
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.420
So that's going to be the main math topic of this video.

6
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.960
And along the way in python you are also going to learn more about late tech formatting in particular

7
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.550
making parentheses look really nice.

8
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.840
So let's begin.

9
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.080
This is called the multiplication property of the logarithm.

10
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:48.560
And essentially what it means is that if you have a multiplication embedded inside the logarithm.

11
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:56.840
So here this is the logarithm of the quantity A times B that can be expanded to or maybe simplified

12
00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.930
as the log of a plus the log of B.

13
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:08.080
So that is pretty remarkable because we have converted from a multiplication into addition.

14
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:15.620
This property becomes really useful really powerful in calculus and in particular in differential equations

15
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:23.060
because you will often find in differential equations that solving an equation with multiplication is

16
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.100
really difficult maybe even impossible or at least really time consuming.

17
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:34.760
But if you can take the log of the equation you can break up the multiplication into addition and very

18
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:41.300
often in differential equations and solving differential equations working with separate in terms that

19
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.750
are added together is much easier than in terms that are multiplying.

20
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.520
So this is for multiplication and addition and the flip side of multiplication is division.

21
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.350
So let's see what that looks like.

22
00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:02.990
So here we see that the log of a divided by B is the same thing as the logarithm of a minus the logarithm

23
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.650
of B.

24
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.880
So that's also pretty cool.

25
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:13.370
You can also by the way see a failure scenario if B is equal to zero then this term doesn't exist but

26
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:20.720
you know the logarithm of zero is also not defined the logarithm of zero is minus infinity.

27
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:27.620
So that condition is kind of built into the log anyway so that's about the math and I'm gonna highlight

28
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.290
this to you in a moment in Python but I also want to illustrate the formatting so here you see these

29
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:41.180
parentheses are kind of like smaller and thinner and these parentheses are much taller and media and

30
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.840
in particular what happened here is when I wrote the latex code to write out this formula here then

31
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:55.430
I made I use a special latex code to automatically stretch these parentheses to be however tall they

32
00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:02.390
need to be in order to capture the entirety of what's inside the parent medical statement and here so

33
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.450
that's this vertically aligned fraction a.

34
00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:13.490
OVERBY So latex automatically expanded or correctly sized these parentheses so I'm going to show you

35
00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.580
in a few moments how to do this in latex.

36
00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:23.690
So I'm going to be using num pi and the display and math functions.

37
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:24.390
So let's see.

38
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.430
I'm gonna get started by specifying two variables.

39
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.390
Let's say a equals three B equals four.

40
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:38.020
And now I'm going to compute a couple of different results so result one is going to be num piled out

41
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:50.020
log a times b result two is going to be num Pi of a Times num Pi the log of B.

42
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.520
So here I'm actually multiplying the two terms I'm taking the logarithm of each term separately and

43
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.720
multiplying them together.

44
00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:03.920
Now if you hadn't seen the previous few minutes of the video then you probably would think that this

45
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.620
term and this term are equal that to me that seems intuitive that these two expressions should be equal

46
00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:10.590
to each other.

47
00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:17.840
However we are going to see that it's actually that result one is actually equal to num paid out log

48
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.610
of a plus the log of B.

49
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:27.230
So to highlight these to illustrate that the the first term in the third term are equal to each other.

50
00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.240
I'm going to use latex coatings.

51
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.570
That's right.

52
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.750
Display math.

53
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.320
And then I'm just kind of write this all out.

54
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:41.050
So this is going to be log of percent G times.

55
00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.630
Percent G and of course I'm gonna replace these with a and b equals and then whatever this happens to

56
00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.330
equal.

57
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.980
So let's see.

58
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.250
We need three substitutions here.

59
00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:59.120
So a and b and result 1 Let's already see what this looks like.

60
00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.390
Okay.

61
00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:06.200
So this tells us that the log of three times four which is just a log of twelve happens to be a little

62
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.970
under two and a half.

63
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:08.260
Okay.

64
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:15.830
And so what I'm gonna do now is copy and paste this code and essentially I want this to be rewritten

65
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.170
for result too.

66
00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.340
So what do I have to change for result to.

67
00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:27.160
So this has to be just the log of a Times the log of B.

68
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.310
I think that's correct.

69
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:29.160
Let's see.

70
00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.380
Yeah.

71
00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.820
Log of three times the log of 4 equals one point five.

72
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.150
Which is definitely not the same thing as two point forty eight.

73
00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:38.170
Okay.

74
00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.540
And then copy and paste this.

75
00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.510
This is going to be adapted to be result 3.

76
00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:49.970
And now here instead of saying times we are going to say plus.

77
00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.480
All right.

78
00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.930
Pretty neat.

79
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.330
So here we see this is confirmation.

80
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:59.600
This is an example that illustrates the concept that I showed you in the slides that the logarithm of

81
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.980
three times four equals the log of three plus the log of four.

82
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.720
All right.

83
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.710
And what I'd like to do now is just write that out a little bit more clearly.

84
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:15.480
So I want to say this expression equals this expression.

85
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:16.940
So let's do that.

86
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:25.940
So copy and paste announce what I want to do is say the log of three times four equals and then essentially

87
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:35.030
what I have done here the log of three plus the log of four so there is all that code and then we need

88
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:39.770
to replace this is a b and this is gonna be again a and then B.

89
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.630
So that has to replace here.

90
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.370
So a comma B run that make sure that that looks good which it does.

91
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:57.490
And then I want to write explicitly that this does not equal the log of three times the log of four.

92
00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.900
So now there's this equals sign here.

93
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.340
How can we say not equals.

94
00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:05.990
Well in code in many languages that not equals sign looks something like this.

95
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.370
You would write.

96
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:13.280
Exclamation point equals or sometimes in some languages it's Tilde equals.

97
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:20.240
But actually what I want is a full on not equals sign which has like that kind of almost vertical slanted

98
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.090
line going through the equals sign.

99
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:29.270
So to do that in latex it is slash slash n e q for not equal.

100
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:35.480
I don't remember if I've already introduced this code to you but here you see log of three times four

101
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:40.780
is not equal to the log of three times the log of four.

102
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:47.270
Now what I want to do is essentially repeat all of this but for division and subtraction.

103
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.750
So let's see.

104
00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:57.000
I'm going to copy all of this code insert a new cell below paste everything in and then let's see what

105
00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:57.630
we need to change.

106
00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.570
So this has to be a divided by B.

107
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:07.630
This has to be longer a divided by log of B and this has to be log of a minus the log of B.

108
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.970
And now we get into some of this fraction business.

109
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.710
So let's see.

110
00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.620
Let's start with frac.

111
00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:17.500
And this has to be the fraction here.

112
00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:23.870
And okay so I'm just gonna run this code to make sure I haven't made any mistakes yet.

113
00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:28.370
So now you see that this parenthesis is small these parentheses are a little bit small.

114
00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:34.680
It looks kind of awkward right because the three divided by four is much larger it's much taller than

115
00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.690
the parentheses.

116
00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:37.950
So I'm going to leave this here.

117
00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.690
I'm going to fix it later on.

118
00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:43.740
Just so you have this printed here for comparison.

119
00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:44.340
Let's see.

120
00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:50.370
And so the next one is going to be I think I'm actually just going to leave this as a slash instead

121
00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.530
of as a vertical line.

122
00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:57.780
So it looks a little funny here with all these slashes going in different directions but essentially

123
00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:04.800
this is like the division with our indicating a fraction or division without explicitly putting the

124
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.460
numerator on top and the denominator directly underneath.

125
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:08.700
Okay.

126
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.730
And then here this changes to a minus sign.

127
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:13.040
All right.

128
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:15.720
So so far these top three lines look good.

129
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:22.620
And then you can also see that the log of three divided by four is not the same thing as log of three

130
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.460
divided by the log of four.

131
00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:31.850
Instead this term is the same thing as the log of the numerator minus the log of the denominator.

132
00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:32.190
Okay.

133
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:34.870
And now I need to fix this code down here.

134
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:40.480
So let's see so I want this to say the log of three divided by four.

135
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:43.020
So this partly looks the same.

136
00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:49.440
We still have the fractions so it's still going to be Frac of the numerator and then in another set

137
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:52.470
of curly brackets the denominator.

138
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:54.990
And then this would be minus.

139
00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:57.630
However of course that doesn't look right.

140
00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:06.810
So what we need to do is replace this parentheses with Slash slash left and then a parentheses.

141
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.690
So here's what that code looks like on its own.

142
00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:16.560
So slash slash left and then parentheses and then the corresponding term on the right is you guessed

143
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.230
it slash slash right.

144
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.000
And then a parenthesis here.

145
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.700
So let's see what happens when I run this all right.

146
00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:26.950
So you can see that this looks really nice.

147
00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:28.930
I think this looks much nicer.

148
00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:32.680
This formatting is much prettier than this formatting here.

149
00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.320
These parentheses are kind of awkwardly small.

150
00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:35.530
All right.

151
00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:41.410
And then one more thing I want to point out is that sometimes if you are doing this making these adaptable

152
00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:48.100
sized parentheses or brackets or whatever you're using embedded in another function that already needs

153
00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:53.590
the parentheses then you can use another set of curly brackets here.

154
00:10:53.620 --> 00:11:01.600
So now this outermost set of curly brackets is indicating to Python that we want all of this everything

155
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.800
inside here to be associated with the log term.

156
00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:10.600
Now in this particular case that didn't actually matter we still get a nice result.

157
00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.020
All right.

158
00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:12.100
And now let's see.

159
00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:21.610
So I just need to complete this line of code so it matches to the last line needs to say that this is

160
00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:29.830
so the log of three divided by four is not equal to the logarithm of three divided by the logarithm

161
00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:30.300
of four.

162
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:38.470
And I think actually just for fun I will put this part in a actual fraction of vertically oriented fraction.

163
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:40.660
Let's see how this looks now.

164
00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.420
All right.

165
00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:44.620
Very nice.

166
00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:48.250
So here you see the division property of logarithm.

167
00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:55.790
And here you see the multiplication property of the logarithm and now it turns out that there is also

168
00:11:55.850 --> 00:12:01.340
an exponential property of the logarithm and that is the goal of this exercise.

169
00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:09.290
So the goal here is to take a few examples and illustrate this concept as property of the log that a

170
00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:17.160
2 or I should say logarithm of a to the power of B equals B times the logarithm of A.

171
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:24.530
So this is also really useful property because you know sometimes you're trying to integrate a expression

172
00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:30.560
or compute the derivative of an expression and the term in the explanation can be really hairy or really

173
00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:31.200
weird.

174
00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:37.000
So if you take the log of everything then this exponent just turns into a multiplication.

175
00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:44.510
So whatever is in the exponent when you take the log of that whole term the base term stays inside the

176
00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:51.550
logarithm and the exponent term comes outside and it just multiplies the result of the log.

177
00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:58.580
So positive videos switched to Python and essentially do some coding to show using a few different numerical

178
00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:03.310
examples that the left hand side really is equal to this right hand side.

179
00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.070
All right let's start here with a new cell.

180
00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:13.560
So insert cell below so I'm gonna stick with the terms a and b.

181
00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:16.600
Just because I already have them there and let's see.

182
00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:22.280
So I'm going to write expression 1 equals num Pi of log.

183
00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:31.900
And now I want a not a times b but a to the power of B and then expression two is going to be b times

184
00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:34.770
num pi log of a.

185
00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:41.440
So you can see I left the base term inside the logarithm and I took the exponent and brought it out

186
00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:45.290
to be multiplicative in front of the logarithm.

187
00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:45.800
Okay.

188
00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.200
And now I'm just going to write.

189
00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.740
Print expression 1 minus.

190
00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:51.150
Expression 2.

191
00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:59.000
And this is equal to zero which is expected result because this term is the same thing as this term.

192
00:13:59.080 --> 00:13:59.370
All right.

193
00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:03.390
And then I want to do one more thing and that is maybe I'll do it up here.

194
00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:09.970
I'm gonna add another expression so I'm gonna say expression 3 and what I'm going to do here is multiply

195
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:16.460
the logarithm or add the logarithm b times so let's see what was B again B was 4.

196
00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:17.060
Okay.

197
00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:27.340
So if four times the log of three is really equal to a to the power of B where B is four then that means

198
00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:35.720
that I should also be able to say num pi log a plus log a plus log a plus log.

199
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.200
So that's really all this is doing.

200
00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:43.890
Main difference is here I'm adding them here are multiplying them and here this is hardcoded to before

201
00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:51.070
so obviously if you would go back earlier and change the value of be to be you know five or seven point

202
00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:54.010
three then this is no longer valid.

203
00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:59.730
So this expression written out like this is valid as long as B is equal to 4.

204
00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:00.550
So let's see.

205
00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:07.870
Now I'm gonna print out these three expressions expert 3 and you can see that they are all identical

206
00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:13.830
to each other certainly up to 15 degrees of precision or however many nos.

207
00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:20.380
This is so this was yet another productive and fun video.

208
00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:21.800
I hope you agree.

209
00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:28.630
You learned about some really special properties of logarithm in particular that the logarithm can magically

210
00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:37.240
transform multiplication into addition division into subtraction and exponents into multiplication.

211
00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:43.060
As I mentioned in the middle of the video that actually becomes pretty relevant for advanced calculus

212
00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:45.090
topics and differential equations.

213
00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:51.580
And on top of the math you also learned a little bit more about latex formatting in particular with

214
00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:54.580
regard to parentheses in the next video.

215
00:15:54.580 --> 00:16:00.760
You're going to learn about scientific notation and you're actually gonna get to see an example application

216
00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:06.190
of using the logarithm for computing the order of magnitude of a number.

217
00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.630
So stay tuned.
