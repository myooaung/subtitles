00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:11.850
This video contains an exercise associated with the previous video on histogram and probabilities.

2
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:19.230
So what you want to do in this exercise is generate these three functions so Y equals X Y equals X squared

3
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.430
and Y equals X cubed.

4
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.970
And then what you want to do is make a graph and draw the probability densities for each of these functions.

5
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:34.470
So you're going to end up with a figure in Python that has two rows and three columns where the top

6
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:42.090
row is the function itself and the bottom row is the probability density of these functions.

7
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.660
Now I will let you pick the x axis range but I recommend using something that's fairly narrow.

8
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.770
Close to zero.

9
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.100
So for example you could set X to go from minus three to plus three.

10
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.190
All right.

11
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.660
So pause the video.

12
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:05.390
Do some coding and when you're ready you can come back and watch me talk you through my solution so

13
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.570
I am going to start by I think I'll even just get rid of all this stuff.

14
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.230
Okay so let's see.

15
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:20.120
I'm going to start by setting the x axis range so let's say x equals num pi Lynn space.

16
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.880
I will go from minus three to plus three.

17
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.900
And how about let's try one hundred and twenty three steps.

18
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.710
So now I'm going to start by setting up the figure.

19
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:40.460
So I'm going to write fig comma X equals L to the sub plots and we want a two by three geometry of subplots.

20
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:49.250
So I'm going to do this in a loop so I'm going to write for I in range 3 and then the idea is that this

21
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:58.490
AI is going to correspond to not only the Axis index but also the exponent for the function.

22
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:10.390
So I'm going to create the function and it's his sto Graham said see Y equals X to the power of.

23
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.340
And now here you have to be a bit careful because it's not actually I.

24
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.340
It's actually I plus 1.

25
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.370
And the reason for that is that when you loop through this for loop I is going to start off at zero

26
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.500
and then it's gonna go 1 and 2.

27
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.720
And so actually to show you that let's just write this just print out here.

28
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.130
So this is going to be the exponents.

29
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:38.570
However we don't want the function to be X to the 0 x or the 1 and x the 2 it has to be X to the power

30
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.350
of 1 which is just X and then X squared and then X cubed.

31
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.600
So therefore this has to be I plus 1 here in the exponent.

32
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.050
Okay.

33
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.480
And now I'm going to create the histogram.

34
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.680
OK.

35
00:02:50.690 --> 00:03:00.650
I'll just call that variable H num paid up his sto gram of variable Y and then I want to normalize.

36
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.790
So I'll call this Y P as I did in the previous video.

37
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:14.500
Equals h 0 divided by the sum of all of h zero.

38
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.530
So let's just make sure we understand what's going on here.

39
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.530
So here we generate the function Y equals X to the power of you know whatever the looping index is.

40
00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.700
Then we get a histogram and the histogram function is going to give to output.

41
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.080
So that's going to be in this tuple and this variable H.

42
00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:40.190
So then we want to create a probability density and I'm going to do that by normalizing the Y the counts

43
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.690
from this histogram function.

44
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.770
And that is in the first element of this tuple h.

45
00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.720
Okay.

46
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:47.780
So then.

47
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.780
So that's all the computations we need to do.

48
00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.690
Now we need to do some plotting.

49
00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.220
So I'll start by plotting the function itself.

50
00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:02.720
So this is going to be zero corresponding to the first row and then I corresponding to the I S column

51
00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:16.250
dot plot and then we want X comma Y and then I will set a title so x 0 comma I and then set title and

52
00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.460
that title is going to be Y equals X to the power of.

53
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:27.230
And so to get the superscript here for the power I want to do all this stuff in latex so I'm going to

54
00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:35.690
convert that to latex use the carat symbol to get me a superscript and then this is going to be % G

55
00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.710
which we then replace with I.

56
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.180
Not I but I plus 1.

57
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.480
Okay.

58
00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:47.900
And then before worrying about the histogram on the bottom row I want to just make sure this is going

59
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.190
to look correct.

60
00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.760
All right.

61
00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.330
So this is what we expect for Y equals X.

62
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:59.180
It's just a straight line of course so all the y values equal all the x values and we want Y equals

63
00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.790
X squared which looks like this and Y equals X cubed which again looks like this.

64
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:05.980
All right.

65
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.470
So far so good except this figure looks a little bit crowded.

66
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.280
So what I'm gonna do is set the size of this.

67
00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.860
I will use fig dots set size inches.

68
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.580
It's a little bit.

69
00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.990
You know America centric here that we have to specify in inches and not in centimeters.

70
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.640
But what can you do.

71
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.660
And let's say 10 inches wide by six inches high.

72
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:38.060
So this is starting to look much better now let's go back and finish this exercise by plotting the distribution

73
00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.110
of values or the probability density.

74
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.510
So there we want X 1 comma I.

75
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:52.350
So that's going to correspond to the second row and the eighth column and then it's going to be plot.

76
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.780
Let's see.

77
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:53.640
So that will be.

78
00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.990
Now the second part of the tuple of H.

79
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.880
And remember that here we don't want to just plot y p like this.

80
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:10.590
Instead we need to not only the first values up to the final point and the reason for this is because

81
00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:16.680
of what I discussed in the previous video on how to interpret the output of the histogram function.

82
00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:21.920
And I'm also going to talk more about this business in the next video.

83
00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:22.240
All right.

84
00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.210
Let's see how this looks.

85
00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.190
So these plots look OK.

86
00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:33.570
They look fairly smooth these histogram here probability densities don't really they look kind of choppy.

87
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:37.560
What I would like to do is break this up into more bins.

88
00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.270
So I would like to have more bins.

89
00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:46.320
So in the previous video I showed you how to use the second input in histogram to specify all the bin

90
00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.400
boundaries.

91
00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:52.500
But if you don't want to specify the exact boundaries of the bends instead you just want to specify

92
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.280
the number of bins.

93
00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:59.830
Then you can simply enter that as a second input into the histogram function.

94
00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:07.170
So I write come a 50 and l python is going to give me 50 bins in total.

95
00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:12.930
So notice how blocky this is here and then with 50 bins for the histogram.

96
00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:17.970
This gets quite a bit smoother but you know I think there's still I think we don't have a high enough

97
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.080
resolution.

98
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.390
Now this looks really choppy.

99
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.540
But notice that these are all really really tiny values.

100
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.350
This is actually a very small range.

101
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:29.860
I think what I'll do is increase the resolution here to 1000.

102
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.330
Let's see how that looks.

103
00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.660
This is starting to look really nice.

104
00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:33.970
Okay.

105
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:35.060
This looks better.

106
00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:40.500
So now we have lots and lots and lots of data points and 50 bins for these histogram.

107
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:41.150
Okay.

108
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:46.780
So now that is actually the successful completion of the code for this exercise.

109
00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:51.900
What I want to take a moment for now is to interpret these plots a little bit.

110
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:55.960
So this top row should be already pretty familiar to you.

111
00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:59.070
But the bottom row might seem a little bit weird.

112
00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.250
And that's not so surprising.

113
00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:08.070
It's not always so intuitive or immediately obvious what a probability density function should look

114
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:12.150
like based on what a mathematical function looks like.

115
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:17.790
This is actually similar to the calculus section when we were looking at derivatives of functions and

116
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:24.540
you saw that the derivative of function can often look really sort of a lot different from the actual

117
00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:25.540
function itself.

118
00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.890
So what does this mean that we have a flat line here.

119
00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:36.120
Well this basically means that all of the values between minus three and plus three are equally likely

120
00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.500
to be selected at random.

121
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:44.190
So if you look at this function and you say what is the probability what's the chance that I would pick

122
00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:48.170
this value just randomly picking out any value anywhere.

123
00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:52.680
What's the chance that you would get this value what's the chance you would get this value and all of

124
00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.900
these values are equally likely to be picked.

125
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.870
So that's why the probability distribution is flat.

126
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:07.830
Now let's go to this function here y equals X squared again what is the chance that you will get a value

127
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:13.500
of let's say 4 given that you're just picking a number purely at random.

128
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:19.500
Well the probability of guessing four or you know sort of picking a value of four is actually relatively

129
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.310
small.

130
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:24.490
You're much much more likely to get a value that's really close to zero.

131
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:29.610
And that should also make sense when you think about this function Y equals X squared.

132
00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:37.020
Because there's a lot more data points close to zero and fewer data points on the y axis as you get

133
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:38.400
further away from zero.

134
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:44.850
So this is a little tricky to think about because on the x axis all of these points are equally far

135
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:46.190
away from each other.

136
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:50.520
And that's sort of trivially defined by this variable x.

137
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:57.000
However for this function Y equals X squared on the y axis these points are actually getting further

138
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.780
and further apart from each other.

139
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:06.690
So they are less likely on the y axis as you get further away from zero on the x axis and maybe let's

140
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:11.140
see if we plot this the density might be a little too high for this to look really.

141
00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:11.670
Yeah okay.

142
00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.950
You still see a lot of numbers here.

143
00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:18.980
Let's see what happens if we go to for example 500 maybe.

144
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:19.430
Mm hmm.

145
00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:24.210
Okay let's try again with 100 although now I think the histogram won't look good.

146
00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:24.430
Okay.

147
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.310
So let's try this.

148
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:30.740
I'm going to set this to be 10 points and now we don't look at the histogram.

149
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:36.780
They all look terrible but the point is you can see in these functions that as you're getting further

150
00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:45.760
away from zero on the x axis the data points are getting sparse and sparse there on the y axis.

151
00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:53.700
And that is why when you look at the probability density you're much more likely to guess a point randomly

152
00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:57.760
close to zero than a point further away from zero.

153
00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:03.740
And now we have Y equals X cubed which actually is a really similar function to X squared except that

154
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:09.300
we also have negative values whereas X squared of course has no negative values.

155
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.110
So if you look to the right of zero.

156
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:17.620
This function looks really similar to this probability density here.

157
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:23.280
But the difference is that we also have negative values here.

158
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:29.580
I hope you enjoyed working on this exercise and learning about histogram probability densities and the

159
00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:34.160
relationship to different mathematical functions in the next video.

160
00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:41.010
We are going to continue talking about histogram and probability densities for continuous data like

161
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.370
these kinds of mathematical functions that you were just working on.

162
00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:45.480
I will see you soon.
