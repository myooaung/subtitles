1
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:09,950
After going through the previous two videos I guessed you are now fairly comfortable with plotting individual

2
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:14,870
points on a graph and what could be better than plotting two points on a graph.

3
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:18,470
How about drawing a line that connects those two points.

4
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,890
That is the big goal of this video.

5
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,590
I'm going to show you how to create lines in graphs.

6
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,060
It turns out it's really easy.

7
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:31,910
And once you get the hang of it you'll be able to do it with no problem along the way.

8
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:38,240
You will also learn a little bit more about plotting lines in Python or plotting in general in Python

9
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,200
including how to come up with any arbitrary color that you want.

10
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:49,320
So the way to think about drawing a line in a graph in Python is to consider that.

11
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:53,240
Also in math you need two points to define a line.

12
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,780
So in Python the way you specify a line is by coming up with two points.

13
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:03,700
The start point and the stop point and that's why I call this the line and start stop form.

14
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:11,210
I will show you in the next video How to generate lines using the slope intercept form but for now I'm

15
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:15,370
going to show you how to create a line using two sets of points okay.

16
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:21,410
So the idea is that you start with this point and this point so let's call this point p 1 the coordinate

17
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,930
is minus three minus one.

18
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:29,240
And this we will call point b 2 and there and his coordinate is 4 4.

19
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:36,020
So then to draw this line you have to specify the x coordinate of this start to stop points.

20
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,030
So that would be here.

21
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,000
The x coordinates and then you specify the y coordinates.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,240
All right.

23
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,880
So let's switch to Python and see how this gets implemented.

24
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:51,950
So anytime you are doing plotting or almost anytime you're doing plotting in python you are probably

25
00:01:51,950 --> 00:02:00,470
going to be using the map plot lib that pi plot module so you will pretty much always have to start

26
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:04,070
your code with a line that looks something like this.

27
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:04,280
All right.

28
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:13,490
So what I'm gonna do now is specify these two points so p 1 was minus 3 comma minus 1 and then p 2.

29
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:20,150
This is just the points that I discussed in the slides a moment ago is for comma 4.

30
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:28,280
OK so now you might think that it should be something as simple as this P1 comma P2 and then I type

31
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:36,110
plot show and technically that does draw a line but it doesn't really look like it's the right line.

32
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,760
It doesn't look like what we expect it to look like.

33
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:43,680
So you expect that the line would look something like this like what I showed in the slides.

34
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,650
So what is going wrong here.

35
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:52,190
Well what's going wrong here is that this is actually technically correct code but it's not doing what

36
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,790
you think it should be doing.

37
00:02:53,960 --> 00:03:00,570
What we actually need to specify is the two x coordinates here and the two y coordinates here.

38
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:07,610
So in fact what this code is doing or the way that Python is interpreting this code is that the x coordinates

39
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,770
are minus 3 to minus 1.

40
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:17,870
You see that here minus 3 to minus 1 and python is interpreting the y coordinates to be 4 to 4.

41
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,020
But actually that's not really what we want.

42
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:24,320
The x coordinates from point 1 To point to are minus 3 to 4.

43
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:29,580
So really the right way to do this is to list the x coordinates like this.

44
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:36,760
So the first element of p 1 and then the first element of p 2.

45
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,840
And then we need the y coordinates.

46
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:45,740
So that's going to be exactly the same list of numbers but it's going to be the second element instead

47
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,060
of the first element.

48
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,390
Okay.

49
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:54,580
And now we get the line that you would have expected based on how I wrote out these points.

50
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,980
Okay so let's say you really don't like blue.

51
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:02,900
I don't know blue makes you feel sad or something that you want to change this color so you can pick

52
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:09,240
a few of the built in colors like red or there's also K for black.

53
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,190
But what if you want to specify the color however you want.

54
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,490
So for that you can use color.

55
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:22,040
So you just write the word color and then you provide a list of three numbers and that corresponds to

56
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,630
our G.B. or red green blue value.

57
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:29,590
So for example you can type 1 comma zero comma zero.

58
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,070
This means 100 percent red zero percent green and zero percent blue.

59
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,620
And here's what that line looks like.

60
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:44,800
So then you can do about 100 percent red and 20 percent saturation on green.

61
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:45,290
Well okay.

62
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,890
It's a little bit orange ish.

63
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:47,750
Let's see if we do.

64
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,110
Point seven for blue.

65
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:53,220
This is starting to look slowly a little bit better.

66
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:53,990
Let's see if we do.

67
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,340
Point four all right.

68
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,270
This is looking good.

69
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,880
I like this shade of purple.

70
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,480
However I want to see more of this purple this line is way too thin for me.

71
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:11,500
So therefore I'm going to type line with equals how about 30.

72
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,660
Okay.

73
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,220
That's maybe a little bit excessive.

74
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,960
Let's scale it back a little bit.

75
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,550
How about a line width of 10.

76
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,480
Still a little bit comically thick.

77
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,010
Maybe let's go for a line with the five.

78
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:25,620
Okay.

79
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:29,610
This is starting to look pretty good but I think you see where this is going.

80
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:36,760
Now I want to make this graph a little bit nicer looking according to properties of the axis that I

81
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,660
showed you how to change in the previous video.

82
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:48,190
So let's make this a square axis and then the axis the square shape and then I'm gonna set the Axis

83
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,370
limits to be how about six all around.

84
00:05:51,370 --> 00:06:00,130
So the X axis limit will be minus six to plus X and the y axis limit will be minus six to plus six.

85
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:00,400
All right.

86
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,450
So I'd say this looks pretty good.

87
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:08,110
If you want you can spend some more time sprucing this thing up a bit but I'm going to stop here and

88
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,300
move on to something else.

89
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:16,360
So what I want to show you now is basically just a bit of an extension of what you learned in this video

90
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:19,410
and what you learned in the past couple of videos.

91
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:27,170
So now let's imagine that we have a single point so I'll call this X equals three and Y equals.

92
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,070
I don't know how about five.

93
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:35,810
So you already learned from the previous video how to plot a dot at that coordinates something to say

94
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:45,850
peel to dot plot X comma Y and let's make this a red circle and I'll say BLT dot show by the way.

95
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:52,990
Probably the most common mistake to make when you are generating these plots in Python is to accidentally

96
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:55,860
type plot here instead of BLT.

97
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:02,490
So you have to always be looking out for this kind of an error simple typo.

98
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:07,330
So here we go here's our red dot in an otherwise empty white universe.

99
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:12,770
Now what I'd like to do is draw a line from the zero zero point.

100
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:17,720
So from the origin of the two dimensional space to this dot.

101
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:22,590
So the way that I'm going to do that is by typing P.L. teed up plot.

102
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:27,130
Now we have to think again about drawing lines so what are the x coordinates for this line.

103
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,280
Well it starts at zero.

104
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:38,230
And it goes to X is variable X and then likewise the y coordinates we need to specify to y coordinates

105
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:38,990
to draw a line.

106
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:47,230
And I want that to go from the origin to y well to you know this variable Y so the number five.

107
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,530
And then I'll also make this red.

108
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,260
Okay.

109
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,930
So now we get this line.

110
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,610
It goes from the origin so from 0 0 up to this line.

111
00:07:55,690 --> 00:08:01,690
But I would like to make this a little bit more looking like you know what you might see in a textbook.

112
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:09,670
So I'm going to start off by actually I think I'll even just copy and paste this because I think these

113
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:10,790
are pretty good.

114
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,210
Axis limits and I'm also gonna add a grid.

115
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:13,930
Okay.

116
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:19,450
So this is looking a little bit better but you know when you see a plot that looks like this in a textbook

117
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:26,380
or online or and of course whatever you often see that these 0 lines are thicker than the other grid

118
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,690
lines.

119
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,170
So how can we do that.

120
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:37,010
Well one way to solve this is by drawing more lines on top of this plot and we make those lines black.

121
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,700
So let's see how to do that so I'm going to say peel teed up plot.

122
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,550
So let's start with a horizontal line that goes here.

123
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,420
So the X coordinates will go from minus six to plus six.

124
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:56,320
So X goes from minus six to six and then the Y actually also goes from minus 66.

125
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,370
And so what are the y coordinates going to be here.

126
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,600
If we think about where we want this line to go it's gonna be flat here.

127
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:07,470
So it has to go from minus six to plus six.

128
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:13,210
But it actually never changes on the y axis so it stays at zero on the y axis.

129
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:20,110
So that means that this coordinate is just zero comma zero and then we make this a black line.

130
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:20,680
All right.

131
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:21,940
So that looks pretty good.

132
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,530
That's our horizontal line.

133
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:29,320
And then you can probably imagine how we're going to make the vertical line essentially it's the same

134
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,920
thing.

135
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,670
We just swap the X and the y coordinates here.

136
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:39,090
So now from X or on the x axis we always stay at zero.

137
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:42,910
And on the y axis we go from minus six to plus six.

138
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:43,240
All right.

139
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:52,640
So I think this is starting to look pretty professional there are two exercises for this video and basically

140
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:58,800
that those exercises are to draw this graph and to draw this graph to draw this graph.

141
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:07,460
You have to implement this function so y equals the square root of the absolute value of x and I implement

142
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,330
this for the values of x.

143
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:14,840
So integers have X ranging from minus 20 to plus 20.

144
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,270
If you want to reproduce this exactly then you can use all of these numbers.

145
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:25,190
These values of x but of course you're welcome to play around add more numbers or fewer numbers.

146
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,320
You can change the colors if you want.

147
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,910
The important part is making sure that you get this formula correct and you'll get a graph that looks

148
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,500
something like this.

149
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:38,290
And then the second exercise is basically just to create this box here with these colors.

150
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,400
So it's green and then red and magenta and black.

151
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,030
All right.

152
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:50,300
So now is your last opportunity to pause the video before I switch to Python and start showing you all

153
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:55,400
of my secrets or at least you know my solution to these two problems.

154
00:10:55,460 --> 00:11:01,430
So the first graph that we have to create was that kind of beautiful looking and almost looks like a

155
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,720
little bit of a bird.

156
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:10,700
So I'm going to specify X to be a range from minus twenty to twenty one and then that's gonna give me

157
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,800
integers between minus 20 and plus 20.

158
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:19,070
So then I'm going to do this in a for loop I'm going to implement this in a for loop where each element

159
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,270
of the for loop draws a line from the origin to that point.

160
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:34,760
So let's say for i in X we can write P L T dot plot and now we want the line on the X to go from zero

161
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:45,170
to I and the y component of the line should also start from zero and then the second part is the implementation

162
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:45,950
of that formula.

163
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:52,800
So that was first we take the absolute value of x or each element of x which gets called I here.

164
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,810
Actually maybe I should call this X..

165
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:02,690
It's a little bit more informative and it's really clear that X Y are indices within X or individual

166
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:06,320
elements within this range X OK.

167
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,780
So then this and now we need to take the square root of this.

168
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:14,840
So if you like you could import the number pi module and do this as an P..

169
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,370
That square root.

170
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:22,520
However you can also implement the square root by taking the power of one half.

171
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,260
OK.

172
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,700
So I believe that this is going to work.

173
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:30,970
Let's see you peel BLT the show and then Yep this looks really nice.

174
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:36,340
And now there's all sorts of other interesting things that you could do with this to explore this further.

175
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,190
You could try changing the range this go up to like two hundred or something.

176
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,830
So that's going to change the shape a bit.

177
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:47,540
There's lots of things you can do you can specify the colors but I'm not going to do any of that right

178
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,390
now.

179
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:54,370
Instead I'm going to move on to the second exercise which was to draw a square.

180
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,700
So drawing a square is actually not so difficult.

181
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:03,590
And there are multiple ways to draw squares in Python it turns out that there's a module called Turtle

182
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:07,660
like the little animal that you can use to also draw squares for you.

183
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:13,790
But I'm going to do it here manually and that is by specifying each line individually.

184
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:18,640
So let's say BLT dot plot and now I'm going to draw.

185
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,440
Actually let's let me scroll up here and let's think about it.

186
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,740
So we're gonna use the same principle that I used to draw these lines except we specify them to be smaller

187
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:33,860
so we can make a square that goes let's say from here or actually I'll make it here.

188
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:40,040
So it'll just go from zero up to two over to two down and then back to zero.

189
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:46,610
So that means each line gets drawn by fixing the values on one axis and drawing the values on the other

190
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,340
axis by two.

191
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:56,810
So let's say let's draw the first line from 0 to 2 So X equals 0 2 x equals 2 and then Y equals 2 to

192
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:04,070
2 so why stays on the 2 line and that draws a horizontal line that looks like this.

193
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:09,130
So this is like the top of the square here to draw the bottom of the square.

194
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:15,140
I'm actually just going to copy and paste this code and notice and I'm gonna keep the x values the same

195
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:21,400
I'm going to change the y values to zero zero and I'll make this a black line.

196
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:29,370
So now we have a set of parallel lines here and you can see this is the top and the bottom of the square.

197
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,530
So now how do we draw.

198
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,860
Let's start with the left line here.

199
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:39,390
So the left line is defined by x equals zero 2 x equals zero.

200
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:46,370
Right because the entire line the x axis or the x coordinate stays at zero and the y coordinate is going

201
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:51,770
to go from zero to two groups that should be at period common that period.

202
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:52,900
Okay.

203
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,060
And this one was green if I remember correctly.

204
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:56,550
All right.

205
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:05,180
And then we have one more leg to draw and I will copy and paste and change this to two comma two and

206
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:10,420
this has to be two comma two on the x coordinates because I want the line to go here.

207
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:18,980
So it's gonna go from zero to two on the y axis and just stay at 2 on the x axis and that one will be

208
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,890
magenta or this nice purple color.

209
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,040
So that's for the square.

210
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:27,550
I would like to change a few things about this axis.

211
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,440
Let's say plot the axis square.

212
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,220
And how about plot dot axis.

213
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:40,820
Let's set this to be the x limits will go from minus three to five and the Y limits will also go from

214
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,020
minus three to five.

215
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,310
All right.

216
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:47,080
So that's looking a bit better and now I think I'll also put a title on here.

217
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:53,840
So how about P.L. t that title and let's set this title to a colorful square

218
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,120
nice.

219
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:04,640
So now you've extended your knowledge of graphics in python from coordinates two lines in the next video.

220
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm gonna show you how to create lines using the slope intercept form that you often come across in

221
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,880
your algebra textbooks and math courses.
