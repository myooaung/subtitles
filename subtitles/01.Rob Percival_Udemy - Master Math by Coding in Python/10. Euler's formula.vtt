00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:12.090
In this video I'm going to tell you about Oilers formula which is also sometimes called Oilers identity.

2
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.980
It is a pretty important formula.

3
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.690
It shows up all the time in theoretical and applied mathematics.

4
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.630
So if you are unfamiliar with it then this is going to be a really exciting video.

5
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.510
Oilers formula is a good thing to have at least.

6
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:35.850
Passing familiarity with in no small part because Oilers formula leads directly to what is commonly

7
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.600
referred to as the most elegant equation in all of human civilization.

8
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.190
That is an extremely bold statement and it's not my personal opinion.

9
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.960
This is generally what people think.

10
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.090
If you look around on the Internet you will find much agreement about this.

11
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.910
All right so let's get to it.

12
00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:04.890
Here we have the unit circle and I'm calling these two axes cosine and sine in other contexts.

13
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.140
You might see this referred to as the real axis and the imaginary axis.

14
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.880
So we can plot a unit vector on this unit circle.

15
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:22.020
This is a vector that has unit length or length of one and this dot is somewhere on this circle.

16
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:29.730
So the coordinates of this dot here are cosine K and sine K that I'm just reading directly off of the

17
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.800
axes here where k is this angle here.

18
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:43.740
So Oilers formula states that e to the Ike equals cosine K plus I assign K so cosine K and sine K this

19
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:51.780
are referring to these coordinates on these axes here and then e here is the natural exponent I of course

20
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.830
is the imaginary operator it's also here on the sine part and then K in all these cases is this angle

21
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.000
here.

22
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.920
So this means that e to the Ike is a compact notation for representing this point on this unit circle

23
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.420
or you can also think of it as this vector with Angle K but what if we wanted to represent this line

24
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.740
here.

25
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.710
Can you represent this line or this point here using Oilers formula now.

26
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:29.340
The way I've written this equation here the answer is no it's not possible because this expression exactly

27
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:37.080
how I've written it is limited to points that are on the unit circle however is actually pretty straightforward

28
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:44.400
to modify this equation to be able to represent this point or in general any point on this plane this

29
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:51.060
cosine signed plane or sometimes called the complex plane with a small modification and that is basically

30
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:59.130
to represent this coordinate using M E to the ik where m is the magnitude it's actually just the the

31
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.910
distance away from the origin or the length of this line.

32
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:11.400
Now I am particularly fond of using the letters M for magnitude and K for angle because that is pronounced

33
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.820
Mike and I think Mike is a pretty cool name.

34
00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.430
I hope you agree.

35
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.550
Anyway you can see that for a point on the unit circle and would be set to 1.

36
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.350
So therefore these two equations aren't actually really different from each other.

37
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.060
This is just the special case where the vector is on the unit circle.

38
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.940
So given this formula we can actually already work through a couple of examples.

39
00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.400
A couple of different points.

40
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:45.110
So for example we can take this point here where K the angle equals zero.

41
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.510
So this is just sitting right on the cosine axis or the real axis.

42
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:57.200
So now we can write each of the I's 0 equals one plus zero times I and this one and zero just come from

43
00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.570
literally reading this point right off of this graph.

44
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.690
So we have a coordinate of 1 and 0 on the sine axis.

45
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:11.510
Now this is also not so surprising because you know from computing powers that any number to the power

46
00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.920
of 0 equals 1.

47
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.000
So this is basically just saying that each of the 0 equals 1.

48
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.260
Let's pick another point.

49
00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.440
How about this one up here.

50
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:28.910
So here the angle K is pi over 2 and the cosine coordinate is 0 and the sine coordinate is 1.

51
00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:36.310
So this is telling us that E 2 the AI pi over 2 equals one AI or just AI.

52
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.380
How about this point over here.

53
00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:45.280
Well the cosine axis is minus 1 the sine axis is 0 and the angle here is pi.

54
00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:46.790
This is pi.

55
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:53.790
So now we get e to the AI pi equals minus one plus 0 AIS so we can actually just drop this term.

56
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:59.630
Now all I'm going to do is move the minus one to the left hand side of this equation and this gives

57
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.040
us e to the AI pi plus one equals zero.

58
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:09.500
And this thing right here this really simple equation which is actually just describing this point on

59
00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.190
this complex plane.

60
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.360
This is the most elegant equation in all of human civilization.

61
00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.750
And why is that the case.

62
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:25.130
It's the case because pretty much all the important terms all the base features from which you build

63
00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.400
up mathematics are all contained inside this compact equation.

64
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.470
So we have equality which of course is important in mathematics.

65
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.700
We have the two most important rational numbers which are 0 and 1.

66
00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.440
We have the two most important irrational numbers which are e and pi.

67
00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:49.010
We have the two basic units for the real and imaginary axes and that's one.

68
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.810
And I and we have all the important arithmetic operations in here.

69
00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.590
So we have addition which is the same thing as subtraction.

70
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:03.590
We have multiplication which is basically the same thing as division and we have exponential nation

71
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.650
which is also basically the same as the logarithm.

72
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:14.210
So you could take this equation and basically build up all of human mathematics all the mathematics

73
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:22.070
that humans have discovered from this one simple tiny little rinky dink equation and that is why this

74
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:29.050
is generally considered to be the most elegant equation ever discovered in human history.

75
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:35.930
All right let's do something slightly more mundane which is just to switch to Python and play around

76
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:42.460
with this a little bit I'd like to start by illustrating Oilers formula.

77
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.820
All right.

78
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.520
I should say Oilers identity.

79
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:51.950
So let's say k equals pi over four and m equals two point three.

80
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:57.660
And so what I'm gonna do now is basically create the number using Oilers notate or the left side of

81
00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.550
Oilers notation and the right side of Oilers formula.

82
00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:03.190
So let's see oil.

83
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:14.700
I'll call this variable oil for Euler is m times he to the I k now remember that Python uses 1 j for

84
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.210
the imaginary operator.

85
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:21.380
Whereas in mathematical notation you would typically write one eye or just I.

86
00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:28.370
So this is for Oilers notation and then we have the right side of Oilers formula which is I'll call

87
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:29.450
this C I ask.

88
00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.220
People often use this notation.

89
00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:35.430
This is for cosine imaginary sine.

90
00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:48.060
So this is going to be m times cosine of K plus ie times sine of K and now what I'm going to do is print

91
00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:56.100
out both of these and if I haven't made any coding errors intent then these should be identical to each

92
00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:56.930
other.

93
00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:58.020
So let's have a look.

94
00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:58.760
So we see.

95
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.470
So these are complex numbers right.

96
00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.130
Because there's a imaginary component.

97
00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.520
So we have the real part and the imaginary part.

98
00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:13.860
So the real part seems to be identical for these two but the imaginary part appears to be different.

99
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.540
So what is going on.

100
00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:16.880
What is the mistake.

101
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:24.440
The mistake here is actually that I'm only multiplying M by cosine I'm not multiplying M by sine.

102
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:33.930
So in fact the way you have to write this expression out would be m times I sign now most people don't

103
00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:34.640
do it that way.

104
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:43.480
A much more common way to do this multiplication appropriately loops is to use parentheses like this.

105
00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:50.110
So then you get m times and then everything in here is the cosine plus I assign part.

106
00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:57.660
So now I run this again and we get identical results for Oilers notation on the bottom and the cosine

107
00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.200
plus sine notation on top.

108
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:06.090
Now these student numbers the real part and the imaginary part also happened to be identical to each

109
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:12.390
other but that's because I use an angle of pi over four which is a 45 degree angle so we can change

110
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:19.390
this to like pi over 6 and then you see that the real part and the imaginary parts are different.

111
00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:23.330
Okay so then the next thing I want to do is make a plot.

112
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:32.370
So show a vector from these two expressions so Oilers formula and the CIS notation of the cosine I sign.

113
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:40.920
So to make a polar plot to make a vector from this thing here what I need to do is extract the magnitude

114
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:47.880
and the angle from that complex number and you will remember that I discussed this general approach

115
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:52.030
to plotting complex numbers in the section on algebra 2.

116
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:59.210
So let's say we need a mag that's going to do so I'm going to call this variable mag for magnitude so

117
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:09.810
a b US oil and then the angle is going to be known PI that angle oil and now this is actually a little

118
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:18.930
bit circular because this magnitude here is exactly the same as M and this angle here is what I referred

119
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:20.790
to as k up here.

120
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:26.820
So just to show you this quickly I'm gonna write M mag and you can see they're both two point three

121
00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:34.230
and then K and Ng and these are both whatever number they are what corresponds to pi over 6.

122
00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:40.290
So slightly circular but at least you know this is in the interest of completeness.

123
00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:43.440
So let's see let's to plot polar.

124
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:51.000
Now I want a vector so it's gonna go from the origin and then we need the angle of the vector and then

125
00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:53.930
the magnitude is going to be matched.

126
00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.780
And let's make this red.

127
00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.440
So let's see how this plot looks.

128
00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.310
All right so this looks pretty good.

129
00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.120
We see the vector out here.

130
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:10.440
The magnet magnitude here so the distance away from the origin is mostly you know most of the way between

131
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.850
2 and 2.5.

132
00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:13.710
So that's about right.

133
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:13.950
Okay.

134
00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:21.750
And then what I want to do is plot a coordinate on top of here and that is going to come from the CIS

135
00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.950
formulation here.

136
00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:26.210
So I'm going to write P L T dot polar.

137
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:31.790
So to get a dot I don't need to specify two coordinates I just need to specify hard.

138
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:37.500
Well I should say two components to each of these coordinates I only specify one input for the angle

139
00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:41.710
and one input for the magnitude.

140
00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:48.380
So this is K whoops K comma M and let's make this a blue dot.

141
00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:51.520
So we get a blue dot at the end point of this vector.

142
00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:59.410
Yeah it's not so surprising that these two correspond to the end of this vector given the kind of circularity

143
00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:06.090
of using M and K to create Oilers notation here and then extracting them here.

144
00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:12.790
Nonetheless I think these kinds of geometric demonstrations are always useful for building up intuition

145
00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.800
so in this video I talked about Oilers formula.

146
00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:19.850
Also called Oilers identity.

147
00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:24.830
You learned about the most elegant equation in all of human civilization.

148
00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:30.960
Up to now maybe someone will discover a more elegant equation at some point in the future.

149
00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:35.380
Of course there is a exercise associated with this video.

150
00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:41.000
You are going to learn more about using functions and polar plots in that exercise.

151
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.260
So stay tuned.

152
00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.550
Don't go too far away and I will see you in a moment.
