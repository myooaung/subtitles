00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:10.190
Now that you know how to compute the area under a curve using integrals it's time to learn how to compute

2
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.710
the area between two curves.

3
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.880
And the good part is that you basically already know how to do this.

4
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.930
It's a small extension of what I discussed in the previous videos on computing integrals and in particular

5
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.640
Definite integrals.

6
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.910
And I'll also give a reminder a review of how to draw patches in Python.

7
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.050
So let's get started.

8
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.050
This is a quick review from a few videos ago about introducing the integral.

9
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:44.840
So remember the idea is that if you want to compute the area under this curve then you create a bunch

10
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.720
of rectangles in here and then you sum up the areas of the rectangles and then basically you make these

11
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.270
rectangles thinner and thinner until they are infinitesimally thin.

12
00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.400
And then here is the formula for that that I showed so this was the definite integral between point

13
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:12.710
A and Point B and F of X is the height of the bars of the rectangles and D X is the width of the rectangles.

14
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:20.300
Now this equation over here is just to show that I can rewrite this expression as this and this is really

15
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.960
nothing in particular special I'm just subtracting zero which basically means nothing.

16
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:33.530
So if you think of this line here as being zero you can call this a function where F of X or I already

17
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.110
call this f of x so let's call this G of X G of X is zero everywhere.

18
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.000
So at every value of x this function G of X is zero.

19
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.450
And that's really the key insight to computing the area between two curves.

20
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.520
So let's imagine we have these two functions here.

21
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.340
So then the question is how do we compute the area between these two curves here.

22
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.940
So not this area down here just this area in here.

23
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.330
Well the procedure is exactly the same.

24
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.050
You draw a bunch of rectangles but now the rectangles don't go all the way down to the bottom of the

25
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.770
graph.

26
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:16.310
They stop here and then the formula is basically just what I hinted at in the previous slide.

27
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.290
So you just say f of x minus G of X.

28
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.810
And so here this would be f of x.

29
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.640
This would be G of X.

30
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.130
Now which one you call f in which when you call G is pretty arbitrary.

31
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:35.000
Of course if you would swap these around if you would write the integral from A to B of G of X minus

32
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.440
F of X you're gonna get the same answer but then it's going to be negative.

33
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.860
So the sine has a little bit of an arbitrary nature to it.

34
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.690
Okay.

35
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:52.240
So let's switch to code now and I'm going to show you how to set up for solving a problem like this.

36
00:02:52.370 --> 00:03:00.620
We are going to be using simple ie num pi matte plot lib pi plot and the display and math functions

37
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.290
although I think these are only going to come into play in the exercise.

38
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.230
Let's get started by creating two functions.

39
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.700
So these are both going to be functions of x.

40
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:19.260
So I will first create a symbolic variable X loops that should be like that.

41
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.630
Okay.

42
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:20.300
So let's say.

43
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:27.060
So we're gonna need to make these functions in simplify and then convert them into function so I'm going

44
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:35.750
to start by writing some f for function F and that's going to be X squared and then some gs of function

45
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:36.000
G.

46
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.550
That's just going to be x.

47
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.130
So this is going to be a fairly simple set of functions X squared of course looks like this and then

48
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.670
x is just as linear increase.

49
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:53.030
And now for plotting what I want to do is convert these from simple expressions into functions that

50
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.610
I can call and generate specific numbers for.

51
00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:06.140
So for that then I'll call those variables F and G so f is going to be simple lambda fi and the key

52
00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:14.150
variable is X and then the function or the expression is M F and then let's see I'll do a copy and paste

53
00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.440
here that's going to be G.

54
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:17.810
All right.

55
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.570
So I just run this code and I didn't get any errors.

56
00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:21.060
That's good.

57
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.150
So let's start by plotting this function.

58
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:29.600
So P L T dot plot and now actually what are we gonna plot.

59
00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.890
Well we need to define an x value.

60
00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:39.800
So I'll call it X X of course because I don't want to confuse it with this single x so x x will be linearly

61
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.550
spaced numbers.

62
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.980
How about we go from minus two to plus two in fifty.

63
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.710
How about fifty five steps.

64
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.540
Seems like a good number.

65
00:04:50.660 --> 00:05:00.830
So plot x x by the function f evaluated at points x x and then on top of that we're gonna plot x x by

66
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:08.550
the function g evaluated at x x and I'll make sure that this is a red line.

67
00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.930
So let's see what these two functions look like.

68
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.700
OK so here's are two functions this is X squared.

69
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:23.470
And this is X and you can see that they overlap a little bit here and this is the interesting region

70
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.940
that I want to compute the area of this little almost looks like a lip here.

71
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.220
Now of course that's arbitrary.

72
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.910
You don't have to compute the area between two functions where they intersect.

73
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.890
You could compute the area between these two functions.

74
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:44.050
Let's say here for whatever reason but you will see when we get to the exercise it's gonna be interesting

75
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.140
to see where these functions intersect.

76
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.410
Okay.

77
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:55.450
So therefore it seems like most of the area of this plot is taken up by space that we are not interested

78
00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:56.010
in.

79
00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:04.900
So I am going to change the axis to go from about minus point to five.

80
00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.530
So somewhere basically here to around here on the x axis.

81
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.950
So then one point two five and on the y axis.

82
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.220
Let's try to be a little bit below here to a little bit above here.

83
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.520
So let's try a minus point five to one point five.

84
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:23.560
Okay that's good.

85
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.460
Now we can really zoom in to the key area here.

86
00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.690
Now I want to put a legend so appeal to that legend.

87
00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:38.380
And of course you could also put the label in these plot commands here but you know sometimes it's good

88
00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:43.230
to change things up a bit just to you know prevent boredom.

89
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:43.710
So let's see.

90
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.750
I want this to be in latex.

91
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:55.840
So in between two dollar signs I'm going to write f of x equals percent s and that's going to be the

92
00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:00.620
same pi since the late TEC of the function.

93
00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:07.990
Remember this is not this function which I've lambda fired into a function that gets evaluated at discrete

94
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.810
points.

95
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:16.240
This is the simple I object for the function talking about coding can sometimes be a little confusing

96
00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:22.420
because of all this terminal logical overloading you know I'm using the word function for this kind

97
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:26.950
of a function and then I create this function and then there's this function which is actually referring

98
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.770
to a calculus function of X..

99
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:34.570
But anyway that's just an ambiguity that you have to learn to live with.

100
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.140
So let's see.

101
00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:45.820
So that was f of x and then we have G of X equals again a percent s and then percent since latex M G.

102
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.890
Okey dokey.

103
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:48.220
All right.

104
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:49.760
This looks good.

105
00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:56.590
So as I mentioned in the exercise we are going to be computing the area between these two functions

106
00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:58.480
using the intersection point.

107
00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:04.540
So these points where they intersect now in the exercise we are going to use simplify to compute their

108
00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:11.650
exact intersect points empirically but I think we can already just kind of look at these two functions

109
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.560
and figure out what are their intersection points.

110
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.700
So where does X equal X squared.

111
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:24.050
Well you can see I mean you can you can guess it but you can also look at the graph and and figure this

112
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:24.200
out.

113
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.370
So when x equals zero obviously zero equals zero squared.

114
00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:32.690
And here where X equals one one equals one squared.

115
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:38.800
So these are the two intersection points that we are going to compute the area between.

116
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.640
So the boundaries.

117
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:48.890
So what I'd like to do now is add a patch here and I'm going to do that using a function from map plot

118
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:49.720
lib.

119
00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.290
So from Matt.

120
00:08:51.290 --> 00:09:01.300
Plot lib dot patches import the function called Paul the gun.

121
00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:04.610
And so what we are going to do here run this cell again.

122
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:10.820
What we're gonna do here is draw a bunch of points that go all the way around from the top of the function

123
00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:17.600
to the bottom of this or the polygon that we want and then we are going to add that as a patch on top

124
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.430
of this graph.

125
00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:19.780
Okay.

126
00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:23.420
So let's see how to do that ad patch.

127
00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:30.620
So what we need to do is specify all the x axis coordinates and the y axis coordinates for the patch.

128
00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:32.690
So let's call this X patch.

129
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:39.730
And that's going to be I'll set this as linearly spaced numbers between 0 and 1.

130
00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.260
And how about 100 hundred of them.

131
00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:46.670
I think that's going to give us a sufficient resolution for this curve down here of course for the top

132
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:47.260
curve.

133
00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:53.540
We actually only need two points this value here at 1 0 and this value here at 1.

134
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:58.710
But for this bottom curve we want to make sure we have a sufficient number of points.

135
00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:06.590
So then for the y coordinates of the patch this is going to be let me write up this function first and

136
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:07.790
then I'll get back and explain this.

137
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:19.010
So we want the function G of X evaluated at the X patch points and then we want F of X also evaluated

138
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.860
at these same x axis points.

139
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:27.450
So that's basically going to draw a bunch of points that in circles this patch.

140
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:27.890
Okay.

141
00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:33.680
And then this needs to be transposed that's just about the order and then this function v stack is basically

142
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.540
just vertically stacking them together.

143
00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:41.210
So let me actually show you what this variable will look like why patch.

144
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:42.620
Okay.

145
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:49.400
So here you see these are all of the functions for let's see what do we draw for G of X and then F of

146
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:55.900
X evaluated at the x axis points between 0 and 1.

147
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:59.780
Okay so we don't need these anymore.

148
00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:07.160
And now what I'm going to do is just set up the patch of Fig X I have to set this up as a call to a

149
00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.600
specific axis.

150
00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:14.630
So it's gonna be so we need this function subplots although we're not actually generating any particular

151
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:26.670
subplots then I write X that add patch and then what I'm going to add is a polygon object so that looks

152
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:28.440
like this polygon.

153
00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.380
That's the function that I just imported from the map.

154
00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:38.420
Plot lib module and then I basically just input the Y patch coordinates.

155
00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.750
So let's already try this code and see how it looks all right.

156
00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:47.520
So that looks pretty interesting we see this blue patch here but I don't really like the patch being

157
00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.340
blue.

158
00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:53.420
I think this will look nicer if I make this have a face.

159
00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.890
Color of black.

160
00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:56.710
Okay.

161
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:58.410
But that's a little bit too black.

162
00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:04.560
This looks like you know we've torn a hole in the universe here and we're kind of looking out into nothingness.

163
00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:10.560
I would like to make this a little bit lighter and the way that I'm going to do that is by setting this

164
00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.450
alpha parameter which is the transparency.

165
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:14.610
Two point three.

166
00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:20.450
So essentially that makes it a black patch but it has 30 percent transparency on it.

167
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.370
Well you're probably wondering when do we get to the point where we actually compute the area between

168
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:31.780
those two functions within the boundaries of where the functions intersect.

169
00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:36.430
That is the whole point of the exercise and that comes in the next video.

170
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:37.450
So keep watching.
