00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:10,090
In this video I'm going to talk about partial derivatives how to interpret partial derivatives and of

2
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:16,690
course how to implement them in Python and to already give you a heads up computing partial derivatives

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,980
is lots of fun.

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,410
And it's probably a lot easier than you might think it is.

5
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:26,880
If you don't already know how to compute partial derivatives so let's get started.

6
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:33,130
When are partial derivatives useful partial derivatives are useful when you have a function of more

7
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,510
than one variable.

8
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:42,400
So in this case we have a function of two variables x and y and that function is defined as two times

9
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,920
X times Y squared.

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:51,280
So if I asked you to compute the derivative of this function you would have to ask me back which variable

11
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:57,110
to compute the derivative relative to so it can be X or it can be Y.

12
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,230
And that's the idea of a partial derivative.

13
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:05,530
So a partial derivative is basically just a derivative of the function relative to one variable while

14
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,900
holding constant all of the other variables.

15
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:15,010
So let's see how the notation works and what the derivative will be of this function.

16
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,400
So the partial derivative is formally written like this with this kind of funny looking I don't know

17
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:25,140
it looks like a D but then you know it's a little bit sad.

18
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,850
So it's kind of like drooping over on the top here.

19
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:35,970
Anyway this is formally pronounced the partial derivative of F with respect to x and as a shortcut.

20
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:42,280
People often say partial f partial X it's also sometimes written like this which is a little bit more

21
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:42,840
condensed.

22
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:50,980
So the function f and then a little X in the subscript so why is the partial derivative of this function

23
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:54,130
with respect to X to Y squared.

24
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:00,640
Well the key insight is to realize that because X and Y are separate variables these are independent

25
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:09,130
variables x does not depend on y and why does not depend on X then from the perspective of X Y is actually

26
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,870
just a constant.

27
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,540
And that's how you compute a partial derivative.

28
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,690
You treat the other variables as constants.

29
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,820
So let's just pretend that this is a constant.

30
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,090
Just like the number two is a constant.

31
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:28,000
So then the derivative of x is 1 right because implicitly there's a 1 here in the superscript in the

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,020
power.

33
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,590
So the derivative of x is 1 and then this drops out.

34
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,220
So then we get to times Y squared.

35
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:43,090
Likewise the partial derivative with respect to y is for X Y and the reason why this is the correct

36
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:48,640
answer is that from the perspective of why X is a constant.

37
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:56,140
So therefore we just differentiate with respect to y and the derivative of y squared is two times Y.

38
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,630
So then we get the Y and then there's the extra 2 that comes out and that multiplies this 2 giving us

39
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:11,120
4 x y what I'm going to do now is show you how to compute a partial derivative using simplify and how

40
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,290
to display the partial derivative using LaTeX coding like what I just showed in these slides.

41
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:24,760
So therefore we are naturally going to be using the simple module and the display and math functions.

42
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:25,640
So let's see.

43
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:38,090
I'm going to import from Sim PI that ABC import x and y variables and let's define our function to be

44
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:44,810
X squared plus X times Y squared.

45
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:51,200
So this is not exactly the same function that I showed in the slides but it's going to produce an interesting

46
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:56,210
looking graph a three dimensional graph as you will see in the exercises.

47
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,140
So let's see.

48
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:04,850
Display math and the first thing I want to show you is how to produce that partial f partial X symbol

49
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,560
that I showed in the slides.

50
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,080
So it's actually probably what you would guess it would be it slash partial.

51
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,920
So partial F.

52
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:18,350
And then in the denominator we have partial X so let's already see how that looks.

53
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:26,660
Okay so that looks pretty good and then equals and let's do a percent s here and now you know how to

54
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,680
C I need a percent sign here.

55
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:38,510
Now you already know how to compute the derivative of a function that's with Cin diff and then you input

56
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:45,050
the function and let's check out the doc string the help file to see what we can do about a partial

57
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:51,780
derivative so in the beginning this is telling us a little bit about computing the third derivative

58
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:57,880
with an optional third input like this and let's see well I guess the answer.

59
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,160
Okay.

60
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:02,590
So I think the answer actually comes from looking at the second input here.

61
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:09,420
So the second input into the diff function is the variable that you want to compute the derivative relative

62
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,250
to.

63
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,170
So we want the derivative.

64
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:18,900
The partial derivative with respect to x and then we simply write seemed that if F comma x.

65
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:24,840
So here's the answer and then it's good to look at this and make sure that this is what we would expect

66
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,530
it to be.

67
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:33,470
So the derivative of x squared is 2 x and then the derivative of x times Y squared would be just y squared.

68
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:39,160
Again because from the perspective of X Y is simply a constant.

69
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:39,540
All right.

70
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:47,820
So then repeating this for the partial derivative with respect to y is pretty straightforward as you

71
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,270
might guess.

72
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,930
Let's see and let's also confirm that this is the right answer.

73
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,640
So here we only get one term.

74
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,780
Here we have two terms.

75
00:05:54,930 --> 00:06:00,780
Now there is no y term or there's no Y variable in this first term in this function.

76
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,850
So that means that the derivative of this term is actually zero.

77
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:11,640
From the perspective of Y and then here we would get the derivative of y squared is to Y and then times

78
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:19,590
X now the interesting thing about functions of two variables is that they have three dimensional graphs

79
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,560
associated with them and that should make sense when you have a function of one variable that produces

80
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,350
a line in a two dimensional space.

81
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:34,500
So therefore when you have a function of two variables that produces a surface in a three dimensional

82
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,320
space.

83
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:42,360
And of course if you have a function of three variables if this was F of X Y and Z then you actually

84
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:49,080
have I don't know it's like a four dimensional hyper surface that's floating on top of a three dimensional

85
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,580
axis.

86
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:54,570
I don't really know what that looks like but anyway let's stick to two variables for now.

87
00:06:54,570 --> 00:07:01,890
So what you want to do in this exercise is implement this function here which we just looked at in Python

88
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:07,880
so X squared plus X times Y squared and you want to generate three graphs.

89
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,370
They're going to look like this.

90
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,820
So the first is the function itself.

91
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:16,800
That's what this function looks like it's kind of this magic flying carpet or something that's going

92
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,590
up to the moon I guess.

93
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:24,210
And then you want to compute the partial derivative with respect to x and the partial derivative with

94
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:28,710
respect to y and then make 3D plots of these guys.

95
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:35,820
Now I am about to give you a hint and the hint is the function is simply that you use to generate these

96
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,940
kinds of plots.

97
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:42,150
If you don't want this hint if you want to figure it out on your own then pause the video now.

98
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:48,710
Okay so the hint is to use the functions Sim dot plotting thought plot 3D.

99
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:53,360
Now I'm not going to tell you how to use that function to produce these inputs.

100
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:59,960
You're going to have to figure that out on your own but at least that will get you started okay.

101
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:04,370
So now I am going to walk through this exercise.

102
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:12,120
So we call the function simple thought plotting that plot 3D and this takes a couple of inputs.

103
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:18,350
Let's just see what happens if we plot only with or if we run this command only with one input.

104
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:18,580
OK.

105
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,690
So first of all we get really nothing.

106
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:24,460
This tells us that we have created a simple plotting object.

107
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:30,650
So we need to actually request an output in order to get this plot to produce something.

108
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:30,890
OK.

109
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,660
So already this is looking pretty good.

110
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:41,140
I want to add a few optional inputs and that is going to be the range of x and the range of Y.

111
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,320
So the ranges of the axes.

112
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,410
So these come in tuples.

113
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:49,430
So it's gonna be X and then minus three come plus three.

114
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:56,600
And this is telling Python or the simple plotting engine that we want to plot on the x axis range from

115
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,110
minus three to plus three.

116
00:08:59,270 --> 00:08:59,600
Okay.

117
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,990
And now it looks like it didn't obey our commands but it turns out that we also need to specify a range

118
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,620
for Y.

119
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:13,940
So y goes from minus three to plus three along with X and now we see that the function is limited to

120
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,680
these domains.

121
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:21,110
So the domain on X from minus three to plus three and on y again from minus 3 to plus 3.

122
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:27,880
And then I'm going to add a title so that's gonna say title equals and now I want this to be in latex.

123
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:34,420
So I'm going to use dollar signs to indicate that I should be planning in latex.

124
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,240
F of X and Y equals percent.

125
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:43,850
S and let's do a replacement of percent simply latex of f.

126
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,410
All right.

127
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,310
So this looks great.

128
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:54,020
Now we need to basically repeat this line three times four or I guess repeat it twice so we already

129
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,390
have ones for the full function.

130
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:59,480
And then we want the derivative with respect to y.

131
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:08,000
So that's going to be some dot diff f first with respect to x and then let's see the rest of this code

132
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,960
is the same except we want to change the title.

133
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:20,890
So this is no longer the function f but instead the derivative of x hour of F with respect to x and

134
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,040
let's see what that one looks like.

135
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,360
Good.

136
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,760
That looks like this sort of half tube thing that I showed in the slides and we can also do a super

137
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,270
quick confirmation that the derivative is what we expect it to be.

138
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:38,720
So X squared goes to X and X times Y squared just goes to Y squared.

139
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,010
All right.

140
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,350
And now I'm going to copy and paste again.

141
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,530
And then we need to change everything from X to Y.

142
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:53,720
So let's see that's going to be here as well all right.

143
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,490
Very nice.

144
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,200
So I introduced you to computing partial derivatives.

145
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,750
You saw that it's actually quite simple it's pretty straightforward to compute partial derivatives and

146
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:09,180
you got to see how to make really nice 3D graphics in simple.
