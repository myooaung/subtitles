1
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:11,550
This is the exercise that goes along with the previous video which you want to do in this exercise implement

2
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,140
this function.

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,110
This is actually a family of functions.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:24,960
I call it F sub a of X so we have the function cosine of X plus sign of X and the sine is embedded inside

5
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,620
the cosine and then out here you have this plus a.

6
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:34,560
So then the idea is that you create four of these functions for four different values of A.

7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,230
And notice that they come from a set of integers 0 through 3.

8
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:45,550
So that's maybe a bit of a hint that you probably don't need to come up with for entirely separate simple

9
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:51,180
objects one for each function but anyway that's up to you to decide okay.

10
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:57,510
So this is gonna give you a family of four functions and then what you want to do is plot all for these

11
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:05,370
functions in the same graph and then in a separate graph you can plot the derivatives of each of these

12
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,720
four functions.

13
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,060
So all of the functions go in one graph.

14
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,730
There's gonna be four lines in that one graph and all the derivatives go in the same graph but not the

15
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:15,070
same.

16
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:19,950
Well they go in their own graph but a different graph from the original functions.

17
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,020
So you know the drill.

18
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,790
Pause the video.

19
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:30,070
Do some coding and now I am going to start coding in Python.

20
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:38,520
All right so I'm gonna start by creating some symbolic variables x and a sub X comma a.

21
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,050
Let's see then what I'm going to do is create the basic function.

22
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:54,140
So that's going to be F equals Sim dot cosine of X plus Sim sine of x and then out here I have plus

23
00:01:54,290 --> 00:02:03,230
a and the way that I'm going to do this is I'm going to use the sub's method in simplified to substitute

24
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,940
for the variable a.

25
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:06,790
Okay.

26
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:07,360
So let's see.

27
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,710
So for a I'll call this variable.

28
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:14,620
This looping index variable a I because I'm it's gonna be indices over a.

29
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:20,240
So for a I in range 0 through 4.

30
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:28,070
Well it ends up being 0 3 of course and then you write for because this is a non-exclusive upper bound.

31
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:32,600
I meant to say a non inclusive of course it is an exclusive upper bound.

32
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:32,850
Okay.

33
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,750
So I'm going to do the same trick that I wrote above in the previous video.

34
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,620
So if a I equals zero.

35
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:44,620
Then we initialize the plot to b Sim plot.

36
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:52,190
And now it's not just going to be f it's going to be f dot subs and we are going to substitute a for

37
00:02:52,310 --> 00:03:02,420
a I and then show equals false and then I will attach a label which is going to basically just say what

38
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,960
a is set to.

39
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:08,710
So a equals s and now you know actually we could do it this way.

40
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:17,630
But I'm just going to set it up to say plus string of a I you know just it's good to have some variety

41
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,130
every now and then.

42
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:25,210
Okay so that is what happens on the first iteration on every subsequent iteration.

43
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:30,860
Then we have to extend this plots and now this is going to be something very similar.

44
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:37,430
So I'm going to copy and paste and let's see.

45
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,500
This is gonna be almost exactly the same.

46
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:45,080
We're gonna run into the same problem that we did in the previous video with the colors but for now

47
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:51,020
I just want to run this to see if we're going to get any errors already.

48
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,330
And of course we already get some errors.

49
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,700
This is I see.

50
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,200
That was just a little typo.

51
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,420
It's supposed to be f dot subs not f comma subs.

52
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,540
All right so that looks pretty cool.

53
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:11,310
Looks like waves on a imaginary ocean in the winter wonderland of trigonometry or whatever.

54
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,800
Okay so this is looking good.

55
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,860
You can recognize this function.

56
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,110
I've used this function several times.

57
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:21,720
This form of a function several times already in this course.

58
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:26,340
Cosine of X plus sine X or something to that effect.

59
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,250
I like this function.

60
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,250
It looks pretty neat.

61
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,590
And then of course when we add different values of a.

62
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:33,590
This is really just acting as a constant offset.

63
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:39,450
So it's just pushing the entire function up or down on the y axis.

64
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:39,700
Okay.

65
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:40,270
So let's see.

66
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:49,640
So now I'm going to define these colors to be uh blue red black and magenta so appear I showed you one

67
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,290
trick for getting the colors and this is also fine.

68
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:57,610
But in this case I'm going to actually specify them up primary so let's see.

69
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,420
That's gonna go here.

70
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:09,320
So the color sets actually line color equals colors and then this is going to be the zero with element

71
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:15,860
and then copy and then paste down here and your eyes have to be careful to make sure you're getting

72
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,800
in the right parentheses here.

73
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:22,010
So now the color is going to come from index a I.

74
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,460
Okay.

75
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,590
This is looking pretty good.

76
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:32,270
I want to add a title so PETA title equals the functions.

77
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,730
And then we need to activate the legends.

78
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,200
Legend equals true.

79
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,510
All right.

80
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,480
I think this looks pretty good.

81
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:43,190
Let's move on to the derivatives.

82
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,440
So I'm just gonna put that in more code down here because I want the derivatives to appear directly

83
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,050
underneath all of these functions.

84
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,850
And in fact let's think about what has to change to plot the functions.

85
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:06,230
We can actually use pretty much exactly all of this same code so copy this entire block of code and

86
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,330
paste it again.

87
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,990
And let's go through line by line what we need to change.

88
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:15,310
Well obviously we don't want to change this stuff because the parameter a has to be the same.

89
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:21,080
Now we do need to change this because we are no longer interested in the function itself.

90
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:28,490
We are interested in the derivative of the function and then it's important to get the substitution

91
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,360
to be inside this derivative function.

92
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:34,120
And then let's see all of that is fine.

93
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:44,540
And then of course we also change this sim that diff of the entire function including the change of

94
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:53,390
the parameter a so and then this is going to change this to their derivatives.

95
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,370
Okay.

96
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,050
Let's see what this looks like.

97
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:56,570
Huh.

98
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,400
So here we get this kind of funny.

99
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:04,830
We get all of these lines all four of these lines are exactly overlapping on top of each other.

100
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,690
And the legend is also exactly the same for all four of these functions.

101
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:15,560
So first of all let's check and make sure we haven't made any coding errors because it's not necessarily

102
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,980
wrong if all four lines are the same.

103
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,050
But it can be an indicator.

104
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:24,460
It does look a little bit suspicious of every line is exactly the same.

105
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:29,840
And in fact I'm pretty confident that we've done the right thing because we confirmed here that we did

106
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,250
the right thing and then I really just copied and pasted all the code.

107
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:36,050
And in fact this is exactly correct.

108
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,920
We did nothing wrong here.

109
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:42,200
It turns out that the derivative of a constant is zero.

110
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:48,530
So these additions here plus zero which is not displayed but implicitly This is a equals zero.

111
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:56,870
So plus zero plus one plus two plus three the derivative of a constant is always going to be zero.

112
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:02,900
So that means that from the perspective of the derivative all four of these functions and all four these

113
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,870
lines are exactly identical.

114
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,330
Great.

115
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:12,380
So I think this in the last video was pretty exciting and pretty fun.

116
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,500
I hope you agreed.

117
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:20,170
You learned about these cyclist city of sine and cosine derivatives and you got some more experience

118
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:25,000
working with simpler plotting and thinking about derivatives graphically.
