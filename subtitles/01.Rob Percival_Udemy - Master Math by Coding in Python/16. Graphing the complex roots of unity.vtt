00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:09.310
Now that you know about complex numbers and how to work with complex numbers and you know a little bit

2
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:17.610
about the natural exponent or e to the X you are ready to learn the complex roots of unity.

3
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.390
Now this sounds like a really bizarre kind of magical mysterious term.

4
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.520
So what is the roots of unity.

5
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:30.340
Maybe you think that this is some like something from a fantasy book like there's this special magical

6
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.840
tree in the land of unity and its roots have magical powers or something like that.

7
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:41.980
But actually the roots of unity turn out to be a relatively tame concept in mathematics but also really

8
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.940
important for for example the 48 transform and other aspects of signal processing.

9
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.730
And once you learn about the roots of unity algebraic Klee then I will introduce you to plotting and

10
00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.460
graphing the roots of unity and that will lead to a really beautiful plot in Python.

11
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:08.890
I think by the end of this video you will see a nice example of the intersection between math and art.

12
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:09.160
All right.

13
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.120
So let's get started.

14
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:17.290
So the roots of unity essentially just means that for some number z which is a complex number so a complex

15
00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.420
value numbers said if you raise it to the end power then it equals 1.

16
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.810
Now on the one hand if you set end to be zero then this is a trivial equation because any number to

17
00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:37.110
the power of zero is equal to 1 but if n is a larger number than zero let's say if n is five then it's

18
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:44.620
not so obvious what said should be in order to get Z to the end power to also be equal to 1 when n is

19
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:52.060
equal to 5 but it turns out that the solution the way to define Z is according to this formula.

20
00:01:52.540 --> 00:02:00.310
So z equals the natural exponent so e to the power of and this whole expression is in the exponent of

21
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:08.760
E and that is to PI K divided by n so pi is the number three point one four and so on.

22
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.090
You see pi all over the place with circles.

23
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:20.380
I of course is the imaginary operator or the square root of minus 1 and k is a set of numbers that goes

24
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.570
from 0 to end minus 1.

25
00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:28.800
So if n is 5 then K would be 0 1 2 3 4.

26
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:35.620
So then the idea is that for each value of k you put K into this formula that gives you a Z and then

27
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:42.340
you take Z to the end power and that will give you the number one and because K is defined as zero up

28
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:50.530
to and minus one then that means when N equals five then there are five roots of one.

29
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.330
So in other words for Z to the end there are N and roots.

30
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.590
Okay.

31
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.300
So what I'm gonna do now is switch to Python.

32
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.260
I will show you how to demonstrate this algebraic.

33
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:08.560
Just with numbers and then I'll show you how to make a plot that visualizes these complex roots of unity

34
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:16.380
and that will lead naturally into the exercise in this video we are going to be using several modules

35
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:25.560
including num pi simplify map plot lived up pi plot and the functions display and math from the Python

36
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.860
display module.

37
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.940
Okay so let's begin and actually let's begin with N equals 5 since that's the number I was talking about

38
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.080
in the slides.

39
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:43.890
So what I'm going to do here is loop through 4 k in range 0 to n and then what I'm going to do is compute

40
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:50.610
the n order or I should say the k if root of 1 and then print that out and hopefully we will see that

41
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.920
that equals the number 1.

42
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.080
So let's call this the root.

43
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.930
So I'll call this variable root.

44
00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:03.360
So that was known PI that he XP and then we have two times pi.

45
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:10.140
So num piled up pi times the imaginary operator which I'm writing as 1 j here.

46
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:16.290
Times K and then divided by n and now actually I mean even just gonna run this cell already it's not

47
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:22.170
going to print out anything but it also didn't give me any error messages so that's a good sign.

48
00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:23.160
Okay.

49
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.600
And now I'm just going to print out the root huh.

50
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.200
So this does not seem to correspond to the number one.

51
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.080
None of these is the number one.

52
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:38.360
So what's going on actually what's going on is that this is not yet the end root.

53
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.580
This is that number maybe I should have called it z and maybe it would have been a bit clearer.

54
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:50.160
So remember from the slides that once you put K into this natural exponent you then need to raise Z

55
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.310
to the power of n.

56
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.030
So let's try this again like this.

57
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.480
Mm hmm.

58
00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.570
Okay so maybe you think there's still looks a little bit confusing but let's go through each of these

59
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:01.810
numbers in turn.

60
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.000
So this first number is 1 plus 0 j.

61
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.750
So that's really just the number 1.

62
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.750
So we get confirmation there.

63
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.450
How about here.

64
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.580
This is almost the number one is point 9 9 9 9.

65
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.380
So it's almost the number 1.

66
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.790
And then this is a complex number.

67
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.760
So the imaginary part is looks like it's minus 1 J.

68
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.230
But actually you have to notice this scientific notation here.

69
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.370
E to the minus 16.

70
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.490
So this is actually basically just zero plus computer rounding error.

71
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:38.130
And if you look down at these other ones you'll see this is one and then also a really really really

72
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.690
tiny number.

73
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:45.630
So this is basically a decimal point and then 16 zeros after that before you start getting to some non-zero

74
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:46.220
numbers.

75
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.060
Same business for all of these guys.

76
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:55.050
Now the reason why we are not getting exactly one and why there's a tiny tiny imaginary component here

77
00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.020
is essentially because of how this number pi is computed.

78
00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.760
This is not actually the real PI.

79
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.490
This is just pi estimated out to some number of digits.

80
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:14.430
So what I think we can do instead is use these simple a tool box or the simple module in order to get

81
00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:20.270
pi and also e in terms of symbols not in terms of estimated numbers.

82
00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.720
So now I'm basically just going to convert everything into simple so simple XP.

83
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.530
This is going to be Sim dot Pi.

84
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:33.870
And here I'm going to use SIM dot AI instead of I j.

85
00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.190
And now let's see what happens.

86
00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:37.090
Aha.

87
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.170
Now we get all ones.

88
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:44.310
Okay so this is looking good and now the last thing I want to do in this cell is just make this look

89
00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:45.120
a little bit nicer.

90
00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:53.640
So let's say display math and then what I want to do is basically say e to the power of all this stuff

91
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:54.960
raised to the ends.

92
00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.720
Power gives us the number one.

93
00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:58.190
So let's see.

94
00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.160
That'll be percent as soon as I need it in quotes here.

95
00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:06.790
Percent s and then I'll have a large write arrow.

96
00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.600
This leads to percent.

97
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:11.820
So now we need to do our substitution.

98
00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:20.430
So this first one is going to be Sim late tech said and then the second substitution is going to be

99
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:30.710
sin that late tech said to the power of n okay so this is looking a little bit better except it's actually

100
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.930
not totally totally accurate.

101
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:37.220
And that's because I made a little typo here or maybe I made it here.

102
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.740
Anyway the point is this is not actually correct.

103
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:43.830
What we need to do is say Z to the power of n.

104
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:52.760
So I'm gonna put parentheses around here and then carat and then another percent s and then here I'm

105
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:56.260
gonna need an okay.

106
00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:00.000
So this number in here is the number z.

107
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.950
And then we raise that to the fifth power and then we get one.

108
00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:04.250
All right.

109
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:05.590
So that is pretty neat.

110
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:10.070
And then it's worth checking that this works for other numbers as well.

111
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:14.630
So here are these seven seventh roots of unity.

112
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:20.110
And we can do 17 so these are the 17 17th roots of unity hot.

113
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:25.000
And actually now we've discovered a bug and I didn't even realize that this was there notice.

114
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:29.690
Now the one is in the superscript and the 7 is not in the superscript.

115
00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:37.260
So in fact this needs to be in curly brackets like this all right.

116
00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.060
This is looking better.

117
00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:39.300
Okay.

118
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:44.970
Now we could do this all day go down to this but that's gonna end up just taking a really long time

119
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.750
and making lots and lots of printouts.

120
00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.880
Let's keep this at about 4.

121
00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:52.080
So this is already kind of interesting.

122
00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:57.000
You see that the 4 4th roots of unity are 1.

123
00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:57.910
And then I.

124
00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:00.270
And then minus 1 and minus I.

125
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:06.930
And that is a good segway into what I want to show you next which is plotting these routes now.

126
00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.140
Z is a complex number.

127
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:16.110
So that means that we can plot this complex number on a circle on a unit circle just like I showed you

128
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:20.130
in previous videos with the with graphing complex numbers.

129
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.440
So let's do that down here.

130
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.180
Let's say N equals 4.

131
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:30.960
And now essentially what I'm going to do is repeat some of this code but I'm going to display it instead

132
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.600
of printing it out.

133
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.840
So I will even copy and paste.

134
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:42.100
So here we compute the K if root of unity.

135
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.370
And then I'm going to plot it.

136
00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.980
So how do we want to plot this.

137
00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:53.490
So I want this to be a line that goes from the origin to this complex number here.

138
00:09:53.490 --> 00:10:01.440
So you will recall we need to specify the x coordinates and then to y coordinates and we start at coordinate

139
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.590
x equals zero and Y equals zero.

140
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:15.060
And then we go up to X equals the real part of said and Y goes up to the imaginary part of Z.

141
00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:15.330
All right.

142
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.300
So let's already run this and see what happens.

143
00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:19.020
Mm hmm.

144
00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:22.080
So we start getting some error messages.

145
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:27.210
And this is actually related to some interactions between simplify and num pi.

146
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:34.190
So what I'm going to do is convert all of these back from symbols into numbers so known PI that the

147
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:36.230
XP num paid out Pi.

148
00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:39.540
And here this will go back to 1 j.

149
00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:39.870
Okay.

150
00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:40.920
So this is pretty funny.

151
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:45.900
We get a plus sign where each of the arms have a different color.

152
00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:54.870
And in fact these correspond to these four numbers appear so appear the first root of unity is one which

153
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:56.300
you see here and then it's I.

154
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:58.890
Which is plotted up here remember this is a complex plane.

155
00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.310
So this is one unit up on the imaginary axis.

156
00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:03.850
So that's I.

157
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:08.310
And then minus one here and then minus I down here.

158
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:11.970
So then we can make this even larger about 14.

159
00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:16.830
And now it looks like these lines are evenly distributed around the circle.

160
00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:21.810
Now to make this point a little bit clearer I want to make the plot look a little bit nicer.

161
00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:28.220
So one thing I'm going to do is make this a square plot.

162
00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:29.530
OK.

163
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:32.410
So that already looks a little bit nicer.

164
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:38.460
And now what I think I would like to do is plot a circle around here so you can see that these lie on

165
00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.090
the unit circle.

166
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:43.540
So you might remember how to do that from a previous video.

167
00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:56.980
So we basically want to draw cosine of X by sine of X and I'm going to set the color to be gray.

168
00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:03.570
So now what is x x was angles in radians that go from zero up to two pi.

169
00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:06.810
So let's say x equals known pi.

170
00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.930
Lynn space from zero to two pi.

171
00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.210
Let's try a hundred steps.

172
00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.940
Let's see how this looks.

173
00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:16.510
That's num pi pi.

174
00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:21.660
Now if you're a little bit confused about why I'm writing these two lines of code and how that produces

175
00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:27.480
a circle you might want to go back and consult the video on plotting the unit circle.

176
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:28.650
Okay.

177
00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:35.540
And then I also want to make this a little bit different so how about a dashed line like this actually.

178
00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.950
Now I think it looks better just on its own.

179
00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:38.980
Okay.

180
00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:43.240
So this is pretty neat it's starting to look a bit like a like a wagon wheel.

181
00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:49.650
And the interesting thing is that what the roots of unity are actually doing is finding evenly spaced

182
00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:53.610
lines that go all the way around the unit circle like this.

183
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.170
So we can try this for how about seven.

184
00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:02.740
So now it turns out that all seven of these lines are equally far apart from each other.

185
00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:11.820
So that means if this were a pizza and you cut this into four or sorry seven slices then using the seven

186
00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:21.660
roots of unity will give you exactly equally spaced slices the exercise for this video is to produce

187
00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:23.200
a picture that looks like this.

188
00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:24.420
And isn't this beautiful.

189
00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.580
I think this looks really nice.

190
00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:29.610
It has a bit of a kind of seashell like Fibonacci.

191
00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:33.160
Kind of look to it and the colors go from black to white.

192
00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.580
I just think this looks really beautiful.

193
00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:37.020
So how did I create this.

194
00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:44.460
Well of course I use the end roots of unity and then there's one tiny addition to the formula that you've

195
00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:45.060
been working with.

196
00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.570
So actually let me just make sure this is really clear.

197
00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:55.380
So I generated this block by taking a formula that looks something like this except I modified it somehow.

198
00:13:55.390 --> 00:14:02.100
Now if you would like to figure out how I modified it and basically produce this plot on your own without

199
00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:07.380
me giving you any hints then now is your last opportunity to pause the video I am about to give you

200
00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:15.460
a hint The hint is exactly the formula that you need to apply to get this thing to look like this.

201
00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:17.730
Okay so here is the hint.

202
00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:24.990
Essentially all you do is you take this exact same K number here and you also multiply the entire expression

203
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:25.470
by k.

204
00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:31.770
So now K is this extra multiplicative term in front of the exponent.

205
00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:32.070
All right.

206
00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:37.910
So if you needed that hint then now you can pause video and go back and keep working on python.

207
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:44.490
Now I am going to switch to Python and show you my solution and let's see.

208
00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:51.000
I think I will start with I'm going to put this in a new cell but I'm going to start with this same

209
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.580
code because it's kind of look pretty similar.

210
00:14:53.580 --> 00:15:00.720
So what we need to do is multiply by K outside here and let's already see how this looks.

211
00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:04.100
Okay so this you can kind of see it's going in the right direction.

212
00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:10.020
The lines are spinning around and they're getting longer as they go around and let's see let's get rid

213
00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:11.890
of this.

214
00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.860
And I'm also going to turn off the axis axis off.

215
00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:19.020
Okay so this is looking a little bit better.

216
00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:22.610
Let's try and equals How about 50.

217
00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:27.360
Right now this is starting to look a bit like a colorful seashell.

218
00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.950
I'm gonna set this even higher to 200.

219
00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:31.380
All right.

220
00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:42.100
Looking better I want to make this line a little bit thicker so I can say line width equals to okay.

221
00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:45.490
So now this is almost done except for the color.

222
00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:52.180
So the way that I went about specifying this color is to start from black and then go up to not exactly

223
00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:52.420
white.

224
00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:56.580
If you go up to exactly white it gets invisible because the background is white.

225
00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:02.350
So the way that I solved this is actually let me show you a kind of simpler way.

226
00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:09.910
So you could write something like this color equals and then in a list you could say K divided by n

227
00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:11.470
k divided.

228
00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:16.310
K divided by an and K divided by n.

229
00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:17.840
Now this kind of works.

230
00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:22.960
It does start black and it gets lighter and lighter and maybe you think it looks better this way because

231
00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:28.670
it fades smoothly into the sort of white ether of non-existence.

232
00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:34.300
But I actually prefer to stop when it's still grey so I get a clear horizontal line here.

233
00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:42.600
So again that is just my personal preference so I'm going to create a variable that goes from Lynn space

234
00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:46.800
it goes from zero up to point nine in n steps.

235
00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:51.190
And so that means that here this ends up being color.

236
00:16:51.190 --> 00:17:02.680
So the K element of color cave element of color and the K element of color so now you can see that stops

237
00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:03.610
when it's still gray.

238
00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:08.520
And if you want it to be more gray you can set this to be for example point three.

239
00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:11.390
And now that one doesn't look really good.

240
00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.730
But anyway you get the idea.

241
00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.060
Of course you're welcome to play around with these colors.

242
00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:18.410
It's pretty interesting to see what you can do.

243
00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:26.800
For example if you would fix the green value to be three then you get one that starts black and then

244
00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:33.640
it goes into this kind of lavender dark purple into a kind of lavender ish purple the very last thing

245
00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:39.850
I would like to point out in this video is that sometimes things can get a little bit confusing with

246
00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:47.440
variable names and property names because notice I set this variable this vector to be color but then

247
00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.990
I used it in here right after color.

248
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:55.780
So this color here is a keyword that the plot function is looking for.

249
00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.590
And I called the variable name color as well.

250
00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:05.730
Now I have to say I generally don't recommend setting your variables to be names that are also properties.

251
00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:09.070
It can be a little bit confusing for exactly this reason.

252
00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:12.590
So that's why I showed it to you.

253
00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:13.210
All right.

254
00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:15.640
This is a really fun video for me to make.

255
00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.560
I hope you enjoyed it as well.

256
00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:22.660
You learned about the roots of unity and you learn to make beautiful plots in Python.
