1
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:10,160
I know I know you've been waiting the entire section of this course just for this moment the opportunity

2
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:15,500
to go through the calculus bug hunt and now is your opportunity.

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:22,700
If you haven't already paused the video work through all of this code find the errors in each one of

4
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,730
these cells.

5
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,400
And don't forget that there could be Python errors.

6
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:31,730
There could also be some math errors that are not explicitly coding errors but still not really the

7
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,310
right thing to do.

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:33,620
All right.

9
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:40,700
So now I'm going to go through each of these cells and fortunately there's already a bunch of libraries

10
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,070
that are already imported for us here.

11
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,360
So let's just start going through and see what we can do.

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:47,810
All right.

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,570
So we get an error.

14
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:55,040
This says X and Y must have the same first dimension but shapes are two hundred and one.

15
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:00,130
So it's definitely a line with or a problem with this line of code.

16
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,640
So let's see that one is here and I can already see the problem.

17
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:11,350
The problem is that here we've specified f of x as a simple object.

18
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:16,880
Here we convert that simple object into a function that we can call and evaluate.

19
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:26,490
But that has to be evaluated at specific points and those I guess correspond to the X Range variable.

20
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,170
Let's see.

21
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:27,530
All right.

22
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,950
So this looks pretty good.

23
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,600
It's a pretty interesting looking function.

24
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:37,440
Let's see next one here we are trying to compute the limit of this function here.

25
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:43,170
So 1 over x plus three at the limit point of minus three.

26
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:49,460
So that's pretty interesting because when x equals minus three then the denominator is going to be zero.

27
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:56,700
So looks like we are trying to compute the limit for variable X function f of x or if X at the limit

28
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:56,930
point.

29
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,430
Coming from the positive direction.

30
00:01:59,540 --> 00:01:59,810
Okay.

31
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,010
So let's see what happens.

32
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,900
Oh so we get an error.

33
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,660
Can't convert expression to float that's over here.

34
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,120
I see the problem the formatting string Here is G.

35
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:16,380
Which means that we are telling Python that we are going to give it a number of floating point number

36
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,640
but actually limit is the output of a simple high function.

37
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,830
So in fact this is a symbolic variable.

38
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:31,270
So we have to use s here O K so now we get this but not really sure what to make of this.

39
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:38,750
The limit as x goes to minus three from the plus side can't really be X. It doesn't make any sense.

40
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:44,770
I think we're not really going to understand what's going on here until we can visualize this function

41
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,140
and see what it looks like.

42
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,600
So let me make a plot of this.

43
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:57,070
I'm gonna say P equals Sim dot plodding dot plot and then effects.

44
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:03,840
And now I will say show equals false and then P does show here.

45
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,150
Okay.

46
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:11,140
So can't really see what's going on although you can kind of already guess that at X equals minus 3.

47
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,790
This function is gonna blow up to infinity and down to minus infinity.

48
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:16,440
So let's see.

49
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:23,590
I'm just going to make this I'm going to zoom in on the y axis a little bit so y Lim equals minus 10

50
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,190
plus 10.

51
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:25,630
All right.

52
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:29,390
So now we get a better sense of what's going on in this function.

53
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:36,160
So when we approach minus three from the positive direction then it looks like this function is blowing

54
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,010
up to plus infinity all the way up here.

55
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,840
So why do we get this X.

56
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,810
Maybe there's something wrong with Howard setting the endpoints here.

57
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,890
Let's see.

58
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:49,210
I'm gonna press shift tab to see the help file here.

59
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:55,740
And this says ah compute the limit of e is the expression at point Z 0.

60
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:56,890
And variables that.

61
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,500
Okay.

62
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:01,660
So we actually just have these inputs in the wrong order.

63
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:06,370
So it should be the function first and then the variable.

64
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,180
Aha.

65
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:13,370
And now we get that the limit is who this is actually the simple way of expressing infinity.

66
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,510
So I'm gonna convert this into later latex and now this looks better.

67
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,200
All right.

68
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,040
And this is also consistent with the plot here.

69
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:30,550
So whenever you're looking at these functions you should definitely make visualizations of these calculus

70
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,380
functions.

71
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:38,710
This is a huge advantage of using Python for helping you figure out math because it's really easy to

72
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,750
generate this plot for.

73
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,820
Well I mean this is a pretty easy function you could have done this by hand but if it's a more complicated

74
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:51,880
function with some polynomials embedded in here it's not really feasible to plot out any arbitrary function

75
00:04:51,910 --> 00:05:00,160
by hand but putting it into simplify or NUM pi then you can make a plot and get an immediate sense of

76
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,960
what's going on with that function anyway moving along.

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,380
Let's see.

78
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,330
Oh there's already an error there's this red text that's just screaming at me to fix something.

79
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:17,920
Okay so here is a closing parenthesis but this is an opening square brackets so I can already see that

80
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,080
that is a problem.

81
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,260
Now clearly it's not the only problem.

82
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,440
There's still something else going on with this function.

83
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,810
Oh I see what it is.

84
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,750
You see we're actually giving this piece wise function.

85
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:37,000
1 1 2 3 inputs but these two inputs actually belong together.

86
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,560
This is the piece 1.

87
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:44,440
So the first function and the boundary conditions for that function.

88
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:50,650
So this all has to be in a tuple like that oh still get an error.

89
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,090
What is the problem here.

90
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:56,620
Well the problem is happening on this line which is this line here.

91
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,610
So let's see we have this function F of X..

92
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,610
That's our piece Y's function.

93
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:07,430
And then we are converting it to an evaluate able function with simple lambda Fi.

94
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,680
That part's fine.

95
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:16,140
And we are inputting the oh this is the symbolic variable X. We actually want to input a num pi array.

96
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:19,160
So that should be X X here.

97
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,530
Hey we got it.

98
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,150
This is a pretty neat looking function.

99
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:25,660
It's like some cartoon surf or something.

100
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,400
All right.

101
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:31,010
So the first and second derivatives of sign of X..

102
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,290
Okay so here we have the function sign.

103
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,600
And now notice there's no simple objects in here.

104
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,220
This is all with NUM pi.

105
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:45,310
So none pi dot diff is just computing the discrete temporal difference.

106
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:51,190
So this will compute the first derivative and then I guess this is the second derivative because it

107
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,770
says second derivative.

108
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,090
And here's a two let's confirm that here.

109
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,740
So this is a.

110
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:05,520
So the discrete difference and then N equals 1 Let's see what it says about n so n is an integer and

111
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,550
it's the number of times that the values are different.

112
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:09,150
Okay.

113
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:14,080
So that means that this is the discrete version of the second derivative.

114
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,730
So let's see what we get here.

115
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,020
All right.

116
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,660
So there is an error here.

117
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,500
Let's see.

118
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:20,820
Okay.

119
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:25,810
So we do get one plot so that at least tells us that something is going right.

120
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:31,830
This says X and Y must have the same dimensions but they have shapes two hundred and one ninety nine.

121
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:40,260
So and again that's happening on this line here showing the first derivative here and now the problem

122
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:47,880
here the issue is that computing the discrete difference means that you end up with N minus one points.

123
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:56,740
So therefore we can only actually consider the x axis values from zero up to the penultimate point.

124
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,100
Okay.

125
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,200
Now we're getting another error and it's actually on the next line.

126
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:03,220
So here we have the same exact issues.

127
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:06,110
So this should go from zero.

128
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:12,030
So from the first index up to minus two all right.

129
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,990
So now we get the plot.

130
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,910
We don't see any errors however.

131
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:19,090
These lines don't quite look right to me.

132
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:22,970
And in particular they're way too small these derivatives are way too small.

133
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:30,750
Because remember that there's this cyclic nature of the derivatives of all the trig functions and there's

134
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,780
nothing in there about them getting smaller and smaller with each successive derivative.

135
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:42,280
And actually what's happening here is that we are only computing d y but what we really want is D Y

136
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:43,570
by D X.

137
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:47,170
So therefore what we need to do is divide d y.

138
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:53,080
We will do it here divide D Y by D X which is actually called D.T..

139
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:59,350
Here it's maybe a little bit confusing but in time series analysis and time series data people often

140
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:03,460
call this d t before where the T is for time.

141
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:11,710
Okay so that looks much better for D.T. and now we need to do this for d d y which is the second derivative

142
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,430
of D.

143
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:13,780
Mm hmm.

144
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:19,870
But it still looks a little bit small actually what we need to do is say the second derivative divided

145
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:23,410
by D.T. or D X squared.

146
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,390
And the reason is that we are computing the difference twice.

147
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:30,810
Now I just made a little typo that's supposed to be asterisk asterisk.

148
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,870
All right.

149
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,570
And now this looks good.

150
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:37,410
I'm going to call this a successful completion.

151
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:37,780
All right.

152
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,270
Let's see now we have another point here.

153
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:44,470
So we are trying to compute critical points using simple.

154
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:51,180
So it looks like we have two functions here or sorry one function and a symbolic variable x.

155
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,470
And then let's see what this looks like.

156
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:54,760
Okay.

157
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:59,690
So this is the function derivative and the critical points are zero.

158
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:07,810
Now critical points are defined by the derivative crossing zero or if the derivative is undefined for

159
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,660
example if it's minus infinity.

160
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:16,390
Now in this case it looks like the or not it looks like it's quite clear that the derivative crosses

161
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,540
zero at three points.

162
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:22,270
So why is only this point being indicated.

163
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,770
Well let's see here.

164
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:31,330
So we compute the derivative and then we find the critical points by solving for where the derivative

165
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,350
is equal to zero.

166
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:38,140
This should say D affects because we want where the derivative is equal to zero.

167
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:38,560
All right.

168
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,100
And then we get the right answer very cool.

169
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:45,380
It looks like we are on the last problem here.

170
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:51,590
The last bit of code so this says compute the area between two curves not the same thing as between

171
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,280
two ferns.

172
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:52,540
OK.

173
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:58,610
I think whoever wrote this code is trying to make a little joke between two ferns is like this YouTube

174
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,800
comedy thing you can look it up if you want.

175
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:09,680
Anyway so I ran this cell and we don't get any coding errors and we do see this interesting shaded region

176
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,450
here between these two functions.

177
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:19,130
Let's see this function is cosine and so the blue line corresponds to cosine and the orange line corresponds

178
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:21,380
to the function X..

179
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,890
Now I don't see anything explicitly wrong here but I think this is an error of omission.

180
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:35,060
In particular the instruction says compute the area between the two curves but nowhere in here is the

181
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,070
area actually computed.

182
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:41,390
So let's do that let's compute the area between these two curves.

183
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,170
These two functions in this shaded region.

184
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:51,320
So that is going to be between zero and this intersection point whatever that intersection point happens

185
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,610
to be.

186
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:58,550
Well fortunately we know that that intersection point is here it's given by this variable f intersect

187
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:06,380
and the way that that is computed is by finding the location of the minimum of the absolute value of

188
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,270
the difference between those two functions.

189
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:14,810
So it seems a little confusing at first although I have gone through this general formula for identifying

190
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,770
the minimum at some point in this course.

191
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:23,630
I don't remember exactly which video it was but the idea is that where these two functions intersect

192
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:26,960
is where their difference is close to zero.

193
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:32,890
So you subtract one function from the other and then take the absolute value of that.

194
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:38,900
And you can already imagine what that absolute value of difference is going to look like here at the

195
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:44,420
absolute value of the difference is large here the absolute value the difference is going to be zero.

196
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:49,000
So these two functions intersect when their difference is zero.

197
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,860
And that's essentially what we're finding here.

198
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,380
OK.

199
00:12:52,380 --> 00:13:01,140
So what I want to do is compute the area between these two functions from the boundary points of 0 or

200
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,150
whatever is the first point.

201
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:08,180
Let's see it's from zero up until the intersection point.

202
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:16,260
So these are simple objects so I'm going to use some dot integrate and then the thing that I want to

203
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:21,750
integrate is the difference between these two functions and then I'm gonna say you know the one on top

204
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,130
minus the one on bottom.

205
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:29,870
So that is f one SIM minus F two SIM.

206
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:36,490
And then the second input is a tuple that contains these symbolic variable that we're looking for.

207
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:41,820
And then the starting boundary which would be the first data points in x x.

208
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:48,270
So this x axis variable here and then the point of intersection now you have to keep in mind that this

209
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,580
point of intersection here is an index.

210
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,190
This is not the actual x value.

211
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:59,890
This is the index into the value into the vector x where this point is located.

212
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:10,310
So therefore the appropriate way to set up the upper bound is x x and then f intersect OK.

213
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:11,170
Let's see.

214
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:16,580
So I don't know what the answer is because I haven't printed it out but I don't get any errors.

215
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,220
And that was the main thing I was looking for here.

216
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,240
So I'm going to write that in the title.

217
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:33,100
So let's say the title is going to be a shaded area is percent s and then percent a.

218
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:34,430
All right.

219
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,100
The shaded area is basically point four.

220
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,470
And that also seems pretty plausible.

221
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:46,860
Just looking at the plot you can imagine if this were a straight line going up and we didn't have this

222
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:54,030
other function here or imagine this other function were constant at 1 then this whole area here including

223
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,420
this piece here that would be point five.

224
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,710
We already discovered that in a previous video.

225
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,590
So this whole area is point five.

226
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:07,340
So it's pretty plausible that this area here is point for all right.

227
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:10,620
So that concludes this book hunt.

228
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:15,390
And that means this also concludes this section of the course on calculus.

229
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,230
I hope you enjoyed it.

230
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:24,120
I hope you found it a useful supplement to your otherwise regular studies in calculus and I look forward

231
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,340
to seeing you in the next section of the course.
