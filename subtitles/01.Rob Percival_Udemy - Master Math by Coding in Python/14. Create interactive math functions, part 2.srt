00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:11,870
This video is basically a continuation of the previous video on creating functions in Python.
1

2
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:17,690
So if you're not really comfortable with the basics of creating functions in Python then you might want
2

3
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,730
to go back and re watch the previous video.
3

4
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:21,040
All right.
4

5
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,360
So here is... this is like a challenge.
5

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,780
This is a big exercise, this whole video.
6

7
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:32,270
What you want to do is create a function that will take basically three inputs and these should all
7

8
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:39,230
be user defined or user specified inputs. So you want to be able to input three numbers from the user
8

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,470
an x value and a y value.
9

10
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:48,230
So basically two numbers here. These have to be integers for now: two integers and a function switch.
10

11
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,470
So let me show you an example of what this looks like.
11

12
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,310
So Python should say input x.
12

13
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,810
And here I picked two. Input y.
13

14
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,160
And here I picked four and then Python should print out some text that looks like this.
14

15
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:09,890
It should say press 1 to compute 2 to the 4 or press 2 to compute 2 divided by 4.
15

16
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,540
So it's the same two numbers.
16

17
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:18,650
And basically we're going to specify a function switch and that's going to call either the power function
17

18
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:26,540
to take x to the power of y or the division function and that will compute x divided by Y.
18

19
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:33,350
So you can see in this case I selected 2, so then Python printed out 2 divided by 4 equals point 5.
19

20
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,560
So this is one example.
20

21
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,560
Here you see another example of this function and using this function.
21

22
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:48,710
So in this case I inputted 3 and 5, and then the instructions were to print to press either one or two.
22

23
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:54,530
But you know I don't always like listening to the instructions; I want to know what happens outside the
23

24
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,920
boundaries defined by the instructions.
24

25
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:04,490
So I press 3 but then Python gave me back this result that said invalid selection.
25

26
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,430
So I hope this is enough for you to get started.
26

27
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,050
The hint is don't try to do this all in one function.
27

28
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:16,640
You can actually create three separate functions in order to get this to work.
28

29
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:17,180
All right.
29

30
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:23,900
So what I encourage you to do now is pause the video, work your way through, make sure you can implement
30

31
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:28,470
these functions and get output that would look something like this or something like this.
31

32
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:34,190
And when you're ready to come back, then come back to the video and I'm now going to switch to Python
32

33
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:40,750
and show you how I solved this problem. Before getting into my solution.
33

34
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:47,550
I should say a few words about solving problems in Python or more generally using code.
34

35
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:55,230
There are often multiple ways to correctly solve a problem using Python or matlab or C or any other
35

36
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,740
computer language.
36

37
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:01,950
So if your solution looks different from my solution that's totally fine.
37

38
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:08,310
It's a good idea for you to pay attention to what I'm doing and maybe you can learn from how my solution
38

39
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,890
differs from your solution.
39

40
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:15,850
But as long as you get the right answer, the way that you got to that right answer really doesn't matter.
40

41
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:21,540
Okay so what I'm going to do is in this cell create the functions.
41

42
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:27,140
So I'm going to create two functions. There's going to be one called Powers and that's going to take this
42

43
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:32,190
input x and y and what's going to happen inside this function.
43

44
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:39,900
So what this function does is going to be to print out that X to the power of y equals and then whatever
44

45
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,790
x the power of y is.
45

46
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:48,090
So I'm going to use some latex coding to make sure that the printing looks good. I will write display
46

47
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,420
math.
47

48
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,580
And then it's goinbg to be x to the Y.
48

49
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,300
Now remember I'm going to be using latex coding here and in latex,
49

50
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,890
You indicate a superscript using the caret symbol like this. In Python code,
50

51
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,400
You use a double asterisk like this.
51

52
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:06,730
All right.
52

53
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:13,200
So we want this for Python so x to the Y equals and then whatever that happens to be it's gonna be let's
53

54
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,850
call it z.
54

55
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:21,060
So now that I've written out a little bit of code here; now I need to replace these with our integer
55

56
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,910
place holders that we've been using a lot.
56

57
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:27,900
So % G to the power of percent G equals percent G.
57

58
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,620
And now of course we need to replace all of the
58

59
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,970
Percent G's here with actual numbers.
59

60
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,940
There's going to be x to the power of y equals x to the power of y.
60

61
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,460
Okay.
61

62
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:46,770
So I have more functions to do but before getting to the other functions I want to test this one and
62

63
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,360
make sure that this is correct.
63

64
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:56,710
So what I'm going to do is type powers and then let's say two comma four.
64

65
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,730
Okay so we get an error message and this says name.
65

66
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,730
Math is not defined.
66

67
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:09,420
The math is this function that's being called here and possibly you already caught this before I made
67

68
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:16,050
this mistake, before this error happened. The issue here is that the display function and the math
68

69
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:22,750
function are not packaged with the default Python environment. So therefore we need to import them.
69

70
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:33,040
So from IPython dot display import display and also import math.
70

71
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,290
Okay.
71

72
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:40,230
So now I'm going to run this cell again and then I run this cell and now we get a result.
72

73
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:43,230
And furthermore, it's also the correct result which is really good.
73

74
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,900
So two to the power of four is sixteen.
74

75
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:52,990
One way you can think about this is by breaking this up into two squared times two squared.
75

76
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:58,140
And that is possible because of the law of exponents which I covered in a previous video.
76

77
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,370
So two squared is four.
77

78
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:04,440
And then two squared again is four and four times four is sixteen.
78

79
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:04,850
All right.
79

80
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:10,100
So obviously we are not yet finished this project but we're getting there.
80

81
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,350
So now I want to create the other function.
81

82
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:19,980
And that's for divisions. I'm to say def division that will also take as input x and y.
82

83
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,610
And here I'm also going to display something.
83

84
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:28,890
So I'm going to actually copy and paste. Now, whenever you copy and paste code you have to be really careful
84

85
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,520
that you're correctly changing everything that needs to be changed.
85

86
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:40,080
So now this needs to be % G and now this is going to be divided by % G.
86

87
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,980
But I want this to look like a nice fraction in latex.
87

88
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:53,640
So you might remember that to create a fraction in latex you do slash slash frac and then in the first
88

89
00:06:53,640 --> 00:07:00,600
set of curly brackets is the numerator and then the next set of curly brackets is the denominator.
89

90
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,140
Now it would be really easy to just stop there and keep going.
90

91
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,320
In fact I think I even will.
91

92
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:13,500
So now I'm going to say... I just ran this cell that runs this line and I'm going to say division here
92

93
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,800
instead of powers.
93

94
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,090
Now on the one hand this function runs.
94

95
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:18,850
So that's good.
95

96
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:26,460
We don't get any error messages or anything, but two divided by four is clearly not sixteen at least
96

97
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,230
not in our universe.
97

98
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:34,560
And the problem here is that I only changed, so I copied and pasted this code but I only changed the display
98

99
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,160
part here.
99

100
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,770
I didn't actually change the math.
100

101
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:41,430
I didn't change that computation so fortunately it's a pretty simple fix.
101

102
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,400
We just say x divided by Y.
102

103
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,710
So run this cell again.
103

104
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:51,090
Now I want to run this again just to make sure that we are really getting the right answer.
104

105
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:57,120
And you know, it's generally a good idea to test this out over and over again just to see what happens
105

106
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:59,340
and confirm that you're getting the right answer.
106

107
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:03,410
And out of curiosity I'm going to say four divided by zero.
107

108
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,160
OK here we get an error it says division by zero.
108

109
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,180
That is illegal in mathematics.
109

110
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:13,480
If you tried to do this the math police are going to come after you.
110

111
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:16,620
So I'm going to get rid of that error message as quickly as possible.
111

112
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:17,900
OK.
112

113
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,680
So we are off to a good start.
113

114
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:25,410
We've created these two functions and now I'm going to create a third function and that is going to
114

115
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:31,440
be the main function that will give the inputs and call one of these two functions depending on what
115

116
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,600
I specify for inputs.
116

117
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:39,240
So because this is the main function I'm actually going to call this main function.
117

118
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,750
Now this function doesn't actually take any inputs.
118

119
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:50,070
Instead, all of the inputs are going to be defined in or I should say the inputs into these functions
119

120
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:56,270
will be created inside this main function by inputting from the user.
120

121
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,510
So let's do that first.
121

122
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:02,510
Let's say I get input from user and I write a helpful comment here.
122

123
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:15,120
So X equals int input and let's just say input x and then I will copy and paste here and then we get
123

124
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:25,500
Y and then we also need a switch variable so we can think about calling this switch and let's see that's
124

125
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,600
also going to be an input.
125

126
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:36,030
So let's say input which algorithm to compute.
126

127
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,350
So again now this function doesn't really do a whole lot yet.
127

128
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:47,220
It just inputs these variables but I would like to run this function just to make sure that it hasn't
128

129
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,540
produced any errors yet.
129

130
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:55,320
So let's call this main function. We see input x I'll call that five; input y let's say three.
130

131
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,670
Which algorithm to compute.
131

132
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,670
Well you know we don't know anything yet.
132

133
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,960
So I'll just do this big number here.
133

134
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:05,150
But actually this isn't really what I wrote in the slides in the slides.
134

135
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,750
I showed that it should print out
135

136
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:13,530
nice looking text that gives the two options for whether to compute this or whether to compute this.
136

137
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:23,510
So in fact, before getting this input from the user I would like to display a nice message. So display
137

138
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,610
math.
138

139
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:34,970
And then this should say Press one to compute and then I'm actually just going to copy and paste from
139

140
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:35,450
here
140

141
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:47,210
or press two to compute and then I can copy and paste from here all right.
141

142
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,870
So we're getting a lot of percent G's in here.
142

143
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:56,800
So you have to be really careful that we are keeping track of all of these. So let's see.
143

144
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,480
So actually it's not so hard the first three.
144

145
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,250
Oh and you don't... actually, I don't want to give the answer right away.
145

146
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:06,760
I just want to give the options, so let's get rid of these equals signs here.
146

147
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,990
So this is actually easier.
147

148
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:11,550
We just need X Y and this one is also x y.
148

149
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:17,440
So X comma Y and X comma Y... oops so we need a comma in here.
149

150
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,650
And then I think we don't need this whole message.
150

151
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:25,210
We can just give a space for the user to input.
151

152
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:25,510
All right.
152

153
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:31,450
So I'm going to run this cell to run this function again.
153

154
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,030
And now I'm going to run I'm going to call this function again.
154

155
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,080
So far this isn't going to actually compute any of these things.
155

156
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,810
I just want to make sure that it's working up until this point.
156

157
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:47,980
That's always a good idea when writing code to check that your code is working at each step of the way.
157

158
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,250
All right.
158

159
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,370
So I'll just say three here and five here.
159

160
00:11:51,710 --> 00:12:00,190
Whoops and I already get an error. OK so I actually had to pause the video and look at this for a good
160

161
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:03,840
10 seconds before I figured out what was actually going wrong.
161

162
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,700
This was a really simple mistake.
162

163
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:13,540
I just had this parentheses in the wrong place, this percent sign and all of this business.
163

164
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,800
These replacements for the percent, they need to go immediately after this
164

165
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,520
end quote here.
165

166
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:23,540
So in fact it just needs to go there be parentheses was in the wrong place.
166

167
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:23,780
All right.
167

168
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,710
So let's try this again.
168

169
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:31,800
And so let's try three and two and this kind of looks OK.
169

170
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,100
OK.
170

171
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:38,080
Let me just finish running this except this is in italics and there's no spaces in here.
171

172
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,960
So it looks a little bit awkward.
172

173
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:48,860
Now what we need to do here is tell latex to print out this stuff like normal text, here it's trying to
173

174
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:53,300
print it out like variables and it's ignoring the spaces.
174

175
00:12:53,300 --> 00:13:00,950
So we write slash slash text and then in curly brackets everything we want to make as text.
175

176
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,110
So let me just show you what this looks like.
176

177
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:11,570
So I input four and three and now this part looks good here, and this part doesn't look good here.
177

178
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:21,680
So we need more text so slash slash text or press 2 to compute and then another end curly bracket.
178

179
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,220
So
179

180
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:29,400
let's input about just three and two.
180

181
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:36,160
Now it says press 1 to compute three to the power of two or plus press two to compute three divided
181

182
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,140
by two.
182

183
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:38,560
All right.
183

184
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,870
So this is looking good.
184

185
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:43,270
We are almost finished here.
185

186
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:50,560
The last thing we need to do is call either the powers function or the division function, or print out
186

187
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:56,740
an invalid selection warning message, depending on the value of switch.
187

188
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,390
So for this we need an if statement.
188

189
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:09,580
So if switch equals, now up here I converted the variable x that was input it from a string into an integer.
189

190
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,970
And likewise here for y but here I didn't.
190

191
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,160
So in fact switch is going to be a string.
191

192
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,950
It's not going to be a [number] variable.
192

193
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:22,750
So this should say 1 like this the string one, not the number one.
193

194
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:34,920
So if the switch input was 1 then we called Powers X comma Y and here we say else if or else if switch
194

195
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:46,050
was equal to two if we input two, then we call Division inputting X comma Y else.
195

196
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,020
So if neither of these is true.
196

197
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:54,630
So if switched does not equal one and if it does not equal two, then the result is we will print out
197

198
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:58,140
invalid selection.
198

199
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:58,670
All right.
199

200
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:59,010
Okay.
200

201
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:04,250
Three exclamation points is probably a little bit overkill.
201

202
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:09,800
So I'm going to run that cell to recompile all this code and I'm going to type.
202

203
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,950
Main function.
203

204
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:18,130
I'm going to press control enter and let's try this with the code that are the numbers that I used in
204

205
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:18,500
the slide.
205

206
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:26,050
So 2 and 4 and we press 1 and we get two to the power of 4 is 16.
206

207
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:26,750
Brilliant.
207

208
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:34,980
Now I want to try 2 and 4 and I'm going to press 2 and we should get that 2 divided by 4 is 1 1/2.
208

209
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:42,830
And finally I'm going to say 2 and 4 and let's say 3 and we get invalid selection.
209

210
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,480
Very nice.
210

211
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:53,860
The last thing I want to cover in this video is how to change this from integers into any other number
211

212
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,390
that can have a decimal point.
212

213
00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:02,860
And as a reminder of how this will crash I'm going to say two point three instead of two and we already
213

214
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,050
get an error.
214

215
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,130
Okay so turns out that the solution here is pretty straightforward.
215

216
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:16,750
We just type float instead of int. So float is a different class of number, int is for integer.
216

217
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,950
And those are just whole numbers like 1 2 3 4 and so on.
217

218
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:28,050
Float is for floating point numbers and that means that they can have a decimal point in them.
218

219
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:35,830
So now we're going to run this cell again run this cell again and let's see two point three to the power
219

220
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:38,320
of four point one.
220

221
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:44,950
Okay so now we get the option to choose two point three of the power four point one or this thing and
221

222
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:51,180
let's say I'm going to press 1 because I'm quite curious what in the world this number is going to be.
222

223
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:51,750
All right.
223

224
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:58,010
So two point three to the power of four point one is thirty point four one for seven.
224

225
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:02,100
Pretty interesting piece of knowledge to have.
225

226
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:02,660
Great.
226

227
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:10,870
So I hope you are starting to feel more confident in your ability to create and use functions in python
227

228
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:15,310
as a way to help you learn mathematics. In the next video,
228

229
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:19,030
we are going to create a game using functions.
229

230
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:22,960
It's going to be really exciting and I look forward to seeing you then.
