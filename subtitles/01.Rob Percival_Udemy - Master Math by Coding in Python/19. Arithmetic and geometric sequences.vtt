00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:10.640
In this video I'm going to tell you about arithmetic sequences and geometric sequences.

2
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.790
There are formulas associated with each of these two kinds of sequences and you are going to get to

3
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.510
practice in this video.

4
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:25.430
One of the most important skills in programming and mathematics which is converting a mathematical formula

5
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.660
into a bunch of code so let me begin by just talking about a sequence.

6
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.260
Well a sequence is actually really simple.

7
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.870
It's just an ordered list of numbers.

8
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.540
And if you're thinking that this is too general of a definition then.

9
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.910
Well I mean that is kind of the idea.

10
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.010
A sequence is just an ordered list of numbers.

11
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.840
You can come up with your own sequences.

12
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.640
There are many many many mathematical sequences out there.

13
00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:01.080
And in this video I'm going to introduce you to two kinds of sequences arithmetic and geometric.

14
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:09.660
So the blue series of squares here shows an arithmetic sequence and the orange sequence here shows a

15
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.210
geometric sequence.

16
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.690
Now you can already see the difference.

17
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.820
This orange squares sequence is getting bigger with each step.

18
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.140
So there's clearly going to be some kind of a power function in here and the blue sequence so the arithmetic

19
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.390
sequence is just getting a little bit bigger on each step in fact this is a linear step.

20
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.150
So that's what these two sequences look like.

21
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.340
Here's what the formulas are.

22
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:43.790
The arithmetic sequence is you say that the end term in this sequence a the end term is defined as a

23
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:52.190
zero sometimes is called a not so a not which is actually the first number plus D times the quantity

24
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.530
and minus one.

25
00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:00.710
D is a parameter that you can specify and you'll get to explore in the code how this parameter changes

26
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:07.010
the sequence and a not or a zero is whatever is the first number that you pick for the sequence.

27
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.290
So the sequence doesn't need to start at 1.

28
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.960
In this case I'm having both of these sequences start at 1 but you can have them start any number you

29
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.380
like.

30
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.010
They can be 1 or 3 they can start at 14 quadrillion whatever you want.

31
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.270
All right so that is the arithmetic sequence.

32
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.460
And here we have the geometric sequence so you can see that some aspects of this geometric sequence

33
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.160
formula are similar to the formula for the arithmetic sequence.

34
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:43.040
That's also a good skill in mathematics to be able to look at two formulas or multiple formulas and

35
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.300
pick apart what is similar and what is different between them.

36
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:55.640
So the end element of the geometric sequence just like the element of the arithmetic sequence is the

37
00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:03.170
initial numbers so the first number you pick and then it's some parameter and then it's N minus one.

38
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.850
Now the difference is that here you're saying plus D times and minus one.

39
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:13.550
And here you're saying G not times are to the power of N minus one.

40
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:20.240
So these two formulas have some things in common and they also also differ in important ways.

41
00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.930
All right.

42
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.180
So what we're gonna do now is switch to Python and basically write out these formulas and generate a

43
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:34.390
couple of sequences and and then reproduce this plot to do all of that we are going to use the number

44
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.880
pi module and the mat plot lib dot pi plot module.

45
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.170
So let's begin.

46
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.290
I'm going to define the parameters.

47
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.450
So a equals so this is going to be a zero.

48
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.620
So the number that we start with and in the slides I showed it was 1.

49
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.300
But maybe now I'll show it as to just for a little bit of variety and then we had D and let's just start

50
00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.400
with D equals 3 and see what those numbers look like.

51
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.830
Now sequences go up to some number of numbers.

52
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:11.220
So I'm gonna call that number or that parameter Max n and let's go up to 10.

53
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.400
So this is going to correspond to the largest n that you saw in this formula in the slide.

54
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.640
So now let's start by creating the arithmetic sequence.

55
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.870
So I will call this Ari seek for arithmetic sequence.

56
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.570
Now that formula was a not so in the formula was a not.

57
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:40.500
But here I'm calling that variable a plus D times and then we want to have the numbers N minus one.

58
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:46.500
So this actually works out pretty conveniently with the way that Python counts because when we start

59
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.560
counting here from zero that actually corresponds to and minus one.

60
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.170
So let me write this out and I will explain what that means.

61
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.380
So a range 0 2 max.

62
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:07.350
And so this term here and let me print this out here so you can see we have Max and is 10 and then num

63
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:15.900
PI that range is going to list numbers from 0 which we specified here up to 1 minus the second input

64
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:16.910
which is Max n.

65
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.700
And this turns out to be our vector of N minus one.

66
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:30.300
And that's because the first element and Ari seek is going to be d times 1 minus 1 which is 0.

67
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.710
Let's see what this looks like.

68
00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.450
So print Ari seek.

69
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.660
Okay so that's pretty interesting we can see the effect of a.

70
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.760
So let's try making a some different numbers.

71
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.070
I'm going to start with how about zero.

72
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.960
So now we start with zero and we can start with 10.

73
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.500
And now we start with 10.

74
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.180
So that's what this value does this parameter of a.

75
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.350
And now let's look at this D parameter.

76
00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:00.300
Now I didn't really explain in the slides what the function of D is.

77
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:06.320
And that's because I wanted you to be able to discover this on your own using Python.

78
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:12.960
And in fact that is one of the main advantages of using python as a tool to learn mathematics.

79
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.390
You can stare at an equation on a piece of paper until your face turns blue.

80
00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:22.830
But that's not going to guarantee that you really understand all of the parameters and all the features

81
00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:23.970
of the equation.

82
00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:30.000
But as soon as you can simulate an equation in Python then you can immediately start playing around

83
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.520
with the parameters and see what effects they have on the results.

84
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:43.110
So D is 3 and now you can see that these numbers are skipping in three so that leads me to an apotheosis

85
00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:49.870
that the effect of D is to just define the skipping rate here.

86
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:54.620
And so to test that hypothesis I'm gonna try a couple of different values for D.

87
00:06:54.630 --> 00:07:01.700
So for example if we go to if we start from two then we have ten twelve fourteen.

88
00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:11.670
How about when do we start at one and set D to be seven then we have one eight 17 twenty two.

89
00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.800
Okay so this seems pretty legit.

90
00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:19.010
It seems like this parameter d is actually defining the skipping parameter.

91
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:24.210
Now when you look at this formula it's also not really that surprising that that's the effect but I

92
00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:28.440
think it's also nice to be able to explore this empirically.

93
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.760
In addition to looking at a formula.

94
00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:34.840
OK so that was the arithmetic sequence.

95
00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.240
Now let's implement the geometric sequence.

96
00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.850
So how about a equals two.

97
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:46.880
And now is that are to be equal to threes or kind of starting off the same way we started here.

98
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.040
So I'll call this g geo seek.

99
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.980
Now this one was a times.

100
00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:57.780
Times are to the power of it then it was the same things.

101
00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:05.420
I'm going to copy and paste that down here and then print out geo seek.

102
00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:05.760
Wow.

103
00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:13.890
So these numbers get really big really fast so it still starts off at 2 as predicted based on this a

104
00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:18.120
being a not so let's see what happens when we start at zero.

105
00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:18.740
Mm hmm.

106
00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:19.540
That's interesting.

107
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:22.390
Then we get an entire vector full of zeros.

108
00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:26.220
Now that didn't happen over here and looking at the formula.

109
00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:30.940
That's not really surprising because here we have a plus this.

110
00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:34.290
And here we have a times this of a zero.

111
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.650
Then of course all of this is going to become zero.

112
00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:44.070
So now in a equals one it's also fairly easy to figure out what is our parameter means.

113
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:48.480
So when a is one in a sense we're just ignoring this a term altogether.

114
00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:55.680
So then this geometric sequence becomes increasing powers of three so three nine twenty seven eighty

115
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.790
one of course is three to the power of four and so on.

116
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:07.640
So now we can set out to be two and see that these numbers are is basically two to two increasing powers.

117
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:14.520
So now when both of these parameters are set to two then essentially what we have here is the number

118
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:20.660
two to increasing powers and then all of these numbers are scaled up by two.

119
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:20.970
All right.

120
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:25.050
So what I want to do now is set both of these to have the same parameter.

121
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.570
Let's go back to 2 and 3.

122
00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:32.820
So let's see I'll run this run that you can see these numbers are quite different.

123
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.000
Well of course the first number is the same.

124
00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:38.000
In fact the second number is almost same.

125
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.670
But then they start to diverge increasingly.

126
00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:45.450
And now what I'm going to do is generate a plot that shows both of them.

127
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:54.360
So let's start by plotting the arithmetic sequence and let's make this how about black squares and this

128
00:09:54.360 --> 00:10:05.070
will get a label of arithmetic and then we say P L tee it up plot geos seek and let's make this red

129
00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:12.100
circles and the label here will be geo metric.

130
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:14.490
All right so let's see how this looks.

131
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:22.420
Oh I need to activate the legend and then appeal to that show.

132
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:30.570
Well this grows so fast that it's even difficult to see that the black squares so the arithmetic sequence

133
00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:32.840
is even increasing at all.

134
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:38.870
Maybe we should try running this again with a max and of how about six.

135
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:46.680
What you want to do in this exercise is to confirm that the tenth term in an arithmetic and geometric

136
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:51.010
sequence matches for indexing and for direct computation.

137
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:52.640
So what do I mean by that.

138
00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:59.530
So essentially what you want to do is implement these two equations which we actually already just did.

139
00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:04.130
So you can really just do a bit of copying and pasting and let's say you set the max.

140
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:13.280
And to be 10 now you could find the six element by indexing into that factor of ten elements.

141
00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:18.580
So you say you know we get 10 A's in the sequence and what is the six A.

142
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:24.330
Or you could just implement this formula directly only for the end that you were interested in.

143
00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:28.860
So for six without generating the entire sequence.

144
00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:35.790
Now it's not going to be a big surprise that those two numbers will match but it is still good practice

145
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:44.460
to do this because this will help train you on indexing and converting formulas into code in Python.

146
00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:44.750
All right.

147
00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:49.710
So now is your opportunity to switch to Python and work through this exercise.

148
00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:54.000
And then I'm going to switch to Python now and show you how I solved it.

149
00:11:55.700 --> 00:12:02.720
So I am going to start by copying and pasting some of this code here.

150
00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:04.670
So let's see.

151
00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:13.590
First we specify the parameters and I'll keep two and three and I'll set Max and to be 10.

152
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:20.240
And now we need to figure out what is the number what is the element that we want to compute and also

153
00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.010
to index and I'll call it variable.

154
00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:28.720
And and I will write six here because I don't know that's the number that I said in the slides.

155
00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:28.990
OK.

156
00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:34.580
So then I'm going to compute the sequences.

157
00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:41.830
So here was the arithmetic sequence and the geo metric sequence and you know what I'm gonna do here.

158
00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:45.040
I'm actually going to leave all the parameters the same.

159
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:49.940
I'm just going to modify whatever needs to be changed.

160
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:54.770
So earlier this was called R and now I'm just leaving it at D.

161
00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:55.160
OK.

162
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:59.310
So here we have the two sequences arithmetic and geometric.

163
00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:03.260
And then we want to do the direct computation.

164
00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:10.400
So by direct computation essentially we are just computing not the entire sequence but only one specific

165
00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:11.580
element.

166
00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:22.110
So I will call this variable Ari direct for arithmetic direct so that's gonna be a plus D times and

167
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:25.100
now it's almost similar to this line of code.

168
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:27.240
Except it's not a range.

169
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:33.990
We're not listing an entire set of numbers we're only listing the N minus one.

170
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:35.910
No.

171
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:44.430
So then for the GEO metric direct it's still the initial number a zero or what I call G zero in the

172
00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:45.120
slides.

173
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.530
And then here.

174
00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:47.840
This has to be times.

175
00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:55.400
And this has to be to the power of this is also by the way an important aspect of learning how to code

176
00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:58.880
mathematics in Python or any other language.

177
00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:05.750
You need to be able to see past the specific names and the variables to the underlying mathematical

178
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:06.790
concepts.

179
00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:13.940
So you need to be able to look at this line of code and map that back onto the formula that was g sub

180
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.260
N equals G not times R to the power of and minus one.

181
00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:25.290
So all the letters are different but the concept is the same the formula is fundamentally the same.

182
00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:27.620
Okay so then we want to compare.

183
00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:37.220
So we want to see whether Ari direct is the same thing as Ari seek and then we want the end element

184
00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:38.890
in this sequence.

185
00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:44.960
Now before I run this code I would like you to guess whether these two are going to be the same or whether

186
00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.190
they are going to be different.

187
00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:49.410
Let's see mm mm mm.

188
00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:52.250
So they seem to be different.

189
00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:56.310
Have I done something wrong that I make any coding mistakes here or here.

190
00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:56.760
Actually.

191
00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:02.060
What's going wrong here is that I'm indexing the six hour element.

192
00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:07.000
Number Six when really what I want is the six element.

193
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:15.500
And because Python starts counting at zero then this or I should say this is actually the seventh element

194
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:16.870
in this array.

195
00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:21.380
So we need to say F minus one and that gives us 17.

196
00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.120
In both cases.

197
00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:23.440
All right.

198
00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:34.910
So let's then try again for geo direct and geo seek and and minus one and these turned out to be the

199
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:42.000
same number in this video you learned about arithmetic sequences and geometric sequences.

200
00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:49.870
And there was also another excuse to learn about an important concept in mathematical programming which

201
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:54.460
is to be able to convert between formulas and Python code.
