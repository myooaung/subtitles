00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:12.370
The purpose of this video is to show you how to export figures that you are making in Python into your

2
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:12.970
computer.

3
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.200
So this is a nice picture but what do you do with this.

4
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.400
Maybe you want to email a picture like this to your mom but your mom doesn't know how to use Python

5
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.890
so you can't just center all this code.

6
00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.820
Instead you want to export this as let's say a PMG file.

7
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.430
So what you can do is type P ulti that save Fig.

8
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.560
The function is save Fig.

9
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:42.010
And then in single quotes you write a string that corresponds to the file name that you want to save.

10
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.480
That says so.

11
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.000
Let's call this let's call it.

12
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:56.320
This is a nice figure that PMG so you can see I'm specifying the extension directly in the file name

13
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.690
here.

14
00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.360
OK.

15
00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.970
So now I'm going to run this cell again and we actually got a little message here that says figure size

16
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.680
400 by 300.

17
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.250
So now let's see what that figure looks like.

18
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.560
Mm hmm.

19
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.620
This figure looks all white here.

20
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.670
It doesn't look like anything but that doesn't look like this.

21
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.400
These are definitely not the same.

22
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.710
So what's going on here actually is that basically anything you want to do with a particular figure

23
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.360
that code needs to come before the line of code that says plot dots show.

24
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.770
Once you run this code plot that show it's like you're basically done working on the figure and nothing

25
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.330
else can really happen.

26
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.600
So now I'm going to move these two I just exchange these two lines of code without changing anything

27
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:53.010
else and I'm going to run this cell again that generates this figure again.

28
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.150
And now here we see that figure.

29
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.680
So now it looks nice.

30
00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.200
This is the PMG file that I loaded up from my computer.

31
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.680
Now let's have a look at this thing so we can zoom in.

32
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.220
You can see it's getting pixilated as you zoom in.

33
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.160
So the letters are kind of fuzzy.

34
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:11.080
It's not really very crisp anymore.

35
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.650
Now maybe that's OK.

36
00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.010
Or maybe you want to have higher resolution.

37
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:25.420
So what you can do then is save it not as a PMG which is a lossy format but for example as a PDA if

38
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.270
where all of these numbers get represented as text and everything will be crisper.

39
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.770
So let me show you that.

40
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.070
OK.

41
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:41.590
So now here's how this looks on loading it up in a PDA viewer from my computer.

42
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.110
Now look how close we can zoom in and you can see that it's still really crisp.

43
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.210
We still get a lot of detail here.

44
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.500
Even in this line here.

45
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:59.230
In fact this figure looks to be even more highly detailed than how it looks on my computer screen here

46
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.590
in Python.

47
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:07.690
There are additional options for saving graphics onto your computer if you put the cursor inside the

48
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.680
parentheses and press shift tab on the keyboard.

49
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:17.250
That's going to open up this help file and then you can read a little bit about some of the other options

50
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:24.490
for example if you want to adjust the orientation of the page or make the background transparent all

51
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.010
kinds of options that you can have here.

52
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.940
But the main purpose of this video was to show you the way to export graphics that you're producing

53
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:40.320
in Python into files that you can save on your computer like pages or PDA FS.
