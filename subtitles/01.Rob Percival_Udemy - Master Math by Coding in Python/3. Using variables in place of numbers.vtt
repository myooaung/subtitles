00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:09.790
Now that you know the basics of using python as a calculator it's time to take your skills to the next
1

2
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:10.470
level.
2

3
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:18.640
And that's going to be done by creating variables in python. A variable is a letter or a set of letters
3

4
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.370
that is a place holder for a number and I'll show you what that means on the next slide and in a few
4

5
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.290
moments in Python.
5

6
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:33.190
In this video, you are also going to get to see how to print multiple answers in the same cell of code.
6

7
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.080
And if that doesn't really make sense yet what this means and why that's useful then don't worry.
7

8
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.060
This will all become clearer in a few moments.
8

9
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:48.640
Now first let me explain what I mean by variables in Python. You can use variables as placeholders
9

10
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.750
for numbers.
10

11
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.170
For example you can say that the variable x equals the number four.
11

12
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.850
So whenever you see X in an equation you simply replace that with four.
12

13
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.200
So for example x plus five equals nine.
13

14
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.980
And this statement is true because x equals four.
14

15
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:14.140
Likewise I can say X divided by two which really means four divided by two equals two.
15

16
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.130
Now in these very simple cases you can say that using a variable really isn't necessary.
16

17
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.420
And that's true for these very simple cases.
17

18
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:29.440
But as you move to more and more sophisticated and advanced applications and mathematics, variables are
18

19
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.420
going to become increasingly important.
19

20
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:32.760
OK.
20

21
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.840
So let's switch to Python and see how to create variables and assign them to be numbers
21

22
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.540
it's actually very simple and very straightforward.
22

23
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.920
All you do is type the letter that you want to use, the variable, and you say equals seven.
23

24
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.180
So now I can say X equals seven.
24

25
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.930
I'm gonna run this cell of code by pressing control enter.
25

26
00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.580
Now notice that nothing happened.
26

27
00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.710
This was a little bit different from the previous video where you saw that I implemented some equation
27

28
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.060
and the number,
28

29
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.630
the result of the equation, printed out below.
29

30
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.300
In this case I'm putting a complete assignment and a complete line of code here and there's nothing
30

31
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.900
to output.
31

32
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.930
So Python doesn't do anything but I can type x all by itself in a line like this.
32

33
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.680
And now Python runs this line of code and then it sees this line of code and says well I'm not setting
33

34
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:33.130
any X to be equal to anything so I'm just going to print out the value of x, which is seven of course
34

35
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.830
because that's what I specified.
35

36
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:36.060
Okay.
36

37
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.190
So now I'm going going to press shift enter to give me a new cell.
37

38
00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.240
And now just like I showed in the slide you can use this variable in place of a number so I can say
38

39
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.430
X minus two.
39

40
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.580
Now I know that this is going to be five because seven minus two equals five.
40

41
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.100
And we confirm that in Python.
41

42
00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.570
Now what if you don't like the number seven anymore. You've changed your mind about the number seven
42

43
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.020
and you want to set X equal to some other number.
43

44
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.040
No problem.
44

45
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.900
It's really really easy.
45

46
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.780
You just reassign the value of x to be in this case 10.
46

47
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.190
So now type X again.
47

48
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:22.450
And now we get X equals 10 and it gets even better than this because I can set X to be equal itself
48

49
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.980
plus some operation.
49

50
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.120
So I'm gonna say X equals X,
50

51
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.540
itself, minus let's say two times five.
51

52
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.310
Now if we look at the right hand side of this equation we see that X is Well initially it was seven
52

53
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.520
but then I reset it to be 10.
53

54
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.070
So this is gonna be ten minus two times five which is ten.
54

55
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.820
So now the new value of X should be equal to zero.
55

56
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:55.120
And now here's something interesting I can run this cell of code again and now X is going to be equal
56

57
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.360
to minus 10.
57

58
00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:02.140
So when I first ran this line of code the value of X was changed to zero.
58

59
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.170
But now I ran it again and now X was zero.
59

60
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.930
So then this became zero minus 10.
60

61
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:16.610
So then the new value of X became zero minus ten which is minus 10 so this is for one variable x.
61

62
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.820
We can set multiple variables.
62

63
00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:24.530
So I'm gonna say x equals 10 and Y equals 20.
63

64
00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.480
So now I have two variables in the python workspace.
64

65
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.040
So now I'm gonna write X plus Y times Z.
65

66
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:40.330
Now this is interesting. I haven't yet defined any variables called Z or maybe call this letter Z.
66

67
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.980
Depending on which country you're from.
67

68
00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:48.350
So let's see what happens if I try to use a variable that I haven't defined.
68

69
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.580
So we get an error message in Python and the error message.
69

70
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.040
In this case is very useful and informative error message.
70

71
00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.260
It says the name z, so the variables z, is not defined.
71

72
00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.100
Now this error message is actually really easy to fix.
72

73
00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.470
We can create a new variable called Z and let's set it to be.
73

74
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.330
How about I know you're thinking I'm going to set it to be 30 but I'm going to do it to be 31.
74

75
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.320
Just to be a little bit different.
75

76
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:15.190
Okay.
76

77
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.730
And now we get six hundred and thirty.
77

78
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.190
There's one more thing I want to tell you about variables in this video
78

79
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:28.670
before moving on to the print function. So far in all these cases, I've been using single letters for
79

80
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:34.910
variables and that can be useful sometimes that's also consistent with how you would see variables used
80

81
00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.890
in a typical math course.
81

82
00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:45.800
But we can have more informative variables so I'm going to say for example let's say Mike equals ten and
82

83
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.420
how about... what's another good name...
83

84
00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.080
How about Spike equals thirty four.
84

85
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.580
Now there is nothing different about Mike and Spike compared to X and Y.
85

86
00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.080
There's still variables there's still place holders for these numbers.
86

87
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.790
They're just more informative. I can write Mike
87

88
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:10.820
plus Spike and that's going to give me forty four and this is really powerful because once you start
88

89
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:17.750
writing more complicated Python code you're going to want to use more informative names. So you can say
89

90
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:28.760
for example number of chocolate bars.
90

91
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:33.960
So this is a pretty informative variable name number of chocolate bars equals 10.
91

92
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:39.070
I hope that's not the number of chocolate bars you eat everyday that's a little bit unhealthy.
92

93
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:40.900
How about point five.
93

94
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:45.220
I think half of a chocolate bar per day is a pretty reasonable amount of chocolate.
94

95
00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.910
Okay so I want to go back up to this cell here.
95

96
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:57.200
I specified x y and z so we found out that X plus Y times Z equals six hundred and thirty.
96

97
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.880
And I wonder what X minus Y times that is equal to now.
97

98
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:07.910
If you're just looking at this cell, looking at the code here, you might expect two numbers to print out
98

99
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.020
six hundred and thirty and then whatever this answer ends up being.
99

100
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:16.930
However when I run this cell by pressing control enter we see only one number
100

101
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:24.030
printing out. And that is minus six hundred and ten, which corresponds to this second piece of code here.
101

102
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:31.940
So in python, in these cells, the output here is the output of the final line of code in the cell.
102

103
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:37.190
Now if you want to see both of these you can use the print function. So to use the print function you
103

104
00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:37.650
type
104

105
00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:42.590
print and then in parentheses the answer that you want to print out.
105

106
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:48.990
So here I wrote print and now I press control enter and I get this 630 answer
106

107
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.310
printed out, and then I get this printed out because this is the last line this ends up being the output
107

108
00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:56.280
of this cell.
108

109
00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:03.590
So I can also put a print function here and then we see the numbers six hundred and thirty from this
109

110
00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:09.470
line this line and six minus six hundred and ten from this line.
110

111
00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:17.570
Now notice that this is a different use of the parentheses compared to using parentheses to group numbers
111

112
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:22.090
or variables, which I already introduced you to in a previous video.
112

113
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:25.970
This is sometimes called "overloading" in programming.
113

114
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:31.450
It means that we're using the same character, or the same operator, for multiple different functions.
114

115
00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:39.400
And you have to know from context which is appropriate. Here are your two exercises for this video.
115

116
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:44.000
What you want to do is create these three variables x y and z.
116

117
00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:49.900
Set them to be 7 so x equals 7 y equals minus 2 z equals 5.
117

118
00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.810
And then you want to implement these two equations here.
118

119
00:08:52.840 --> 00:09:01.960
So 3 x times the quantity 4 plus y and then minus Y minus X plus 3 over Z.
119

120
00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:09.470
And this first equation will equal 42 which is a pretty neat number and this equation will equals zero.
120

121
00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:15.280
So now you should pause the video, switch to Python on your own and implement these two exercises.
121

122
00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:20.890
These two equations. Make sure you get the right answer and then you can come back to the video and watch
122

123
00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:23.230
me solve these problems in Python.
123

124
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:35.260
So to start with I'm going to create the three variables so we need X equals seven, Y equals minus two,
124

125
00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:39.290
and z equals five.
125

126
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:45.520
So the first equation was three X and then times something else so you might be initially tempted to
126

127
00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:50.300
say three X times four plus y.
127

128
00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:55.960
Now if you're writing out math in the way I showed in the slide or the way you would see in a textbook
128

129
00:09:55.990 --> 00:10:00.490
the way you would write it on a piece of paper with a pencil it actually does look like this.
129

130
00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:06.250
You don't have to put a multiplication operator in between the three and the X or in between the x and
130

131
00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:07.690
the parentheses.
131

132
00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:10.990
However, this is not the right way to do it in Python.
132

133
00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.810
As you learned in the previous video.
133

134
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:17.280
So you need parentheses to indicate multiplication.
134

135
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:18.070
All right.
135

136
00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.420
So that gives us an answer of forty two.
136

137
00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:28.090
I'm actually going to print this out here because I want to put the next line of code directly under.
137

138
00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:31.890
I'm going to say minus Y minus.
138

139
00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:36.650
And then this was x plus three divided by Z.
139

140
00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:39.680
And again if you wrote out something like this then.
140

141
00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:46.400
Good job trying but this is unfortunately not really correct, because python is gonna associate three
141

142
00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:50.050
divided by Z and then separately add that to X.
142

143
00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:58.660
We need to tell Python explicitly that the X plus the three go together in the numerator of this fraction,
143

144
00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:05.740
and that we do with parentheses and then we get a value of 0 which is the correct answer.
144

145
00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:12.490
In this video you learned how to use variables in Python as place holders for numbers.
145
