00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:10,280
This video is a follow up to the previous video on plotting coordinates in Python.

2
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:17,760
And in this video you are going to get to apply the knowledge you gained in the previous video to working

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,240
through this exercise.

4
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:25,560
So if you haven't yet watched the previous video and you're not super familiar with generating plots

5
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:31,390
in Python then I recommend going back to the previous video before trying to work through this one.

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,940
Anyway the goal of this exercise is basically just to generate this plot.

7
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:47,910
So this plot shows data points on a function and the function is Y equals X squared minus three x and

8
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:54,820
these points are plotted for X corresponding to integers between minus 10 and plus eleven.

9
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,110
And actually when I'm looking at the plot now I see that this.

10
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:04,260
Here the instructions say to go up to eleven although this last plot here this last point here is just

11
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,150
a 10.

12
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:10,610
So a part actually doesn't matter you can plot including point eleven or just up to point ten.

13
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,700
That doesn't matter.

14
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:20,230
Notice also the x and y axis labels which include for the y axis the definition of the function.

15
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:26,100
Okay so you should pause the video and see how you do in Python work as much as you can to get this

16
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,630
plot to get your plot to look like this.

17
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:36,240
And now I am going to switch to Python and you can watch me work through this exercise.

18
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:43,630
So I am going to solve this using the simple module so import Sim pie as Sim.

19
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,900
Now it's not strictly necessary.

20
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,040
You can also solve this exercise without using simple pie.

21
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,870
But I like some pie so I'm going to use it here.

22
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:58,290
It's also makes it convenient for plotting the y axis label.

23
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:07,320
So first I'm going to create a symbolic variable X so some symbols X and then we set our function that

24
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:16,650
was Y equals X squared minus three times X and now I'm gonna specify all of the points to be plotted

25
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,200
in a for loop.

26
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,780
So let's say for P and T I.

27
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:30,350
So for point index i n s i in the range from minus eleven to an hour.

28
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:35,010
Here is where you know you can go up to plus eleven or up to twelve as you like.

29
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,660
That part doesn't matter so much.

30
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,110
So then what we want to do is plot.

31
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:47,460
Now we need to specify the x axis and the y axis coordinates for each point.

32
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,570
So the x coordinate is actually in this coming from this range here.

33
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:58,850
So I'm just going to write P NTI and then the y axis comes from evaluating this function y.

34
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:06,200
This symbolic object substituting X for point or know no p NTI.

35
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:16,350
So this is going to be y dot y dot subs and then I'm going to substitute X for P and T I.

36
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:22,920
And then I want to make these a points so so I draw it with a dot at each coordinate.

37
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:30,450
Okay so now let's type peel t peel T dot show and see what we get.

38
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:32,100
All right.

39
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:37,860
So already this is looking pretty good we're almost already finished the exercise.

40
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:44,970
The other thing that I want to do here is added the axis labels so let's say P L T the X label that

41
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:55,860
was pretty simple that was just X and then peel BLT y label and this one I'm gonna write f of x equals

42
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,910
percent s and then percent Y.

43
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,130
So let's see how this looks.

44
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,600
All right this looks good.

45
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:09,600
We have all the points this time going up two point eleven or x coordinate eleven we have the x axis

46
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,660
label and the y axis labels showing the function all right.

47
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,940
So I hope you enjoyed working through this exercise.

48
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,760
There's a lot more to learn about graphics in Python and so keep watching.
