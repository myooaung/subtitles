00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,944
Before we learn how to build Athena databases and tables,

2
00:00:03,944 --> 00:00:09,163
there's a few more concepts to cover, such as SerDes,

3
00:00:09,163 --> 00:00:14,367
data formats, and compression formats that are supported by Athena.

4
00:00:14,367 --> 00:00:19,064
The formats listed on this slide are used by Athena for reading data.

5
00:00:19,064 --> 00:00:23,423
I'll explain formats that Athena uses for writing data

6
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:27,892
when it runs CREATE TABLE AS queries, or CTAs,

7
00:00:27,892 --> 00:00:30,224
in a subsequent slide.

8
00:00:30,224 --> 00:00:36,063
Athena supports creating tables and querying data from CSV,

9
00:00:36,063 --> 00:00:39,243
TSV, custom delimited, and JSON formats.

10
00:00:39,243 --> 00:00:43,760
It also supports Hadoop-related formats like ORC,

11
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,055
Apache Avro, and Apache Parquet.

12
00:00:47,055 --> 00:00:51,366
It also supports log data formats from Logstash,

13
00:00:51,366 --> 00:00:55,828
AWS CloudTrail, and Apache Web Server logs.

14
00:00:55,828 --> 00:01:00,416
SerDes stands for serializer deserializer.

15
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:05,841
Amazon Athena uses SerDes to interpret the data read from S3.

16
00:01:05,841 --> 00:01:09,230
Athena supports several SerDes libraries for parsing data

17
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,922
from different data formats such as CSV,

18
00:01:12,922 --> 00:01:14,521
JSON, Parquet, and ORC.

19
00:01:14,521 --> 00:01:19,440
It's important to realize that it's the SerDes you specify

20
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,924
and the DDL that defines the table schema.

21
00:01:21,924 --> 00:01:23,134
In other words,

22
00:01:23,134 --> 00:01:26,930
the SerDes can override the DDL configuration that you

23
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,060
specify in Athena when you create your table.

24
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,272
This table summarizes the Data Format, the Description of the data format,

25
00:01:35,272 --> 00:01:39,469
and the associated SerDe Types to use with each data type.

26
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:42,203
This should be a great reference as you're building out

27
00:01:42,203 --> 00:01:45,246
your own Athena databases and tables.

28
00:01:45,246 --> 00:01:51,811
The compression formats listed on this slide are used for CREATE TABLE queries.

29
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:55,928
SNAPPY is the default compression format for files in

30
00:01:55,928 --> 00:01:57,996
the Parquet data storage format.

31
00:01:57,996 --> 00:02:03,803
ZLIB is the default compression format for files in the ORC data storage format.

32
00:02:03,803 --> 00:02:09,737
You can also use LZO and GZIP for data in CSV, TSV, and JSON.

33
00:02:09,737 --> 00:02:14,962
Athena determines the compression type from the file extension.

34
00:02:14,962 --> 00:02:19,417
CTAS queries are commonly used for the three reasons you

35
00:02:19,417 --> 00:02:23,908
see in the colored squares on this slide.

36
00:02:23,908 --> 00:02:29,455
The data format supported for the CTAS queries can use ORC,

37
00:02:29,455 --> 00:02:39,000
Parquet, Avro, JSON, or text file. In the next section, I'll cover creating Amazon Athena databases and tables.
