Hi everyone.

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:13.341
My name is Kim Schmidt, and welcome to my course, Serverless Analytics on AWS.

3
00:00:13.341 --> 00:00:20.803
I am an AWS partner, vendor, and consultant via my company, DataLeader.io.

4
00:00:20.803 --> 00:00:27.697
DataLeader specializes in big data architecture and advanced analytics on AWS.

5
00:00:27.697 --> 00:00:32.897
This course is about best practices when doing big data on AWS,

6
00:00:32.897 --> 00:00:38.112
that far exceeds learning how to work with AWS Glue and Amazon Athena.

7
00:00:38.112 --> 00:00:43.323
Those two technologies have changed the way big data solutions

8
00:00:43.323 --> 00:00:48.031
are architected in the day of AI and ML.

9
00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:51.101
Some of the major topics and solutions to business problems

10
00:00:51.101 --> 00:00:56.672
that we will cover include how to solve the business problem of

11
00:00:56.672 --> 00:00:59.116
heterogenous data transformation,

12
00:00:59.116 --> 00:01:04.298
instantaneous querying of heterogenous data for immediate actionable

13
00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:09.051
insights without the need to first perform ETL,

14
00:01:09.051 --> 00:01:11.073
and among other really,

15
00:01:11.073 --> 00:01:14.545
really cool things is having one centralized

16
00:01:14.545 --> 00:01:17.060
repository for all your global data,

17
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.186
no matter where it physically sits to be in the Glue data catalog,

18
00:01:23.186 --> 00:01:29.924
enabling multiple people to do processing and analytics simultaneously,

19
00:01:29.924 --> 00:01:33.575
having different permutations of the source data

20
00:01:33.575 --> 00:01:36.102
without affecting the actual data.

21
00:01:36.102 --> 00:01:37.498
By the end of this course,

22
00:01:37.498 --> 00:01:42.938
you will have a thorough understanding of modern distributed

23
00:01:42.938 --> 00:01:47.493
advanced analytics workflows that you can begin to immediately

24
00:01:47.493 --> 00:01:52.914
apply to your own applications on AWS.

25
00:01:52.914 --> 00:01:56.702
Before beginning the course, you should have an AWS account,

26
00:01:56.702 --> 00:01:58.971
everything else is taught in the course,

27
00:01:58.971 --> 00:02:02.480
and any prerequisites required before starting the

28
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.869
course are covered first in the modules.

29
00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:11.804
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn all about AWS Glue and

30
00:02:11.804 --> 00:02:23.000
Amazon Athena with my Serverless Analytics on AWS course, at Pluralsight.
