00:00:01.428 --> 00:00:05.191
In this section, I'll introduce you to Globomantics,

2
00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:10.799
a global provider of NBA, or the National Basketball Association,

3
00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:11.437
trivia.

4
00:00:11.437 --> 00:00:16.841
Globomantics needs to keep NBA fans happy by keeping current

5
00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:19.814
with constantly-updated trivia about the sport,

6
00:00:19.814 --> 00:00:24.629
its players, and a lot of interesting NBA trivia on a global scale.

7
00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:28.372
They're having some business problems that we can solve for

8
00:00:28.372 --> 00:00:33.298
them using AWS Glue and Amazon Athena.

9
00:00:33.298 --> 00:00:36.006
Let's look at Globomantics' business problems now.

10
00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:41.295
Globomantics is a global provider of NBA trivia.

11
00:00:41.295 --> 00:00:46.303
They need to merge together large volumes of data from various

12
00:00:46.303 --> 00:00:51.400
disparate data sources and differing data formats from around the globe

13
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.837
into one secure cost-effective storage location.

14
00:00:55.837 --> 00:00:59.840
Globomantics is experiencing tremendous growth,

15
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.613
thus the storage location needs to be infinitely scalable.

16
00:01:04.613 --> 00:01:07.273
Their developers are stretched thin,

17
00:01:07.273 --> 00:01:11.377
and they're already overloaded with mundane tasks just to

18
00:01:11.377 --> 00:01:14.378
keep the data managed as best they can.

19
00:01:14.378 --> 00:01:19.616
Globomantics is looking for an automated way to discover,

20
00:01:19.616 --> 00:01:21.240
categorize, clean, enrich,

21
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.693
and move just the data needed at any given moment from the source

22
00:01:26.693 --> 00:01:33.521
data to the destination location while performing ETL on the fly for

23
00:01:33.521 --> 00:01:36.033
subsequent advanced types of analytics,

24
00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:39.727
including machine learning and artificial intelligence,

25
00:01:39.727 --> 00:01:43.814
in addition to traditional business intelligence

26
00:01:43.814 --> 00:01:46.562
analysis on historical datasets.

27
00:01:46.562 --> 00:01:49.844
Globomantics wants to ensure that no data,

28
00:01:49.844 --> 00:01:51.973
no matter what the structure,

29
00:01:51.973 --> 00:01:56.955
isn't siloed across the globe for various teams to work on.

30
00:01:56.955 --> 00:01:57.910
In addition,

31
00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:05.424
Globomantics wants one clear picture of all company data in one place.

32
00:02:05.424 --> 00:02:07.874
Let's look at the data we'll be using in this course.

33
00:02:07.874 --> 00:02:13.843
First, we're going to populate a relational database, Amazon Aurora.

34
00:02:13.843 --> 00:02:18.467
Then we'll bring in semi-structured datasets in CSV format.

35
00:02:18.467 --> 00:02:22.100
We'll then have Glue crawlers crawl both of these data

36
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.952
sources to populate a Glue Data Catalog.

37
00:02:25.952 --> 00:02:30.467
This will show you how the Data Catalog holds any type of data that exists,

38
00:02:30.467 --> 00:02:37.066
regardless of structure, format, or data types together in one place.

39
00:02:37.066 --> 00:02:38.020
In the next module,

40
00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.626
we'll begin to build the infrastructure and configure the data

41
00:02:41.626 --> 00:02:48.000
requirements that will be used throughout this course. See you there.
