00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:08.200
In this video we're going to discuss hexadecimal binary and decimal conversions with an emphasis on

2
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.020
the conversion of hexadecimal numbers to decimal.

3
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:20.190
In previous videos I explained how to convert binary to decimal and decimal to binary.

4
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.320
Please refer to those videos.

5
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:29.840
If you're not sure how to do binary to decimal and decimal to binary conversions hexadecimal is really

6
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.050
important in networking.

7
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:40.220
As an example on my Windows machine if I type IP config for special and I'm going to pipe that to more

8
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:48.390
so that we see one page at a time what you'll notice is that on my network interface card.

9
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.920
So my Local Area Connection.

10
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:59.600
I have a Broadcom network stream gigabit ethernet card with this MAC address so hexadecimal is used

11
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:06.910
to identify MAC addresses but it's also used to identify IP version 6 addresses.

12
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.390
Let's discuss MAC addresses of ping a device.

13
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.510
So this is my default gateway.

14
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.010
As you can see over there when I type up a.

15
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.440
I can see that the IP address of the default gateway was resolved to this MAC address as an example

16
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:33.790
if I ping 191 except 56 to 40 and then do all Peiffer ne.

17
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.950
I can see that that IP address was resolved to this MAC address.

18
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:52.940
Now that is a Cisco router so I'll telnet to the router luggin show interface if 0 0.

19
00:01:53.110 --> 00:02:03.370
So here's the command shows me the IP address and MAC address of the Rodda I'll open up another cmd

20
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:14.360
prompt in Windows so all hyphenating notice on my local PC that IP address of the router will be here.

21
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.180
Has been resolved to this MAC address which is correct.

22
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.650
That's the MAC address of the rod it now on a router.

23
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:32.980
You have the MAC address that it uses as well as a burned in address or B.A address that's the address

24
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.700
that was burnt into the network interface card by the manufacturer.

25
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.520
You also have something similar in Windows so this is my network interface card in Windows and if I

26
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:57.360
go to properties and configure the network interface card under advanced I have the option network address

27
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.810
so the MAC address of my local network card

28
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.130
is shown here.

29
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:15.300
That I can change that to quadruple they triple B quadruple C as an example.

30
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:27.670
So I'm changing the MAC address from what the manufacturer said it to to this new MAC address I may

31
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.280
lose my telnet connection because I've changed the MAC address but I could telnet back to the router

32
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:43.520
show interface if 0 0 shows me the MAC address on my router as it's configured and the boot in address

33
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.790
and I could do something similar.

34
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:56.570
So on the Cisco router I could specify the MAC address as let's say a b b b c.

35
00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.140
So I've changed the MAC address of the interface.

36
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.230
So show interface 0 0.

37
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.140
Notice the MAC address is now this.

38
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.930
Previously the MAC address was this up.

39
00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:23.710
Hi FNet shows me the new MAC address on my local Windows machine and show up on the router shows me

40
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:33.830
MAC addresses of devices in the network so the IP address on my local PC is 1 9 2 1 6 8 56 199

41
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.120
and you can see that MAC address in the output here.

42
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:48.460
Some of these other duplicate MAC addresses are because of network address translation that's being

43
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.340
configured on the router so I wouldn't worry about that for the moment.

44
00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:00.850
What I'd like to see is when I look at the running configuration of this router I have changed the MAC

45
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.590
address to this valley

46
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:14.470
and when I look at the cache on the PC I can see that entry on my local PC so understanding hexadecimal

47
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:23.440
can be important in networking because simple things such as working with MAC addresses or IP version

48
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.990
6 require that you have an understanding of hexadecimal.

49
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.850
So I'll not explain how to convert hexadecimal to binary and two decimal.
