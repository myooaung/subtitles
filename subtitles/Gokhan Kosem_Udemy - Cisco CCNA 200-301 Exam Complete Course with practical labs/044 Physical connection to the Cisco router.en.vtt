00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.730
However before looking at the Cisco IOS you need to connect to a device.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.790
And in this video I'm going to connect to a Cisco router.

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.790
So I want to show you the physical connections so that you know how to connect to the console of a Router

4
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:21.680
Set up your computer to access the console using hyper terminal as an example in Windows.

5
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:29.430
There are many terminal emulation options available to you hyper terminal Tehrik term and Patty are

6
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.460
some examples who turn on the router and look at the start up process to see how the Rodda boots.

7
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.820
And then we'll run the initial configuration dialog which isn't really used that often by networking

8
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.050
engineers in the real world but it's well worth looking at it so that you're aware that it exists.

9
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.270
The initial configuration dialog allows you to configure some basic configuration options on a Cisco

10
00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.280
router but these days Cisco have introduced other ways of configuring devices.

11
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.500
So most Cisco engineers only look at the initial configuration dialog once or twice and I suggest you

12
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.770
do the same.

13
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.830
Have a look at it see what it does.

14
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.260
Get an understanding of what it provides.

15
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.500
But in the real world you're going to configure networking devices using the command line interface

16
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.020
and specific commands rather than following the initial configuration dialog.

17
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:33.220
So as mentioned the exec interface is where you going to be configuring networking devices and this

18
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.880
is WAY YOU as a Cisco engineer are going to be spending a lot of time.

19
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:46.180
You need to get very very comfortable with the layout and commands available in the exec interface.

20
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:52.200
You'll probably never memorize all the commands available in the Cisco IOS.

21
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.890
There are thousands and thousands of commands that you need to learn at least some of them to be able

22
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.110
to configure a Cisco router or switch.

23
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.610
So we're going to look at some of the modes available.

24
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.940
And as mentioned this causes a lot of confusion don't type the right C'mon in the wrong mode as the

25
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.300
Cisco Radu a switch or won't accept it.

26
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.420
So if a command is not accepted by your router will switch.

27
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.720
Firstly make sure that you're in the right mode and secondly make sure that you are working on the right

28
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.190
device.

29
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.890
Now like all things in life the more you practice the easier it becomes.

30
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.480
So spend time practicing commands on Cisco routers and switches.

31
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.780
I'm going to show you some exec interface tips and tricks which you'll find really useful in the real

32
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.770
world to save you time.
