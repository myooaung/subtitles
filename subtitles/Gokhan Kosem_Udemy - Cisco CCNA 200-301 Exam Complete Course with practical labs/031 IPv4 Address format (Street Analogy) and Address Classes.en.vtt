00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:08.120
So once again the format of an IP address in this case IP version 4 is a 32 bit binary number.

2
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:15.290
It's divided into four parts or four octets which are 8 pets or one byte in size.

3
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:22.280
So an IP address could be written as follows in binary in dotted decimal notation or it could be written

4
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:23.780
as follows.

5
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.510
Ducted decimal notation.

6
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:35.900
So just to summarize it say for byte number or 32 bit number typically written in dotted decimal notation.

7
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.230
But be aware that it's actually a binary address of 32 bits.

8
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.010
Please refer to the binary videos.

9
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:49.250
If you're not sure about the formatting or conversion of binary to decimal and back again and octet

10
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.950
is 8 binary bets all one byte one byte equates to eight binary bits.

11
00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:01.970
So no provision for dress consists of four octets such as extra X to add extra X where X is an octet

12
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.610
or 8 bits or one byte.

13
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.610
Now using our street analogy again it's possible to have the same house number on different streets.

14
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.290
So house one could be an Oxford Street as well as Cambridge Street.

15
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.410
House Number One should just not appear twice on the same street.

16
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.800
But number one is permitted on different streets in the same way here.

17
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:31.730
It's possible to have number one on Network 10 but one dog 1.0 slash 24 as well as number one on network

18
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.330
12:48 1.0 slushed 24 the same number can appear on different networks.

19
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.240
I'll explain this next 24 in a moment.

20
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.970
When we discuss network mosques but in this example we have network up one at 1.0 and told at one point

21
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:54.980
1.0 and it's possible to have multiple devices with the host portion of the IP address set to one the

22
00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:02.500
same host portion can appear twice as I'm in this example or many times in a network or the internet.

23
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:10.980
As long as the network portion is different now one thing you'll learn about networking is that things

24
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:19.440
are constantly changing across classes or classful networks were used in the Internet from 1981 until

25
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:27.730
the introduction of classless into domain routing in 1993 which is commonly known as cyder or C IDR.

26
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:35.340
Now prior to 1993 address classes were used to divide the IP version 4 address space into five address

27
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.380
classes.

28
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:44.370
The three that we are going to concentrate on here are Class A B and C which are used for any cost traffic

29
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:52.660
plus D is used for multicast and class-C is reserved for future or experimental purposes.

30
00:02:52.700 --> 00:03:00.450
Classes have been superseded in IP version 6 IP version 6 and does not use address classes and in IP

31
00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.430
version 4 address classes have been replaced with cyder.

32
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.800
So the different classes of addresses a B and C were used to accomodate different sizes of networks

33
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.170
which aided in the classification of those networks.

34
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:20.910
So as an example a classful address supports about 16 million IP addresses.

35
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.000
So once again we had plus a b and c..

36
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.620
These have been replaced with superseded by cyder.

37
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:35.360
We'll see IDR and address classes such as A B and C were determined and then allocated by the owner

38
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.440
or internet assigned numbers or 30.

39
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.050
This format is not used entirely in its original format.

40
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.250
Today he has an entry on Wikipedia showing the list of class addresses.

41
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.200
So each class a address has approximately 16 million IP addresses.

42
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.990
And if we scroll down the list we can see various examples.

43
00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:07.050
AT&amp;T have 12 Xerox 13 HP 15 Dec. 16 so 15 and 16 are now owned by HP.

44
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.740
Apple has 17 MIT 18 Ford 19 and so forth and so on.

45
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:24.450
So notice as an example Apple own 17.00 doats arrow slash 8 Apple have 16 odd million public IP addresses

46
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.920
that are part of the Class A address.

47
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:35.740
So in the original IP address format across a address consists of eight network bits and 24 host bits.

48
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.770
Hence it's written as shaped denoting eight network bets.

49
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.770
Now this was fine when the Internet was small but it quickly became a limiting factor and thus multiple

50
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.300
addresses were introduced with a different size and network portions.

51
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.520
Hence we have class a class B and class C addresses.

52
00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:04.280
Please note once again that class full addresses were replaced in 1993 with plotless into domain routing

53
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.320
or C ID are also called cyder.

54
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:13.340
However you may still come across commands that use the classful address format.

55
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.330
An example of that is the net work command within writing protocols.

56
00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:26.040
So as an example if you use the network command on a rope routing process the command is written in

57
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.680
a class full format.

58
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.660
It's also worth knowing a bit of the history and understanding why we have problems with a lack of IP

59
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.030
addressing today.

60
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.270
Hence it's worth your learning about potful addresses for completeness.

61
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.880
The breaking up of addresses was originally used to try and save or conserv IP addresses but did not

62
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:52.680
work in its original format and thus was expanded and changed by cyder well-explained side in a moment.

63
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.540
Let's first look at the various address classes in more detail.
