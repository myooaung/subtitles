00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.670
I noticed once again in the exam they talk about differences between Puppet Chef and sensible.

2
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.850
Now I have discussed this in the exam overview.

3
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:19.520
I'll explain it a big difference between answerable puppet and chef is answerable is Agent Lewis.

4
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.250
You don't have to run an agent on the road.

5
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.520
So if you've got a Cisco router if you want to use puppet or chef you have to run an agent which is

6
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.170
basically a piece of software that can talk to one of their servers.

7
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.190
So that's a huge disadvantage.

8
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.560
If you've got an old 37 50 switch in your lab at home or you want to use genius 3 as an example.

9
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.320
All you've got is a stage or talent.

10
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.110
But let's just assume SSA.

11
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.340
You don't want to run an agent or have to install an agent and have to run Linux commands on the rod

12
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.640
or switch just to be able to talk to it to configure it.

13
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.910
That's a disadvantage of both puppet and chef.

14
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.320
If you've got a server or you come from a server environment it's very easy to install a piece of software

15
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.340
on the server.

16
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.180
So if you've got a Linux server or you've got a Windows server you can just install a piece of software

17
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.620
on that server and that's fine.

18
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:20.160
So install an agent and then manage the server using this connection from the server from the management

19
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.330
station to the agent.

20
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.650
That's easy to do but you can't easily do that with Cisco.

21
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:32.910
IOW devices in a in classic IOW the monolithic old IOW you couldn't just install applications on a rod

22
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:33.690
or a switch.

23
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.750
Now since you have opened that up quite a lot now with XY so with the newest versions of Iowa's you

24
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.430
can drop down into Linux shell and I'll show you that in this course it's not required once again for

25
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.190
the CCMA exam but you can actually drop down into Linux and that's how you install an agent for puppet

26
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.830
as an example you have to go into Linux shell dropped on into the Linux Shell on Your rod or switch

27
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.260
to install the agent.

28
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:04.660
So basically you're running Linux on your on your router now you can't do that very easily on old Iris

29
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.680
systems.

30
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.140
So that's the advantage of sensible you're just using SSA basically to configure the device.

31
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.080
Now I have a love hate relationship with sensible.

32
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.110
I don't like sensible because every time they update sensible it breaks all my scripts accredited sensible

33
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.050
course and as soon as I release that sensible updated and it broke all my answerable scripts and the

34
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.840
students weren't very happy.

35
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.860
So I personally prefer Python.

36
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:30.190
Why.

37
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.730
Because python is easier to control.

38
00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.640
There was a big change from Python two point seven to Python 3.

39
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.010
Python 3 is the de facto.

40
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.630
Now you must use Python 3 but I can control what happens.

41
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.470
Big Idea in programming is you as the developer control what goes on.

42
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.600
There is no external application that breaks everything and that's what I hate about sensible.

43
00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:03.100
So personally I would study Python some guys would say you learn animal animals kind of like a halfway

44
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.950
step to Python so traditional network engineer go to animal and go to python.

45
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.520
Now a few years ago a lot of guys would say Python as is is bad because you can't scale very easily

46
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.700
and still has a lot of scalability stuff built into it.

47
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.770
And that was true as an example if you wanted to configure a hundred switches using Python.

48
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.480
It was a lot more difficult because Python would Alicia did some clever coding open one session and

49
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.170
go to the next device then to the next device.

50
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.560
So everything was done sequentially it was very very slow.

51
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.060
So you'd have to write code to do everything in parallel to speed up the scripts.

52
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.470
Basically that was an advantage of sensible that kind of stuff.

53
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.120
Cleverness was built into encircle from the beginning but that's no longer true.

54
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.900
Today we've got frameworks such as Narnia.

55
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.960
We've got pi 80 s also called Jeannie from Cisco.

56
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.880
Cisco has made it a lot easier with pi.

57
00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:59.650
Yes.

58
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:07.660
So pi 80 s and Jeannie really make things a lot easier if you configuring devices it also gives you

59
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:08.540
scalability.

60
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.070
It hides some of the complexity makes your python scripts a lot simpler and so does Narnia.

61
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:21.040
So I would say that the advantage of using sensible has diminished compared to to Python.

62
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:27.460
A lot of new people to the programming world would struggle with Python so if Europe pure network person

63
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.600
you might struggle to get into python but let me tell you rather bite the bullet as they say do it as

64
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.450
soon as you can get over the hurdle of learning python because once you do it opens up a whole new world

65
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.340
to you rather than just being a use of an application that someone else has written you can control

66
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.270
what goes on.

67
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:52.150
So my recommendation is Learn Python once again as quickly as you can for the real world but for the

68
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.580
CCMA exam you don't need to learn python so you don't have to debug scripts that is covered in the definite

69
00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:58.730
associate.

70
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:05.740
Okay so I've been talking quite a bit now but I wanted to give you the sort of summary of this section

71
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.460
some of the stuff that I haven't spoken about is overlays and underlies.

72
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:16.600
So I did talk about this in my exam overview but I'll explain it once again.

73
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.130
Here let me give me feedback.

74
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:23.330
I mean do you like me just talking to you as hopefully it's as if you're sitting next to me and we're

75
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.610
just having a conversation.
