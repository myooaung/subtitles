00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:08.310
In the wide shot captures we can see that the router is sending a Rodda advertisement to F-F zero to

2
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.430
call and call on one.

3
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:18.100
So here's the advertisement link a late address is the MAC address of the router and to use 5800 bytes.

4
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:29.290
But notice no prefix information contains 2001 Polan 0 1 0 1 as well as 2001 Kahlon face.

5
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.390
So both of those networks are being advertised to devices on the local segment.

6
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:44.540
Notice the PC is sending out a neighbor's solicitation message for this link.

7
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:51.490
Laya address with that target address 2001 face colon colon one.

8
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:58.540
In other words it's sending it to the broader and the Rodda is replying back with a neighbor advertisement

9
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.660
telling the PC what its MAC address is.

10
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.100
Here we can see the pings.

11
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.400
So he has an echo request from the PC to the router.

12
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:20.820
Notice the IP version 6 address of the PC and IP version 6 address of the router and then the router

13
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.780
replies back.

14
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.780
So 2001 Colan face colon colon one.

15
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:34.320
If replying back to the PC and we can see it's an echo reply he has another ping request and another

16
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.370
ping reply.

17
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.440
So a lot of what you've learnt in IP version 4 can be applied to IP version 6.

18
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:49.890
We have ping we have echo requests and we have Echo replies but in addition we have newer protocols

19
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.340
like neighbors elicitation and neighbor advertisement.

20
00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.540
One of the reasons that this is required is that port costs are no longer supported in IP version 6.
