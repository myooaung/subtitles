00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:08.640
You can once again look at RNC 2 7 8 4 or go to the updated version 2 8 9 0 to see some of the extra

2
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:19.660
extensions to GOP back in 2 7 8 4 noticed once again you can see the encapsulated packet with a payload.

3
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.470
GERRY HADDEN delivery header.

4
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.950
You can see what the GOP had it looks like.

5
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.270
As an example you can see the protocol type.

6
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:35.430
You can see the version and other fields that kind of information is explained in this RNC but rather

7
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.040
than boring you going through an RNC.

8
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.170
I'm going to show you practically with a wire shot capture what the actual packets looked like in our

9
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.870
topology so we'll capture some packets here.

10
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:55.570
And we'll also capture them on the Internet to see how the packets are encapsulated and what headers

11
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.280
are used.

12
00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:06.160
You can see the protocol type used by GRC in RC seventeen hundred and in this RFP you'll see that GRC

13
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:14.110
uses protocol number 47 are the protocols that you may be more familiar with include DCP which is protocol

14
00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.590
6 and UDP which is protocol 17

15
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:31.360
so the point to remember is GRC is a protocol that resides next to UDP and DCP in the OSA model.

16
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:37.580
Doesn't run on top of UDP or on top of DCP it's its own protocol type.

17
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:45.510
You can also see the ether type for GOP in the ether net numbers on the Iona but once again I'm gonna

18
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.280
be using Y shock to show you this even though that kind of information is contained in the various sorry

19
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.860
if CS.
