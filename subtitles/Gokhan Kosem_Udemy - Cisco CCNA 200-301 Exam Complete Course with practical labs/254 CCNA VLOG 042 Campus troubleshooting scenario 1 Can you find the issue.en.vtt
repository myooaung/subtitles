00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.890
This is one of a multiple land or local area network troubleshooting videos.

2
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:22.190
In this video we have four switches running ingenious three switch one and switch two are configured

3
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:30.550
as Layer three switches switch three and switch for configured as Layer two switches so I could change

4
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.110
the symbol as an example

5
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:43.040
to indicate that that's a layer to switch however these four switches are running.

6
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.680
IOW a v layer to

7
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.160
and what I've done is simply disable IP running on switch three and switch four.

8
00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:03.290
So we have four switches in the topology and two Iowa's v Rogers right a one and write it to acting

9
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.040
as pieces.

10
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.460
This is a very simple topology where we have a core and an access layer.

11
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.890
Typically you would connect the core to the access layer using cross connects.

12
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.530
I'm not going to do that in this troubleshooting video.

13
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:26.720
Have a look in my CCN a course which is linked below for a more complex topology running HSR P optimized

14
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.930
spanning tree redundancy between the core and the access layer and multiple other options.

15
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.320
But this network will suffice for our basic troubleshooting.

16
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:44.590
So now let's assume that a new hire has made some configuration changes on the network and users are

17
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:53.690
complaining about network connectivity issues you've been told that to this user 10 1 to 1 in VLAN 2

18
00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:02.740
is unable to ping this user that has a P.C. with IP address 10 dot 1.0 3 or 2 in V land 3.

19
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.940
You've been told that switch 3 is connected to switch 1 as follows.

20
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:15.250
So each one is connected to switch 2 and switch 2 is connected to switch for but as Ronald Reagan said

21
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.310
Trust but verify.

22
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.460
And what I like to say is don't trust anything that you've been told about a network until you've checked

23
00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.690
it yourself.

24
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:36.320
So you're not topology right a 1 is acting as P.S. 1 show IP interface brief shows us the IP address

25
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:44.800
on the gigabit interface that looks right the IP address looks right subnet mask looks right.

26
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:53.550
Let's see if we can ping 10 but wonder 3 or 2 which is the IP address of Rada t acting as P.S. To

27
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:04.640
Okay so the ping is failing we don't seem to be able to ping that device so that piece of information

28
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.280
is true.

29
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:14.060
Show IP rot shows us no roots in the routing table but it shows us that the default gateway is set to

30
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:21.910
tend on 1 2 2 5 4.

31
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:29.480
Now that's because IP routing has been disabled on this Radha in this topology we've got Radha one acting

32
00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.810
as a P.C. so when IP writing is disabled this is what the writing table looks like.

33
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.510
The default gateway has been configured on the P.C. so that's good.

34
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.880
Let's check if we can ping the default gateway yes we can.

35
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.160
Now where is the default gateway.

36
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.980
We could try and Telnet to the default gateway

37
00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.790
and let's try and Telnet to the right type of address so the device is there.

38
00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.240
But we're told that a password is required but none is set.

39
00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.900
So hopefully the default gateway in this topology is either switch one or switch to which all of the

40
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.930
core Layer 3 switches.

41
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:23.030
So here's switch one show IP interface brief we can see that a villain one villain tune villain 3 have

42
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.140
an IP address configured and that's the IP address on VLAN 2.

43
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.860
So this should be the device that the P.C. is pinging.

44
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:40.520
I'll do a debug IP ICMP on that switch and get to the P.C. to paying the default gateway.

45
00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.700
Now you need to be careful with debugging in a real world environment.

46
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:46.040
Yeah.

47
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:52.790
Because we studying for the CCMA we can simply enable any debug command because that'll help you learn

48
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.020
the debug that are available but in the real world.

49
00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:02.480
Be careful with simply enabling a debug especially on a core device.

50
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:09.710
You may get so much output on the console that you can't read anything or in a very bad situation the

51
00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.810
device may fall over so we don't want that.

52
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.680
So in the real world.

53
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.010
Be careful with debugging.

54
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:25.230
Okay so the pings do arrive on this default gateway so that's good.

55
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.700
I'm gonna turn off IP domain look up in the lab here to make things happen quicker.

56
00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:42.110
And then what we'll do is trace tendered one dot three or two which should be P.C. to an auto apology.

57
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.360
Let's see how far it gets.

58
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:51.270
So it gets to the default gateway which we've now determined is which one.

59
00:05:51.310 --> 00:06:00.130
So what we should do is update the documentation so we can say that these are the IP addresses on the

60
00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.630
V lands of that switch.

61
00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:14.110
That once again can be seen on switch one by using the show IP interface brief command and there they

62
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.980
are once again

63
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:28.500
the trace rot shows us that the traffic gets to the default gateway but then doesn't go anywhere else.

64
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:38.280
Let's check if P.S. two components default gateway now a test I'd like to do is to make sure that the

65
00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:44.190
local device can ping the other VLAN of the default gateway.

66
00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:55.960
So in other words this P.C. is in Vila and 2 it's in subnet 10 1 2 0 and I'm checking that it camping

67
00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.570
the subnet of the device that we're trying to go to but this is the IP address of the default gateway

68
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:03.730
into that villain.

69
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:11.070
In other words we've proven that interval and writing is working on the layer 3 switch but now let's

70
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:17.730
check the connectivity of PCI 2 can it get to its default gateway.

71
00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:24.210
So this is rather to acting as P.C. to show IP interface brief IP address.

72
00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:25.230
Looks right.

73
00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:32.620
Per the diagram subnet mask looks right now that information is once again not shown on the diagram.

74
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:42.580
So we'd want to add that somewhere and you may want to add that on individual devices or make a note

75
00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:51.020
somewhere that these subnets have a slash 24 mask show IP run it shows us the default gateway of PCI

76
00:07:51.020 --> 00:08:00.390
2 so cannot ping its default gateway No it can't so there's something wrong.

77
00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:11.300
Either here or here or here let's have a look at switch for switch forwards the local access switch

78
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:24.530
show IP interface brief it has an IP address of 10 1 1 4 can it paying such 1 in VLAN 1 yes it can show

79
00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:35.360
IP wrought default gateways tendered 1 1 2 5 4 can it paying tendered 1 dot 3 2 5 4 yes it can can it

80
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:46.280
ping the P.C. in the violent 3 No it can't so the switch camping the default gateway into V Line routing

81
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:53.470
is working on the default gateway but it can't ping this P.C. traffic from the switch to this piece

82
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:58.930
you would have to traverse to here to get to the default gateway and then it would have to come back

83
00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:09.420
again let's confirm the ports on switch for so firstly show IP interface brief let's confirm that interfaces

84
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:14.310
are up all interfaces look up including gigabit 0 1

85
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:25.610
that interfaces up gigabit 0 0 is up which is the link to the core network pings that were previously

86
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:30.450
so so we have an indication that this interfaces are ready up and working.

87
00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:39.790
Show interface trunk there's a trunk to the core on gigabit 0 that looks good let's have a look at the

88
00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:40.330
gigabit.

89
00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:49.090
0 1 interface show interface gigabit 0 1 switch port this interface should be in villain three.

90
00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.300
Can you see the problem in the this.

91
00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:53.950
Put interface.

92
00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:55.800
Name is gigabit 0.

93
00:09:56.010 --> 00:10:00.490
It's enabled as a switch port administrative mode is dynamic auto.

94
00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:08.750
It's currently acting as a static access port so dynamic trunk protocol or DTP did not negotiate to

95
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:18.540
form a trunk so DTP is on but there wasn't a switch to negotiate drinking with noticed the problem access

96
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:19.180
mode.

97
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:29.450
A villain is one show run interface gigabit to 0 1 this port is not in VLAN 3.

98
00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:37.460
Interface gigabit 0 1 is currently in VLAN 1.

99
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.480
So switch port access.

100
00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:42.910
Vigeland 3 show interface gigabit.

101
00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:43.890
0 1.

102
00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:51.680
Switch port Port is now an access port in VLAN 23 show run interface gigabit.

103
00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:55.410
0 1 There's a configuration.

104
00:10:55.410 --> 00:11:02.280
Let's check the local switch can ping that P.C. at the moment it still can't.

105
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:07.680
It may take a while for spanning tree and other protocols to converge

106
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:16.980
so you may just need to wait a bit before you assume that there's a problem but spanning tree at this

107
00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.190
point looks good.

108
00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:34.690
So show CTP neighbors we can see that right it to is connected to gigabit 01 using gigabit 00 show interface

109
00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:44.370
gigabit 01 switch port confirms that to this port is in V land 3 so let's go back on to the P.C. and

110
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:49.950
check if it can ping its default gateway.

111
00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:50.850
It can now.

112
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:57.150
So once again you may just have to wait a little bit before you assume that your change hasn't made

113
00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:00.710
any difference Kennett paying

114
00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:05.590
a one acting as P.S. 1.

115
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.350
Yes it can.

116
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.420
So it looks like we've solved the problem

117
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:20.540
we could trace to the P.C. which didn't work before that now works.

118
00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:30.620
So previously when we traced to 10 1 3 2 it failed at the default gateway but now it's working and we

119
00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:35.510
could do a ping to prove it.

120
00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:45.680
And do a debug on the side to prove that the traffic arrives so that was an example of how to troubleshoot

121
00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:52.190
a local area network it can sometimes be complicated to troubleshoot a layered two issues but remember

122
00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:57.790
to check your interfaces check your v lands check your encapsulation as in other videos.

123
00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:04.960
I will show you other problems that you may encounter and need to troubleshoot in this topology open
