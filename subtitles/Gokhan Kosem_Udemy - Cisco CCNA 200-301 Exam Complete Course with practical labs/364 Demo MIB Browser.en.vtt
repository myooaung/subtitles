00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:10.440
So in this example in our washup capture we have a 1 3 6 1 2 and so forth and so on in the engineer's

2
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:19.280
toolkit which I've installed on the VM I've opened up the browser and notice one is Eissa.

3
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:27.640
So the idea is one three organization six is diod.

4
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:36.770
So 1 3 6 is ISO org P.O.D. one is Internet 2 is management.

5
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:46.070
So at this point at the moment we need to choose one which is mapped to map Mbutu is what we saw in

6
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.140
the RF CS.

7
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.380
So notice map too.

8
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:56.840
This is our FC 1 1 5 8 which has been obsoleted by RAFC 1 2 1 3 over here.

9
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.170
So management information bases for network management to.

10
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.720
So that's my T based system as an example.

11
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.810
But what we've got here is 31.

12
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:23.790
So scrolling down 31 is IDF map that we've got one for objects one for X table.

13
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:32.180
Another one for X entry one for face and then we've got a value of two.

14
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.750
So this is the textual name of the interface.

15
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.380
This might be a text name such as Elly's zero or a simple number such as one depending on the interface

16
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.410
naming some ticks of the device.

17
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.270
If we have a look at another 1 1 3 6 1 2.

18
00:01:50.010 --> 00:02:06.640
So if we scroll up 1 3 6 1 to 1 so we can map to two interfaces to his I.F. table.

19
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.420
One is an entry to the description.

20
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.670
So this is the interface description information.

21
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:22.270
So the moral of the story is you can walk the map using the browser in this application to work out

22
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.670
what these ID values actually mean or refer to.

23
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:35.530
Fortunately for us NPM shows us in a nice graphical format so you get information about the device and

24
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:43.080
you also get information about the interfaces so in a nice easy to read format.
