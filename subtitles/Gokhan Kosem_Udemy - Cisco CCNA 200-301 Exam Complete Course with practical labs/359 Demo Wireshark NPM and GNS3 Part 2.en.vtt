00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:08.290
That would require a telnet client enabled on my PC scrolling down I can see as an example that the

2
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:15.600
polling method is used for those devices and MP and the polling interval is 120 seconds.

3
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.860
I can see as an example the interfaces and the state of those interfaces we can see other information

4
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.100
about the device including that it was reputed.

5
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.860
Let's have a look at rowdier to see his router too.

6
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.790
We can see information about the node.

7
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.500
Once again that it's up we can see that it's being Pold with an empty we can see the interfaces once

8
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.950
again.

9
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:47.540
So let's have a look at serial is 0 0 0 0 in this case we can see the utilization isn't very high on

10
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.100
the scene to face because no traffic is being sent.

11
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:57.860
And we can see that the interface is up to the router to interface serial 0 slash 0.

12
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:07.000
That's the interface that we're looking at in NPM or shut the interface down interfaces going down I'll

13
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.550
click poll and now.

14
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.390
And as you can see the interface is being shut down.

15
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.390
That interface has gone down in Wireshark.

16
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:25.050
We can see that a message was sent from NPM to the router and the router then responded with information

17
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.790
about the IDs on the device.

18
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.810
So let's do that again.

19
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.670
What I'll do is restart the capture.

20
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.870
We're going to search for SMP and I'm going to specify an IP address 10 at one point one hundred or

21
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.750
two.

22
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.140
So we can see requests from the management station and then responses back from the Rodda.

23
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.720
What I'll do now is no shut the interface so bring it up.

24
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.770
So I'm bringing up serial 0 slash zero back in the management interface.

25
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:10.140
I'll click poll now and notice there are no values for different IDs and now responses are coming back

26
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.080
from the Rodda poll again interface's up.

27
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.980
So it was done previously.

28
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:25.740
So the NPM device is able to retrieve status information of network interfaces by using SMP.

29
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:32.820
We can see for instance the speed of the interface utilization and other options on the interface of

30
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.640
the Rodda all running within Jeana's 3.
