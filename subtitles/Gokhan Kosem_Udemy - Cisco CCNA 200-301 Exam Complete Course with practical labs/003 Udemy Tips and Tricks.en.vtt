00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.550
Now before we get into the technical content I want to share some tips and tricks with regards to the

2
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:11.930
Udemy interface.

3
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:17.240
This will hopefully make the interface a lot more understandable and a lot more usable.

4
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.550
Now the first thing is you can increase the speed of the video.

5
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.800
Some people find that I speak too slowly.

6
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.560
So if you find that I'm speaking too slowly then simply speed me up.

7
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.470
I personally like to watch videos at two times the speed.

8
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.180
So I'll set this to two times.

9
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.480
But you could change the speed up and once again if I'm speaking too quickly then slow me down.

10
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.080
So reduce the speed of the video.

11
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.240
You can increase the sound levels by clicking here.

12
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.590
You can look at the video transcript over here.

13
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:57.410
Close captions can be set on or off some videos will have close captions created others are automatically

14
00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.900
generated but you can specify your captions settings through this interface.

15
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.440
You can also go full screen if you prefer.

16
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.660
If you want to watch a full screen I'm going to press escape to go back to normal size.

17
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.110
You can use the slider to move the video to a specific point if you like.

18
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.240
Now what's really important is I'm often sharing resources.

19
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:28.730
So if you want resources then click on the Resources button to download resources.

20
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:34.220
So have a look on the left up here for the resources Udemy sometimes change the interface it used to

21
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.270
be on the right but now it's on the left.

22
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:43.130
So just have a look on the Udemy interface to make sure that you can find the resources they may change

23
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.470
the interface off.

24
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:52.190
I've recorded this notice there's also Q and A so you can ask a question or you can read previous questions

25
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.090
and answers that have been posted.

26
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.760
You can also make your own notes and any announcements that have been made will be displayed here.

27
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.330
Now the settings cog gives you access to a whole bunch of settings including video playback quality

28
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:13.520
if the video playback quality is per then simply increase the video playback resolution to say 720 P

29
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.380
you can specify whether you want video to order play from one video to the other.

30
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.180
That means as soon as one video finishes it'll auto play the next video.

31
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.660
You can also download lectures that have been marked for download.

32
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.520
That depends on the instructor.

33
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.960
I often allow students to download my lectures.

34
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:39.500
There are various useful keyboard shortcuts such as using spacebar to play or pause the video left arrow

35
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.360
key allows you to go back five seconds right.

36
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.630
Iraqi allows you to go forward five seconds.

37
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.030
You can change the video speed by using keyboard shortcuts and there are various other useful keyboard

38
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.790
shortcuts available through the Udemy interface.

39
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.760
You can also report technical issues and report abuse through this interface.

40
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.260
So a whole bunch of really useful options are available when you click on the cog.

41
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.310
Now a big tip that I want to give you is once again go and have a look at my YouTube channel.

42
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.580
Go and follow me on social media if you want a whole bunch of stuff for free.

43
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.170
I post daily questions on Twitter and other social media platforms such as Instagram.

44
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.550
So if you want free additional content then follow me on social media and if you want to watch free

45
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.690
videos have a look at my YouTube channel.

46
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.910
I have over 900 videos posted on my YouTube channel.

47
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.230
Lots of free content covering a whole range of topics available on my YouTube channel.

48
00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.250
OK so without further ado let's get into the technical content and make sure that you can learn something

49
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.480
that's of value to you.
