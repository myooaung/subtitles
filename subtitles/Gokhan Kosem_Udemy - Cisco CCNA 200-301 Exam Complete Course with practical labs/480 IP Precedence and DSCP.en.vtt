00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:08.400
A phone can indicate that its traffic is important by mocking traffic at least three now at least three

2
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:14.140
we would be using an IP version for header or IP version 6 header in this course will concentrate on

3
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.160
IP version 4 in an IP version 4 header.

4
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.830
There is a field called type of service.

5
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:30.330
It consists of eight binary values now in the old days we used to only look at the most significant

6
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.540
three bits.

7
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.670
So these three bits of the header were read by routers and networking devices to determine how important

8
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:52.140
the traffic is and the same way as cause the valleys are from zero all the way up to 7 so 0 1 to follow

9
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.100
up to 7.

10
00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.330
Voice once again would be marked with a cos value of 5 so a phone as an example would markets traffic

11
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:06.450
at Layer 2 and then market at least 3 to indicate how important the traffic is.

12
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.920
The problem with this mechanism is we only have 7 classes close to zero would be used for best effort.

13
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.280
In other words you are not going to get a decent quality of service and often 6 or 7 or both are used

14
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.830
for network protocols so you are limited in the number of classes that you can use for traffic.

15
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:35.280
So voice maybe using 5 video maybe using 4 What are you going to use for ERP or business traffic vs.

16
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.090
HDP traffic versus other traffic on your network.

17
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.360
You're running out of classes and in addition the classes weren't standardized so any traffic could

18
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.150
end up in any class so this was adjusted to use 6 binary bits.

19
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.680
And this is known as DCP or differentiated services code points.

20
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.130
It's the same field in the IP version 4 header.

21
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.610
It's just the interpretation of the bits rather than using three bits six bits in the header are read

22
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:13.090
and marked to determine how important the traffic is this is known as IP precedence.

23
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.160
So when only three bits are used it's known as IP precedence when 6 bits are used.

24
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:26.320
It's known as differentiated services code points or DCP now DCP is backward compatible to IP precedents.

25
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:33.160
These values in DCP are known as class selector values or CSR values.

26
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:41.090
So you may see someone talk about this being IP precedents 5 but they may also mention this as CLOs

27
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.650
select a 5.

28
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:52.400
It depends whether we're using the old naming convention of IP precedents or or the newer DCP descriptions.
