00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.040
How many layers are there in networking.

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.260
Do we have a four layer TPP model or perhaps a five layer TPP IP model.

3
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.260
Or do we have a seven layer oversight model.

4
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.890
How many layers are there.

5
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.590
Why do we actually care.

6
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:28.600
Now in the previous version of the CCMA we were taught the over side model which consists of seven layers

7
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.050
starting at the top.

8
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.750
It's inverted.

9
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:38.230
So from layer seven to layer one all people slipping through networking don't POS Well that's not actually

10
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:38.850
what it is.

11
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:45.480
It's actually application presentation session transport network data link and physical layer.

12
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:53.050
Now that caused a lot of confusion a lot of people have debated how relevant the OSA model is in today's

13
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:53.970
networks.

14
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.510
Have a look here on Twitter.

15
00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:03.210
Rob tweeted I've got three hours to kill in an airport lounge and I'm going to discuss the OSA model.

16
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.810
There's no such thing.

17
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.830
What they taught you was a lie and they knew it but they didn't care.

18
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.150
And that's interesting.

19
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.530
People in the real world are saying that the OSA model is rubbish.

20
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.830
Other people are saying well that's not true.

21
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.810
The OSA model is required.

22
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.140
Now Ivan is someone that I recommend that you follow on Twitter or go to his website and sign up for

23
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.100
his free courses.

24
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.940
Ivan is someone who doesn't mess around.

25
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.430
As in he speaks what he thinks he will tell you what is true and what is not true.

26
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.670
I highly recommend that you follow Ivan and perhaps you know take some of these free courses if nothing

27
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.940
else.

28
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.570
Follow him on Twitter and read his blog posts.

29
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.160
Now if you'd really need to networking you may not understand everything that he talks about.

30
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.280
Don't worry most of us struggle with some of the concepts.

31
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.860
Ivan is really intelligent has years and years of experience.

32
00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:04.750
But if you want to learn from someone who has got lots of experience and can help you in your networking

33
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.530
career follow him on Twitter are basically in his response.

34
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.630
Ivan is saying that we do need the OSA model and if people have followed the US model life would be

35
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.360
a lot simpler today.

36
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.380
Now I don't want to muddy the waters just as you starting with the OSA model and the TTP IP model.

37
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.700
Again I'll tell you what you need to know for the exam.

38
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:32.230
But just note that nothing in life is as simple as it seems sometimes there are gray areas in the OSA

39
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.090
model and the TCB IP model they taking what's called a protocol stack.

40
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.760
In other words different protocols that do different things and they try and put it into neat layers.

41
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.130
Now that's not always clear cut and it's not always possible to take protocols and put them neatly into

42
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:54.520
individual layers because some developers have programmed the applications to do things that supposedly

43
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.150
they shouldn't be doing.

44
00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.260
We are told in the CCN course that specific layers should talk to specific layers but that doesn't always

45
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.300
happen that way.

46
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.130
So moral of the story is for the real world.

47
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:15.480
Things get more complicated and people get into these rants or discussions if you like about the OSA

48
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.320
model is rubbish or we shouldn't be learning the OSA model.

49
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:27.850
We shouldn't be learning the TTP IP model and then people code stuff from various CCN a box showing

50
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.380
an original TTP IP model and an updated TTP IP model.

51
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.070
And just to further complicate it here's a whole range of different models.

52
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.160
Now the original model comes from RC eleven 22.

53
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.190
This is a four layer model.

54
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:49.510
We have what's called an application layer transport layer Internet layer and link layer.

55
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:56.800
The Cisco Academy talks about Internet model being application transport into network and network interface.

56
00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:03.370
But then on wikipedia here they start quoting different books and what you'll notice we have a five

57
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.670
layer TTP IP model and then a four plus one layer and then right at the end we have a seven layer over

58
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:10.970
assigned model.

59
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:17.050
Now the OS model once again is what was taught in previous versions of the CCMA in this version of the

60
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.860
CCMA.

61
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:26.340
They are teaching the so-called five layer TPP model which is a combination of the original RF C 11

62
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.430
22 TTP IP model and the OSA models.

63
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.380
So basically it's a hybrid of multiple models.

64
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.280
Now the reason we have a model is we taking a complex problem and we breaking it up into smaller components

65
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.690
or smaller pieces.

66
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.340
This has been done for many many years.

67
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:50.170
The Romans had a divide and conquer policy so we divide a problem into smaller parts and then we conquer

68
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.190
smaller parts rather than trying to do everything in one go.

69
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.990
Models are used in many places as an example if you're building a house you typically have a blueprint

70
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.810
or a model of what the House is going to look like.

71
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:08.920
So before you even dig the foundations a model is created or a blueprint is created of what the House

72
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.280
is going to look like.

73
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:16.810
It makes a lot more sense to create a blueprint of a house and then have specific people work on specific

74
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.540
parts of the building and do what they are good at.

75
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:27.270
So as an example a plumber will work on the plumbing an electrician will concentrate on the electricity

76
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.790
a bricklayer will concentrate on laying the bricks.

77
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:36.520
But they all work together to correct to the end result which is the house that you want built.

78
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:42.970
It's going to be much easier to have a blueprint or a model that everyone works towards to build something

79
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.590
rather than them just arriving on site and then saying let's bulldoze house but they don't actually

80
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.090
know what the house looks like.

81
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.930
You have an electrician working on the plumbing or a plumber working on bricklaying.

82
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.050
That's not going to scale very well.

83
00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:04.240
So we have a model of a network and then we have specific layers or specific components or subunits

84
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.770
if you like that people specialize in and concentrate on that layer.

85
00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:14.700
So manufacturer of fiber cables concentrates on building this to a specification.

86
00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:21.580
If you're a application developer you don't worry so much about the physical layer or how data is transmitted

87
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:28.090
from let's say the US to Europe across the Atlantic using light under the ocean.

88
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.240
You concentrate on building your application.

89
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:35.890
So we have different layers in the oversight model and different people concentrate on different layers.

90
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:41.650
Now the layers that we as networking people concentrate on are the lower four layers which in the OSA

91
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:46.150
model are called transport network data link and physical.

92
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:53.450
In the new version of the CCMA they are using this hybrid model where they've taken parts of the oversized

93
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.430
model and added it to the TTP IP model.

94
00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:04.780
So rather than the original model of just a link layer or network interface layer we actually have what's

95
00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:10.360
called the data link layer which is called Layer 2 and the physical layer which is layer one we accounting

96
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:19.500
upwards through the layers from layer 1 being the physical layer so ignoring all the debates and all

97
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:25.590
the wars if you like on Twitter about which model is important and why we care about models.

98
00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:27.840
This is what you need to know.

99
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:33.950
You need to know both the OS model and TTP IP model but concentrate on the TTP IP model.

100
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:40.160
The OSA model which consists of the seven layers physical layer data link layer network layer transport

101
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:47.300
layer session layer presentation layer and application layer isn't as important as the TTP IP hybrid

102
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.140
model if you like.

103
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:54.950
So a five layer TTP IP model which is more real world which has a physical layer data link layer network

104
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:58.990
layer transport layer and a combined application layer.

105
00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:07.700
But notice we talk about Layer 7 applications because of the history of the OSA model being used.

106
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.400
So notice we have layer one layer to layer three layer for those are the layers that we concentrate

107
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.720
on as a networking person.

108
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:21.710
And then we have a combined layer 5 2 Layer 7 called the application layer but we still referred to

109
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.450
it as application layer.

110
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:28.430
Now I'm gonna show you this practically using Packet Tracer but I want you to download this yourself

111
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:29.840
and try it.

112
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:36.230
So don't just follow me do this yourself and see if you can answer some of these questions yourself

113
00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:42.950
and see if you can understand the various layers in Packet Tracer they still have the seven layers of

114
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:48.410
the OSA model but what you'll notice is layer five and layer six are basically ignored for for the most

115
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:53.180
part we concentrate on the lower four layers and then layer seven the application layer.
