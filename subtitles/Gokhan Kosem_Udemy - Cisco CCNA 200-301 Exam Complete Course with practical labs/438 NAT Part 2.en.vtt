00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.990
Before going any further Here's a demonstration.

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.400
I've disabled all network interface cards on my PC except for the wireless interface card.

3
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:21.130
When I look at the details of that card I can see that my IP address is 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 8 9 and I have

4
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:28.870
a default gateway of 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 2 5 4 I can view that in a CMG prompt as an example.

5
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:37.190
So on my PC type IP config see the IP address see the default gateway.

6
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.500
I can ping Google dot com

7
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.120
so notice I'm getting replies from Google dot com.

8
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.250
I can access Google dot com.

9
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.830
So here's the Google web site.

10
00:00:53.990 --> 00:01:04.800
But when I type what is my IP address into Google I'm told by Google that this is my public IP address.

11
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:17.720
IP config again shows me that my internal IP address or private IP address is 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 8 9 but

12
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.860
my public IP address is this.

13
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:31.250
So in this example my internet router at home is connected to the Internet and this route is configured

14
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.980
with DHP.

15
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.010
It's allocating IP addresses to devices internally using DHP.

16
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:45.350
And one of those IP addresses was allocated to my local PC but when I go on to the internet my address

17
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:53.640
used is a public IP address so a network address translation essentially translates a private IP address

18
00:01:53.910 --> 00:02:01.230
which is non-radical on the Internet to a publicly ratable IP address your public IP address is typically

19
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:07.560
allocated to you by your service provider which in my case is British Telecom or BT.

20
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:14.880
Here in the UK in large networks companies may register their own public IP addresses.

21
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:29.090
Yarrow's some well-known examples Hewlett Packard own $15.00 flechette and 16 Apple own 17 and 18 forward

22
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.940
19 AT&amp;T 32 and so on.

23
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.670
And IBM is an example nine dot sera sera sera.

24
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:49.140
So as an example if you working with HP or with an apple you may not be using a private IP address such

25
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.120
as this.

26
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.010
You may actually have a public IP address allocated to your PC.

27
00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.900
These are globally readable public IP addresses that were registered by some of the largest companies

28
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.980
in the world but IP addresses are running out.

29
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.510
So in most small medium businesses today you'll be using a private IP address internally.
