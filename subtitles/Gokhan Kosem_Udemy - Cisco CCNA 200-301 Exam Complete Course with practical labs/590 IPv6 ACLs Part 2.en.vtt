00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:05.870
Now APB 6 access lists are similar to IP version for access lists.

2
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:12.660
Here are some examples both can match on the source IP address or destination IP address in the protocol

3
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:24.330
header IP vs 6 AC ls on IP vs 6 IP addresses IP version 4 access lists on IP version for addresses both

4
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.400
can match individual host addresses or subnets or prefixes.

5
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.790
In other words you can match an individual host in IP vs 6 and permit or deny that host or you could

6
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:44.340
permit or deny a IP version 6 subnet both IP version 4 and IP version 6 are applied in an inbound or

7
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.780
outbound direction on a layer 3 interface such as a routers interface or switch to the virtual interface

8
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.830
on a switch both IP version for an IP version 6 can match on transport layer protocol information such

9
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:04.800
as DCP or UDP source port number or destination port number.

10
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.090
Both can also match ICMP message types and codes.

11
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:17.880
Be careful there aren't differences between the types and codes in IP version 6 vs. IP version for both

12
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.980
have an implicit deny statement at the end that matches all remaining packets so a deny any any after

13
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:33.900
the end of both IP version for an IP version 6 both also support time based access lists.

14
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.750
Now there are some differences between IP version for an IP version 6 IP version for access lists only

15
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:48.790
match IP version 4 packets and not IP version 6 and also only match fields in IP version for headers.

16
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:54.960
We have this concept of ships in the night IP version 6 is totally independent and separate to IP vision

17
00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.190
for so what IP version for is doing has nothing to do with IP version 6 and what IP version 6 is doing

18
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.410
has nothing to do with IP version for IP version 6 could be permitted but IP version for could be denied.

19
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:15.600
As an example IP version 6 access lists match on IP version 6 addresses only so it matches on source

20
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.500
destination IP version 6 address as well as other fields unique to an IP version 6 had a.

21
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.940
Yes some examples of the differences between IP version for an IP version 6 IP version 4 access lists

22
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:36.690
once again only match IP version for packets IP version 6 access lists only match IP version 6 packets

23
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.910
IP version for access lists identified by a name or a number but IP version 6 access lists only use

24
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:54.420
names IP version for access lists identify whether an access list is extended or standard by using either

25
00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:02.430
numbers such as one to ninety nine being standard access lists or one hundred two one ninety nine being

26
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:09.930
extended access lists or they use keywords such as Standard or extended IP version 6 access lists.

27
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.710
Use a similar convention of Standard and extended access lists but they are only differentiated by the

28
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:24.240
use of a word rather than a number because numbers are not used in IP version 6.

29
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:31.260
IP version for access lists can match on specific values unique to IP version for such as precedence

30
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:39.210
type of service TTL and fragments where as IP version 6 access lists a match on specific values unique

31
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:47.550
to an IP version 6 header such as a flow label or a DCP Valley as well as extensions an option had a

32
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:53.730
values IP version 6 access lists have some implicit permit statements at the end of each access list

33
00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:00.900
just above the implicit deny all at the end of the access list with IP version for access lists do not

34
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.600
have implicit permit statements.
