00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.490
Once traffic is identified it can be treated in a number of different ways.

2
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.720
You could as an example give it a minimum amount of bandwidth.

3
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:15.100
You could give it a maximum amount of bandwidth or a limit on the amount of bandwidth that it can send

4
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:22.510
some queuing mechanisms provide a minimum bandwidth guarantee policing and shaping the limit the amount

5
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.370
of traffic that you can transmit.

6
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:32.320
So polices and shapers are both great limiters but they differ in how they treat excess traffic as a

7
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.790
general rule of thumb.

8
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:40.640
Polices will drop excess traffic with traffic shapers will delay excess traffic.

9
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:46.930
In this example we've got traffic sent at different rates and administrator has configured a maximum

10
00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.860
limit.

11
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:55.760
However as shown by this line here with policing any excess traffic is automatically dropped.

12
00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:02.980
So polices will perform checks for traffic violations against a configured rate set by an administrator

13
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:10.030
which could be you to action that a police takes in response to traffic would either be dropping the

14
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.160
traffic as shown here or it could remark excess traffic and still transmit the traffic.

15
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:23.200
There are different options you could just transmit the traffic as long as you are below the threshold.

16
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.560
You could configure a police search or send the traffic without any modification as long as it's below

17
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.480
the configured threshold when it goes above the configured threshold.

18
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.240
You could read market but still transmit it and that would be true for traffic between the threshold

19
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.880
and a second threshold but any traffic exceeding the second threshold would be dropped.

20
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:53.900
We have this concept of a tri color or three color implementation when traffic is below the first threshold

21
00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:00.410
it's transmitted as normal when it exceeds the first threshold but it's below a second threshold.

22
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.440
It will be remarked to our lower class.

23
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.930
So in other words you are moved from first class to economy as an example but to the traffic is still

24
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:09.760
transmitted.

25
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.170
And when you go above the second threshold you are simply kicked off the plane or in a data network.

26
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.820
The traffic has dropped.

27
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.980
What's important to understand about polices is that they do not delay traffic.

28
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.390
They will check the traffic and either remarketing and transmit it or drop it.

29
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.190
They do not buffer or delay traffic shapers on the other hand will delay traffic.

30
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.540
So they try and smooth traffic out by buffering it.

31
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.120
So if we look at our original traffic when it's shaped notice the curve.

32
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:49.220
Here is a lot smoother as the traffic is delayed so that it falls within a configured bitrate so the

33
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.610
shape doesn't drop the traffic but smooth it out by delaying the traffic to make sure that over a period

34
00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:03.080
of time the traffic falls within a configured bitrate shape as are usually used to meet service level

35
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.080
agreements when the traffic spikes above the contracted rate.

36
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:13.580
The excess traffic is buffered and is delayed until it falls below the contracted rate.

37
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.550
Polices are a lot harsher.

38
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:23.120
They will drop as effective way as a shaper will try and smooth the traffic out over a period of time

39
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.880
to get it below a configured rate.
