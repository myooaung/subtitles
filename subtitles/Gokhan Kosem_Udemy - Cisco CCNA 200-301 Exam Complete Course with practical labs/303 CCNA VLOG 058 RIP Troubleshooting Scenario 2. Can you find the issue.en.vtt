00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.130
This is one of multiple videos discussing group writing information protocol.

2
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.990
We've been told that in this typology of one is not able to ping the loop back of a Rato for so let's

3
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:29.910
verify that on Route 1 paying for a photo for that for we can see in the output that the pings are not

4
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:38.010
successful trace to 4.4 that for trace route doesn't seem to be going anywhere.

5
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.580
Let's do a de-bug IP packet to confirm what's going on.

6
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:51.460
Be careful in the real world with the de-bug IP packet and you don't want to run that on a live network

7
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.170
without using an Access list to limit the output.

8
00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:05.780
You'll get a huge amount of information otherwise some of a ton of debugging and notice we see unreadable.

9
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.590
The packet is not readable.

10
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:17.510
We are in the output seeing that the local router is sending updates on 2 to 4 0 0.

11
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:26.250
Knowing that is the multicast address for rep so show IP protocols shows us that Ruppert is running

12
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:34.320
on the local router is advertising various networks and we are receiving information from a router with

13
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.160
IP address 10 1 1 2 which is routed to show IP route shows the wrong table.

14
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.650
We all learning some routes so as an example we should be able to ping the loopback of router to which

15
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:54.840
we can because of the data entry but we don't see Network 10 1 2 3 0 in the local writing table.

16
00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.010
We don't see networks 3 and we don't see network 4.

17
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:07.370
So it looks like there's a problem on Rodda too not to show IP ROFFT.

18
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.670
We are learning about network 1 which is the loopback part of one but we are not seeing any other rats

19
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.070
in the writing table.

20
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.270
Show IP database shows us the database.

21
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:26.190
We see the local interfaces and we see interfaces connected to one but we don't see rodded three or

22
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.950
four debug IP rep.

23
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.350
Let's see if the D-Backs show us anything OK we already see a problem.

24
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:44.300
When I stop the debug notice this ignored version 1 packet from 10 1 or 2 to 2.

25
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.360
The legal version.

26
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:57.200
So let's see what's going on show IP protocols on route to Ruppel enabled the default send and receive

27
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.510
version is Version 2.

28
00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:08.340
Version 2 is being sent and received on both physical interfaces as well as the loopback but we are

29
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:19.080
receiving a version one packet from 10 to 1 to 2 to 2 which is Raanta 3 son rotas 3 show IP protocols

30
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.270
is running on rodders 3.

31
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.730
Can you see the problem.

32
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:34.540
Default St version is version to receive version is version 2 but on gigabit 0 0 the second version

33
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.180
is version 1 receive version is version 2.

34
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:48.190
So show IP razzia shows that this router is learning about the loopback of Rotto one such receiving

35
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:55.590
routes from router 3 but its not sending routes to route 3.

36
00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:05.190
That's because it's accepting version 2 updates which is what router 2 is sending but Rotto 3 is sending

37
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.450
version 1 updates and Keiga it to 0 0.

38
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.210
So show run interface gigabit 0 0.

39
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.030
Notice this command IP St.

40
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.090
Version 1.

41
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:26.360
So on that interface I'll use the no IP rumpus and version 1 to show run interface geek give it 0 0.

42
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.720
C'mon has been removed.

43
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.630
Show IP ROFFT on brought to.

44
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:40.760
We haven't learnt any Roths yet debug IP rep is a slow protocol but notice we are already receiving

45
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:48.710
updates about network fall back on router 3 show IP raht shows us that the rats on the running table

46
00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.760
are brought it to show IP Brott.

47
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:59.130
We've now learnt about network for paying for that looks better.

48
00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.230
What about I'm not a one paying quadruple for Pingu works.

49
00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.520
So we've resolved the issue with the OP in this network.

50
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.090
Be careful with your versions.

51
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.450
Let's just turn off that debug show.

52
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:14.600
IP protocols

53
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:25.510
shows you the version sent and received on individual interfaces show IP protocols.

54
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:34.510
Make sure that your versions are set correctly so that both sides are using the same version for sending

55
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:35.770
and receiving.

56
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.570
I hope you enjoyed this video.
