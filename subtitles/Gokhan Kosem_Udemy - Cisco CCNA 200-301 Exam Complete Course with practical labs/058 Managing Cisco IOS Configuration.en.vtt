00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
My local PC has an IP address of 192.168.56.252

2
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and I’m running some free software called TFTP 32

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
so on the router lets first see

4
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
if I can ping the TFTP server, which I can

5
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It's important to check that you’ve got connectivity

6
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
so now I'll type copy running-config ?

7
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and I have the option TFTP, so I'm gonna say tftp

8
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:44.000
the IP address of the TFTP server is 192.168.56.252

9
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I'll accept the default file name of r1-config or config

10
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
as you can see the file is being copied to the TFTP server

11
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and I can see that in the output on the router as well.

12
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So many bytes have been copied in so many seconds.

13
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
In windows I'll open the file with word pad and as you can see here

14
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I have a configuration of my router. So let’s make a change.

15
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I'll set the line vty from 0 to 20 (line vty 0 20)

16
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
specify login and specify a password of cisco

17
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000
that is different to this current config on the TFTP server

18
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I’ll copy the config to the TFTP server again.

19
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I’ll specify the same filename and let's open up the file

20
00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and as you can see now, the changes have been made.

21
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So the file was successfully copied to the TFTP server.

22
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
It's good practice once again to copy a config

23
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I could also copy the start up config to the TFTP server.

24
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Specify the IP address and let’s view the actual copy taking place.

25
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I’ll call this r1-start-config

26
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and that file has been copied to the TFTP server,

27
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
we can also see that on the router and in windows.

28
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I can see the startup config.

29
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Now what’s important to note is

30
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000
the startup config is different to the running config,

31
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
so notice the VTY lines are different on startup and running config.

32
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
so once again if I look at the startup of the router

33
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I have login login as the commands with no passwords

34
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and to make the point I'll change the router's names to R1-run

35
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
so sh start | i host

36
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
shows me that the name of the router in the startup config is R1

37
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
but the name of the file in running config is R1-run.

38
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:37.000
so I can type copy, before I do that once again sh start | b vty

39
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
that’s the config in the startup config but if I type copy tftp start

40
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
this will overwrite the config in startup config.

41
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
I’m gonna specify the running config not the startup config

42
00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.000
but I’m gonna overwrite the startup config with the running config stored on the TFTP server.

43
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
So that’s completed.

44
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:11.000
So if I type sh start | b vty which looked like this previously, notice its changed.

45
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
So the startup config has been overwritten with the config on the TFTP server.

46
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Let’s try copying from TFTP to running config

47
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:30.000
in this case I'll specify the startup config on the TFTP server

48
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
but merge that with the running configuration.

49
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Notice as an example that the router name has changed.

50
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
sh run | b vty

51
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Some config has remained because it’s done a merged.

52
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
So as an example notice the passwords are still showing on the VTY lines

53
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
where’s in this config file that we copied

54
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
there were no passwords specified on the VTY lines.

55
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:09.000
So a copy from TFTP to startup is an override of NVRAM

56
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
or replacement of a saved configuration

57
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000
but a copy from TFTP to running config is a merge of the configuration.

58
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Now we could have done configure replace tftp

59
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:32.000
but I need to specify the IP address of the TFTP server

60
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and the file name that I’m gonna use

61
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:44.000
and that will now replace the running config

62
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
and you can see as an example that commands have been rolled back.

63
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
So now if you type sh run | b vty

64
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000
notice the password have been removed from the running config.

65
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
So in summary copy  run to start is an override

66
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
a startup config with running config

67
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000
a copy from startup config to running config is a merge not an override

68
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
When you configure through the terminal  by using configure terminal

69
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000
that’s a merge of configurations, copy TFTP to run is a merge

70
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
you can backup your configs and you should to TFTP servers.

71
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
So copy run to tftp or copy start to tftp.

72
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
erase start erases the startup-config

73
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
so essentially removes it and the router is set back to defaults.

74
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
So we'll do that as a last test

75
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.000
erase startup-config hit enter to confirm.

76
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
startup config has been erased

77
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
I’m gonna reload and not save the configuration

78
00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and what will happen now is the router will reboot with no configuration

79
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
If you’re not interested in seeing this skip ahead

80
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
but otherwise I'm gonna show you the boot process on this router

81
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
and show you  that it's starts up again

82
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.000
asking us to complete the initial configuration dialogue.

83
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:18.000
You can see once again that this is a 1841 router

84
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
it's decompressing the image at the moment.

85
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:30.000
We can see the system bootstrap version which is different to the main IOS

86
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
It's now booting the IOS, which is this version of software.

87
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:45.000
We can see  router platform, amount of memory, interfaces in the router

88
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000
amount of NVRAM, size of flashcard and once again size of RAM

89
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
so running config is stored in RAM, startup config is stored in NVRAM

90
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:03.000
and the IOS image is stored on flash and then loaded into memory

91
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
when the router is booted

92
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
It's sending a broadcast into the network

93
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:16.000
to try and get a network config file, it then tries to get a cisconet.cfg file.

94
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
We're asked if we want to enter the initial configuration dialogue.

95
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000
I've hit no, so we are now at the CLI prompt on the router.

96
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000
sh start shows me that I have no startup config.

97
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
sh run shows me the default configuration on this router.
