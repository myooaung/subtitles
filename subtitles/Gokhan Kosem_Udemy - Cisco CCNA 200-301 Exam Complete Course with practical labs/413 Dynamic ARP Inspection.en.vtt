00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.870
Zebra What are you doing.

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:09.410
How are you a nasty zebra worth while guarding zebra.

3
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.580
Let's break some model locks in this video.

4
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.190
I'm gonna show you how to implement dynamic up inspection dynamic up inspection stops attacks such as

5
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.370
OP poisoning.

6
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:25.030
And man in the middle attacks in a previous video which I've linked here and below I showed you how

7
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:31.960
to use Kelly or Collie Linux if you prefer to implement a man in the middle attack by poisoning of the

8
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.120
OP caches of devices.

9
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:40.900
We had Kelly poisoning the OP cache of a Windows device and a Cisco router and then implementing a man

10
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.770
in the middle attack where all traffic from that Windows host to its default gateway.

11
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:52.330
The Cisco rider was routed or switched in this case through the Kelly linux host So Carly was able to

12
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.440
see all the traffic from Windows to the rider and windows to the Internet.

13
00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.180
As an example we were able to capture telnet passwords and HDP passwords.

14
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.600
You shouldn't be using clear text protocols in your network today so you shouldn't be using protocols

15
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.620
such as HDP or telnet but if someone did use clear text passwords I'd have visibility of those passwords

16
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.260
and have visibility of the data because all traffic is sent through the Kelly linux host.

17
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.720
Which in this case implemented a man in the middle attack.

18
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.560
We can stop that kind of nonsense by implementing dynamic OP inspection dynamic OP inspection requires

19
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:36.670
either DHB snooping or that you manually configure MAC addresses these switches basically snooping or

20
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:44.620
listening in on the HP requests from hosts or devices to the DHB server and then is creating dynamically

21
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.290
when using DHB snooping a MAC address to IP address mapping to an interface.

22
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.970
So it says this MAC address this IP address belongs on this interface.

23
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.120
If you change your mac address that traffic is denied and I'm going to demonstrate that using Kelly

24
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.920
Linux in this video.

25
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:10.540
So I'm going to show you how you can implement the HP snooping dynamic OP inspection and then stop Kelly

26
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.690
from sending traffic when it changes its Mac address.

27
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.170
So we're going to stop stop poisoning attacks.

28
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.300
Now to make it easier I've added this presentation below this video.

29
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.840
This presentation shows you the network that I'm using and then shows you how to configure dynamic IP

30
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.780
inspection.

31
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.410
So I've got links in here to Cisco and other websites that give you more information but I also show

32
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:42.970
you how to configure both DHB snooping as well as dynamic of inspection.

33
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.210
So in this video I'm going to show you quite a lot of detail how this all works.

34
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.930
Use the menu here to jump to a specific topic if you want to.

35
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.800
So going to show you how to set up DHB snooping but I've covered that once again in this video so if

36
00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.380
you just want to see the dynamic IP inspection part of the video then jump to the specific timestamp

37
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.000
of interest.

38
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.660
I've included this once again below this video.

39
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:25.600
This presentation shows you how to set this up how to verify it on a Cisco switch.

40
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.890
Now the first thing we need to do is enable DHB snooping.

41
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.770
Now I've covered this and a lot of detail in a previous video so all I'm going to do here is copy and

42
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.690
paste the commands into the switch.

43
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:39.720
Have a look at this video.

44
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.070
If you want to look at a DHB snooping video that discusses this in a lot of detail.

45
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:52.660
Okay so what I'm gonna do is copy the commands from this presentation and paste the commands on our

46
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.300
switch.

47
00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:00.210
Now you're not topology once again we've got a Cisco broader this rider is configured with a DHB server.

48
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:09.140
So let's view that first here's the raw data show run pipe.

49
00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:20.310
Begin DHEA P that just allows me to falter the configuration until the keyword DHEA P is found so there's

50
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.610
the command.

51
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.880
Here's my DHB pull.

52
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.900
You can see the network used its 10 1 1 0 slash 24.

53
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:37.660
Default right or default gateway is the local router a DNS server is set to google the router has this

54
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.400
IP address 10 1 1 2 5 4 configured on gigabit 0.

55
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:52.030
So this interface is configured with the IP address 10 1 1 2 5 4 and the right is allocating IP addresses

56
00:04:52.030 --> 00:05:00.070
to devices and we can see that by typing show IP DHB binding we can see that two devices have received

57
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.540
IP addresses.

58
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.390
This is the IP address allocated to Kelly Linux.

59
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.080
This is the IP address allocated to the Windows computer.

60
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.520
We can verify that

61
00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.290
by using the command IP address on Kelly.

62
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:24.860
Notice there's the IP address allocated to the Kelly linux host and on the Windows computer.

63
00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:30.410
I'll open up a C and D prompt IP config.

64
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:36.220
This is the IP address of the windows computer so the DHB server has been configured.

65
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.220
It's allocating IP addresses to the devices in the network.

66
00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:45.730
What we need to do now is configure DHB snooping on the switch.

67
00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:53.660
At the moment no DHB snooping has been enabled so you can see that no DCP commands have been enabled

68
00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.790
and we haven't enabled dynamic up inspection.

69
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:05.240
Okay so the first thing I'm gonna do is copy the DHB P snooping commands to the switch

70
00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.600
so paste those in

71
00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.450
and you can see here that DHB snooping has been enabled globally.

72
00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:24.390
It's been enabled for VLAN 1.

73
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:34.560
We've disabled option 82 and the command show IP DHB snooping shows us that to DHB snooping is now enabled

74
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:40.500
on v 1 no trusted ports have been configured yet.

75
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.150
Now once again I've shown you previously how to configure the HP snooping and I've explained it in a

76
00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.370
lot of detail so I'm not doing that here.

77
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:48.910
Okay.

78
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:58.710
The next step is to configure trusted ports in mind topology gigabit 0 0 is a trusted port Okay so it

79
00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.120
might topology gigabit.

80
00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:09.150
0 0 is the interface that connects to the rotor the rotor is running the DHB service it's allocating

81
00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:18.360
IP addresses we want to trust the CHP server we don't want to trust this Kelly linux host as a DHB server.

82
00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:30.360
So back on the switch I'm going to paste those commands gigabit 0 0 is now a trusted interface show

83
00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:41.040
IP the DHB snooping we can see that gigabit 0 0 is now a trusted interface now we can also reached a

84
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:50.700
limit DHEA P requests to stop a denial of service attack so I'm going to rate limit DCP messages to

85
00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:59.070
10 packets per second on gigabit 0 1 which is the interface connecting me to the Kelly linux host again

86
00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:04.170
I've explained that in a lot of detail in the previous video sold piece to that in

87
00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.070
got to type quantity first.

88
00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:17.080
So try that again.

89
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:18.980
There we go.

90
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:23.200
So show run interface gigabit 00.

91
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:26.090
We are trusting this interface.

92
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:30.130
We are not trusting this interface.

93
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:36.740
This interface gigabit 0 1 is being rate limited 0 0 is being trusted.

94
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:44.000
Okay now that I've configured DHB snooping I can configure dynamic up inspection dynamic up inspection

95
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:53.150
is fairly simple to configure what we're going to do is configure it globally on the switch by using

96
00:08:53.150 --> 00:09:05.330
the command IP inspection VLAN 1 so confetti IP OPP inspection specify the VLAN my example it's v land

97
00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:16.070
1 because all ports on the switch are currently configured in VLAN 1 now typically in the real world

98
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:22.580
you wouldn't put your devices and VLAN one you would put them in a different VLAN now notice what's

99
00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:23.210
happening.

100
00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:28.870
We are already seeing invalid OP messages received on gigabit 02.

101
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:33.640
That is the windows host.

102
00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.020
We are not trusting anyone at the moment.

103
00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.450
We are basically blocking all traffic.

104
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:46.870
So the windows host is trying to get it to its default gateway so it's trying to get to 10 1 1 2 5 4.

105
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:52.970
There's the IP address of the windows host Mac address of the windows host trying to get to its default

106
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:57.050
gateway and the traffic is being denied.

107
00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:59.170
We can see that as an example on the windows.

108
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:06.170
P.S. If I try and ping the router it's not going to work.

109
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:07.100
Traffic is denied

110
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.800
and actually let me demonstrate this.

111
00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:19.580
I'm going to remove dynamic OP inspection so it's removed and what you'll notice is the P.C. the windows

112
00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:27.890
P.C. can ping the router but what you'll also notice is the Kelly Linux host can ping the P.C. which

113
00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:35.900
we don't want it to do and it can ping the router so Kelly can ping both the windows P.C. as well as

114
00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:44.540
the router but as soon as we enable dynamic up inspection we basically break the network because notice

115
00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:56.330
traffic from 10 1 1 2 2 10 1 1 100 is being denied because now when we try and ping say the windows

116
00:10:56.330 --> 00:11:06.830
host the traffic is denied Kelly is not able to ping the windows host and it's not able to ping its

117
00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:12.110
default gateway the windows host can't get to its default gateway.

118
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:13.070
That's a problem.

119
00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:16.880
We want it to be able to talk to its default gateway.

120
00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:24.810
So what we're going to do is set gigabit 0 0 as a trusted port.

121
00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:28.210
That's the port connecting us to the rotor.

122
00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:39.010
So on the switch interface gigabit 00 IP OPP inspection just use question mark again trust we are going

123
00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:46.160
to trust that interface so show run interface gigabit 00.

124
00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:56.880
This command shows us that this interface is trusted for DHB snooping as well as for OP inspection so

125
00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:00.590
now can the windows P.C. ping the rotor.

126
00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:03.800
At the moment we can see that it can't.

127
00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:08.670
We still getting a whole bunch of denies on the switch show IPD HP

128
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:14.910
snooping let's look at the bindings.

129
00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:16.060
Notice the problem.

130
00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.830
There are no D HP bindings at the moment.

131
00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:24.700
We are relying on the D HP bindings database to implement dynamic OP inspection.

132
00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:30.240
We need to have the bindings in the database for dynamic of inspection to work.

133
00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:39.920
So we are constantly getting these denies at the moment because there is no entry in the DHB snooping

134
00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:40.510
database.

135
00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:49.180
So I'm going to top IP config slash release to release my IP address and then I'm going to type renew

136
00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:53.660
to renew the IP address on the windows computer.

137
00:12:53.710 --> 00:13:04.030
It's now being given this IP address back on the switch show IP DHB snooping binding we can see that

138
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:13.990
this mac address has been given this IP address and we can see that via DHB snooping on VLAN 1 the interface

139
00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:19.420
where that host resides is gigabit 02 so back on the windows.

140
00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:24.610
P.S. Can it now ping its default gateway.

141
00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.720
And the answer is yes it can.

142
00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:34.100
So remember because we're using the HP snooping the pieces have to request IP addresses and those IP

143
00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:37.140
addresses have to be allocated through DHEA.

144
00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:43.340
We've got to have DHB snooping listening in on the conversation seeing that to the rider allocates the

145
00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:50.180
IP address to the P.C. and then because of that the DHB snooping databases bolt and dynamic up inspection

146
00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:55.190
can leverage that database to permit devices.

147
00:13:55.190 --> 00:14:02.870
So again on the switch show IP DHB snooping binding we can see that this IP address was allocated to

148
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:06.770
this Mac address on this interface.

149
00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:19.770
Now Kelly can stall not paying the default gateway because an IP address hasn't been added to the DHB

150
00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:21.280
snooping database.

151
00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:27.920
So what I'm going to do is edit connections in Kelly.

152
00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:33.490
I'm going to go to IP version 4 settings disable the interface

153
00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:42.560
go back and get it to use DHEA P

154
00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:53.450
I have config shows us that it's got its IP address

155
00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:04.070
show IP DHB binding on the switch you can see that this IP address has been allocated to this mac address

156
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:14.700
which is the Kelly Lennox host MAC address ends in 5 a 0 0 which is what we see over here.

157
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:20.080
So can the Kelly Lennox host ping the default gateway.

158
00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.030
Yes it can.

159
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:26.960
So on the switch once again show IP DHEA snooping binding.

160
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:39.780
We can see that two IP addresses have been allocated to specific MAC addresses show IP up inspection.

161
00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.260
So there's the command again.

162
00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:48.950
We can see that it's enabled for veal and one so many packets have been dropped.

163
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:59.460
Now on Kelly once again I have config shows me that this is the MAC address of the host ending in 5

164
00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:09.620
a 0 0 on the switch show IP DHB snooping database that MAC address has been allocated this IP address

165
00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:15.960
Kelly can paying default gateway.

166
00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:29.050
Once again that IP address this MAC address I'm gonna change the MAC address by using Mac changer Mac

167
00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:36.040
change it tells us that we can see the MAC address by using S. as an option and then we can create a

168
00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:48.070
random MAC address using dash bar or hyphen or so Mac change the dash s Ethernet zero that's the current

169
00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:49.480
mac address.

170
00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:53.440
That's the permanent MAC address scrolling up once again.

171
00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:57.830
That's the MAC address that we saw previously with I have config.

172
00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:02.210
So let's create a random MAC address.

173
00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:05.540
MAC address we've been told is now this.

174
00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:13.510
So I have config shows us that that is the new mac address that we've been given random MAC address.

175
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:19.030
Can we paying the default gateway answer is no we can't

176
00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.550
and we're seeing a lot of denies on the switch.

177
00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:31.990
You can't just create some random MAC address or try and implement ops spoofing or OP poisoning because

178
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:36.700
we've now got dynamic up inspection enabled on the switch.

179
00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:40.390
And I'll just stop the ping on Kelly.

180
00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:46.920
The only MAC address that's allowed is that MAC address on interface gigabit 0 1.

181
00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:51.310
This MAC address is permitted on gigabit 02.

182
00:17:51.700 --> 00:18:04.210
So by randomly changing my mac address using Mac changer from this address to this address traffic is

183
00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:14.530
now being denied it also stops someone from using an application such as a cap to poison the OP caches.

184
00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:24.910
So again previously I showed you how to use it a cap to poison hosts on the network so if I try and

185
00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:31.990
scan for hosts now that traffic is going to be denied by the switch because of dynamic up inspection

186
00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:39.970
I can't implement of poisoning by using at a cap unlike previously when I demonstrated it in this video

187
00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:44.370
because we've got a dynamic OP inspection enabled.

188
00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:44.620
Okay.

189
00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:49.750
Very long video once again but hopefully I've shown you clearly how to set up a dynamic of inspection

190
00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:56.200
and how to test it you can once again download this presentation if you want to have a summary of what

191
00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.680
we've done and you want to keep this as a reference.
