00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:08.270
At the moment Rudd 1 acting as P.S. One can ping Rudd of five acting is P.C. to turn off these dead

2
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.840
bugs.

3
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.970
Let's have a look at some show commands.

4
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:23.810
So first command on rather to show interface tunnel 0 tunnel 0 is up.

5
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:32.310
The hardware type is tunnel the IP address on the interfaces tended wondered three to one slash 30 the

6
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:38.970
encapsulation type is tunnel the tunnel sources forwarded Wandered Wandered one tunnel destination is

7
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:47.220
forwarded one door to the to the protocol and transport is GOP over IP version 4.

8
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:57.430
Notice the empty view has been reduced for this interface because of the headers used in Jari the empty

9
00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:06.640
you force serial to slash zero or maximum transmission unit for interface to slash a zero is fifteen

10
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:21.250
hundred points but the empty you for the jury tunnel is 15 14 so 1 5 5 0 minus 1 5 1 4 gives us 36 bytes

11
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.140
because of the additional headers used in jury the empty view is reduced.

12
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.440
In other words only smaller packets can be transmitted across the serial link because of the additional

13
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:40.850
headers added by GOP originally we only have a single IP header but now we have an additional IP header

14
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:48.140
called the delivery header as well as the GOP had a and we can see that by doing a y shock capture

15
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.300
so going to capture traffic on serial to slash 1 en route 3

16
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:07.340
send a ping from Rota 1 acting as P.S. 1 2 out of 5 acting as P.S. 2

17
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.910
Here's the ping I remember originally we would only have a single IP version for header with the payload

18
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:28.340
but now we have both the GOP header as well as the outer header or delivery header so the original packet

19
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.490
over here as received by at to

20
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.490
doesn't include the jury headers.

21
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.080
So when we do that ping again

22
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.360
this is the first Ethernet interface on rudder to

23
00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:04.270
we can see the ping message with the standard IP version for header and Ethernet header but when that

24
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:12.780
goes across the serial interface nodes Cisco HDL HTC we see the original header and payload so there's

25
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:18.700
the ping but notice once again the additional header.

26
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:27.870
So we've got to the delivery had a as well as the GOP had a so additional headers have been added when

27
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:34.740
compared to the original packet because of that the empty view is reduced.

28
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:43.230
You can only send a maximum packet size of 15 14 bytes because of the additional headers.

29
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:53.900
So once again on serial to slash 0 the empty use fifteen hundred points but on the tunnel interface

30
00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.330
it's 15 14 bytes because of the additional headers.

31
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:10.230
You can also see some information by using the command show IP interface tunnel 0 scrolling up here's

32
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:18.570
the command tunnel interface 0 0 is up up IP addresses tendered wonder 3 to 1 slash 3 broadcast is thus

33
00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:28.910
empty use 14 76 bytes once again multicast reserved group joined includes 2 2 4 0 0 10 which if you

34
00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:35.390
remember is the multicast group for UI GOP ya job he's able to form a neighbor relationship across this

35
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:42.350
tunnel interface in a very similar way to how you would form it across a serial interface because this

36
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:49.960
is a point to point a link logically directly from one writer to the other so as an example show API

37
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:59.120
GOP neighbor Robert too has a neighbor relationship with Robert a 4 on this IP address and not on this

38
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:08.600
IP address because the neighbor relationship is formed across the tunnel show IPR GOP topology we have

39
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:20.930
learnt a round 10 1 2 0 via 10 1 3 2 through tunnel 0 and once again a one is able to ping Rudd of 5

40
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:32.370
acting as a P.C. when we do a trace to 10 1 2 2 notice the trace goes to a 2 then to write a 4 through

41
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:40.110
the tunnel and then to write a 5 rod a 3 is not seen at all in the trace because logically write 2 is

42
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:48.190
directly connected to write a 4 in the same way write a 5 when tracing to 10 1 1 1 since the traffic

43
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:54.910
to write a 4 then logically to write a 2 and then to write a 1.
