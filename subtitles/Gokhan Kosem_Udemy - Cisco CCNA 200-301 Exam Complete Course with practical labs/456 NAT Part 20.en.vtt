00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:06.080
That's once again how the rod is able to differentiate between the devices.

2
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:14.030
Let's have a look at both output in the show IP translations the boast output we can see when it was

3
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.800
created.

4
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.290
So this one was created two minutes and 38 seconds ago.

5
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.750
This one two minutes and 34 seconds ago you can see the use and the timeout and what's left on these

6
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:24.550
entries.

7
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:34.500
What's important to remember for dynamic not translations such as this is that multiple internal IP

8
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.430
addresses are being tied to a single external IP address.

9
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.890
You mustn't forget to include the overload keyword.

10
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.280
If you forget to that key word only one device will be able to access the internet.

11
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:58.700
Overloading enables Pat or port address translation which allows multiple internal devices to share

12
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:06.260
the same global IP address and the router that's doing the nat well in this case port address translational

13
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.460
Pat can differentiate between the sessions based on the port numbers.
