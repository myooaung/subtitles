00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.230
So on the subnet 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 128 to slash 26.

2
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.030
We've been told to configure the Rada with the lost IP address in the subnet.

3
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.000
Now the next subnet is one ninety two.

4
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:27.070
So the broadcast address for the subnet will be 191 which means that this writer can be configured with

5
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.810
one ninety.

6
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.970
Have a look at the previous videos in this series.

7
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:40.860
If you're not sure how I worked that out so IP address 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 1 only 2 is the next subnet one

8
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:49.720
only 1 is the broadcast one ninety is the lost IP address in the subnet subnet mask is that and we know

9
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:58.310
that from our previous calculations the switch needs to use the second IP address in the subnet the

10
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:08.720
right is configured with one 90 so the switch I'll change the name to switch to will simply use IP address

11
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:18.660
1 point 2 1 6 8 1 1 89 so 1 less than the router

12
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.680
shutter the interface so ping 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 1 89.

13
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.770
That's our local IP address.

14
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.680
Can we ping the router.

15
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.360
Yes we can.

16
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:43.680
I'll also configure a default gateway on the switch pointing to the router switch as configured so the

17
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.160
switch once again is using one eighty nine.

18
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.930
The DNS server should use 188

19
00:01:53.150 --> 00:02:02.330
one less than the switch so static IP address of the DHB server is 1 8 2 1 6 8 1 88 public mask is 255

20
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:16.340
255 192 default gateway is the router 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 1 90 again that's the IP address of the router DNS

21
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.680
server will be Google.

22
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:26.890
So on the server can we ping the router type that right.

23
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.120
Yes we can.

24
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.910
Can we ping the switch.

25
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.380
Yes we can.

26
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.860
Can we.

27
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.630
Paying the DNS server.

28
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.540
Not at the moment because we need to configure the serial interface of the router.

29
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:52.970
But now let's configure the DHB server so DCP will enable the DHB service default gateway is going to

30
00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:03.110
be one ninety two so 1 so 1 8 2 1 6 8 1 1 Ninety DNS server is Google IP addresses that will allocate

31
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.230
all 1 9 2 1 6 8 1.

32
00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.760
Now you need to be careful.

33
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.750
The first host is one more then the subnet so it's 1 twenty.

34
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.460
Maximum number of hosts.

35
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.670
I'll allocate is 50 and I'll save that configuration.

36
00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.490
You could allocate more IP addresses in your pool or less if you wanted to so.

37
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.990
So for instance only allocate 10 just depends how many IP addresses in your subnet you want to have

38
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.040
for static IP addresses.

39
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:41.930
How many IP addresses you want for dynamic IP addresses so on the P.C. IP config IP address has been

40
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:42.770
allocated.

41
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.560
Ping 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 1 90.

42
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.320
That's the Rada.

43
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.880
That's the switch that's the DNS server.

44
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.480
What about PCI 5.

45
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.160
Just do one more here.

46
00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.830
IP config IP address has been allocated.

47
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.680
So can we ping the Rada.

48
00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.430
Yes we can.

49
00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.320
What about switch.

50
00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:07.670
Yes we can.

51
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.710
What about DNS server.

52
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:10.960
Yes we can.

53
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.490
We won't be able to ping 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 to 1.

54
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:22.910
P.S. And the other subnet because we still need to configure this serial link so let's configure the

55
00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:31.820
serial link the IP address of this rather on the serial interface is gonna be one more than the subnet

56
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.520
so show IP interface brief.

57
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:47.060
This serial interface needs to be configured with IP address 1 8 2 1 6 8 1 subnet is 1 only 2.

58
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.390
So first ip address will be 1 93 with that subnet mosque.

59
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.170
So can we ping 1 or 2 1 6 8 1 93.

60
00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:04.730
It won't work at this point because we need to configure the other side so on this rather show IP interface

61
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:12.770
brief we still need to configure the search interface it's currently down so no shut to that IP address

62
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:21.950
will be 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 and this is a little bit more difficult to work out the broadcast for the subnet.

63
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:31.610
Again you just populate the host portion with binary ones and what you'll notice is it's full of ones.

64
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:39.320
So that would equal 255 but one less than the broadcast is 254.

65
00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:49.380
So 254 subnet mask is that no shut to the interface again to show IP interface brief according to this

66
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.570
it's still down.

67
00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.800
Let's make sure that I've configured it right.

68
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.480
Show IP interface brief

69
00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:07.320
may have connected the wrong serial interface in this network and that looks like what I've done wrong

70
00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.970
serial interface.

71
00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.120
So what I'll do is delete that serial interface.

72
00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.060
I'll fix it in your lab so you don't have that problem.

73
00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:27.120
So that serial should be connected to that serial so show IP interface brief this interface is up up

74
00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.120
so can we ping 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 2 5 4.

75
00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.920
Yes we can.

76
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:41.040
So write too can ping the Internet router so hopefully these pieces can now paying the Internet which

77
00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:49.650
they can notice they can ping Cisco dot com as an example and they can paying Facebook a dot com.

78
00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:57.540
So going to the web browser on P.S. 3 can this P.C. get to Cisco dot com.

79
00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:58.950
Yes it can.

80
00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.930
Can it get to Facebook dot com.

81
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.400
Yes it can.

82
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:07.470
What about P.C. 5 web browser on P.C. 5.

83
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.570
Can we get to Cisco dot com.

84
00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:10.950
Yes We Can.

85
00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.120
Can we get to Facebook dot com.

86
00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.290
Yes we can.

87
00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:17.820
We can access these servers on the Internet.

88
00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:21.150
We've had to do quite a lot here as a lost test.

89
00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:29.640
Can the pieces in the one subnet ping pieces in the other subnet so can we ping one on 2 1 6 8 wandered

90
00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.310
1.

91
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.080
Yes we can.

92
00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:32.700
What about 1 to 2.

93
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.990
Yes we can.

94
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:43.440
And if we trace to that we are essentially sending traffic to rather 2 event invented the Internet rather

95
00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:48.890
than to write a one and then to the P.C. in the other subnet.

96
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:54.250
Okay so this was quite a complex lab we had to do a lot of things here but I'm hoping it's helped you

97
00:07:54.250 --> 00:08:01.620
understand subediting and way you use updating and how to use submitting in a practical lab.
