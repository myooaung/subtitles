00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:27.450
We can also answer this question How many broadcast domains are they in network one.

2
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:35.700
So if I go back all the way to the original OP message and then click capture forward the OP a message

3
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.060
is sent to the Hub.

4
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.580
Notice it's a broadcast at or layer two.

5
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:53.730
So what happens to broadcast traffic it gets flooded so we have one broadcast domain because I broadcast

6
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.120
sent to a hub is flooded.

7
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.390
So single broadcast domain in network one

8
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:15.140
we can also prove that by rerunning a simulation so let's rerun the simulation.

9
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:24.620
I'm only going to look at AAP and ICMP traffic but on P.S. 1 what I'm going to do now is send a broadcast

10
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:35.900
to 10 1 1 255 so this is a broadcast I'll only send two packets notice the broadcast traffic is sent

11
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:48.800
to the hub when we look at the packet source address is P.S. 1 we can see that again by looking at the

12
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.480
MAC address.

13
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.610
So notice the MAC address is P.S. 1 destination is a broadcast.

14
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:05.780
So the destination MAC address is set to that destination IP address is set to a broadcast 255 255 255

15
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.500
in Packet Tracer.

16
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.850
Source IP address is P.S. 1 Notice the broadcast goes to everyone.

17
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:23.320
So it's a single broadcast domain these devices will reply back but the traffic is flooded out of all

18
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.370
ports.

19
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:33.920
Notice we're getting a collision here so recent of the simulation and let's look at another problem

20
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:51.380
if P.S. 1 sends a ping to P.C. for and P.S. 2 sends a ping to P.C. for what's going to happen so they

21
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.530
both sending packets into the network

22
00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.760
in this example.

23
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:12.790
P.S. to send an OP because it doesn't know the MAC address of P.S. For so here's the actual frame.

24
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:22.270
A quick recap of terminology to be precise and to be correct for the CCMA exam and to leave one in the

25
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.460
OSA model.

26
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:31.630
We talk about butts at least two in the US eye model we talk about friends and to layer three we talk

27
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:39.400
about packets and at least four we talk about segments and then we typically talk about the data at

28
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.050
higher layers.

29
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:48.520
I'm often using terms interchangeably here but if you want to be very precise about terminology at a

30
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:56.110
later one it puts a layer to its frames Layer 3 its packets at layer for its segments.

31
00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.990
So notice another layer to the frame has a destination address of a broadcast.

32
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:09.980
That's causing problems with the frame that was sent by P.S. 1.

33
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:17.660
We've got a collision taking place here so there's a problem with the frames because of the collisions

34
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:24.530
only one device can access the network at any time so here.

35
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:31.260
P.S. 1 is sending the ICMP message and a reply is sent back to P.S. 1

36
00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.100
so run the simulation again before I do that.

37
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:49.720
I'm going to make sure that P.S. To can ping P.S. 4 so make sure that it's OP cache is populated so

38
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.670
both.

39
00:04:50.800 --> 00:05:02.770
P.S. To and P.S. 1 have P.S. fours MAC address in the OP cache and then what I'll do in simulation mode

40
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:15.130
is get P.S. 1 to ping P.S. 4 and get P.S. To 2 ping P.S. 4 so they both can send an ICMP packet.

41
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.470
When that hits the hub we have a collision.

42
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.490
You have a single collision domain when you have a hub.

43
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:31.830
So a hub is a single broadcast domain as well as a single collision domain.

44
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:38.620
We're going to have problems with lots of collisions taking place as you add more and more devices to

45
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:39.790
a hub.

46
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.120
So be careful with hubs.

47
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:50.320
They are single collision domains and single broadcast domains so we can save for questioning 11 network

48
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:56.770
1 equals a single collision domain.

49
00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:06.160
Be careful using hubs today we don't use hubs in wide infrastructures we use switches which we'll see

50
00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.030
in a moment.

51
00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.430
Have multiple collision domains.
