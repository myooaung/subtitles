00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.550
So what about Facebook.

2
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.330
Facebook have developed to open hardware switches.

3
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.480
Here's an example of the six pack switch.

4
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:16.440
And before that they had developed their wedge top of rack switch

5
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:28.130
information is available on Facebook Web site explaining how Facebook have created an open hardware

6
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.720
switch.

7
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:36.200
This is part of the Open Compute Project and now idea is rather than just having open source software

8
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.240
Let's have open hardware so Open Compute.

9
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.340
In other words servers open storage as well as open networking.

10
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.900
Why do we have proprietary network devices.

11
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.700
Why don't we have open hardware.
