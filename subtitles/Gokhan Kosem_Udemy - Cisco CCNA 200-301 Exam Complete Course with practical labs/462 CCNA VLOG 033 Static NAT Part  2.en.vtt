00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:15.660
This is one of multiple videos I discuss not on network address translation in this video answering

2
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.820
a question from Pedro who's attending my and three CCNY course

3
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.500
this is the inside the global address.

4
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.030
In other words this is the address of that PC.

5
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.300
This is the address of that PC when traffic is sent on to the Internet.

6
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:45.040
So let's do a telnet to 8 8 8 1.

7
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.730
Let's configure the server for telnet.

8
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.200
At the moment it's a trans port input.

9
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.060
None Summerset transport input.

10
00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.500
Telnet back on Grada 3.

11
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.480
Can we telnet to 8 8 8 1.

12
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.050
Yes we can.

13
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.630
And we were on Route 1.

14
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.940
Now can we ping 8 8 8 8 to 2.

15
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:14.770
No we can't

16
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.090
camping 8 8 8 2 3.

17
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.710
No we can't those addresses don't exist.

18
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:31.040
So at the moment we've got one NAT translation this one.

19
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:42.250
What I'll do now is create another one for the real IP address of the host inside local tendered one

20
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:56.350
or two to two and will set the global IP address 2 8 8 8 8 or 2 and make that extendable IP net inside

21
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.860
source.

22
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.220
Let's do the same for 3.3 and then get to that address.

23
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:15.080
So show IP net TRANSLATION We have three net increase in the net table at the moment there are no outside

24
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:22.280
local outside global entries because no traffic is being initiated by the PC to those servers.

25
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:31.970
But if we now ping this address which didn't work in the past it now works and the same is true for

26
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.100
8 8 8 8 or 3.

27
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:43.340
So we are getting some simply because there let's all that say 8 8 8 8 2 3 works and or two works.

28
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:50.750
And if we look at the net translations we can see the ICMP translations in the table here.

29
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.590
I see it may be a little bit more difficult to read.

30
00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:06.610
So let me do a telnet softshell at it from the PC to the server and notice we can see that the destination

31
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:13.160
port is 23 source port from the this PC is a random port number.

32
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:22.750
So this is the NAT translation for the telnet session the IP that you fight into here.

33
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.530
You should see translations.

34
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:26.650
There we go.

35
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:36.570
And then I'll just type some characters noticed we're getting at translations a source of 8 8 8 8 8

36
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:45.210
4 2 8 8 8 and 1 means that the destination address is translated to 10 that wandered 1 to 1 and then

37
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:52.330
it's translated back for the reverse traffic.

38
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.150
OK so in summary.

39
00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:02.000
So run pipe including that to set up a network such as this where you have multiple internal servers

40
00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.520
and you want them to be accessible from the Internet.

41
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:13.120
One way to set this up is to create an individual static and not entry per server.

42
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.560
This is the real IP address configured on the device.

43
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.080
In other words that's the address that's being configured on the device it's called the inside local

44
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.250
address.

45
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.850
This is the inside global address.

46
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:33.610
This is the Nottage or virtual IP address associated with this physical IP address configured on the

47
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.960
device.

48
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.750
So Pedro I'm hoping that answers your question.

49
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.660
I also hope that this helps everyone else.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.740
