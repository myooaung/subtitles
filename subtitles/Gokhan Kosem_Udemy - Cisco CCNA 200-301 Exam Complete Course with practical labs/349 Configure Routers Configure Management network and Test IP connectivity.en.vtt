1
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:10.490
So I typologies connected all start up all the devices what you'll notice is NPM is starting the genus

2
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.780
3 V.M. is starting

3
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.820
the NPM Windows machine is booted up.

4
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.740
The genius 3 VM is booted up.

5
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:27.420
And what I'll do now is open up a console connection to the rodders.

6
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.380
So let's start with one what I'm into.

7
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.400
D is configured.

8
00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.170
This network is 10 to 1 and 1 2 8 0 24

9
00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:51.410
this network will be 10 to wonder 2.0 slushed 24 and this one tenth of 1 to 3.0 slash 24.

10
00:00:51.820 --> 00:01:01.190
I'll also create loop packs on each Rodda with an IP address that relates to the name.

11
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:13.930
So it could ripple one for auto one could triple t ferrata T and quadruple sorry for rodder three Lubeck

12
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:14.610
so great.

13
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:21.640
These are logical interfaces that don't go down on Rajahs and are very useful for management as well

14
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:31.030
as for protocols such as OSPF Serrato one Krake the loop back interface so a quadruple one

15
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:45.790
going to the first serial interface serial zero slash zero IP address 10 1 1 1 slice 24 no shut to go

16
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:56.500
into the second interface serial zero slash 1 IP address 10 1 to 1 No shut that interface

17
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:10.280
and enable the GOP serrata at your GOP 100 network and I'm going to enable the GOP and all interfaces

18
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.980
and disable automatic summarization.

19
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.340
The important step from a management point of view is to enable SMP.

20
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:31.710
So I mean to say is an empty server community and I'm going to specify a community of NPM and I'm going

21
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:40.620
to set it to read only and then I'm going to save for the configuration do something similar on rockety.

22
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.580
So in order to interface Luebeck zero IP address

23
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:49.750
quadruple te

24
00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:00.250
to face serial zero slash zero IP address tend to wonder wonder t.

25
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.420
No shut it.

26
00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:15.900
Serial zero slash one IP address tendered one to treat or two no shut that interface Rodda here.

27
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:27.460
GOP 100 network and enable the GOP and Alling to faces and disable automatic summarization loss Draut

28
00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:28.250
erotic story

29
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.260
create a loopback interface

30
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.030
quadruple stree

31
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:50.480
slash 32 mosque go into the serial interface IP address take that one to two or three.

32
00:03:51.740 --> 00:04:01.280
No Sharratt second serial interface IP address tendered one or treat or three no shut that interface

33
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.450
enable the GOP on all interfaces

34
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.160
disable automatic summarization

35
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.120
neighbor relationships are being established

36
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:27.060
and importantly mustn't forget to type as an MP server community.

37
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:39.160
The community name NPM read only need to do that on both rodded 2 and rotatory it's an MP server community

38
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:47.500
and PM read only and I'll save the configurations.

39
00:04:49.650 --> 00:05:00.030
So that's the initial configuration on ARADAS show IP IP neighbors shows me that Rodda 2 has two neighbor

40
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:06.620
relationships router one has two neighbor relationships

41
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:17.830
and so does rodders three rabbit three can paying the loop back of Route 1 and the loop back of Rodek

42
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:23.620
to the one paying the loopback about it too.

43
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.030
And to the loopback of radix 3.

44
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:34.530
So I have configured the network with IP addresses on the serial interfaces and the routers can ping

45
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:44.250
each other the next step is to enable the management network and get NPM to manage the devices

46
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:53.670
so to configure the management interface a going to go in the first Ethan an interface of Rato one and

47
00:05:53.670 --> 00:06:07.430
give it an IP address of 10.0 one talked 100.0 one slice 24 mosque and save the config right to do an

48
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:08.440
interface.

49
00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:16.650
Given a trace of 10 one 100 dot to slice 24 mosque save the config

50
00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:30.340
and do something similar on rodders 3 10:01 one hundred three slice 24 mosque

51
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:40.430
save the configuration so our devices have booted up.

52
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.330
We have connected NPM to that apology.

53
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.080
Let's test connectivity from NPM.

54
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:57.580
So here's my NPM Windows machine IP config shows me the IP address of 10 1 to 100 100.

55
00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.620
Ping ten one hundred one.

56
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.660
That's not a one Ping's succeed.

57
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:10.710
Rodda to Ping's succeed rodders 3 Ping's succeed.

58
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:19.010
So NPM has IP connectivity to the three routers using the management network.

59
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:23.690
Now let's get NPM to discover the devices.

60
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.340
In other words the three routers.
