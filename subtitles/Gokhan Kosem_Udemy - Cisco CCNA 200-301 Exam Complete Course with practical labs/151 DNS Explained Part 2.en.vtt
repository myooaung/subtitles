00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:10.170
Now on this Windows computer I'm going to change the DNS server to the Cisco Rhoda

2
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:25.230
so go to the Ethernet settings rather than using Google as the DNS server and CloudFlare.

3
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:32.660
I'm only going to specify my local reporter as the DNS server now in this example.

4
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.410
I've configured the right to accept a DNS queries and answer them.

5
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.710
And if it doesn't know the answer to forward it to Google this is once again a Cisco broader.

6
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.440
But to your home right it probably does something very very similar.

7
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:53.280
So if I type show run piping collude which basically allows me to look for a command and search for

8
00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:01.920
DNS you can see that I've enabled IP DNS server so the writer will act like a DNS server show IP right

9
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:09.390
shows us that it has a default or brought to a router physically in my local network that say another

10
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.430
Cisco rider that actually physically connects me out onto the Internet.

11
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.240
This device can ping Google dot com.

12
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:30.230
So if I type show run pipe include name typically I would have IP Name Server something like this but

13
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.280
it actually got to that because the outside interface.

14
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:43.490
In other words the interface connecting this device to the Internet is using DHEA P so through DHEA

15
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.800
P It learnt the default gateway it also learned to the DNS server information.

16
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.840
So once again it could paying David Bumble dot com as an example.

17
00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:03.350
Now the P.C. won't be able to ping right of one dot whom dot com as an example because the broader isn't

18
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:13.130
configured with that information on the Cisco router if I try and ping rather one dot home dot com that's

19
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.080
not going to work because it doesn't know about that domain.

20
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.070
Notice it's actually trying to get to the Internet right.

21
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.340
To try and find out what did that domain is.

22
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:35.000
But if I type IP host and specify a hostname like Rod or one home dot com and then specify an IP address

23
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:43.250
of let's say 10 dot wonder wonder to fly for the local writer this writer will be able to ping itself

24
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:53.150
it's done a name resolution locally and the P.C. will also be able to ping that domain I'm gonna flush

25
00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:05.270
the DNS cache so it doesn't have any cached entries locally and then ingenious 3 all run a y short capture

26
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:15.820
here and what we'll filter for is DNS so basically we'll see a DNS request from the P.C. going to the

27
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:26.740
right and the broader replying if it does a DNS request so ping are one whom dot com that works in why

28
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:35.680
a shark we can see the DNS request from another random or ephemeral port going to Port 53 but the DNS

29
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:46.420
server is 10 1 1 2 5 4 which is the local router it's asking for the IP address of this domain name

30
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:57.310
and the rowdies replying back saying the IP address of that domain name is 10 1 1 2 5 4 so standard

31
00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:04.270
query for an A record because this is IP version 4 but in this case the query went to the broader now

32
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:09.880
the road is going to forward on DNS queries that it doesn't know the answer to and we can prove that

33
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.620
by running a y shock capture between the broader and the Internet.

34
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.810
So on this link.

35
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.640
So we're seeing a whole bunch of traffic because that is bridge to my physical network.

36
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:30.910
But once again what I'll do here is filter for DNS can see some other DNS queries are really taking

37
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:31.620
place.

38
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.480
On the windows P.C. I'll ping David Bumble dot com once again.

39
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.880
You don't have to use ping you could use an as lookup.

40
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.380
So let me show you that as well.

41
00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:48.710
But notice it did get resolved and it looks like it didn't get forwarded

42
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.790
so let's do an honest look up for a different domain.

43
00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:03.420
Let's say Cisco dot com resolution is this IP address so notice.

44
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.590
There we go.

45
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.220
We've done an NSA lookup notice in this case.

46
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.480
It's a DNS query for both the IP version for address.

47
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:21.390
So we've got a query for the a record Cisco dot com and then we've also got a query for the IP version

48
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.960
6 IP address.

49
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.980
So in this case the reply came back saying this is the IP address of Cisco IP version 4 and this is

50
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.960
the IP version 6 address and we can see that here.

51
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:45.450
IP version 6 an IP version 4 in our y shock capture notice that the source IP addresses 1 9 2 1 6 8

52
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:52.380
1 67 which is actually the road show IP interface brief shows us that that is the IP address of the

53
00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:59.920
router so the router is querying another device for the IP address information because it doesn't know

54
00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.080
it locally.

55
00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.230
So that's the whole idea with DNS.

56
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:10.890
If the local DNS server doesn't know the answer it forwards that query to a more authoritative DNS server.

57
00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:17.160
And in this case we're getting both the IP version for IP address as well as the IP version 6 IP address

58
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.040
because I used n s lookup.

59
00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:25.800
Now you need to make sure that the DNS server that you querying is giving you good information.

60
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:33.870
As an example on this broader I could create a hostname for Cisco dot com and simply pointed to another

61
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:34.460
IP address.

62
00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:46.830
Let's say the local router on the P.C. I'll flush the DNS cache so flush DNS and then I'll ping Cisco

63
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.330
dot com.

64
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.440
Notice the IP address resolved is 10 1 1 2 5 4.

65
00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.500
It's not to the actual IP address of Cisco

66
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:04.230
so if your DNS entries are manipulated or you connecting to a false DNS server you could end up going

67
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.090
to the incorrect server.

68
00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:11.820
You may think you're going to Cisco dot com or another domain but actually you're being redirected somewhere

69
00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:12.590
else.

70
00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:20.220
So hackers will often target the DNS servers have rogue DNS servers which allow them to push your traffic

71
00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:21.660
where they want to.

72
00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:27.780
Again fortunately because of certificates preloaded on browsers today you may be warned if you go to

73
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:34.040
the wrong server typically you're not going to use your Cisco writer as a DNS server.

74
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:40.370
You might use it for DNS requests onto a DNS server on the Internet but you wouldn't want to configure

75
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:43.400
your local broader as the DNS server.

76
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:51.110
You may in some cases but typically not what you typically want to use is a linux server to be the DNS

77
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.620
server.

78
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:59.490
So in this example I'm going to show you how to setup a DNS server on a boon to computer.

79
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:01.970
Now this is a boon to desktop.

80
00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:05.330
Typically you'd run this on a server rather than a desktop.

81
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.590
But the same principle applies.

82
00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:12.550
So I have config shows us the IP address of the server.

83
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:17.280
Can we ping Google dot com.

84
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:18.070
Yes we can.

85
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:25.740
So we getting a resolution of that domain now to set up this boon to P.C. as a DNS server.

86
00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:33.150
I need to disable system D resolved because there's a conflict on Port 53.

87
00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:36.560
You cannot have two services listening on Port 53.

88
00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:38.050
I want to set up DNS mosque.

89
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:47.730
So I want to disable this process so that DNS mosque can listen on that port number

90
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:54.920
so I'm going to disable system D result and then I'm going to stop it.

91
00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:05.130
I'll put all these commands below this video if you want to access this yourself and see the commands.

92
00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:12.340
Next thing I'm going to do is edit I'm just going to use nano for that to keep it simple resolve dot

93
00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:12.860
com.

94
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.950
Name Service set to this at the moment.

95
00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:21.460
I'm gonna set the name server to Google

96
00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:32.030
and then I'm going to do sudo apt update to update references.

97
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:38.330
It might be a bit slow here because I'm going through the genius 3 network going through Cisco devices

98
00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:42.880
like this in Janus 3 is very slow so speed the video up if necessary

99
00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.700
OK so the references have been updated.

100
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.360
So what I'm going to do is install DNS mosque

101
00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:01.720
and that's now been installed.

102
00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:03.970
Now my Mac is going crazy.

103
00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:09.700
There seems to be an issue with VMware Fusion and a Mac where the use starts acting like mad.

104
00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:14.800
So I'm sorry if there's a lot of background noise but hopefully you can hear what I'm saying now to

105
00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:20.070
edit DNS mask it's not that difficult.

106
00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:27.150
I'm going to edit it see Dennis mosque conf now quite a few options that you can change here but I'm

107
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.430
just going to change some of the basics.

108
00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.940
Set the port to 53 that is the default

109
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.370
for housekeeping and to be a better net citizen.

110
00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:46.780
I'm going to uncommon domain needed and bogus prove.

111
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:54.330
So we'll never forward plain domain names onto the Internet and non readable address space and then

112
00:10:54.450 --> 00:11:04.630
essentially all I need to do is uncommon at this because I don't want to use Etsy resolve I'm going

113
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:08.050
to put domain names directly here.

114
00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:18.760
So what I could do is simply add domain names like all one dot home dot com and the IP address and whatever

115
00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.500
other domain names I want to enter.

116
00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:29.590
So let's say my broader whom dot com same IP address and then all I need to do is save that file and

117
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:31.660
then restart the service.

118
00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:37.570
So sudo sys CTO restart DNS mosque

119
00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.320
I can look at the status if I want to

120
00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:50.960
can see that this lightweight DHEA P and caching DNS server is running.

121
00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:59.320
So now on my windows P.C. to prove the point let's configure the DNS server to do your boon to P.C.

122
00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:20.120
so I'm gonna set the DNS server here to 200 which is my boon to P.C. click Okay so let's flush the DNS

123
00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:22.760
DNS that's been flushed.

124
00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.500
Do that again.

125
00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.980
So can I ping R one dot home dot com.

126
00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:33.640
Yes I can because that's been resolved by the ubuntu server.

127
00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.010
That was quite a long video but hopefully you've learned something.

128
00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:42.120
I've shown you how to capture DNS queries and responses using Y shock.

129
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:44.870
I showed you the source and destination port numbers.

130
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:50.510
I showed you how you can configure a Cisco router as a DNS server and how to configure and a boon to

131
00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:52.340
P.S. as the DNS server.

132
00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:57.010
And then we tested the queries and made sure that it worked properly.

133
00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.480
I'm David Bumble and I want to wish you all the very best.
