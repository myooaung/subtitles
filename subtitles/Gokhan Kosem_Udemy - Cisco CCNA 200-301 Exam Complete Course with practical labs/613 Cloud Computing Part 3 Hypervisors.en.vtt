00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:07.770
Now generally it's inefficient to run multiple operating systems on the same hardware.

2
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:17.210
In other words in this example I'm running Windows as what's called my host operating system and then

3
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:25.430
I'm running Linux as a guest operating system within virtualization software or a hypervisor which in

4
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.710
this case is VM way workstation

5
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:39.910
so the terminology once again the operating system installed on the hardware is called The Host operating

6
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:40.320
system

7
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.130
the hardware is called Bare metal hardware.

8
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:57.890
So in this example the virtualization software in other words VMware Workstation is not installed directly

9
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.210
on the bare metal hardware.

10
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:07.340
The virtualization software is running as an application within Windows.

11
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.900
Windows is installed directly on the hardware.

12
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:18.260
A more efficient way of doing this is to run the virtualization software directly on the bare metal

13
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.460
hardware.

14
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:29.090
So in this example I've connected to a VM where E6 I server this as a physical server that has the VM

15
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.400
where hypervisor software installed directly on it.

16
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:41.420
So the VM where yes sex Software is software that you install directly onto a bare metal server.

17
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.470
You don't run it to within another hypervisor.

18
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:53.810
Now you can like I've done here run E6 I within iOS 6 I but that's only for testing.

19
00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.470
Typically what you do is you would run year six high directly on bare metal hardware and then you would

20
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:10.580
run multiple virtual machines on iOS 6 I that gives you more scale and better utilization of your hardware

21
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:19.510
rather than running a host operating system such as Windows on the hardware that's consuming resources

22
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.040
and then installing virtualization software and then running your virtual machines.

23
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:33.200
In this example the virtual machines are running directly on hypervisor software installed directly

24
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:44.450
on hardware so in this example I've got Cisco Call Manager software installed in a virtual machine on

25
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:56.290
iOS 6 I see what I can do as an example is open up a web browser to that virtual machine so back in

26
00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:09.110
the console of the virtual machine I can use Cisco commands such as Show Network eith zero that shows

27
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:17.480
me the IP address of this virtual machine and I've not connected to that virtual machine from a web

28
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:29.240
browser within Windows and I can log in to the Cisco Call Manager which is running in a virtual machine

29
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:41.200
on iOS 6 I so this server that I've connected to has an IP address of 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 2 4 2 back to the

30
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:50.770
Cisco call manager has a different IP address my local windows P.C. in this example has multiple IP

31
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:57.700
addresses configured but he's using a separate IP address to the virtual machine which is different

32
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:09.820
to the ESM outside server so when you connect to Web sites such as Facebook or Cisco there'll be many

33
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:15.710
servers running within data centers that are providing the hosting for these Web sites and the back

34
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.560
end software such as databases

35
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:27.880
those servers are typically not physical servers they are virtual servers running on hypervisor software

36
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.570
such as E6.

37
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:36.970
So you can have multiple virtual servers running on a single physical server.

38
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:45.130
In this example I've got one server but notice I've got many virtual machines that can run on that single

39
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.750
server.

40
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:57.550
And in addition I can run virtual routers and other virtual devices as virtual machines on the same

41
00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.120
server.

42
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:10.150
So this is a Cisco CSR Cisco services right at 1000 V which is a virtual router running as a virtual

43
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:16.350
machine on the hypervisor which in this case is E6 I.
