00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Here’s a network consisting of 3 routers, router 1, router 2 and router 3

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
each router has a loopback configured as follows

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
this network is configured as 10.1.1.0/24

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and this network is configured as 10.1.2.0/24

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
no routing protocols have been enabled on this routers

6
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and we can see that by typing show ip protocols

7
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:38.000
so notice no protocols have been enabled on any of the routers.

8
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
show ip route on router 1 as an example

9
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
shows me only directly connected networks.

10
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So to enable RIP simply go into global configuration mode

11
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and type router and in this case rip and press enter.

12
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Now you need to advertise networks and RIP

13
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
so you need to use the network command

14
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and this is a classful network entry

15
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
so network 10 is a class A network.

16
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So even if I enter it as follows

17
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
notice what happens when I look at the configuration

18
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
so I’m going to look at the RIP configuration in the running config

19
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
notice its changed to 10.0.0.0

20
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
so even though I type this in the running configuration the output looks as follows.

21
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Now when I use the command show ip protocols

22
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I can see that RIP has been enabled

23
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
the default version of RIP used for sending is version 1

24
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
the default received is version 1 and version 2

25
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
so notice received version 1, version 2, send is version 1

26
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
RIP at the moment is only enabled on F0/0

27
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
RIP will also automatically summarize networks

28
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and that will cause a problem which I'll explain in a moment

29
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
by default, it will load share or load balance across 4 paths

30
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
it's advertising this network 10.0.0.0

31
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
no gateway of last resort has been configured

32
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and the administrative distance for RIP is 120 by default.

33
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
If I want to advertise network 1.1.1.1

34
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I need to add that as a network command 100 RIP process

35
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
So do show run | section rip

36
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
shows me my commands, I’ve used 2 network commands under the RIP process.

37
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Now I should specify version 2

38
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
because I want to use RIP version 2

39
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
RIP version 2 supports Variable Length Subnet Mask or VLSM

40
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:08.000
notice we have /32 masks here as well as /24 mask

41
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
we need to use a version 2 of RIP

42
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
if we have varying or different subnet mask length.

43
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
So show ip protocols again

44
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000
shows me that I’m using RIP we're sending version 2

45
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and receiving version 2, so I have change it

46
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
from what it was set to previously, the network command does 2 things

47
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
it advertises networks that fall in the range of network command

48
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
so we will be advertising network 1 and network 10

49
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
while it will also advertise any networks

50
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
that fall in the range of the network command.

51
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
So to explain that in more detail, let’s have looked at router 2.

52
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.000
On router 2, when I use the command network 10.0.0.0

53
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
RIP will be enabled on both this interface and this interface

54
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
so now when I use the command do show ip protocols

55
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
notice RIP is enabled on both of these interfaces

56
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
any interface that falls within the range of the network command

57
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000
so these 2 are subnets of network 10 will be advertised by the router

58
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and RIP will advertise routes out of those interfaces.

59
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000
So I need to advertise the loopback interface

60
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and I need to set the version of RIP to version 2

61
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
so now when I type show ip route on router 1

62
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.000
notice I’m receiving a route 2.0.0.0/8 from router 2

63
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
notice it's automatically being summarized

64
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
this is a class A network

65
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000
so router 2 is advertising it to router 1 as 2.0.0.0

66
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
because we move from 1 class A network to another class A network

67
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
automatic summarization takes place by default across classful boundaries.

68
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000
So class A to class A 10 network 2 is automatically summarized

69
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
but that’s not a problem in this example

70
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
router 1 is able to ping the loopback of router 2

71
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
let's enable RIP on router 3

72
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:34.000
so router rip network 10.0.0.0 network 3.0.0.0 version 2

73
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
go to router 1 show ip route

74
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
router 1 is learning about netwok 10.1.2.0

75
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
this network here it wasn’t automatically summarized

76
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
because we are still within the 10 network.

77
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Network 2 is being summarized do the command again.

78
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and network 3 is being summarized

79
00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Router 1 can ping the loopback of router 3.

80
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:08.000
On router 3, it can ping the loopback of router 1

81
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
because the route is advertised via the RIP routing protocol

82
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
it's as simple as that to get a network of 3 routers

83
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
configured with RIP and advertising routes

84
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
so once again show run section rip

85
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
shows me the commands that I typed on router 3

86
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
to enable rip version 2, very simple
