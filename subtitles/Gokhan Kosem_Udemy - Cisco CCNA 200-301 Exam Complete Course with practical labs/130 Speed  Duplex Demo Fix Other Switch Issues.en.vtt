00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So we now need to fix this link between 2950-1 and 2950-2

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
both switches are showing messages that there's a duplex problem.

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So CDP does a nice job here of showing us that there's a problem rather sh run int f0/4

4
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We can see the speed and duplex are hard coded.

5
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Sh run int f0/4 on this side it's 100 half duplex, on this side it's 100 full duplex.

6
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So that’s a simple fix of setting a duplex to full.

7
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:56.000
the interface has gone down and comes up again and hopefully that’s resolve the problem

8
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
we could clear the counters as n example on F0/4 and do the same here

9
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:14.000
clear counters f0/4 and then we could after while look at those counters

10
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and see if we find any problems

11
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
but that should have solve the problem of a duplex mismatch.

12
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:33.000
To confirm it sh int f0/4 rather the tap here we can see, so here’s the command

13
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
here’s the speed and duplex of the interface. Interface is up, up and it’s connected.

14
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000
sh int f0/4 on switch 2. Here’s the command once again.

15
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Duplex and speed are shown here as well.

16
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Interface is up, up and it’s connected.

17
00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
We’re not seeing any errors on this interface

18
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and on this one, we are also not seeing any errors.

19
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So that hopefully has resolve the problem on this link and this link.

20
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So be careful hard codings speed and duplex.

21
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Auto negotiation may negotiate correctly but it may not, generally today with gigabit

22
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and faster links your problem are not as bad as they used to be on 10100 links.

23
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Let see what happens if we configure speed and duplex on one side

24
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and leave the other side for autonegotiation.

25
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.000
So on 2950-1 we will configure this interface with the speed of 100

26
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:47.000
duplex of full interface is gone down, interface will hopefully come up and there you go.

27
00:02:47.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Here is the 3750 and we can see that’s it's complaining about a duplex mismatch.

28
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So sh run int f0 f1/0/3 no duplex or speed is being configured on this interface.

29
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.000
sh int f1/0/3 this side is using 100 Meg half duplex

30
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.000
where's this side is using 100 meg full duplex.

31
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.000
So if you have 1 side configured for autonegotiation and the other side is hard-coded

32
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
you may have a problem because this side is not negotiating

33
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
with the other side and this side may take a full back decision.

34
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000
sometimes it’s able especially on gigabit and later interfaces to still work out

35
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
what the other side is using and set its duplex and speed accordingly

36
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000
but here it wasn’t able to do that because the 2950's are older switches.

37
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:15.000
So to resolve this, let's configured the 2950 for autonegotiation.

38
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:32.000
So F0/1 this interface speed, auto, duplex, auto interface has gone down

39
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.000
hopefully it will come up and hopefully they'll be able to negotiate successfully.

40
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:47.000
S0 3750 showing up, 2950 showing up sh int f1/0/3

41
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Full duplex 100 meg, so that side is 100 meg full duplex.

42
00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:03.000
do sh int f0/1 on this side full duplex 100 meg.

43
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
So they’ve negotiated successfully.

44
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000
so moral of the story is either configure both sides for autonegotiation or hard code

45
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.000
both sides, generally today you’re going to allow both sides to auto negotiate.

46
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:29.000
sh run int f1/0/1   sh run int f1/0/1

47
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
now this is the link between the 2 3750's

48
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:43.000
f1/0/1 this interface isn’t currently connected, so we’ve got 1 interface F1/0/1

49
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000
between the 2 3750's 1 side is not set for speed and duplex it's set for auto.

50
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
The other side is using 100 half but in this case

51
00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:03.000
The side set for auto negotiation has reverted to 100 meg half duplex.

52
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:12.000
So that’s work out ok, in this example, however if I change this to have a duplex of full

53
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000
the negotiation will probably fail and will have a duplex mismatch.

54
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Interfaces have come up, let’s see what its done.

55
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000
In this example it’s negotiated correctly full duplex 100 meg.

56
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:41.000
This side do sh int f1/0/1 full duplex 100 meg

57
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000
So we manually configured this side with speed and duplex

58
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:57.000
this side has been able to work out what the speed and duplex should be.

59
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:07.000
So let’s set the speed here to 10 and the duplex to half.

60
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And let's see if the switches can successfully negotiate that.

61
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:21.000
So interfaces is come up, sh int f1/0/1 and I'll simply include the duplex

62
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
so we don’t see all the output, notice here its negotiated properly.

63
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:34.000
So on this switch, it’s been manually configured for half duplex 10 meg

64
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:41.000
and this switch has successfully negotiated that if I change the duplex here to full

65
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
let's see what happens now when the interface comes up

66
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000
so here it's 10 meg full duplex, on this side it's also 10 meg full duplex.

67
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.000
So the 3750 is on negotiating correctly without any problems

68
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:06.000
but that wasn’t happening between a 3750 and the 2950.

69
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000
So let’s set the speed to 100.

70
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
So sh int and look at the duplex that’s been set

71
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.000
try that again 100 full duplex, this side 100 full duplex.

72
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:31.000
So in this case when I set the 1 side it’s successfully negotiating with the other side

73
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
but we have problems with negotiation between 3750 and 2950.

74
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
So generally the moral of stories is, autonegotiation on both sides

75
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
or hard code on both sides, mixing and matching can cause problems.

76
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Today the general recommendation is use auto everywhere except perhaps between core links

77
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
where you wanna hard-code both sides to increase the speeds of that interface coming up.
