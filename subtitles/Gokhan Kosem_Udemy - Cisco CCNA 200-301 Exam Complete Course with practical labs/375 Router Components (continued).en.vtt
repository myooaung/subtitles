00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:07.580
Flash memory is nonvolatile computer memory and is used as the permanent storage for the operating system

2
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.710
and other files.

3
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:16.490
This is very similar to the hard drive or flash drive on PCs today depending on the size of the flash.

4
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.730
Multiple copies of the Cisco Ioway can be stored in Flash.

5
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:27.680
Other files such as music on hold which is used in coal manage express environments can also be stored

6
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.830
in Flash.

7
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.820
When a Cisco router boots up it will copy the Iowas software from flash into RAM.

8
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.490
Gerring the boot process and then the CPA will execute the IRS.

9
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:48.410
Some very old models of Cisco routers such as the twenty five hundred rand the Ioway from memory and

10
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:55.880
flash at the same time but these days the entire operating system is copied into RAM and is run from

11
00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.930
RAM in a similar way to a hard drive or flash drive on a computer.

12
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.970
When the router is turned off flash memory doesn't to lose its contents.

13
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.400
Rom is another form of permanent storage.

14
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.310
This memory contains microcode for basic functions to start and maintain the router and includes the

15
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.500
bootstrap code and power on self test or post run.

16
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:28.730
Also contains run monitor or Rumson which is used for password recovery and for rodded disaster recovery

17
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.100
functions.

18
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:38.360
Run is nonvolatile So the contents are maintained even when the road is turned off or rebooted.

19
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.030
The Rotto also stores the IP writing table the stores information about directly connected and remote

20
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:52.490
networks and is used to determine the best path to a local remote network up caches will be used by

21
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:59.060
the router and those contains the IP version for address to MAC address mappings which is very similar

22
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.440
to the OP Kashan APC.

23
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:08.960
The cache on road is used on ethernet interfaces and is used for example when the router pings another

24
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.010
device on the local subnet.

25
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.150
The router will send out an op request and when it receives an op response that information is stored

26
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.840
in the OP cache.

27
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.910
Typically however it's populated when PCs or forwarding traffic through a router to a remote destination

28
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:33.200
PCs will send an op request for a default gateway and the router will reply and hence the cache will

29
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.640
be populated.

30
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.480
Routers also have packet buffers when packets are received on interfaces they are stored in buffers

31
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.610
that was stored in buffers before they exit an interface.

32
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:53.120
As an example if an interface is congested the buffer of the outgoing interface will fill up with packets

33
00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:01.520
in the queue to be processed out of that interface a rado also has the configuration register which

34
00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.500
is stored in nv ram.

35
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:10.430
This is used to control how a router boots you could configure this valley to get a router to boot into

36
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.200
run monitor mode or to bypass the startup config to do it.

37
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.830
Password recovery and can be used for other functions such as changing the speed of the console port

38
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:30.560
Erato has multiple interfaces and may include an exit report which is used in the past for modem connections.

39
00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.270
It will have a console port.

40
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:39.950
It may have a use B interface it may have serial interfaces for Ethan it interfaces that gigabit interfaces

41
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.760
and may contain other components such as PV DMD's which are used in voice environments for transcoding.

42
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:55.170
These have what are called DSP or digital signal processors to convert analog voice into a digital stream.

43
00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:02.060
Various other types of interfaces and components may be found in routers and even servers can be installed

44
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.990
and routers today.
