00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Sometimes you believe the network is cabled in a certain way

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
whereas in reality it's cabled  differently

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
so you may think that 1  device is connected to another device

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
but that’s not actually how it's cabled.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Cisco discovery protocol or CDP

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and the industry standard version Link Layer Discovery Protocol or LLDP

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
are protocols that run at layer 2 in the OSI model

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and allow you to discover how devices  are connected to each other

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
this runs independently of protocol such as IPv4 and IPv6

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
CDP and LLDP are a great way to discover how devices are connected

11
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and allow you to verify documentation as well as great new documentation.

12
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
CDP is Cisco propriety and well typical only discover other Cisco devices.

13
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
please be aware that some vendors such as HPE do not send CDP messages

14
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
but will receive CDP messages

15
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and hence they can see which Cisco devices are connected directly to them

16
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
but a Cisco devices will not be able to see the switches

17
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and routers from other vendors

18
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
such as HPE unless the Cisco devices are enabled for LLDP.

19
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
CDP uses multicast frames which I'll demonstrate in a moment

20
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
but once again doesn’t rely on higher layer protocols.

21
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We'll start with the simple GNS3 topology

22
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and then I’ll show you a more complex 1 in a different video.

23
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
In this GNS3 topology, I’ve got 3 Cisco routers.

24
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
one of them is connected to a hub which is bridge to my Local Area Network

25
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
which will allow me to see physical devices in the network.

26
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Router 1 and router 2 are configured with IP addresses

27
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:57.000
on their FastEthernet 0 interfaces, router 2 is using DHCP on this interface

28
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
but this network hasn’t been configured.

29
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
So let’s see how that affects CDP.

30
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Firstly on router 1,  sh cdp neighbors

31
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
What you'll notice is it sees the directly connected neighbor router 2

32
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
but no others neighbors.

33
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I could also use the details command

34
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
to see detailed information about that neighboring router.

35
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
you can see as an example the IP address of the neighbor

36
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
the platform, the capabilities, in other words, this supports routing

37
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
it supports switching and it supports IGMP

38
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
IGMP is used in multicast applications.

39
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
We could see the version of operating system that that router is using.

40
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:49.000
on router 2 sh cdp neighbors this shows a lot more detail

41
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
we can see router 1 once again, connected via FastEthernet 0/0

42
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
we can see its a 3725 router

43
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
but in addition, we can see a Cisco Unified Communication Manager

44
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
this is a Linux server that runs the Cisco Unified Communication Manager software

45
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
that’s running within the VMware and is using Ethernet 0

46
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
somewhere in the cloud here to connect back through the hub to router 2.

47
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Now CDP only shows you directly connected devices that are running CDP

48
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
so as an example, router 1 doesn’t see these devices

49
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
because router 1 is separated from them by router 2

50
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
but CDP messages are sent through a hub

51
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and any other layer 2 switches in the topology that are not running CDP

52
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
so there are actually some Cisco switches in this cloud

53
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
that connect router 2 to some of these devices such as the IP phones

54
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
but those Cisco switches are not running CDP

55
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and hence are not seen in the topology.

56
00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000
So be careful CDP shows you directly connected devices that are running CDP.

57
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
This hub as an example is not running CDP

58
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
it's layer 1 device so CDP messages are transparently sent through it

59
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
to devices in the cloud

60
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
and they transparently send CDP messages back to router 2.

61
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000
In addition, there are layer 2 Cisco switches

62
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
these are small personal switches that are not running CDP

63
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
and they don’t show up in the topology

64
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
these 2 phones as an example are powered by Cisco switch.

65
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
So CDP does show you directly connected neighbors

66
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
that would be the exam answer, in the real world, it’s not as simple as that.

67
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Let’s look at some details so sh cdp neighbor detail

68
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.000
We can see some information about the Cisco Unified Communication Manager server

69
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
you can see as an example that it’s running on Linux

70
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
we can see a Cisco 3750 switch here

71
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
scrolling down, we can see a Cisco IP phone

72
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
notice it's Cisco DX650 that’s it's IP address.

73
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000
We could as an example, open up a web browser to that phone.

74
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
In this case, the phone is supporting a web browser

75
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
so we can see details about the phone including its telephone number.

76
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.000
CDP is great for discovering devices on the network

77
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
but also is a security risk because you can discover the devices on the network.

78
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
That may be good for you but maybe bad if you have a hacker

79
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
or someone inquisitive to find out what you’re running.

80
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:44.000
So as an example, I can connect to the Cisco Communication Manager

81
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
and if I knew the username and password or hack it

82
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.000
I could then discover other devices in the topology.

83
00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000
So back on router 2, there’s a CUCM, there’s a 3750

84
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:07.000
here’s my Cisco phone DX650, I can see as an example

85
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
the power that's drawn by that phone

86
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
I can see the operating system that it's running

87
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
I can see which port it's using to connect back to router 2

88
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000
so router 2 is using F0/1 that phone is using port 1.

89
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Here’s another phone Cisco 7970, its port is 1

90
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
the local interface on the router is FastEthernet 0/1

91
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:41.000
here’s router 1 its outgoing port is FastEthernet 0/0

92
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
and router 2 is local interface is FastEthernet 0/0.

93
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
In this case, the router can see itself

94
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
because CDP message is being loop back to the router in the cloud

95
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
but once again sh cdp neighbors

96
00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
we can see the local interface that's receiving CDP messages

97
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and we can see devices

98
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.000
and their local interfaces is used to connect back to this local router.

99
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
now, what about R3? It’s not showing in the topology

100
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:21.000
and that’s because the interface isn't up, this interface is shutdown

101
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
so I’m gonna no shut that interface

102
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
but I’m not going to enable an IP address on the interface.

103
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
So we'll enable this link but configure no IP addresses.

104
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000
So interface f0/0 no shut but that’s all we’ve done.

105
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
sh cdp neighbor

106
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
no neighbors are shown yet

107
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
it takes a while for CDP messages to be sent

108
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
you might have to wait 30 seconds before you see any CDP messages.

109
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
but sh ip int brief

110
00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.000
will allow us to see the state of the interface, FastEthernet 0/0 is up up

111
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000
on router 3, router 3 is connected and FastEthernet 0/0 to router 1

112
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
and FastEthernet 0/1 to router 3

113
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
router 3 is connected using FastEthernet 0/0

114
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
to router 2 is fast Ethernet interface 1/0.

115
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
sh cdp neighbors

116
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
we can now see router 2

117
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
the reason why the domain is showing up is I've configured

118
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
a domain name of cisco.com on router 2

119
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:39.000
so the local router interface is F0/0 and the interface of router 2 is F1/0

120
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
but please be aware that there are no IP addresses configured on this router.

121
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:53.000
so sh run int f0/0 sh ip int brief

122
00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:01.000
what you’ll see is no IP addresses are assigned to any interfaces on this router

123
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
but CDP still works because CDP does not rely on IP.

124
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Let’s have a look at detail

125
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000
so on router 3 sh cdp neighbor detail

126
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
we're seeing router 2, we're seeing it's IP address

127
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
the local interface of router 3 is F0/0

128
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.000
and the interface used on router 2 is F1/0

129
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
the outgoing port is the port of the remote device in this output

130
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
which can be very confusing

131
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
That’s a basic example of CDP and the next video I'll do a Wireshark capture

132
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
and then on subsequent videos, we'll look at a more complex topology.
