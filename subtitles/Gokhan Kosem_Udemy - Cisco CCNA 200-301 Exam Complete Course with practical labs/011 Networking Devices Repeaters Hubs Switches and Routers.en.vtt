1
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.860
I'll go through this in more detail later.

2
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:13.580
Let's just look briefly at some of the devices that we had in the past and then some modern devices.

3
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:19.930
The original Ethernet was 10 base five using this really big yellow cable.

4
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:27.280
So this cable was restricted and distance the signal would attenuate from one end of the cable to the

5
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.060
other.

6
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.730
And what they developed were repeaters.

7
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.100
This is an example of a very early repeater.

8
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.590
This would repeat the signal from one port to another.

9
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.110
We could use ten base five here or ten base two.

10
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:49.180
So this amplified the signal basically didn't understand the actual signal but it just amplified the

11
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.280
signal from one port to another.

12
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.110
Now you'll notice it doesn't have many ports on it.

13
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.660
We've only got two ports.

14
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.270
So it was simply repeating from one port to another.

15
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.120
So example of a repeater.

16
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.210
They then developed what was called a multiple port repeater.

17
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.570
This is a Cisco fast hub 400 series.

18
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.320
So we've got RJ 45 connectors on the front.

19
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.530
We've got power on the back.

20
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.970
But the idea is a hub is essentially a multi port repeater.

21
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.710
We've got multiple ports and we are simply repeating the signal.

22
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.200
We would connect RJ 45 until the twisted pairs an example to these ports.

23
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.840
And what a hub does is once again it simply repeats the signal without understanding what's going on.

24
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.810
So it doesn't understand the frames that it receives or the information that it receives.

25
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.240
It simply amplifies it.

26
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.050
So a repeater here would amplify the signal amplified from one port to another.

27
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.170
Here we've got a multiple repeater.

28
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.830
It's repeating the signal from one port to multiple other ports.

29
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.930
So if traffic was received on port one on this hub it would simply amplify the signal out of all of

30
00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:59.830
those ports.

31
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.370
So it repeats the signal out of every other port without understanding any of the details.

32
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.830
Here's an example of a net gear hub on the front.

33
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.670
We have 24 RJ 45 ports and on the back.

34
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.190
We've got 10 base two as well as 10 base five.

35
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:24.580
So again this would allow me to connect different cable types on the back we could connect 10 base five

36
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.460
as an example.

37
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.140
And then on the front we could have UDP RG 45 cabling as we know today.

38
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.160
This has no intelligence.

39
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.120
There's no intelligence in the hub.

40
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.140
There's no intelligence in the repeater.

41
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.230
Remember this is just repeating the signal from one port to another.

42
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.330
This is a multiple repeater.

43
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.120
If something is received on this port it just amplifies it.

44
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.810
Out of all the other ports or repeats it out of all the other ports.

45
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.520
Otherwise we get attenuation of signals and the signals degrade over a period of time which restricts

46
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.900
the length of a cable.

47
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.680
This allows me to increase the length of the cable.

48
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.110
Now the problem in those days is the more devices that you have on the network the more collisions that

49
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.610
you're going to have which causes problems and slows the network down.

50
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.910
I'll talk more about that later.

51
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.340
But the idea is that this is a hub.

52
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.930
This is a repeater.

53
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.720
We don't worry too much about these days.

54
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:21.810
A lot of people say David don't even show me hubs because they're pointless but they forget that wireless.

55
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.250
This is an example of a wireless access point very modern wireless access point supports Wi-Fi sex the

56
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:34.630
latest version of Wi-Fi at the time of this recording a Wi-Fi network or a wireless network is essentially

57
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.040
a hub in the air.

58
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.420
We are sharing the air.

59
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.510
So whatever I'm saying can be heard by you if you're within range.

60
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.300
Both of us can speak at the same time because it's a shared medium.

61
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.880
We are sharing the air now Wi-Fi six does try and implement some very clever stuff to allow multiple

62
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.840
devices to talk at the same time.

63
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.680
So it kind of approaches a switch but it's still acting as a hub.

64
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:02.630
So what is a switch.

65
00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.500
Here's an example of a switch.

66
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.680
This is an older switch that is 750 very popular for doing labs.

67
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.110
Cisco labs noticed lots of ports on the switch we got 48 ports on the switch.

68
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.400
The number of ports on your switch varies.

69
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.270
You can have very small switches you could have larger switches.

70
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:24.860
Here's an example is a five Port switch T.P. linked switch very small switch.

71
00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:31.750
Has another four port switch from TB link so you don't necessarily have lots of ports but in an enterprise

72
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.410
environment you typically will you'll have a lot of ports on a switch.

73
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.090
These are smaller switches.

74
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.250
The point is is that the form factor or the way that these devices look varies.

75
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:49.510
But the big difference between a switch and a hub is a switch has intelligence a switch actually reads

76
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:55.360
what are called the frames received on Ethernet when you send data into Ethernet we're sending what's

77
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.710
called a frame.

78
00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.620
So this device uses what's called a MAC address table.

79
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.740
It's the same as these devices of the top here.

80
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.860
They basically receive frames and they have the intelligence to only forward the frames out of the correct

81
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:09.310
ports.

82
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.680
So if there was a device with a certain MAC address on this port and traffic was received on this port

83
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.470
going to that MAC address it would only be sent out of that port rather than out of all ports a hub

84
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:27.190
or multiple repeater is done when a when traffic is received on one port it just simply amplifies it

85
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:33.180
or floods it is the term out of all ports so everyone receives that frame here.

86
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:39.250
A switch has a MAC address table it has some intelligence and it learns where MAC addresses are in the

87
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.680
network and then it will only forward the traffic out of the relevant ports.

88
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.500
Based on the destination MAC address and a frame.

89
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.070
So if traffic comes into this port it's going to you based on your mac address it's learned that you're

90
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:55.720
connected to this port when traffic arrives in this port going to your mac address it's only going to

91
00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:01.500
be sent out of this port whereas if it arrived on a hub it would send it out of all ports.

92
00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:07.000
So a big difference between a switch and a hub is a switch has intelligence.

93
00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.400
It works at what's called Layer 2.

94
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.550
We'll talk about that later in a moment.

95
00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:16.210
So it has some intelligence and it'll only forward the frames out of the correct ports.

96
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.630
Now some people would say but hold on a minute David what is a bridge.

97
00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:20.320
A bridge.

98
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.820
You can think of as an intermediate device between a switch and a hub.

99
00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.180
So we had repeaters first.

100
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:32.020
Then we've got hubs and then we had bridges which basically did things in software they learned where

101
00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:39.070
the MAC addresses were of devices in the network and then someone rebranded their devices as switches

102
00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.160
because they could learn MAC addresses in hardware.

103
00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.910
So they use something called an application specific integrated circuit or a sec.

104
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:52.710
So the lines are a little bit blurred but for the CCMA you don't have to worry about that a switch learns

105
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.610
where devices are learns where their MAC addresses are and then we'll only forward the traffic out of

106
00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:02.690
the relevant ports a bridge was an intermediate device between a switch and a hub.

107
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:09.010
So historically we had repeaters that we had hubs and we had bridges software switches if you like and

108
00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:11.380
then we have switches today.

109
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:15.100
Now notice the number of ports on the switch there many many ports on the switch.

110
00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:21.660
So that's one of the features of switches they allow us to connect many devices in our local area network.

111
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:27.680
They are essentially useful sending traffic within a local area network or LAN.

112
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:31.600
We're not going to try and send it from one network to another.

113
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:39.910
These operate on mac addresses using what's called Layer 2 in the OSA model or TCE IP model hubs or

114
00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:45.660
layer 1 devices they are basically dumb devices they don't understand what they receive.

115
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:51.250
These are called Layer two devices because they use Ethernet frames and then we have routers which use

116
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.370
IP addresses to rot from one network to another.

117
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.500
They are called Layer three devices.

118
00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:01.900
We'll talk about those terms in a separate video layer one layer to layer three layer 4 and layer five

119
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:08.080
to seven you need to know those layers you need to know the TTP IP and we say models so don't worry

120
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:14.260
too much about that for the moment just get an understanding dumb device repeats everything that receives

121
00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:19.840
on one put out of all of the ports more intelligent device uses mac addresses learns where devices are

122
00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:21.560
and then we have writers.

123
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:25.150
Now your home device might look something like this teepee link.

124
00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.460
This is a little tepee link right.

125
00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.970
It allows us to root from one network to another.

126
00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:38.950
Typically little routers like this allow us to go from our Ethernet LAN local area network onto the

127
00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:39.640
Internet.

128
00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:43.390
So to what's called a one wide area network.

129
00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:52.900
So Ethernet ports this is how we connect our devices to the broader wireless and then we've got a connection

130
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.090
to the Internet.

131
00:08:54.090 --> 00:09:02.410
He has a Cisco router what you'll notice is the shroud it is as big as the switch but it has far fewer

132
00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:03.580
ports on it.

133
00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:07.660
We've only got a few Ethernet ports and then we've got other types of ports.

134
00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.960
These are what are called serial ports.

135
00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:14.950
Now fortunately in the new CCMA you don't have to learn about these serial interfaces.

136
00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:16.150
They were very slow.

137
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:17.260
Older interfaces.

138
00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:23.650
The most common when technology and land technology tonight today is Ethernet so Ethernet is what you

139
00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:24.090
need to know.

140
00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:30.250
So that's why I'm spending so much time discussing Ethernet these older interfaces aren't that important

141
00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:31.330
today.

142
00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:32.770
But think of your home broader.

143
00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.520
How do you connect to the Internet.

144
00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.210
Maybe you've got an A DSL connection.

145
00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:42.120
So your service provider mine here in the U.K. is British Telecom.

146
00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:44.510
They've given me an A DSL connection.

147
00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:48.070
Now some of you may be fortunate enough to have fibre to your home.

148
00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.940
So in actual fact your one connection is Ethernet.

149
00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:56.020
In that case but in the old days it might have been something like the serial interface.

150
00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.840
But notice this right here this is an interesting road.

151
00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:00.410
Eighteen hundred series right.

152
00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:06.610
This is an older router that would be used in small medium business or in a remote branch office of

153
00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.560
a large corporate.

154
00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:11.160
This device does a lot of things.

155
00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.300
It has all telephone connections here where you could put old analog phones in.

156
00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:21.130
So these ports share these f access ports would allow you to connect an old analog phone to the rudder

157
00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:27.490
and then this would allow you to make telephone calls to your service provider like AT&amp;T or British

158
00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:28.820
Telecom etc..

159
00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:30.250
It's also got a way an interface.

160
00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:32.830
So one of these interfaces could go here.

161
00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:36.100
It also allows us to connect to the Internet.

162
00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:39.270
It's also got like a switch part to it.

163
00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:46.220
So the idea here is this is kind of like a hybrid device writers today mix a lot of switching with them.

164
00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:50.430
Like I said nothing is as simple as it seems in its purest form.

165
00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.860
A router will rot from one network to another.

166
00:10:53.860 --> 00:11:02.080
So as an example we are routing from Ethernet to serial or we are routing from physical Ethernet to

167
00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.950
wireless or we are writing from one connection type to another.

168
00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:09.970
So as an example this writer could support voice over IP.

169
00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:16.250
We could have IP phones talking to analog phones but this is where it gets a little bit less clear cut.

170
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:22.030
This is what you need to remember a router has writing functionality in its most basic form.

171
00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:25.770
A writer writes from one IP network to another.

172
00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:31.240
So here we are talking about IP addresses such as IP version for IP version 6 addresses.

173
00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:37.780
We are routing from one network to another as in one IP network to another in a lot of cases.

174
00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:43.330
We would be routing from one physical media to a different physical media.

175
00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:48.640
This is typically used for connections to the Internet or to wide area networks.

176
00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:54.430
So we are connecting from a local area network to a wide area network switches are typically used in

177
00:11:54.430 --> 00:12:00.240
the local area networks are local within the building as an example local at your home you're not going

178
00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.830
to use this to write to the Internet or write to other sites.

179
00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:09.130
A router does that function so it rots from one network to another layer to switch as this is called

180
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:15.730
uses Mac addresses but switches today have routing functionality so switch like this is called a layer

181
00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:22.690
3 switch because it has routing capabilities built into it and then it'll rot from one VLAN or virtual

182
00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:26.300
local area network to another virtual local area network.

183
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:31.340
Basically from one subnet to another subnet we'll talk about that later.

184
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:39.670
Thing to remember is basic definition routing switching dumb device so no intelligence here.

185
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:43.510
Intelligence based on Mac addresses intelligence based on IP addresses.
