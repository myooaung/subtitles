00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.400
This Flug are you going to continue discussing it.

2
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.520
Mr. distances and the believability of writing protocols.

3
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:37.630
So on one show I wrote why in this apology is this loop back available in the writing table through

4
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:38.780
BGP.

5
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.570
And why not for this route.

6
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:50.140
So this network to dot 2.0 too is available in the writing table and the ront has learnt a viable g.p

7
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.370
this network has learnt of your job.

8
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.640
So why is BGP used for the one network and not the other.

9
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.460
The first thing you need to look at is look at this admin distance here.

10
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:04.430
Its 20.

11
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.150
So that BGP route has an administrative distance of 20.

12
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:15.280
What are the administrative distances of BGP and what you must remember is that you have two versions

13
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:26.030
of BGP BGP and IBG P E BGP has an admin distance of 20 BGP has an admin distance of 200.

14
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.370
So show IP BGP summary.

15
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:41.560
We have a neighbor relationship to router to as well as two routers three show IP BGP neighbor the relationship

16
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.820
to Rodda to uses IE BGP.

17
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:54.470
Notice the autonomous system number for oddities to view and scrolling down the neighbor 10 1 to 2 which

18
00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:01.640
is rotted 3 is using BGP router 3 is an autonomous system one.

19
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.040
The relationship is established.

20
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.710
Are we learning the routes through BGP.

21
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.750
So show IP BGP.

22
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.760
Yes we are learning both the loopback of router 2 as well as the loopback of router 3 through BGP.

23
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:24.210
So BGP has both routes in the BGP routing table but this route is not being put into the IP writing

24
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:31.530
table and we can see that because of this or it says a rope failure the rope is the wrong information

25
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.720
base which from a CCMA point of view is the writing table.

26
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:45.210
So this route is not put into the periodic table by BGP and that's because a better route is available

27
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.320
through the GOP.

28
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:55.170
So 3 3 3 3 and 4 forward and forward for a post not put into the periodic table.

29
00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.950
Show IP BGP.

30
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.210
We're not learning quadruple for three BGP.

31
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.000
We are all learning about this route but because of the failure it's not put into the writing table

32
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.810
notice here.

33
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:15.220
The rot was learned through BGP and the reason why this route is not put into the writing table is because

34
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.570
your job P has a lower administrative distance.

35
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.730
Then I BGP.

36
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.320
So to prove that let's remove your GOP from Rodda one.

37
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:34.020
So rather no Rodda your GOP one show IP rot.

38
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.560
Notice the rot is now available through BGP had been.

39
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.950
Distance is 200.

40
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:50.100
So remember IBG has an industrial distance of 200 e BGP has an admin distance of 20.

41
00:03:50.170 --> 00:04:02.320
If we shut the neighbor relationship down neighbor 10 10:01 1 to shut down what we should see is that

42
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.230
the rot is replaced by another writing protocol.

43
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.960
In this case it's always P.F..

44
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.770
So I'm running OSPF and wrote one and wrote it to you and wrote one has learnt about that loop back

45
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:20.560
through a whisper of previously because the rot was learnt through IBG the BGP rot took precedence.

46
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:28.280
But now because we've shut down the neighbor relationship OSPF is able to add the rot to the writing

47
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.030
table.

48
00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:35.850
So no neighbor 10:01 want to shut down when that relationship comes up

49
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.340
which it has.

50
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:48.500
We should see the rot replaced by a BGP rot and we can on this example reap took a long time to converge.

51
00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:56.580
But notice Ripp has been used as the writing protocol to get to this loopback rather than BGP repairs

52
00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:03.020
and Edmon distance of 120 BGP has an admin distance of 200 Ripp is more believable.

53
00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:13.370
So if we removed wrap from the router what we should see is the rot is now available through BGP.

54
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:19.770
So in summary I BGP has an admin distance of 200 RP has an admin distance of 120.

55
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:27.980
ISIS has an admin distance of 115 always P.F. has an admin distance of 110 GOP internal Rantz have an

56
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:35.570
admin distance of 90 static routes to next top addresses have a admen distance of one static route to

57
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.820
directly connected interface has an admin distance of zero.

58
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.790
The lower the number the more believable the running protocol.

59
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:53.640
Remember with BGP we have both BGP and IBG P E BGP admin distances 20 BGP admin distances 200.

60
00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.410
Make sure you know you administrative distances.

61
00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.980
