00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.500
Now voice is very different to data voice calls are smooth inductor.

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:13.110
They require a certain amount of bandwidth and they require that all the time they don't burst like

3
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.470
a data.

4
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:21.630
Applications do voice codecs such as G 7 to 9 or G 711 use a certain amount of bandwidth and they need

5
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.090
that for the entire voice call.

6
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.210
So they said to be smooth they benign they don't try and grab bandwidth from other applications but

7
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.720
they are very drop sensitive and very delete sensitive.

8
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.910
If your voice packets are dropped or delayed it will affect the voice conversation.

9
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.380
So in a voice over IP scenario it's very important that packets arrive without a lot of delay and packets

10
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.170
are not dropped.

11
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.870
Voice is transmitted across UDP so there's no capability to transmit the lost to voice.

12
00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:02.220
These are the one way requirements for voice latency less than 150 milliseconds to less than 30 milliseconds

13
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.060
loss less than 1 percent bandwidth it does vary depending on the codec used but as an example it's in

14
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:17.680
the range 30 kilometers per second 228 kilohertz per second video has characteristics of voice and characteristics

15
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.520
of data in that it's bursting and greedy.

16
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.940
A video with a lot of movement requires more bandwidth than a video where there's not a lot of movement.

17
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.950
So as an example if you were watching a video stream where there's a lot of action on the screen so

18
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.790
people are moving around or cause a racing or an ultimate example would be a video of a fire.

19
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.130
There's a lot of changes on the screen when videoing fire it's going to grab a lot of bandwidth and

20
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.770
be very busty.

21
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:57.200
If you were videoing a stall scene so as an example you were videoing a wall on a building with no movement.

22
00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.520
The bandwidth requirements would be a lot less video however is drop sensitive like voice it's delay

23
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.980
sensitive like voice and it uses GDP rather than TTP.

24
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:16.300
So the one way requirements for video are similar to voice delay or latency less than 150 milliseconds

25
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:24.340
jitter less than 30 milliseconds loss between zero point one and one percent bandwidth does vary depending

26
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.620
on the video stream.

27
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.740
As an example if you're watching 720 P or 100 ATP or high definition the bandwidth requirements can

28
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:41.320
be a lot higher but for the CCMA we'll use a value of 384 kilohertz per second to 20 plus megabits per

29
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.150
second.

30
00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.890
So the thing to remember is that video and voice or delete sensitive they are drop sensitive.

31
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.910
A lot of data traffic doesn't have those requirements so data traffic such as FCP can be dropped.

32
00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:03.670
It can be delayed but voice traffic in a audio stream or a video conference needs to be pro terrorized.

33
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:11.050
So the idea with quality of service is that we cannot give priority to some sessions over other sessions.

34
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.260
The packets of delay sensitive applications such as voice and video are going to be prioritized over

35
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:24.640
traffic from non delay sensitive applications such as FTB will drop 50 P packets before we drop voice

36
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.790
packets with FCP it doesn't matter it will re transmit.

37
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.480
But if we did drop voice packets and video packets it would affect the user experience.

38
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.930
So with quality of service we are going to create policies and implement policies using quality of service

39
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:47.560
mechanisms on a network to prioritize certain traffic types over other traffic types.
