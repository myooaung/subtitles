00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So what is the difference between a routed protocol and a routing protocol?

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Now a routed protocol carries user data, example, would be IPv4 or IPv6.

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
When you use a higher layer protocols such asHTTP or FTP

4
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
that protocol is using a lower layer protocols

5
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
such as IPv4 or IPv6 to carry the user data from one device to another.

6
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So when you connect to a website

7
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and you're viewing a webpage that would be deemed to be routed data.

8
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Data from the web server is being routed to your PC

9
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
now the addressing scheme used by routed protocol is based on this specific protocol

10
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
such a IPv4 using a 32 bit address and IPv6 using 128 bit address.

11
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Now how do routers know where devices are in a network?

12
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
As an example, my PC is based in the UK

13
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
but when I go to Facebook.com traffic is sent from my PC

14
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
to Facebook based in California and back again,

15
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
How does my device actually reach the facebook service

16
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
in a data center in  California and how does the data get back to my PC in the UK?

17
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
How is the user data forwarded from one device to another?

18
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Now it’s important to realize that every router

19
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
along the path between my PC in the UK and facebook.com

20
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
makes an independent routing decision.

21
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
As an example, if I trace to facebook.com

22
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and in this case, I’m going to set the timeout

23
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
to a low value such as 50 milliseconds.

24
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Traffic is being forwarded from my PC

25
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
on hop-by-hop bases from 1 router to the next

26
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
until it hopefully reaches facebook.com

27
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
every one of these hops is an independent router

28
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
making independent routing decisions.

29
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Now Facebook and a lot of other big websites

30
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
will have data centers scattered around the world

31
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
so my traffic may not actually be going all the way to the US

32
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
but maybe going to a local data center in Europe

33
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
that all depends on how the network is configured.

34
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
These routing decisions made by routers

35
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
is known as the hop-by-hop routing paradigm

36
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
with unicast traffic routing is based on destination address only

37
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
not on source address

38
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
so routers decide where traffic goes based on the destination IP address

39
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
in my example it's this address and routers will decide

40
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
where to route traffic based on the destination IP address

41
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and information stored in routing tables.

42
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Every router along the path needs to determine

43
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
an outgoing interface to forward traffic to reach the destination IP address.

44
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.000
To do that routers communicate information about networks using routing protocols.

45
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
They will then determine the best path to the destination IP address

46
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
using criteria specific to that individual routing protocol.

47
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
As an example, RIP uses hop count to determine the best path.

48
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
OSPF uses the bandwidth of interfaces to determine the best path.

49
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
EIGRP uses bandwidth and delays to determine the best path.

50
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
So routing protocols are used to automatically advertise networks

51
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
between routers and that’s how routers learn

52
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
about the available networks in a topology.

53
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
It’s also important to note

54
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
that if a router doesn’t know about the destination IP address.

55
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
In other words, information about that destination IP address

56
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
is not in its routing table it will drop unicast packets.

57
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Destination IP address is a match against networks

58
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and subnets in the routers routing table

59
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
so if a router receives traffic going to an IP address of let say 10.1.1.1

60
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000
but that IP address doesn’t match a network in the routers routing table.

61
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
The router will drop the packets because it doesn’t know where to forward them

62
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Essentially if you tell a router send traffic to IP address 10.1.1.1

63
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and the router doesn’t know how to get to that network or IP address.

64
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
The router will drop that traffic

65
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
if there is no matching route in the routing table traffic gets dropped.

66
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
This applies specifically to unicast packets

67
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
where we are doing routers based on destination IP address.

68
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
So in summary, routing protocols allow routers to learn about destination networks.

69
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000
That facilitates the change of routed information between devices.

70
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Routers can dynamically learn about networks in the topology

71
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
and can then make routing decisions based on different criteria

72
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000
such as bandwidth hop count or delay to determine the best path.

73
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Routers then simply choose an outgoing interface based on the routing table

74
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and will then forward packets out of that interface to reach a destination.
