00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So format flash  format flash

2
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Flash formatting has completed, let's create our VLANs again

3
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
this is changed to client mode, let’s set it to server mode, VTP mode server.

4
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:34.000
VLAN 2, VLAN 3, VLAN 4, VLAN 5, VLAN 6.

5
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Let’s create a few VLANs to ensure that files are being written to flash correctly.

6
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Show flash

7
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
notice our VLAN.dat file is now stored in flash.

8
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I can view that by typing more flash vlan.dat

9
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and there’s our VLAN database

10
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
we can see our VLANs like VLAN 5, VLAN 6 shown in that file

11
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
but I might as well type show vlan-switch

12
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and notice there are our VLANs

13
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Let's have a look on switch 2 to see if the VLANs have come across properly

14
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
show vlan-switch

15
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
it’s not seeing that let’s check our VTP domain.

16
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
show vtp status

17
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
notice the domain is CCNA

18
00:01:39.000 --> 00:02:00.000
so vtp domain ccna vtp mode client show vlan status or show vlan-switch rather

19
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
we suddenly have the VLANs in our VLAN database

20
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
show flash

21
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
we can now see our vlan.dat file

22
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So I’ve shown you how to resolve an issue with formatting flash on a router

23
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and how to get the vlan.dat file copied across.
