00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:18.110
This is one of a multiple videos discussing the troubleshooting of routing information protocol in this

2
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:25.730
typology we've been told that a broader one is not able to paying the loopback of wrote a full selects

3
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.690
let's verify that enable paying $4.4 for.

4
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.130
It looks like the pings are failing.

5
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.900
So we've been given correct information that the network is not working.

6
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.390
So now let's troubleshoot show on the route.

7
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:55.270
We can see that we are receiving a route from a router 10 up 1 at 1 to 2 via gigabit 00.

8
00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:02.070
So we are receiving information about network 2.0 that separates era from router to.

9
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:11.230
So this is a loop back of brought it to Per our typology and we can ping the loopback of to show IP

10
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:19.150
protocols shows us that we are running the routing protocol on the local router and we are writing for

11
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.380
these two networks.

12
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:28.610
The loopback of Route 1 and rip is enabled on the gigabit zero interface and we've received routes from

13
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.590
10 1 1 2 which again we can see in the writing table.

14
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.790
Notice however that we don't see forward forward forward for in the writing table we do see this network

15
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.720
10 1 2 0.

16
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.000
So can we ping tendered one or two to one.

17
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.450
Yes we can.

18
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.470
In other words we can get to this network on route to.

19
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:59.120
I'm going to turn off IP domain look up to speed up trace route and then I'm going to trace to quadruple

20
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.620
for this is just to show you the trace route can be used.

21
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.550
But in this case it's actually not even going to leave the local router because we don't have a gateway

22
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.280
of last resort set and network for does not appear in the writing table.

23
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.110
So the local router doesn't even know where to forward the packet.

24
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:27.270
We can see that by using the command debug IP packet and doing the trace again notice we see in the

25
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:35.060
output that the packet is unreadable the local router doesn't know where to forward the packet so I'll

26
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.350
turn off debugging on Grada one.

27
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:45.630
Let's have a look at Route to show IP protocols verifies that RP is running on the local router network

28
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.490
to a network 10 are being advertised by this router.

29
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.440
We only see one gateway.

30
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.830
In other words we are only receiving routing information from router one.

31
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.950
We don't see routing information from router to let's do a debug.

32
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.610
Remember the debug debug IP rep and not just hit enter here.

33
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:15.620
We're seeing that the local Rodda is sending out a version to update to the loopback using the well-known

34
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.570
multicast address for up to 2 4 0 0 9.

35
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:28.520
We see it sending out an update via gigabit or 0 1 we are receiving a update on gigabit 0 0.

36
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:40.710
But notice this output ignored version to update from bad source 10 1 3 1 1 gigabyte 0 1 here's some

37
00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:41.560
more debugs.

38
00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.630
Can you see the problem in the debug

39
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.900
notice here.

40
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.110
Ignore the version to update from a bad source.

41
00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:01.590
10 1 3 1 on gigabit 0 1 it ignored an update from itself on the loopback.

42
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:13.560
That would be correct but we are receiving updates on kickabout 0 1 gigabit 0 1 on 2 is configured with

43
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:20.850
an IP address of 10 1 to 1 per our diagram and Rodda 3 should be configured with this IP address 10

44
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.530
1 to 2.

45
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.180
So let's verify IP addresses show IP interface brief

46
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.800
this IP address is configured on gigabit.

47
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.370
Is there a one that looks right and it will just confirm the details.

48
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.290
Using a show run that looks good.

49
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:49.790
On broader 3 show IP interface brief interface gigabit 0 1 is configured with an IP address of 10 1

50
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.890
to 2 and gigabit 00 is configured with this IP address.

51
00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:06.410
That's not correct per diagram so let's change that no IP address on the gigabit 00 interface no IP

52
00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.510
address on that could give it to 0 1 interface.

53
00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:20.420
Go back to Gigabit to 0 0 IP address 10 1 to 2 gigabit 0 or 1 IP address 10 1 3 1

54
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.410
paying 10 to 1 2 to 1.

55
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.320
Ping works show IP route.

56
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:43.050
We've now learnt about network 10 1 3 0 from 10 1 to 2 so it looks like it's not working.

57
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:49.720
If I do a debug we should see that we are receiving updates from router 3 and no longer getting a error

58
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.090
on the de-bunk.

59
00:05:51.190 --> 00:06:00.760
But while we waiting for that show IP ROFFT brought a one week getting network 10:01 3 0 in the writing

60
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:08.740
table so we should be able to ping 10 1 3 1 which we can and we can ping 10 1 3 2 can we Pinga loop

61
00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:09.790
back to 4.

62
00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.320
Yes we can.

63
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.240
So we've successfully solved the problem in the debug.

64
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:26.590
Notice we are now seeing an update received on gigabit 00 and on gigabit 0 1 the local router is learning

65
00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:34.750
the brats from both neighbors show IP Rupp database allows us to see the routes in the database.

66
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:41.970
We can see as an example that network 4 is in the database and I'll just pause this debug.

67
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.660
We also see the loop back of Rodda 3.

68
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:55.360
We see the loopback of brought a one so as an example we can ping the loop back of root of one of to

69
00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:01.950
which is ourselves wrote a three and wrote a four.

70
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.400
So we've successfully solved the problem in this network.

71
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:11.380
Routers need to be in the same subnet for them to exchange Rantz with one another.

72
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:18.320
In this example the IP addresses on gigabit to 0 0 and 0 1 was swapped around serrata 3 updates were

73
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.750
being ignored by rather too.

74
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.250
