00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.780
You can see a list of IP version 6 multi-course addresses on the Iona.

2
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:15.480
This is very similar to IP version for multicast addresses so the Ayana has an address or registry for

3
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.470
both IP version 4 and IP version 6.

4
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.780
So scrolling down in IP version 6 to a link a local scope multi-course addresses.

5
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:34.980
You'll notice that if 02 colon colon one is all nodes address and an IP version for the all systems

6
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.780
on this subnet address is 2 2 4 0 0 1 IP version 6 5 0 2.

7
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:50.550
Calm cool and to use all rodders and 2 2 4 0 0 2 is all routers in IP version 4.

8
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.490
So you notice that the host portion of the addresses in IP version 6 and IP version 4 are very similar

9
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.330
Fourways DVM or PII routers same over here.

10
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:16.490
Five and six is always P.F. same in IP version 6 5 and 6 the GOP is a IP version 6 which is 10 and decimal

11
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:27.210
so 2 2 4 0 0 or 10 is the GOP 9 is Version 2.

12
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.000
And thats the same IP version 6.

13
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:37.790
So you can have a look on the owner at the list of multi-course addresses used by IP version 6 as well

14
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:46.930
as IP version for Fortunately the host address numbers have been kept kind of consistent to make it

15
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:47.430
easier.
