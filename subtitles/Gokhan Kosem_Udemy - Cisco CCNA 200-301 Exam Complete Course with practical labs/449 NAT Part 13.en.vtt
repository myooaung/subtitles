00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.630
So is dynamic not once again you are creating a pool of inside global races.

2
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.980
The reason why it's called dynamic rather than static is the rodded dynamically allocates IP addresses

3
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.090
from the pool on a as needed basis.

4
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.660
The mapping will be removed once communication ends.

5
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.980
So there's no permanent one to one mapping that's always VEI like you have with static not with dynamic

6
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:36.300
not the natural translations are automatically created when they needed and torn down or removed to

7
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.520
were not needed.
