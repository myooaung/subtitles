1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.260
I previously downloaded the NPM software.

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:10.910
In this case I'm using a Release Candidate 1 version of software you'll be using the full release.

3
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:18.940
Now that I've downloaded my solutions software I need to get it into my virtual machine.

4
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.670
There are multiple ways of doing this but in this example I'm going to go to VM settings options and

5
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:33.380
I'm going to create a shared folder something I click ADD and browse to the folder where I downloaded

6
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.430
the software on my physical PC.

7
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.940
Click next click Finish.

8
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.590
I'm going to make this available as a network drive and click OK.

9
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:53.950
So now in Windows Explorer I have a shared folder and within that I can see my installation file.

10
00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:03.150
I'll now be able to install solar winds NPM on my Windows 7 VM so to install NPM I'm going to double

11
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.850
click on the solar winds NPM executable file.

12
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:16.300
This fall is once again stored on my physical machine but I'm accessing it via a shared folder.

13
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:24.500
I'm going to click run the install has been verified and then files are being extracted.

14
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:32.380
I'm going to click yes to allow the program to make changes to the computer so the solar wins installer

15
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.480
is starting the installation.

16
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:44.240
Now I'm told that so the windows requires Microsoft to Dot Net Framework version 4.5.

17
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:51.130
If this version is not already installed so the wins will install the required Dot Net Framework version

18
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.690
before installing your solutions application.

19
00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.320
Click install to begin the installation of the Microsoft up NET Framework.

20
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.700
Something to click install to install Microsoft Update.

21
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.430
Now to make sure that you don't get bored with these videos.

22
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:16.630
I'm going to speed up the installation process save some processes are taking a long time to complete.

23
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.700
I'm going to simply speed them up in the video.

24
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.970
OK so Microsoft stock Knecht has been installed.

25
00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.440
I'm now shown to the welcome was it for the Orion network performance monitor software.

26
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.990
So it says Welcome to the install it for Ryan.

27
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.940
Network performance monitor.

28
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.410
Click next to continue.

29
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.730
I'm going to click next to start the installation.

30
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.840
You need to choose your language.

31
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.860
In my case I'm going to select English.

32
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:53.160
I'm told that Arayan requires Internet Information Services or IOPS but it's not currently installed.

33
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.530
After completing the installation the Orion configuration was it can install ISIS automatically.

34
00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:00.640
Don't want to do this.

35
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:09.930
Yes I do submenus continue with the Arayan installation the license agreement is then displayed it's

36
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.540
obviously recommended that you read the license agreement before accepting the terms.

37
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:22.230
I'm going to accept the terms and then click next and then AWST to choose a destination installation

38
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.460
location.

39
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.420
I'm going to stick with the default and click next.

40
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.770
I then need to choose the install type.

41
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:38.010
Am I going to use an express install which is the recommended way of doing it so fully install Arayan

42
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.730
network performance monitor as quickly as possible.

43
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.830
Or do an advanced installation.

44
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.370
In this case because I simply want to get the software up and running as quickly as possible.

45
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:58.070
I'm going to go for the express install and click next NPM now supports Kiyoshi or quality of experience

46
00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.780
traffic monitoring.

47
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.830
I'm then asked whether I want to install this.

48
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.670
In this case because I want to get it up and running quickly I'm going to select the default values

49
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.490
and enable Chione and click next.

50
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.630
I'm told that the set up has enough information to start copying the files.

51
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:24.570
If you want to review or change any settings click back if you are satisfied click next.

52
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:33.720
I'm happy with that so I'm going to click next and start the NPM installation so NPM is installing various

53
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:42.130
components including Microsoft Visual C++ installation takes a while.

54
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:48.180
I'm going to speed up the video so that you don't have to wait for the full installation taking place

55
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.610
in real time.

56
00:04:53.510 --> 00:05:02.750
We are told now that the installation has been completed we are now told that the installation has successfully

57
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.810
completed so the database is being set up.

58
00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.510
The Web site is being set up.

59
00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:14.840
All services are running and we can launch the web console by checking those checkbox which is checked

60
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.580
by default.

61
00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:25.860
I'm going to click Finish to exit the configuration was it I can then connect to the local host on port

62
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.030
80 787 and then log in to the solar winds.

63
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:40.260
NPM server noticed by default we can log in with a username of admin and no password to change the admin

64
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.650
password off to log in.

65
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:49.350
Click Settings manage accounts so I'm going to log in with the default user name of admin and a blank

66
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:50.900
password.

67
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:58.710
So at this point I have successfully installed NPM and I can access the console.

68
00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.880
The next step is to follow the wizard to discover the network.

69
00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:09.450
But before I do that I need to configure the virtual machine for integration with Jinnah's three.
