00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.720
Look at IP version 6 routing protocols.

2
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.860
Now a lot of the routing protocols you've seen in conversion for have been updated for IP version 6

3
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.200
version 6 uses a different address structure.

4
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.460
So the key version for writing protocols cannot be used in IP version 6.

5
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.950
The updated versions of the routing protocols need to be used.

6
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.740
Now some examples I Version 6 routing types include static routes and I'll show you a little bit later

7
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.490
how to set up static routes.

8
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.520
I'm also going to show you how to set up rip in G or next generation which is essentially REPP in October

9
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.570
and 6.

10
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.860
Now if I were you I would remember the various routing protocols listed here.

11
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.330
Don't worry too much about the Archies.

12
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.230
Put them here for completeness.

13
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.390
If you really want to get into the depth of the routing protocols have a look at these or it sees OSPF

14
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.550
version 3 is a version of OSPF that supports IP version 6.

15
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:13.150
We also have ISIS for IPV 6 as well as a multi protocol BGP version for multi protocol BGP essentially

16
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:22.900
supports multiple protocols including IP version for IP version 6 and VPN before use in NPL environments.

17
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:30.700
The thing to remember is multi protocol BGP version 4 is the BGP version used in IPV six environments.

18
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.810
The GOP is also being updated.

19
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.020
So we have the GOP for IP version 6.

20
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.490
It's important that you remember this command in global configuration mode on a router you need to tap

21
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:48.390
the C'mon IPV six unicast cost routing before you can enable any routing protocols on that router.

22
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:59.050
So just to demonstrate that he has a router saying Global config mode I'm going to type IPV six Rodda

23
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.420
and let's try an enable rep.

24
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.610
And now an IP version 6 you need to specify a string to identify the reprocess.

25
00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.220
Let's just say RIP.

26
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.080
And notice it says IP B-6 routing is not enabled.

27
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:21.070
So I have to type IP V-6 unique cause routing and now I can tap the came on ITV 6 herad a rep with a

28
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.880
string.

29
00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:29.200
So please don't forget you need to top the common IP V-6 unicast routing before enabling a routing protocol

30
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.480
that supports IP version 6 on Cisco routers.

31
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:40.030
Now rip N-G is very similar to repped in IP version for it's a distance vector routing protocol.

32
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.030
It has a radius of 15 hops 16 is set to infinity.

33
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:50.620
It still use a split horizon poison reverse and it's based very much on repletion too.

34
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.720
In other words the version of REPP used an IP version for environments.

35
00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.110
There have been updates.

36
00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.350
It obviously needs to support the IP B-6 Prefect's.

37
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:05.320
In other words support IPV six addresses next Hoppa addresses are set to the IP V-6 address because

38
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:12.220
we could run a network entirely using IP version 6 with no IP version for now it uses a multicast group

39
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:20.590
of 5 0 to Colin Kurla 9 which is the all the routers multi-course group that is the multicast address

40
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.570
used for rep updates.

41
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:29.500
In reply one if you remember Ripp sains updates using broadcasts broadcasts are no longer supported

42
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.690
in IP version 6.

43
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:37.130
So they cannot be used broadcast also have some inherent disadvantages which we've covered previously.

44
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.880
Reversion to uses multicast address 2 2 4 0 0 9.

45
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.730
So one of the well-known multi-course addresses and you can see this address is very similar to version

46
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.230
2 and version 2 it's 2 2 4 0 0 9.

47
00:03:53.230 --> 00:04:00.300
In other words that's the multi-course address used in IP version for encrypt N-G in IP version 6 we

48
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.620
use multicast address F-0 to call uncolored 9.

49
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:10.300
So let's say some consistency in the multicast group number IP version 6 is used for the transport of

50
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.410
Ripp updates.

51
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.770
REP.

52
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:22.100
N-G since updates on UDP port five to one that's an able rep G or next generation on these routers saying

53
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:30.840
global config mode I can tap IP V-6 Varada rather.

54
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.510
And then I need to specify a string to identify this process.

55
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.220
So I'm just going to call it in G.

56
00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:45.390
And you can see that I'm now in can figure out a mode of I need to go into my interfaces and top IPV

57
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:56.360
6 Ripp the process name and then top enable and I can do that on each interface.

58
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:05.070
You don't have to do this command first but that will allow you to change various parameters.

59
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:13.580
I can do the same thing on rockety the top IPV six Rodda rip

60
00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.370
will just change this to ngi too.

61
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.730
Because this is on route to go to my interface's

62
00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.060
and we've now enabled REPP back in Rodda.

63
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.190
One can top the C'mon show.

64
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:52.430
IPV 6 rocks to see my writing table and after a while I should see my rip roots populate in the writing

65
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.090
table.

66
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.150
So knock and talk.

67
00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.910
Ping 2001 Colin.

68
00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:02.970
One color in one color and three color on one which is this IP address.

69
00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.040
The and you can see the ping succeeds.

70
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.150
Some able to ping from router 1 to router.

71
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:20.350
I could also do this source and specify the first ethernet interface on route one and you can see the

72
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.660
ping succeeds.

73
00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.250
So it's as simple as that to set up or up.

74
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:29.590
I could also advertise a default route from router 1 to a T

75
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.510
so going on to the serial interface.

76
00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.730
I can top that come on IPV 6.

77
00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:43.890
The process name and then default information originate

78
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:57.170
to send a default dropped gravity on Ratatouille is writing table so show IPV six route

79
00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.280
notice here.

80
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:09.060
I'm getting a default route the default route is represented by colon on for Slash 0.

81
00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:15.150
Notice the administrative distance of rape in G is still 120 and we still have a hop count.

82
00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.520
In this case of T.

83
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:21.340
Notice she has an example looking at the route from router 1.

84
00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:24.920
So this route here is the rat on.

85
00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:34.620
Ethan It's 0 1 1 one notice we are learning it to Vire not to this address but via the link local address

86
00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:36.250
on router 1.

87
00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:46.190
So going on to Route 1 is an example show IPV 6 interface serials 0 0 notice the link local addresses.

88
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:55.200
If 80 C 600 and so forth which is the address here link local addresses are used by writing protocols

89
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.290
to ever type routes to one another.

90
00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:03.420
These addresses are not being used by the routing protocols to advertise the rats other commands I can

91
00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:11.490
type or for instance show IP V-6 rep which shows me information about Ripp you can see for instance

92
00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.860
which interfaces Ripper's enabled on.

93
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:19.850
You can see it's administrative distance max number of pause that it supports 16 in this case Edmon

94
00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:21.750
distances 120.

95
00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:28.230
You can see the multicast group which if you remember back to Activision Foy's 2 2 4 0 0 9.

96
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:38.330
So something similar here if if 0 2 color and color 9 of information very similar to Version 4 is for

97
00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:43.120
instance updates are sent every 30 seconds so they expire off 180 seconds.

98
00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.870
We still have split horizon.

99
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:49.110
We still have poison reverse and we still have hold on timers.

100
00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:57.980
I can see just a rip gruts in the writing table by tapping the C'mon show IPV 6 frocked repr and you

101
00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.460
can see my two routes on Route 2.

102
00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:08.960
We are learning a default dropped from router 1 and we are learning about this network which is this

103
00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:16.220
one over here both by the linked local address of serial 0 0 on router 1.

104
00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:27.880
Now lets configure OSPF on these routers so in global config mode I can type IPV 6 Varada OSPF and specify

105
00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:29.980
process idea of let's say 1.

106
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:39.200
Notice what it says OSPF version 3 Crossus one could not pick a router ID even though this is OSPF version

107
00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:39.980
3.

108
00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.670
In other words OSPF IP version 6.

109
00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:48.220
It requires a router ID in IP version 4 format.

110
00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.710
So I'm going to put that in as quadruple one.

111
00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.590
You need to go to the interfaces to put them into the various areas.

112
00:09:55.610 --> 00:10:03.390
So I'm going to type IP V-6 OSPF pro-ISIS ID is one specified area.

113
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:08.780
In this case I'll specify area 1 on the serial interface.

114
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:10.480
I'll put that into areas.

115
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.400
We need to do the same thing on router.

116
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:26.870
So IP B-6 router always IPF let's just make this process to give it Arata ID quadruple to go into the

117
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.290
first definity interface.

118
00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:37.150
ITV 6 OSPF to in other words a process ID.

119
00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:44.650
And let's put this into area to go into the Ciril interface and let's put that into area zero.

120
00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.230
So hopefully we should form a neighbor relationship.

121
00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:49.650
And as you can see it's taking place.

122
00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.500
The relationship has gone to full.

123
00:10:51.610 --> 00:11:01.280
So hopefully we should get Drats from Route 1 so show IPV 6 Berat notice here we have received an OSPF

124
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:10.010
in to area route from router 1 telling us about this network notices no one at the end here because

125
00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:12.980
that is a network address not a host address.

126
00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:23.770
So on Route 1 let's create credit loopback interface so give it an IP V-6 address of let's say 2002.

127
00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:32.300
Carl uncolored one slash 64 put that into OSPF area one member commodity.

128
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:34.670
It's a new look at V.F. rocks.

129
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:39.070
And here you go.

130
00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:46.310
We have now learnt about the loop back on Route 1 through OSPF and it's displayed in the writing table

131
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.070
of rockety.

132
00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:54.020
I could ping 2002 Karl and one or other call and call on one.

133
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:57.280
And as you can see they the ping is successful.

134
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.870
It's as simple as that to set up a version 3.

135
00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:08.060
In other words OSPF the IP version 6 that's important to realize that we are only running IP version

136
00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:13.060
6 on these routers for example I type show IP route.

137
00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:20.150
You'll notice there are no routes on Route 1 and on route to the writing table displays in the same

138
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:25.340
way that there are no rats there are no IP version 4 addresses configured on these routers.

139
00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:27.730
So nothing gets displayed in the writing table.

140
00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:30.860
It is possible to run both protocols at the same time.

141
00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:38.590
So on router 2 on the serial interface lets configure an IP address of 201 2.0

142
00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:48.030
and now if our top show IP route noticed that route appears in the writing table on Route 1 there are

143
00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:53.880
still no rocks because no provision for addresses have been configured on the serial Zerah interface.

144
00:12:53.880 --> 00:13:00.050
I could do something like IP address 10 1 to 1 with a mosque.

145
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.760
And now the writing table will display that grot.

146
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:10.570
So I could ping 10 1 to 2 which is the IP address of router 2.

147
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:20.480
All I could ping 2001 Colan one Cullin one Kurland to tell uncurl on T which is the IP version 6 address

148
00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.500
of router.

149
00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.530
I could also for instance trying to telnet to the router

150
00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:30.950
and as you can see its his password required but Nunspeet

151
00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:48.920
not can do the same in version 6 so in Ratatouille let's create a Viti y password password.

152
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:53.490
Cisco Creadon enabled password of Cisco.

153
00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:58.000
And now let's try and telnet from Rotto want to write it to using division 6.

154
00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:04.740
And as you can see here we are able to tell that successfully and get an IP version 4.

155
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:07.450
Notice we are able to telnet successfully.

156
00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:13.230
In other words both protocols can be run at the same time running side by side.

157
00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.820
This is known once again as running a dual stack.

158
00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:23.670
Both the provision for stack and the IP version 6 stack are running side by side.

159
00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:29.690
You can also clear the OSPF process in a similar fashion to Activision for you just literally taught

160
00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:35.060
clear IPV 6 OSPF crossest.

161
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:37.880
And that clears the OSPF processes.

162
00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:42.520
You can see the neighbor relationship was torn down and then re-established.

163
00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:48.690
So a lot of the concepts are very similar between IP version for an IP version 6.

164
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:54.560
Another example of a command that's very similar in IP version 6 as an IP version 4 is you can do the

165
00:14:54.560 --> 00:15:00.230
come on ITV six hostname and not specify a hostname let's say or two.

166
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:05.740
And then I can specify its address.

167
00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:09.730
So now I've got ping are to do that again.

168
00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:17.090
Notice the ping succeeds let's look at some of the vision for kabillion six transition mechanisms.

169
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:20.000
There is fortunately transition richness.

170
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.510
In other words there is no fixed date to convert.

171
00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:30.460
This is not like Y2K where the whole world was supposedly going to fall apart at the end of 1999.

172
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:33.160
There's no need for all of us to convert at once.

173
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:35.540
However this is becoming very important.

174
00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:43.250
As I mentioned earlier as I'm recording this a week ago the available IP version for address space was

175
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:44.190
exhausted.

176
00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:50.200
So it's becoming critical now for businesses to look at ways to transition to IP version 6.

177
00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.630
There are multiple transition mechanisms available.

178
00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:59.300
The first one is what's called Running a jewel stack where you run both IP version for an IP version

179
00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:03.470
6 at the same time on a single host.

180
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:08.900
So this MacBook for example has an IP version for address as well as an IP version 6 address.

181
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:15.120
But in the Mac Pokhran is communicating to the server it can use my provision for.

182
00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:20.900
But when communicating to this server it can use IP version 6.

183
00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:27.050
So this is the typical analogy where a person can speak two languages and as an analogy would speak

184
00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.700
English to one server and French to another server.

185
00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:38.750
But in this case IPV for the server that only runs IPV for an IP V-6 to the server that only runs IP

186
00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:40.740
version 6.

187
00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.100
A lot of operating systems support this.

188
00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:53.540
There's an example in Windows I can bring 170 I can ping 127 0 0 1 the loopback an IP version for once

189
00:16:53.540 --> 00:17:02.990
again I can thing the loop back in IP version 6 this Windows machine supports both protocols and in

190
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:07.790
this case based on the address the specific protocol is chosen.

191
00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:13.680
So this example we're looking at an IP version 4 protocols stack and this example the application being

192
00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.000
used only supports IP version 4.

193
00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:23.460
So when data is sent from the application layer down to the physical layer the application will choose

194
00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:26.320
whether it's using TZP UDP layer 4.

195
00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:32.850
It would then use the provision for protocol stack at least three at least two that Ethernet type would

196
00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:34.340
be set to zero.

197
00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:35.230
X 800.

198
00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:40.590
If this is an Ethernet to frame that would then be forwarded across the physical media in this case

199
00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.150
Ethernet.

200
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:48.680
If an application supports both IP version for an IP version 6 the application may choose either TZP

201
00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.870
to UDP depending on how it's been programmed.

202
00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.920
And then the protocol stack 3 would be chosen.

203
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:59.050
Are we using IP version code or are we using IP version 6.

204
00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:04.590
So the choice of particle stack would be determined by for instance the destination IP address that

205
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:10.980
we going to or by using a DNS server that determines which protocol stack is used.

206
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:17.190
The application programming interface or API of the application needs to be able to handle IP version

207
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:19.550
6 formatted addresses.

208
00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:26.330
So as I've shown you previously in HGP the IP version 6 address would have to be put in brackets.

209
00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:32.100
So the application would need to be able to handle those address formats for example the infinite type

210
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:39.450
would then be chosen once again if it's version 4 of IP the Senate type would be set to 0 x 800.

211
00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:43.710
But if it's IP version 6 the ethernet type would be set to 0 x 8 6.

212
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:48.010
DD That would then be forwarded across the physical medium.

213
00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:54.390
So when data is sent from an application let's say Internet Explorer depending on various parameters.

214
00:18:54.480 --> 00:19:01.650
For example the role that you specified the browser the data would be sent across the IP version 6 stack

215
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:09.740
all across the IP version 4 stack down to the physical medium and other transition mechanism is to use

216
00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:10.640
tunneling.

217
00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:16.220
In this example we have a host on the left hand side that is running IP version 6 on the right hand

218
00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:23.270
side the server is running IP version 6 but the rod is connected by an IP version for only network so

219
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:26.990
IP version 6 addresses will not be routed by this infrastructure.

220
00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:34.100
So what you can do is you can set up a tunnel between router 1 and router two to tunnel IP version 6

221
00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:36.410
over IP version 4.

222
00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:42.410
There are multiple ways to do this you can either use manual tunneling or dynamic Sixty-Four tunneling

223
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:46.750
or intra site or a medic tunnel addressing protocol will last.

224
00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:49.130
You can use to RIDO tunneling.

225
00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:52.000
Now let's look at each of those in more depth.

226
00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:57.990
See as an example of tunneling IP version 6 packets over not be vision for infrastructure.

227
00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:05.660
The Mac book on the left hand side since IP version 6 data inside of an IP version 6 header to its default

228
00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:14.660
gateway which is let's say router one router one will then take the IP version 6 information and encapsulated

229
00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:23.450
inside IP version for a tunnel is set up from the local provision for address of router one to the remote

230
00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.120
IP address on rabbity.

231
00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:29.740
So please note this is an extra IP header.

232
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:36.350
In other words an IP version for header is prepended to the front of the IP version 6 header encapsulates

233
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:38.660
the IP version 6 information.

234
00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:41.130
So Rod is in the provision for infrastructure.

235
00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:44.380
Never see the IP version 6 header.

236
00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:48.890
They only see the provision for header not shown more detail.

237
00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:52.620
The provision for header I've shown you the source and destination addresses.

238
00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:59.420
But this is part of the same header when the packet gets routed to the IP version for headers are stripped

239
00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:06.920
off and the packet is sent on the remote LAN as a pure IP version 6 packet.

240
00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:11.370
Now when setting up tunneling it's important remember that the protocol type is 41.

241
00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:15.980
So the IP version 6 packet is encapsulated within IP version 4.

242
00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:22.730
And when Activision for encapsulates that IP version 6 packet a protocol type of 41 is specified in

243
00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:30.380
IP version 4 header TCAP for example has a protocol type of 6 and UDP protocol type of 17.

244
00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:35.150
And in this case IP version 6 is set to protocol clapt 41.

245
00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:37.550
The head is 20 bytes in size.

246
00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:40.690
When there are no options this can cause some problems.

247
00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:48.980
The maximum transmission unit between our two hosts the MacBook and the server is reduced by 20 bytes

248
00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:56.310
because of this additional header can be difficult to troubleshoot issues with tunneling as an example.

249
00:21:56.330 --> 00:22:02.210
The rod is in the cloud could be blocking protocol 41 and we need to be changed to allow that traffic

250
00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:09.860
through in manual tunneling you are mentally establishing the tunnel between router 1 and router 2 and

251
00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:15.740
I'm going to demonstrate how to do that a little bit later with dynamic 64 tunneling that tunnel is

252
00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:22.830
automatically established between the IP B-6 networks through the IP version for network presenting

253
00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:29.710
of source and destination IP version 4 addresses is not required for these automatic tunnel's automatic

254
00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:36.800
prefix assignment is way one aggregated global unit cost IPV 6 prefix is assigned to each Sixty-Four

255
00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:42.150
site and these are based on the specific address 2002.

256
00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:46.150
Colon colon slash 16 is signed by the ANA.
