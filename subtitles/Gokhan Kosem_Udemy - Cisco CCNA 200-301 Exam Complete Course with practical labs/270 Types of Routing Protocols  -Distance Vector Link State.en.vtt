00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
There are different types of paradigms or algorithms used by routing protocols.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The first type is distance vector also known as routing by rumor.

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Distance vector routing protocols will determine

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the direction and the distance to a destination.

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The direction is also known as a vector

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and the distance such as hop count is determined to any destination in the network.

7
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.000
RIP as an example, uses hop count to determine the cost or distance of a remote network.

8
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The advantage of distance vector routing protocols

9
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
is that they are very simple to configure.

10
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The major disadvantage of distance vector routing protocols

11
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
is that they have limited visibility

12
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
they only know what neighbors tell them

13
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and that’s where the concept or analogy of routing by rumor comes from.

14
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
It’s possible that routers will learn incorrect information

15
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
or make bad choices based on the information that they received from their neighbors.

16
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Distance vector routing protocols

17
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
used the Bellman–Ford algorithm to calculate paths.

18
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
This requires that a router inform its neighbors of topology changes

19
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
periodically and in some cases when changes are detected in the network.

20
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000
RIP as an example, will advertise its entire routing table every 30 seconds

21
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and will send triggered updates when there’s a change in the topology.

22
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Distance vector means that routers advertise routes

23
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
as a vector of the distance and direction.

24
00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Direction is represented by the next hop address and local exit interface and distance

25
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
uses a metric such as hop count in RIP to determine the cost of a route.

26
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
It’s important to understand that distance vector routing protocols

27
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
do not have knowledge of the entire path to a destination

28
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
hence once again the term routing by rumors

29
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
used because the routers are relying on the information that they've received

30
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
from other routers and they themselves cannot determine

31
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
if the information is actually valid or true.

32
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
This can introduce instability and routing loops

33
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and thus multiple features have been introduced to try and combat loops.

34
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
As an example, mechanisms or features

35
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
used to stop routing loops include split horizon

36
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
poisoned reverse and trigger updates.

37
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000
As an analogy distance vector routing protocols have information available to them

38
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
in a similar fashion to the information shown on a road sign.

39
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
If you’re on a road going to a destination

40
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and you don’t have a map you must rely on the road signs

41
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
to tell you the direction of the destination

42
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000
and the distance to get to it, in the same way in distance vector routing protocols

43
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
a router does not know  the entire path to every network segment.

44
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
The router only knows the direction or vector in which to send the packet.

45
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
The distance vector routing approach

46
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
to determine the direction called a vector

47
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and distance such as hop count to any destination network.

48
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
So to summarize, distance vector means

49
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.000
that a destination such as 10.1.1.0 is a distance of 5 hops away

50
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
in the direction of the next hop router router 2

51
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
that statement sums up essentially

52
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
how distance vector routing protocol operate.

53
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.000
The destination 10.1.1.0 is a distance of 5 hops away in the direction or router 2

54
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:24.000
this is similar to our analogy of using a road sign to get to a destination.

55
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Links state routing protocols on the other hand

56
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
have a complete map of the area

57
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Every router built its own internal map of the entire network topology

58
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
in its link state also called topology database

59
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
each router then runs its own shortest path first algorithm

60
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
to calculate the shortest path to all known destinations.

61
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
An example, of a links state routing protocol is OSPF

62
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
which uses cost as its routing metric which is based on bandwidth.

63
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Link state routing protocols cannot be fooled as easily

64
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
into making bad routing decisions

65
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
because they have a full view of the network topology.

66
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
They can make better choices or more informed decisions

67
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
because they have a full view of the path

68
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
to get to a destination network.

69
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
A road sign use by distance vector routing protocols

70
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
we just say go left and the network is 5 hops away.

71
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
However, a link state routing protocol has a road map

72
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
which allows the router to see the path to the destination

73
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
and therefore the router can make a better choice

74
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and how to get to that destination network.

75
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
The name link state means that each router

76
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
originates information about itself

77
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000
it’s directly connected interfaces or links and the state of those links

78
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
in other words other links up or other links down.

79
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
This information is then passed between all routers

80
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
and each router makes its own copy of that information

81
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
but doesn't change the information

82
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
That means that all routers end up sharing

83
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
the same information within a network or area

84
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
and that’s what called a topological database.

85
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:32.000
In OSPF as an example, you could use a command such as display ospf lsdb

86
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
to see the link state database that’s identical on all routers in the area.

87
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
So each router has identical information about the network

88
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and each router can make independent decisions

89
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
on how to calculate its best path.

90
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
link state routing protocols use an algorithm

91
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.000
called SPF or Shortest Path First which was develop by EW Dijkstra

92
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
and is a very powerful algorithm use by protocols

93
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
such as OSPF and ISIS, once again links state routing protocols

94
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:14.000
have a better visibility of the network than distance vector routing protocols do.

95
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000
So in summary, each router has a copy of the topological database

96
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
which is all routes in the entire network or area

97
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000
and the routers use the Shortest Path algorithm or SPF algorithm

98
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
to determine the best part to every destination.

99
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
The routers have better visibility than distance vector routing protocols.

100
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
however, the disadvantage of link state routing protocols

101
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
is that they are more difficult to configure

102
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
they require a hierarchical network topology

103
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000
where you would have a backbone area, area 0 and multiple other areas.

104
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Link state routing protocols also require more memory

105
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
because they maintain multiple tables such as a neighbor table

106
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
a link state database table and routing table

107
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000
the SPF or Shortest Past First algorithm can also be process intensive

108
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
and thus link state routing protocols require more powerful CPUs

109
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
and more memory in routers than distance vector routing protocols do.
