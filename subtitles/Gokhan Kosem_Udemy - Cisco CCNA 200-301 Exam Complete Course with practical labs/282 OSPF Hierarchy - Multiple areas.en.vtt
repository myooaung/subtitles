00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Link state routing protocols such as OSPF

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
allow for the division of large Autonomous System into smaller groupings called areas.

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
In this example, we have a RIP router

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
connected to a router running both RIP and OSPF

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
so RIP is connected to an OSPF Autonomous System.

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The routers within OSPF are under common administrative domain

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
in other words, they are part of the Autonomous System.

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The OSPF Autonomous System however

9
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
can be broken up into multiple areas to allow for smaller routing tables

10
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
reduction of flooding of link state advertisements

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
rank summarization and more efficient use of resources.

12
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
If you have many routers in a single area, the routing tables of those routers

13
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
can get very large, so this allows for the reduction of routing tables on certain routers

14
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
by breaking the Autonomous System into a hierarchical design with multiple areas.

15
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
In OSPF, these routers are known as Area Border Routers or ABRs

16
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
they have interfaces in multiple areas.

17
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
These routers are known as internal routers as they are only part of a single area

18
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
they have no interfaces in any other areas.

19
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
This router is known as an Autonomous System border router as it connects OSPF

20
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
to an external Autonomous System or routing process which in this case is RIP.

21
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
These routers are known as backbone routers

22
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and they also called internal routers.

23
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
They are internal to the backbone area.

24
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
one of the advantages of creating multiple areas is that

25
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
link changes within 1 area are hidden from other routers in other areas

26
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000
so within OSPF if we had network 10.1.1.0 in area 1

27
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and that network went down that information will be hidden from routers in other areas.

28
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
They wouldnâ€™t have to rerun the SPF algorithm

29
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
because they're unaware of that network going down.

30
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000
so this router in area 2 and this router in are 3 will not be aware of that fact

31
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
that network 10.1.1.0 has gone down

32
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
you can do this by configuring area 2

33
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and area 3 as what are called stub and totally stubby areas.

34
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
You can also use route summarization to reduce

35
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
the need to rerun the SPF algorithm when a network goes down.

36
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
The idea here is to use your resources more efficiently

37
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
by reducing the flooding of link state advertisements.

38
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Links state advertisements within area 1 are contained within that area

39
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
or limited to that area and summary LSAs propagated to other areas.

40
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
These summary LSAs are blocked by Area Border of Routers or ABRs

41
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
so they donâ€™t go into other areas such as area 2.

42
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
So routers in area 2 are unaware of specific routes in area 1.

43
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
To enable connectivity a summary route

44
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
or default route can be propagated into area 2.
