00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:09.670
Example false systems include TFT P represented by TFT P colon flash memory represented by Flesch colon

2
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:16.480
RAM or system colon nv ram nv ram colon and Goosby flash.

3
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.960
And as an example you may have used be Flash 0 or use B flash 1.

4
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.010
This is dependent on what's available in your router.

5
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:34.510
So on the 1041 show file systems allows us to view various false systems available on the router.

6
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:44.850
Notice system nv ram flash TFT P RCP ATP and others.

7
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:53.110
Now Paik represents a logical internal fault system used for internal functions and commands network

8
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.300
is an external fault system.

9
00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:04.370
So notice network for TFT P network for HDD P ATP and others so Network represents an external fault

10
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.030
system of different servers using different protocols.

11
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:17.520
Disk is used for flash and this is the place where the Cisco Iwate is going to be booted from by default.

12
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:27.520
Notice the hash sign or pound sign USP fleshes used for use B flash and NV RAM is nonvolatile RAM.

13
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.640
That's where the startup config is stored.

14
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.910
The show running config command displays the running config found in system the show startup config

15
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:44.960
command displays the startup config found in nv ram and show flash refers to the default file system

16
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.630
which is typically flash zero.

17
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:58.240
So once again show run shows us the current configuration found in system show startup config shows

18
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:07.790
us the saved configuration found in nv ram and show flash shows us the built in flash on the router.

19
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:18.690
As an example here we only have one flash card available but you may have more depending on the router

20
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.020
that you are working on.

21
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.930
As an example we could say copy and notice all the options.

22
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:36.630
Lets say copy nv ram and what is there different options here including the startup config so startup

23
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:43.560
config and lets save that in Flash.

24
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:53.780
As copy start docked if CFT show flash

25
00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:10.640
days are copy start config and if you use the command more flash copy start config the shows us the

26
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.110
copy of the startup config that we copied from nv ram.
