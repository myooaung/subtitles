00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In this video we're going to discuss routing.

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We'll look at the basics of IP routing and look at different routing protocols

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
including distance vector and link-state routing protocols.

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We'll compare differences between distance vector routing protocols

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
such as RIP and link-state routing protocols such as OSPF

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We'll also discuss some of the methods that distance vector routing protocols use to stop loops.

7
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Routing protocols are very important

8
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
because they advertise networks and used various mechanism to prevent loops.
