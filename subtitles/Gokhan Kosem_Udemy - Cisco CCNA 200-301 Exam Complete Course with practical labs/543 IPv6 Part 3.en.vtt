1
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:08.700
IP version 6 or link local addresses or unique cost addresses but restricted to the local link hence

2
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.650
the name link local.

3
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.780
There are still hundred twenty eight bits and length the interface identifies automatically configured

4
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:25.120
with the EU IP address Notah ever that the most significant 10 bits of the address start with 80 in

5
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:32.110
hexadecimal or seven binary ones followed by binary zero followed by binary one followed by binary zero

6
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:40.490
in binary routing protocols use link local addresses to advertise routes to one another and an IP version

7
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:47.510
6 at a node having a global unicast address on a local link will use the link local address of its default

8
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.050
IPV six router rather than the global unicast address.

9
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.680
This is good because if the network is renumbered the default router can still be used using the linked

10
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:05.340
local address link local addresses won't change when you renumber your global unicast addresses.

11
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.490
Site local addresses.

12
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.210
Also another type of unicast address but have a limited scope to a site site local addresses are not

13
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.740
enabled by default on nodes unlike link local addresses which are automatically enabled.

14
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.610
In other words you have to configure site local addresses.

15
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:33.200
The address starts with C Zira with the most significant 10 bits set in binary to 7 binary ones followed

16
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.120
by binary zero followed by two binary ones.

17
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:45.270
So the most significant 10 bits of a site local address always start with this value so that local addresses

18
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.320
are the IP version 6 equivalent of or FC 19:18 addresses.

19
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.500
These however have been deprecated and should no longer be used.

20
00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.370
But the idea was that you could have many many subnets within your organization as you would now have

21
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:11.550
54 bits for subsetting which is far greater than the 16 beds that you get with global unicast addresses.

22
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:19.950
The next type of address is an IP for compatible IP D6 address in this address.

23
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:27.570
The most significant 96 bits are set to 0 and the least significant 32 bits are set to the IP version

24
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.680
for address.

25
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:37.760
This is a special unit cost RPV 6 address uses a transition mechanism on hosts and routers to automatically

26
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.840
create IPV for tunnel's to deliver IPV six packets over IPV four networks.

27
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:52.730
This mechanism allowed for the automatic establishment of an IP B-6 over IPV for tunnel between two

28
00:02:52.760 --> 00:03:02.210
nodes over and RPV for infrastructure using the IP version for destination address inside the destination

29
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.270
IP V-6 address.

30
00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.920
So the format of the address would be as follows.

31
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.360
The most significant 96 bits would be set to zero.

32
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:18.890
The least significant 32 bits would be set to the decimal representation of the IP version for address

33
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.620
that could be rewritten as follows.

34
00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:29.870
So colon colon 1 9 2 0 to 100 the decimal Ickey version for address could also be written as a hexadecimal

35
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:30.600
value.

36
00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:42.270
So this would be the same address for example 190 in decimal is equal to zero in hexadecimal.

37
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.970
Notice 1 2 equates to see.

38
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:53.990
So once again it's used to represent the addresses of IP version 4 nodes as IP version 6 addresses.

39
00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:00.580
Please note that this address format has been deprecated in favor of other more enhanced transmission

40
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:07.690
mechanisms such as dynamic net Peetie or net protocol translation.

41
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:16.290
It's also important to point out that the IPV for comparable IPV six addresses use a slash 96 mosque.

42
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.340
So 96 boats are set to zero.

43
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:26.990
The mosque is Flesch 96 the least significant 32 bits are set to the IP version for address either in

44
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:35.030
dotted decimal notation such as your or a hexadecimal representation of the address like in this example.

45
00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.410
As I've already mentioned unspecified addresses is where the address is set to zeros and it's used as

46
00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.800
a placeholder when no address is available.

47
00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:53.320
So during an initial DHP request or duplicate address detection loopback addresses are set to zeros

48
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.490
and Lawsie or 1.

49
00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:02.670
This is equivalent to 127 0 0 1 an IP version 4 and as used by the host to identify itself.

50
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:09.450
I've already demonstrated this and can be used to check that the IP V-6 protocol stack is functioning

51
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.100
properly.

52
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:19.660
So in summary IPV 6 unique cost addresses can be broken up into six types.

53
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.480
The first type is unspecified.

54
00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:31.450
So colon colon slash 128 then loop back colon colon one slash 128 and then we have aggregate all global

55
00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:39.700
unicast addresses and yes some examples of ranges these Remember globally unique There's no need for

56
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:45.800
net because you have global reachability that addresses unique globally.

57
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:51.270
Then we have linked local addresses which address is used only on the local link used for example by

58
00:05:51.270 --> 00:06:01.600
writing protocols starts with 80 in hexadecimal site local addresses or similar in concept to RAFC 19:18

59
00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.190
private addresses.

60
00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.670
They start with F E C.

61
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.340
IPV for compatible addresses.

62
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:17.230
The most significant 96 bits are set to zero and that's allowed us to create automatic tunneling of

63
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:26.520
IPV six of the IPV for both site local and IPV for comparable addresses have been deprecated now multicast

64
00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.400
addresses are broken up into two parts.

65
00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:37.130
If if the 00 slash 8 or assigned multi-course addresses and then you have solicited node multi-course

66
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:44.170
addresses for each unique cost and any cost address configured on an interface of a node or router a

67
00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:50.730
corresponding solicited node multicast address is automatically enabled the solicited node multicast

68
00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:55.050
address is scoped to the local link.

69
00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:00.020
This is an example is used for the replacement of up an IP version 4.

70
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:08.540
If you remember up uses broadcasts but broadcasts are no longer supported in IP version 6 so the solicited

71
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:14.660
node multicast address is used by nodes and Rod has to learn the linked layer addresses of Navan nodes

72
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.320
and routers on the same link.

73
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:24.680
So very similar concept to up but we are not using broadcasts we are using multicast duplicate address

74
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:31.010
detection or dead can be used by a node to verify whether an IP V-6 address is already in use on its

75
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:32.300
local link.

76
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:38.510
Before using that address to configure its own IP V-6 address with stateless order configuration

77
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:50.450
stateless order configuration is a new function enabled by IP version 6 by having a much larger address

78
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:58.100
space IP version 6 is designed to enable order configuration of IP addresses on devices while keeping

79
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.290
those addresses unique.

80
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:09.770
This enables basic Servilius configuration of nodes as well as easy renumbering routers same periodic

81
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:14.220
router advertisements using a link local address.

82
00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:19.570
I wouldn't try and remember these addresses but the address used would be this.

83
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:26.090
But the source address used would be this going to a multicast address of if have zero to Colan column

84
00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:26.810
one.

85
00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:34.800
In other words all nodes on the link the router uses ICMP version 6 type 1:34 which is known as a router

86
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:43.620
advertisement telling notes information like what prefix to use what the default gateway is and a lifetime

87
00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:51.600
of this prefix that's advertised to them the advertisement period can vary and you can also change the

88
00:08:51.600 --> 00:09:00.320
lifetime of the prefix advertised to hosts when a host initially boots up the node will need its IP

89
00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:00.910
address.

90
00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:02.640
As soon as possible.

91
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:09.380
And normally in the early stages of the boot process it could wait for a long period of time for the

92
00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:16.100
next router advertisement to get the information it needs to configure its interfaces and thus a node

93
00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:23.570
will say I wrote a solicitation message to routers on the network asking them to reply immediately with

94
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:30.970
Erato advertisement so that the node can immediately order configure its IP address so the host will

95
00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:35.440
send a solicitation to all writers using the all Rajiv's multi-course multicast address.

96
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:43.040
It is zero to Colon colon to the host uses ICMP version 6 type 1:33.

97
00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:48.340
Again I wouldn't try and remember all of these ICMP types just understand the process.

98
00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:55.410
The host uses it to link local address as the source of the Rodda solicitation request.

99
00:09:55.660 --> 00:10:03.320
So Jesus if he followed by its address as the source and the message goes to destination of faith Syria

100
00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:06.810
to call Anchal and to all rodders on the local link.

101
00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.480
Harada will reply to that message.

102
00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:18.580
Using ICMP version 6 type 1 3 4 the Radu will use its linked local address of if he A-T and EU.

103
00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:23.470
As the source and the destination will go to if it's 0 2 colorant column 1.

104
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:29.860
In other words all notes on the link sawder configuration has the advantage in that enables plug and

105
00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.390
play configuration of IPV six devices.

106
00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:42.190
You just configure an IP address on the router and by default route advertisements are enabled PCs and

107
00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:48.100
other devices can be plugged into the network and they will automatically learn the prefix assigned

108
00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:55.180
to them and default gateway without the administrator configuring at the HGP server or manually configuring

109
00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.580
IP addresses.

110
00:10:56.590 --> 00:11:02.120
Hosts are automatically configured with the prefix received and then they combine that with a link layer

111
00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:02.800
address.

112
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:09.370
In other words the address to configure a local IP B-6 address to allow them to communicate with the

113
00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:11.350
network.

114
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:15.970
Another advantage of status or configuration is the renumbering of devices.

115
00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:25.210
A router can just advertise a new prefix and time out the old prefix if required and hosts will automatically

116
00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:28.100
be updated with the new prefix information.

117
00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:36.760
So gone are the days of struggling to reconfigure and renumber the IP addresses of hosts now stateful

118
00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:41.730
DHP still exists in version 6 of DHP.

119
00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:48.590
It provides more control and stateless configuration for example of using Cecka IP phones.

120
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:56.370
They need to learn an option 150 from a DHP server which tells the phones the TFT server they need to

121
00:11:56.370 --> 00:12:01.120
connect to to download their configuration as well as their firmware.

122
00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:08.840
So DHP in some cases is still required as it gives us more control and more options.

123
00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:16.490
Now that said you can use stateful DHP concurrently with stateless order configuration so you don't

124
00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:22.990
have to make an explicit choice between the two stateful the AGP can also provide IP version 6 addresses

125
00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:24.790
in the absence of routers.

126
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:30.190
So in this typology there are no routers so DHP server can be configured.

127
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:36.790
It can also be used for network renumbering in the same way as an IP version 4 and it can be used for

128
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:41.210
automatic domain name registration of hosts using dynamic DNS.

129
00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:47.130
So a lot of the concepts available in provision for or supply an IP version 6.

130
00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:51.700
Now in this example we have both a router and a DGP server.

131
00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:58.130
Now the process for acquiring configuration data for a DHP version 6 Cline is very similar to IP version

132
00:12:58.130 --> 00:12:58.730
4.

133
00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:05.780
However initially the client will first detect the presence of routers on the linked by using neighbor

134
00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:07.640
discovery messages.

135
00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:13.340
If at least one router is found as in this diagram the client will examine the rod advertisements to

136
00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:16.790
determine if DHP version 6 should be used.

137
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:22.490
If there are advertisements and able to use of DHP version 6 on the link or if there's no Rodda the

138
00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:27.370
client then starts a DHB solicit phase to find a DHP server.

139
00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.530
So in this example the HBP version 6 can be used.

140
00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:37.350
So the host will send a DHP solicit message to DHP version 6 agents.

141
00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:40.470
In other words the AGP servers using multicast address.

142
00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:48.470
If if 0 2 colon colon one colon to once again just remember anything starting with 0 2 is a multicast

143
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:50.100
address.

144
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:54.080
We do not have broadcasts in IP version 6.

145
00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:58.180
Send the place of broadcasts we're using specific multicast addresses.

146
00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:02.790
The hosts will use a source address of he.

147
00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.150
In other words a link local address.

148
00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:14.230
Now both DHP servers and DHP relays will listen for DHP solicit messages on the multicast address.

149
00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:24.210
So DHP forwarding is very similar in IP version 6 has its own IP version for now if DHP cannot be used

150
00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:30.790
the host reverts to stateless configuration as per the previous examples I've shown you.

151
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:35.640
Now without further ado let's set up a basic IP version 6 network.

152
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:43.440
In this example I have route 1 and router to both route is have a foster ethernet interface router one's

153
00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.700
network and the first Ethan and interfaces going to be 2001.

154
00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:54.020
Column One column one column one router to use force Ethan subnet is going to be 2001 and one color

155
00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:55.900
one color and three.

156
00:14:55.950 --> 00:15:01.740
The rod is connected by a serial link and the subnet is going to be two thousand and one color and one

157
00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.420
color in one color.

158
00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:11.920
Notice once again the subnet mask is always slushed 64 on all subnets OK so an Rato one I'm going to

159
00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.600
break out of the initial configuration dialog

160
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:28.390
going into global config mode and give the Rodda a name and then I'm going to enable IPV sake's unique

161
00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.560
cost routing

162
00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:39.450
so that we can run the B-6 on this router and then I'm going to go into to 0 0.

163
00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:45.540
The first Ethan interface and give it an address or IP V-6.

164
00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.230
I notice there are a lot of options here.

165
00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:56.610
But I'm going to specify a trace and then I'm going to specify an IP V-6 address so 2001

166
00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:11.580
and in this case I'm going to give the interface an address of one such a simple as that to configure

167
00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:22.050
an IP version 6 address on a router this portion is the network portion and notice we've got colon colon

168
00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:29.580
so there were a bunch of zeros not displayed here and we ending in a one.

169
00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:35.860
And then I can no shut the interface.

170
00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:37.920
And as you can see the interfaces come up.

171
00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:41.970
Not taught do pain 2001.

172
00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:53.070
And ping the IP address and as you can see the ping is successful on the serial zero interface.

173
00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:58.810
I can do the same thing IPV six address 2001

174
00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:08.100
and on this side I'm giving it an address of Colan one.

175
00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:13.460
And on this side I'm going to give an address of code on to some router to do the same thing.

176
00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:17.820
Enable IPV six unique cost routing and then on.

177
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:24.090
Seriously zero give it an ITV 6 address of 2001

178
00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:34.710
no shut the interface and 0 0 0 given an address

179
00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:49.310
and shut that interface.

180
00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:53.700
So hopefully now from Rodek to you I should be able to ping wrote a one

181
00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:07.600
that doesn't work because I forgot to shut the interface on the side so no shut it.

182
00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:10.980
And go back to route it to.

183
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:13.660
And let's see if the pings succeeds this time.

184
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.900
The interface came up and as you can see the ping succeeded.

185
00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:25.720
It's as simple as that to configure IP addresses on a Cisco router.

186
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:31.930
Now on the first ethernet interface I could give it another IP address so I could say RPV six trace.

187
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:33.750
Let's just be lazy.

188
00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:39.400
They've given an address of 2001 Carlon called on one slash 64.

189
00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:43.590
And as you can see the rod has accepted that address on the road.

190
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:47.510
I cannot think 2001 Cullen column one.

191
00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:49.610
And as you can see the thing succeeds.

192
00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:52.870
I could go back to the interface and give it an address as follows.

193
00:18:52.890 --> 00:19:00.590
IPV 6 address and it's a 2001 colon to Colon colon.

194
00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:04.650
Notice it gives you the option of link local address but we don't want to do that let's go for Slash

195
00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:06.050
64.

196
00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.230
Notice please.

197
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:14.340
I haven't looked a whole portion on the Sadrist up just specify the network portion.

198
00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:19.790
And now what I can do is I can specify EU y 64 and hit enter.

199
00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.850
So we are going to use the Mac address as part of that address.

200
00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:30.430
So now I can type the command show run interface if seriously Ashira to show you the configuration.

201
00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:35.150
And as you can see there's no provision for address configured on this interface.

202
00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:41.180
There are only IP version 6 addresses and they are three IP version 6 addresses that we have manually

203
00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:56.010
configured I couldn't type show interface 0 0 the MAC address of this interface is C 4 0 1 0 F E 8 followed

204
00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:57.840
by four zeros.

205
00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:05.550
So the vendor portion of this address is see 4 0 1 0 F and the unique portion is 8 followed by four

206
00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:06.670
zeros.

207
00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:14.440
So just to display that nicely I'm going to say show interface if 0 0 pipe include a set.

208
00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:20.510
Only shows that MAC address in the output in there it is.

209
00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:29.580
And then I'm going to talk show IPV 6 interface 0 0 and only include the addresses that we configured

210
00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:35.090
and the other three IP addresses we configured on the interface.

211
00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.470
So notice here please.

212
00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:43.050
We'll start from the right inside the unique portion of the MAC address is eight followed by four zeros.

213
00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.150
There it is in the IP address.

214
00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.730
Remember leading zeros can be dropped.

215
00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.380
So this zero represents those four zeros.

216
00:20:52.560 --> 00:21:02.990
He ate is the eat of they f f f e has been inserted in the address to make it 64 bits and then notice

217
00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:06.330
the remaining portion is C 4 0 1 0.

218
00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:17.540
If which is represented here as see 6 0 1 if once again leading zeros can be removed.

219
00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:19.910
Notice the zero in front of this f has been removed

220
00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:35.060
see 4 0 1 has been converted to see 6 0 1 because the 7th but has been changed to a one to represent

221
00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:47.980
at this mac addresses globally unique so notice a IP address is derived from the MAC address by using

222
00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:54.250
the UI representation of the MAC address.

223
00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:56.440
Let's talk the command show.

224
00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:00.300
IP The CICS interface.

225
00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.300
It's 0 7 0.

226
00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:11.200
And as you'll see here notice there are three globally unique Unicode addresses configured on the interface

227
00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:14.200
notice on this interface.

228
00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:22.800
IPV 6 is enabled and these are linked local address starting with Haiti and the EU portion of the address

229
00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:34.470
if they zero to call on call and 1 represents all nodes and Rod is on the link if it 0 2 colon colon

230
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:38.580
to represent all rodders on the link.

231
00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:45.160
This is the solicited node multicast address used for mechanisms that replace up in other words.

232
00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:49.280
This is the address used by duplicate address detection or dead.

233
00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:59.530
Is a solicited node multicast address for each unique link ID so solicited node multi-course addresses

234
00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:09.510
consist of f f 0 t colon colon one colon F F and then the unique portion of the interface ID.

235
00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:18.450
So as an example you can see this is 001 which is the same for this address and this address that here.

236
00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:28.280
Notice we have if if 0 2 column called on one colon if if e 8 0 because of this entry here which is

237
00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.850
different to the previous addresses.
