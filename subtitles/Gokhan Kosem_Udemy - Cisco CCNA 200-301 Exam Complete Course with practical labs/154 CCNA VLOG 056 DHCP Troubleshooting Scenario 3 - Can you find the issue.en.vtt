00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:17.430
This is one of multiple videos discussing Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol or DGP and specifically

2
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.890
how to troubleshoot DHC.

3
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.780
In this typology we've got a client connected to a router connected to a DHP server and we've been told

4
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.460
that the client is not receiving IP addresses from the DHP server.

5
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:43.590
In this example rather than using physical PCs I've got us V-Rod is acting as DHP server and DHP client

6
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:53.800
so he has the client show IP interface brief noticed the client hasn't got an address assigned to Gigabit

7
00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:06.040
00 DHB is being used but no address has been assigned so let's shut the interface down and then no shut

8
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.000
it to test.

9
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.070
What's happening.

10
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:20.640
Interfaces come up show IP interface brief interfaces up no address has been assigned through DHP.

11
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:32.140
So on the DHP server we're trying to debug a debug IP DHP server and I'm going to go for packets to

12
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.680
see detailed information.

13
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:45.050
We are already seeing something here says Cline's VPN is something no option 1 25 DHP discover received

14
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.270
from a client through a relay of 10 1 1 2 5 4.

15
00:01:51.650 --> 00:02:00.380
So ADHD the message is being relayed by the router we can see in this example that router 2 has the

16
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.620
IP address on the interface facing the client that's the address that we see on the DHP server.

17
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.270
But we told her that option 1.5 is not present in the message.

18
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.320
There's a problem with option 1 25.

19
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.890
You can find information about option 125 in this RAFC vendor identifying vendor options for DHV the

20
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.780
problem here he said.

21
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.320
Option 1 25 is a vendor dependent.

22
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:36.340
So we've seen a lot of messages stating that option 1 25 is not present in the message.

23
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.670
So let's have a look at the relay agent show run interface gigabit 00.

24
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:50.770
Now we do see the IP help address on the relay agent which is routed to but we still seeing problems

25
00:02:50.980 --> 00:03:01.220
on the DHP server we're getting information at the DHP server based on this configuration so we can

26
00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.750
ping the DHP server.

27
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:09.990
DHP messages are being forwarded to the server but there's a problem on the DHP server.

28
00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.560
So let's have a look at the DHV piece of a configuration.

29
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.460
We have a pool configured.

30
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.680
This looks right.

31
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:26.390
Network default gateway or default router that needs to be in the same subnet as the interface where

32
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.300
the client is configured.

33
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.880
So that looks right.

34
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.230
DNS server is 10 to one or two to one.

35
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.030
That is the IP address of the DHP server.

36
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.050
So that looks right there.

37
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.470
No excluded addresses in the pool.

38
00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:50.400
So we've got a very basic pool and an IP address configured on the gigabit interface everything else

39
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.940
looks standard.

40
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.770
But I'm going to go through the shop run slowly to see if you can find the problem.

41
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.540
What is the issue in this configuration.

42
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.770
Post the video if you need to but there's a problem in this config.

43
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.830
Show IP DHV.

44
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.370
P Paul

45
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:27.700
we have a pool next address to be allocated to 10 1 1 3 shoyu IP DHP binding is an address allocated

46
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:33.530
to a client somewhere but no address has been allocated to this client.

47
00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.690
Now this is something you need to remember for DHP.

48
00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:43.260
Notice what happens when not top show IP route we are told that there's no gateway of last resort.

49
00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.800
There's no writing on the DHP server.

50
00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:53.990
The DHP server has to have a route back to the subnet of the relay agent brought it to is receiving

51
00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.540
a DHP broadcast on gigabit 0 0.

52
00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.270
But the DHB server doesn't know how to get back there.

53
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:12.440
So notice here it can't get to that subnet because it doesn't have a route in the writing table.

54
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:22.130
So IP route and I'll simply create a default route and point it to the IP address on Route 2 which is

55
00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:32.030
gigabit to 0 1 so on the client show the interface brief and no IP address is allocated yet.

56
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:43.310
I'll force this by shutting the interface down and then shutting it show IP interface brief.

57
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.560
Let's see if we get an IP address in now and there we go.

58
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.620
We've just been allocated an IP address by the DHP server.

59
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.870
This address has been allocated to the client.

60
00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:02.850
Now the reason that the binding was shown previously is that the address was allocated previously to

61
00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.710
the client and then it broke the network.

62
00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.160
So the same address has been allocated back to the client.

63
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:15.470
Now since we fixed the network so this is the thing about DHP service on Cisco.

64
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.580
Make sure that they have a route back to the client.

65
00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:24.900
In other words they need to know how to get to the relay agent's IP address.

66
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:30.210
Otherwise they will not allocate addresses to clients.

67
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:34.280
So no we have a default route.

68
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:39.240
And if we look at the binding we should be able to paying the client.

69
00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.730
And there you go making paying 10 1 1 2.

70
00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.390
So that was an example of how to troubleshoot to DHP.

71
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:53.070
Don't forget that your DHB servers need Roths back to the relay agents in your typologies.

72
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:59.860
You found this video useful if it's been of benefit to you please like at least describe to my YouTube

73
00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:00.600
channel.

74
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.350
I wish you all the very best.
