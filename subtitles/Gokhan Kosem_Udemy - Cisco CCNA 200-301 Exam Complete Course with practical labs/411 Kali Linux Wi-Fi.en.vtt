00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.520
In this video I'm gonna show you how to get wireless network adapters working within Kelly Linux.

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.150
In this example I'll show you how to get a wireless network adapter running with Kelly within both virtual

3
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.240
box as well as a VMware Workstation Pro.

4
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:21.840
In this example I'm using an alpha network adapter but other network adapters are also supported.

5
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.460
Now there's a reason why you don't want to use the wireless bolting network adapters and a lot of laptops.

6
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.890
They don't support monitor mode.

7
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:36.000
They don't support injection only certain wireless network adapter support the injection of packets

8
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.490
onto a wireless network as well as the monitoring of wireless networks.

9
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:47.880
So you have to use specific chipsets in this example we're going to be using a wireless RTL 88 1 to

10
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:55.480
a new wireless chipset that supports 82 or eleven AC so much quicker wireless standard.

11
00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.870
And it also supports injection of packets on to the wireless network.

12
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.120
I've put a list below this video of wireless network adapters that you can purchase you could use wireless

13
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.740
network adapters from Alpha or panda or teepee link as an example.

14
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.440
There are as always advantages and disadvantages to some of these network adapters.

15
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.150
I found that this wireless network adapter from Alpha works well for my needs.

16
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.160
Now I'm going to be covering quite a lot of topics in this video offensive security I've just released

17
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:33.220
at the time of this recording version 2019 got four of Kelly Linux so I want to show you how to get

18
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.270
this version working get it working within virtual box and get it working with a wireless network adapter

19
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.960
the same process for getting the wireless network adapter a place to VM workstation pro so at the end

20
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.290
of the video I'll show you that I've got this working in both virtual box as well as VM workstation

21
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.880
Pro.

22
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.970
Now without further ado let me show you how to get wireless working with Kelly Linux running with in

23
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:07.740
virtual box or VMware Workstation on a Windows 10 laptop.

24
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:19.170
Okay.

25
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.790
So the first thing is we need to download the latest release of Kelly Linux.

26
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.890
I'm gonna go to Kelly dot org I'm going to go to downloads download Kelly Linux.

27
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:38.250
I'm going to scroll down and in this example I'm going to be running Kelly as a virtual machine in a

28
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.660
virtual box.

29
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.060
So I'm gonna be using the 64 bit version of Kelly.

30
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.230
You could use VMware if you prefer.

31
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.830
I've been able to get this working in both VM workstation pro as well as a virtual box so you could

32
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:53.550
use either.

33
00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:01.410
So again the Kelly Linux 64 bit virtual box overlay is available on the offensive security VM download

34
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.310
page.

35
00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:11.320
So going to that page I'm going to select a virtual box and download the 64 bit version the overlays

36
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.530
now downloading.

37
00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.460
The reason why I want to get the 64 bit

38
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.360
is my computer is running Windows 10 64 bit operating system.

39
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.130
It's an Intel I 7 processor with 8 gig of ram.

40
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:34.350
I've enabled nested virtualization in the bios of this computer so I can use the 64 bit version of Kelly

41
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:41.300
if you don't have nested virtualization support on your laptop you'll need to use the 32 bit version.

42
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.760
Use this link if you want to see how do you enable nested virtualization in the bios of your computer.

43
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.180
Now once you've downloaded the overlay you can import it into virtual box.

44
00:03:52.200 --> 00:04:01.170
So in this example we can see that Kelly Linux 2019 not for virtual box HD 64 but V.A. has been downloaded

45
00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.840
so what I can do now is start a virtual box.

46
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.610
So when I click on Oracle VM a virtual box.

47
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:17.690
Now I've previously imported an older release of Kelly Linux as well as a boon to 18 zebra 4 in this

48
00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.130
example I'm gonna go to file import appliance.

49
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.150
I'm going to click choose a virtual appliance file to import.

50
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:34.820
I'm going to browse to my downloads directory select the overlay that I downloaded click open and click

51
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.810
Next a summary of the appliance settings is displayed.

52
00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.710
I'm going to leave most of the settings at default.

53
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:49.840
So in this example I'm simply going to click import to import the appliance into virtual box so all

54
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.660
you need to do now is wait for the appliance to import.

55
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.030
Okay.

56
00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:01.560
So as we can see the appliance has been imported before you start up a virtual machine in virtual box

57
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.740
of verify the settings.

58
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.610
Something to click on settings.

59
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.700
And notice we told that they are invalid settings detected.

60
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.990
We told that USP 2.0 3.0 is currently enabled for this virtual machine.

61
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.920
However this requires the Oracle virtual box extension pack to be installed.

62
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:27.570
Please install the extension pack from the virtual box download site or disable USP 2.0 3.0 before you

63
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.330
start the machine.

64
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:37.770
So if I go to US b I can either set the US b to version 1.0 one which means I don't need the extension

65
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:46.470
pack or I could use a USB 2.0 which is what the overlay has been configured to use but that requires

66
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.380
the extension pack on the virtual box website.

67
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:57.430
We told that the virtual box extension pack personal use and evaluation license governs your access

68
00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.330
to and use of the virtual box extension pack.

69
00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:07.900
It doesn't apply to the virtual box based package or its source code which is licensed under the new

70
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:15.850
General Public License a virtual box is open source software but the virtual box extension pack isn't.

71
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.670
This is closed source software or proprietary software.

72
00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:26.410
So basically you can use it for personal use or as evaluation software but you can't use it permanently

73
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:27.850
for commercial use.

74
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:33.250
But make sure that you read the license carefully and if you want to use the software go to a virtual

75
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:34.970
box dot org.

76
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:43.160
Click on downloads and then download and install the extension pack.

77
00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:50.730
Click on the all supported platforms link we told once again that this license is different to the open

78
00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:53.990
source license that applies to virtual box.

79
00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:57.210
Okay so my virtual box extension pack has downloaded.

80
00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:04.290
I'll double click on the file and then I'll click install to install the extension pack within virtual

81
00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.670
box.

82
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:14.380
We asked to read the license once again you need to accept that the extension Park has now been successfully

83
00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:15.790
installed.

84
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:24.070
So now when I click on settings notice we no longer receive an error when using USB 2.0.

85
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:30.970
I no longer have to use USP one not one I can use 2.0 which is better and that's the setting that the

86
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.980
overlay used.

87
00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:39.670
So now I can click start to startup Kelly Linux and as you can see it's now booting up

88
00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.080
the interface looks very different to previous releases.

89
00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:54.510
I'm going to log in as root and default positive t o r so root spelt backwards which is the default

90
00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.250
for this virtual machine.

91
00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.960
Again very different interface to the previous release.

92
00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.370
I'm going to click on terminal to open up a terminal.

93
00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:08.360
So here's my terminal the font is very small.

94
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:13.780
I mean a go to file preferences and what I'll do is change that font.

95
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:23.980
So make it 18 so that it's easier to read type.

96
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:25.400
I have config.

97
00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:30.850
Notice we don't see anything but an Ethernet interface and a loop back.

98
00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:37.800
Currently on this virtual machine so I now one installed adapters.

99
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:42.740
Now if I plug in my wireless adapter Windows has recognized it.

100
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:54.050
So if I go to control panel network an Internet network and sharing center change Adapter Settings I

101
00:08:54.050 --> 00:09:00.680
now have this external network adapter but it's being managed by windows.

102
00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:04.280
Notice USP network interface called.

103
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.040
So what I'll do here is shut down Kelly

104
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:18.000
and go to Settings go to USP and click plus.

105
00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:26.000
And what I want to do now is get a virtual box to control this external network adapter so it's now

106
00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:33.710
going to be used by the virtual machine rather than by windows and what I'll do now is start up virtual

107
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:40.150
box once again in windows we can see that the network adapter is no longer used by windows.

108
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:51.950
It's now being used by the virtual machine so log in is root I'll open up a terminal I config.

109
00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:59.340
Notice we still only have an ethernet zero adapter and a loop back adapter even though this virtual

110
00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:05.410
machine is controlling this wireless network adapter.

111
00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:12.140
So what I'm going to do is essentially follow the instructions on the two thousand and seventeen dot

112
00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:22.150
one release and use app to get update and apt install I'll use apt update to update references

113
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:37.070
and then at install and once again it's a real tech RTL adapter so real tech and all type arty tab to

114
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.530
order complete and press enter

115
00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:45.080
software is now being downloaded and installed.

116
00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:50.630
Now one thing I've noticed with this release running within virtual box is I get a lot of flicker on

117
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:51.410
the screen.

118
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:56.600
Not sure if you can see that but there's quite a bit of flicker when moving around from one window to

119
00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:02.600
another but hopefully it's not affecting the video but you may encounter that when using this release

120
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.870
within a virtual machine on Windows 10.

121
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:05.800
Okay.

122
00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:12.530
The installation has completed but notice I'm getting an error failed to attach a USP device real tech

123
00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:16.590
ATO 2.0 11 and NEC to the virtual machine.

124
00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:22.860
So what I'm going to do is unplug the USB connection and what I'll do now is plug it back in again.

125
00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:26.120
And a type if config.

126
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:31.210
Notice I still don't have the wireless adapter showing within Kelly.

127
00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:37.540
I'll unplug it again plug it back in so I'm having some errors at the moment.

128
00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:45.060
So what I'll do is shut down Kelly and shut down virtual box and then I'll start it up again

129
00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.840
and then boot up Kelly Linux again.

130
00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:06.790
You may sometimes have these issues some of the logging as root gain open up a terminal window type

131
00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:15.430
I have config and as you can see I still don't have my virtual card Sol unplug it and plug it back in

132
00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:16.950
top.

133
00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:24.970
I have config now so at the moment I'm having issues with USP version 2 even though I remove the USP

134
00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:31.040
and plug it in virtual box is having an issue connecting that to the virtual machine.

135
00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:39.790
So what I'm going to do is go back to USP version wanted one so I'll shut down the virtual machine go

136
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:48.030
to settings so what I'm going to do is go back to USP wandered 1 and click okay and then start up the

137
00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:48.860
virtual machine

138
00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:01.190
it's better to use USP 2.0 but I'm going to revert back to wondered one in this example because I'm

139
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:03.350
having issues with version 2.0

140
00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:16.400
I'm going to log in with my username and password I'll remove the USP adapter plug it back in open up

141
00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:26.750
a terminal type I have config no error at the moment but I'm not seeing the network adapter so what

142
00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:33.860
I'm going to do now is revert back to a backup plan to get this working and to do that I'm going to

143
00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:38.570
download additional software from GitHub So I'm to open up a web browser

144
00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.290
and I'm gonna browse to get.

145
00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:46.690
Dot com.

146
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:49.330
Go to a crack in G

147
00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:58.860
and get to the driver for the chipset.

148
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.510
So I want to get this driver RTL 88 1 2 a U.

149
00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:11.020
That's the driver that we downloaded originally using Kelly but I'm having issues with that driver so

150
00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:18.700
I'm gonna click on clone or download and I'm going to download the zip file some downloading different

151
00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:26.050
drivers from get hub on to my virtual machine and I'm gonna save those drivers to the local computer.

152
00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:28.330
The software is downloaded.

153
00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:33.420
I'm gonna go to file manager go to downloads.

154
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:41.090
I'm going to right click on that zip file and I'm going to click extract here the file contents has

155
00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:42.830
now been extracted.

156
00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:48.470
So in my terminal window I'm currently in my home directory.

157
00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:53.480
Alice shows me that I have a downloads directory so I'll move to that.

158
00:14:53.480 --> 00:15:00.770
So C.D. downloads Alice shows me the directory so I'll move to that directory and I'm now going to run

159
00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:02.930
the script to install the software.

160
00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:12.350
So Dottore period forward slash decay and mess install dot SDH You now simply need to wait for this

161
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:13.850
new driver to be installed.

162
00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:18.110
It may take it a while so go and grab a coffee or something while you wait.

163
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:21.920
But as you can see there the boulders completed.

164
00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.980
The driver has been installed.

165
00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:30.530
I have config shows me that I still don't have a wireless network adapter but what I'm going to do here

166
00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:39.470
is restart networking so restart networking so sys CTO will restart networking and I'm going to restart

167
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:45.920
network manager I have config noticed we still don't have that network adapter so what I'm going to

168
00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.930
do is plug it back in again.

169
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:59.270
I have config not working I'll shut down Kelly again and restart it while wireless adapter is now associated

170
00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:06.120
with Windows but what I'll do is restart the Kelly Linux virtual machine.

171
00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:16.640
I log in once again as root.

172
00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.210
Open up a terminal.

173
00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:21.390
I have config it's taking it a while now.

174
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:22.450
That's a good sign.

175
00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:27.710
So hopefully it's picked up my wireless network adapter and there you go.

176
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:37.580
Notice w when 0 is available within Kelly Linux running within a virtual box on my Windows 10 computer

177
00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:39.280
OK.

178
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.250
So again I have config.

179
00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:42.840
That's what we want to see.

180
00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:52.220
But now we want to try and do something with this network adapter so I'm going to use a man and G check.

181
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:55.950
Kill this process has now been killed.

182
00:16:56.690 --> 00:17:04.640
And we're gonna use AI w config w when zero mode monitor to set the mode to monitor.

183
00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:10.940
I'll bring the interface up again so I have config w land 0 up.

184
00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:21.520
I have conflict shows me my wireless LAN interface once again and lets use aero dump and G W. land zero

185
00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:25.270
and notice we can now see wireless networks.

186
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:29.960
So as an example ABC one is my wireless network.

187
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:37.030
He has my windows computer connected to that wireless network using its built in wireless network adapter.

188
00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:40.940
The USP wireless network adapter is no longer connected to Windows.

189
00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:47.200
It's connected to my Linux virtual machine running within virtual box.

190
00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:51.710
We can see as an example the B SS I.D. we can see the cipher used.

191
00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:58.510
We can see that the authentication is preset key and we can see the actual SS I.D. name so I'll stop

192
00:17:58.510 --> 00:17:59.090
that.

193
00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:02.420
Let's run a replay in G.

194
00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:06.100
Press enter you to spell that correctly.

195
00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:13.780
Notice one of the options we have here is test injection so we can use minus nine if we prefer.

196
00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:21.050
Or we can use test like this to test whether we can use wireless injection with that network card.

197
00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:29.370
Notice injection is working to APIs have been found I've now shown you that I can successfully use this

198
00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:36.870
external USP wireless network adapter within Kelly Linux running within virtual box on a Windows 10

199
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:37.770
laptop.

200
00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:46.050
Once again I have config shows me that my wireless network adapter is available within Kelly Linux.

201
00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.530
Now this is only the beginning.

202
00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:53.730
I've shown you how to successfully connect an external wireless network adapter to Kelly Linux running

203
00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:55.350
within virtual box.

204
00:18:55.350 --> 00:19:00.360
I had multiple issues getting it working and I've shown you some work arounds including the fact that

205
00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:05.940
in this example I had to revert back to using USP wandered 1.

206
00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:09.600
You may have better luck using a USB 2.0.

207
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:17.610
So that being said actually let's shut down this virtual machine and let's change it to use USP too

208
00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:21.450
and see if that works better this time round.

209
00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:23.820
Now that I've installed drivers from GetUp

210
00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:30.590
came virtual machines boot it up I'll log in.

211
00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:37.690
Open up a terminal I have config that looks a lot better.

212
00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:41.010
Notice I've got wireless LAN 0.

213
00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:52.540
So look at my history I could as an example run command 38 aero dump and notice I'm able to discover

214
00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.820
wireless networks once again.

215
00:19:54.820 --> 00:20:05.670
In this example when using USP to dot 0 I'll cancel that and let's test whether injection works on this

216
00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:06.930
wireless network adapter

217
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:17.800
notice injection is working on this wireless network adapter so try and use USB 2.0 if you have issues

218
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:22.560
then revert back to USP one that one now shut down.

219
00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:29.260
This Kelly linux host I want to show you that you can do something very similar with VMware Workstation

220
00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:33.370
pro Sol startup VMware Workstation Pro.

221
00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:37.830
Here's my 2019 dot for Kelly linux host.

222
00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:42.860
I'll power the host on so under VM removable devices.

223
00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:50.650
This device has now been connected to this virtual machine so it's no longer connected to virtual box

224
00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:57.950
because that VM is being turned off in my VM way a virtual machine I log in.

225
00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:59.820
Here's my terminal.

226
00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:07.710
I have config shows me that I have that wireless network adapter available within VMware Workstation

227
00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:12.000
pro so I can find out my networks

228
00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:21.150
and as you can see there I'm able to discover the same networks using them where workstation pro that

229
00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:30.710
I was able to discover using virtual box VM where by default supports a USP too.

230
00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:37.880
So the virtual machine is using USB 2 and VMware Workstation pro supports that by default.

231
00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:41.060
My personal preference is to use VMware Workstation Pro.

232
00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:46.960
However that's paid software so you may prefer using virtual box which is free now while we here.

233
00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:54.000
Let me show you one of the cool options available in this release of Kelly Linux which is under cover

234
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:54.820
mode.

235
00:21:54.960 --> 00:22:01.080
If you used two previous releases of Kelly you'll notice the interface is very different but I can by

236
00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:06.410
simply selecting that option make my computer look like a Windows 10 host.

237
00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:13.560
So here's my real Windows 10 and here's my so-called Windows 10 running within a virtual machine but

238
00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.350
it's actually Kelly Linux.

239
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:22.760
So if I click on the web browser which looks like Internet Explorer it's actually going to run Firefox.

240
00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:27.200
This is not Internet Explorer it's the Firefox bolt into Kelly.

241
00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:31.620
So if I go to help as an example you can see that this is Firefox.

242
00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:41.010
All the tools are available here so we have for instance snuffing and spoofing why a shock and this

243
00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:42.970
looks very much like windows.

244
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:47.990
We have a Windows skin here including file explorer.

245
00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:55.110
So applications like wire shock look like wire shock on windows and my file manager looks like windows

246
00:22:55.490 --> 00:23:00.390
so going to downloads it looks like windows but it's actually Linux.

247
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:08.460
If you want to disable that open up a terminal terminal still looks like Linux and type Kelly undercover

248
00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.250
and what you'll notice is my menu has changed.

249
00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:20.030
I'm back to a Kelly shell rather than a Windows shell but I could simply type that command again and

250
00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:24.780
what you'll notice is the start menu will change to a windows start menu.

251
00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:25.840
So there you go.

252
00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:28.310
I've shown you a lot of options in this video.

253
00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:31.430
I'm David Bumble and I want to wish you all the very best.
