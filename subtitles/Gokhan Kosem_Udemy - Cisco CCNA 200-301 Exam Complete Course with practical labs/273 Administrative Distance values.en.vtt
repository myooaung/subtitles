00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Administrative distance is then used as a tie breaker

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
to determine which way to go when multiple routing protocols

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
tell the router to go different ways.

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
as an analogy, administrative distance is used as a tie breaker

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to determine which way to forward the traffic

6
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
if OSPF says go left and EIGRP says go right

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
the router uses administrative distance

8
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
to determine which routing protocol it believes most.

9
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Technically, what happens is that the routing protocol

10
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
with the lowest administrative distance is more believable

11
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and its routing information is inserted into the RIB

12
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
or Routing Information Based or routing table in preference

13
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
of other routing protocols that have a higher administrative distance

14
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
so EIGRP has a lower administrative distance than OSPF.

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
EIGRP has an administrative distance of 90

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
OSPF has an administrative distance of 110

17
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
so internal EIGRP would be preferred over OSPF.

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
So the lower the administrative distance

19
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
the more believable a routing protocol is

20
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
you cannot believe anyone more than yourself

21
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
so a router will believe routes that it originates

22
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
above routes received from neighboring devices.

23
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
A directly connected interface has a believability factor

24
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
or administrative distance of 0.

25
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
A static route configured to a next hop IP address

26
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
has an administrative distance of 1.

27
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
When a static route is configured to a directly connected interface

28
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
it is deemed to be directly connected

29
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and therefore has a believability factor or administrative distance of 0.

30
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
The reason why static routes have such a low administrative distance

31
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
is that the router believes that you know more than other routers do.

32
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
You as the administrator are supposed to know what you're doing

33
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and thus the router believes you more than it believes

34
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
routes received via routing protocols such as OSPF or EIGRP.

35
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
EIGRP has administrative distance of 90 for internal routes

36
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
those are routes that originated in EIGRP and will not be redistributed

37
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
or taken from a different routing protocol and then put into EIGRP.

38
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
OSPF has an administrative distance of 110

39
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
RIP has an administrative distance of 120

40
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and unknown routes have an administrative distance of 255

41
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.000
as you can see EIGRP has a lower administrative distance than RIP does

42
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and thatâ€™s because EIGRP is a better or more powerful routing protocol.

43
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
EIGRP will take bandwidth and delay into account when determining the best route.

44
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
RIP only uses hop count

45
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
so EIGRP seems to be better than OSPF which is better than RIP.
