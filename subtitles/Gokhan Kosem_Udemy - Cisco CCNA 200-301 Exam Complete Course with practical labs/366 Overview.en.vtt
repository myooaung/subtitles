00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.300
Knowing how to troubleshoot networks is a really important skill for any network engineer.

2
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:13.340
And knowing how to properly use logging on Cisco routers and switches is a cool requirement to help

3
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.680
you troubleshoot.

4
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:21.470
It's vital that you know how to use logging directly on a Cisco device as well as using a slug server

5
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.100
when you need to troubleshoot networks.

6
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.990
Now Cisco offers many options with regards to logging.

7
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.360
You can log directly to the consul of Urara.

8
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:40.090
You can log to a buffer you can look to assist log server as well as additional logging options in these

9
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:46.180
videos I'm going to show you how to log to the console and use various options with regard to logging

10
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:53.740
including logging levels look at logging to the buffer as well as logging to ISIS logs server.

11
00:00:53.740 --> 00:01:01.350
So let's get started in this example of a simple network of two rods Rato one in rodded two connected

12
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.290
via They first.

13
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:09.560
Ethan etting to face on Route 1 if I go to the first Ethan interface and no shut it.

14
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:16.120
Notice the output that's displayed on the console link and then a number.

15
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:26.240
In this case three up down interface first Ethan it is 0 0 has changed state to up and then we get another

16
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:34.930
message or line protocol number five in this case up down line protocol and interface has changed to

17
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.440
up.

18
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.510
There's also a date and time stamp on the message.

19
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.130
So these are logging messages displayed on the console of the router.

20
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.230
And this number indicates service log level.

21
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:57.390
You can read more about the log protocol in RAFC 5:44.

22
00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.400
And I won't bore you going through the entire RAFC But if you want to know the details of logging messages

23
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.930
and the slow protocol this is a good place to start.

24
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.310
I'll just point out a few things.

25
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.370
Certain types of functions are performed.

26
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.360
We have the originator which generates Suslov content to be carried in a message.

27
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.810
So for example a router is generating this log message and then we might have a collector that gathers

28
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.270
this log content for further analysis in a later video.

29
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.940
I'm going to show you how to configure a solar Wiens says log server.

30
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.960
As a collector capturing multiple syslog messages to a central server.

31
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.480
But for now let's start with some of the basic principles of this log.

32
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.000
And to do that we need to look at the priority of each.

33
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.400
So SLOC message.

34
00:02:51.610 --> 00:03:00.720
So in the RAFC we have numerical codes 0 to 7 with the severity description.

35
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:07.740
When you configure logging on a route as an example you can configure the severity either by the number

36
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:17.830
or by the name so on all Cecka right at the moment if I type show logging noticed when I typed and a

37
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:25.200
message was shown with a level of 5 and when I typed showed logging it shows me as an example that the

38
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.950
console logging is set to level debugging.

39
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.620
I can configure the logging level by typing logging

40
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:44.180
and there are multiple options but in this example I'll configure logging Konsole use question mark

41
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:52.930
and notice I can specify a logging severity level using a number or I could specify a word.

42
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.670
So either debugging or using the number 7.

43
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.900
So let's start with the highest number seven is debugging which allows you to view debugging messages

44
00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.650
Six's informational messages.

45
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:15.210
This would be something like an access list of violation five notices normal but significant conditions

46
00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.020
and example would be line protocol down.

47
00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.970
So interface if Cirrus fleshes 0.

48
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:28.610
If I shut to the interface notice five line protocol is down.

49
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.970
For these warning conditions.

50
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:41.750
So an example would be a configuration file is written to a server via an S&amp;P request Shreeves errors.

51
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.540
This is an error condition.

52
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:51.550
An example would be interface updown messages to these critical conditions that might be something like

53
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.810
memory allocation failures.

54
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.680
One is an alert action must be taken immediately.

55
00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:04.480
That might be something like temperature limit has been exceeded and emergencies the system is unstable.

56
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:11.950
So an example would be that the system is shutting down due to a missing fan tray on a switch is an

57
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.070
example.

58
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:22.330
So the numerical numbers are specified in this RAFC 5:44 and are specified in lots of places on the

59
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.190
Cisco Web site.

60
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.040
So here is an example.

61
00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:36.440
On the Cisco Web site talking about the error message keywords and corresponding Unix s'est log definitions.

62
00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:42.230
So once again notifications is five normal but significant conditions.

63
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:48.140
So let's have a look at another example showing you the differences in output on the console of a router

64
00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:56.640
depending on the debugging that you set an important note to make is that if you enable a higher level

65
00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:06.660
such as 7 all other levels are enabled if you enable a level such as five that means levels 0 1 2 3

66
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.960
4 and 5 are enabled.

67
00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:16.320
So whenever you specify a level that level and all lower levels are enabled on the router.
