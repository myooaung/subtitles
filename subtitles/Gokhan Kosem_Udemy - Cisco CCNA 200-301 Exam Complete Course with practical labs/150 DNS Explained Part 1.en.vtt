00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.780
What is DNS or domain name system.

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:09.390
In this video I'm going to explain it in a lot of detail but before we get there Alexa N.S. look up

3
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.620
Amazon.com.

4
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:18.190
The DNS lookout for Amazon dot com is 176 dot 32 dot 103 dot 205.

5
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.450
That is an example of what a DNS does.

6
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:28.350
It's essentially resolving a name typically a domain name to an IP address.

7
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:52.290
N S look up a Google dot com DNS look up for Google dot com is 172 dot 217 dot 164 dot 142.

8
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.920
We as humans don't communicate easily using IP addresses.

9
00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.670
We use domain names.

10
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.840
So if I told you to go to Google's IP address you probably don't even remember what the IP address was

11
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:13.390
but you'll remember what Google dot com is so DNS essentially resolves a human readable name such as

12
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.330
Google dot com or Amazon.com to a machine readable IP address.

13
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:25.480
Machines don't use names they use IP addresses in IP version 4 we use dotted decimal notation IP addresses

14
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:33.710
such as 1 9 2 1 6 8 wandered 1 IP 6 uses IP addresses such as 2001 colon colon 1 2 3.

15
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.040
There are many IP addresses out there and many Web sites.

16
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:44.620
It's much easier to remember a domain name once again like Facebook dot com or Amazon.com rather than

17
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.900
the IP address of a server.

18
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:53.380
And to further complicate it like in my example depending where you're on the world a domain name may

19
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.600
resolve to a different IP address for load balancing.

20
00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:04.060
So if I'm in the UK and I ping Google dot com I may get a different result to you if you in the US or

21
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.370
in Singapore or somewhere else in the world.

22
00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:13.090
It's much easier to remember the domain name than it is to remember an IP address but machines use IP

23
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.620
addresses and traffic is routed across the Internet using IP addresses not names.

24
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:25.390
DNS is a fundamental building block in networks today without a DNS internet wouldn't really work very

25
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.380
well because very few of us are going to remember IP addresses.

26
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:37.090
Now as an analogy DNS is like a telephone book taking a name converting it to a telephone number.

27
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.540
But in this case taking a domain name and converting it to an IP address in the bad old days I'd have

28
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.740
to look up someone's number in a book and then I'd have to manually dial their telephone number.

29
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.810
But I don't think any of us do that these days on a phone like an iPhone today we're not going to manually

30
00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.230
type a number like this and then dial it we're going to go to our contacts and search for a contact

31
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.920
and then just press on the contact to call the person.

32
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.370
I mean a lot of us probably don't even know our own telephone numbers these days.

33
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.080
We don't know the telephone numbers of other people because we simply look them up in a directory on

34
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.800
our phone.

35
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.610
Now this is a local directory.

36
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.460
We can do something very similar on a P.C. by using what's called a hosts file.

37
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.380
That is the most basic version of so-called DNS.

38
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.560
No it's not DNS but it's a local lookup so you could create your own version of DNS locally on your

39
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.750
P.C. by editing the hosts file.

40
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.470
Taking that a step further companies may have a local DNS server that resolves and names within the

41
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:48.790
organization but on the public Internet we have distributed DNS systems that allow us to resolve names

42
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.660
such as Google Facebook etc..

43
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.920
Now it's all very good and while talking about DNS but I want to show you practically how it works I'm

44
00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:03.660
going to show you why shock captures I'm going to show you how to setup a DNS server on a Cisco rider.

45
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.380
How to set it up on a country server.

46
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.310
I'll show you basically how you can manipulate a DNS to do anything that you want.

47
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.250
You need to be careful that you use trusted DNS servers.

48
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.050
Don't just trust any DNS server out there.

49
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:24.520
DNS can be intercepted and you can manipulate the DNS servers used by pieces to get them to go to the

50
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.170
incorrect domain.

51
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:31.810
Fortunately today a lot of browsers like Chrome have a whole list of certificates preloaded on them

52
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:38.860
so you'll get a warning if you end up going to an incorrect domain such as Microsoft dot com or Cisco

53
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.420
dot com.

54
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.650
Okay so in this topology I've got a Windows 10 computer it's connected to a Cisco switch which in turn

55
00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.920
is connected to a Cisco rather which connects us to the Internet.

56
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.430
This topology is running in Genesis 3.

57
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.850
I'm hosting this entire topology on my computer so forgive me if the fan goes a bit crazy.

58
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.820
It's all running locally on my Mac.

59
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.960
I also have an a bunch too P.C. which will configure as a DNS server.

60
00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.920
Okay firstly let's have a look at the Windows computer.

61
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.060
Here's my windows.

62
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.480
P.S. I'll open up a seam deep prompt.

63
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.120
Make this a bit bigger.

64
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:24.590
IP config shows me that this is the IP address of the P.C. IP version 4 default gateways 10 1 1 2 5

65
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:31.240
4 and I should at this point be able to paying my default gateway which I can default gateway.

66
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.540
Is this Cisco with IP address once again 10 1 1 2 5 4.

67
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:43.500
The switch is a lever to switch it's not really doing anything except giving connectivity in the network.

68
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:54.300
So back on the P.C. IP config slash all shows us that the CPC has to DNS servers configured 8 8 8 8

69
00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.710
8 and wandered wandered wandered 1.

70
00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:04.760
In other words Google and CloudFlare are the two DNS servers configured on the P.C. so I'll start a

71
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:11.080
wire shock capture between the P.C. and the switch so that we can see what's actually going on.

72
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:17.510
Windows sends a lot of traffic into the network so as you can see here a bunch of traffic is being sent

73
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.260
by that Windows computer out into the network.

74
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:29.950
But I'm going to filter for DNS and then back on the P.C. what I'll do is ping a domain such as David

75
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.460
Bumble dot com.

76
00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:39.170
And notice we get a reply from this IP address 2 1 7 160 0 sixty nine.

77
00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:47.140
Now the CBO spiking on my P.C. here the throughput through a Cisco switch and a Cisco broad are running

78
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:54.460
in June 3 may be a bit slow but the point is is that I am getting replies back to that domain and if

79
00:06:54.460 --> 00:07:02.170
we have a look at the Y shock capture what you'll notice is we can see that this IP address 10 1 1 1

80
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:10.510
cent a DNS request 2 8 8 8 8 8 for domain David Bumble dot com.

81
00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:18.460
So just to confirm on the P.C. once again IP config shows us that this is the IP address of the P.C.

82
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:28.420
the P.C. send a request to the DNS server notice the query is for David Bumble dot com.

83
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:37.790
It's a record a record is a domain name in IP version 4 could triple A is a domain name in IP version

84
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:38.560
6.

85
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:48.960
So the P.C. is asking the DNS server what the IP address is of the domain name now going back a step

86
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:57.010
at a layer 2 in the OS model or TTP IP model if you prefer we have Ethernet to.

87
00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:02.850
That's because this network is using ethernet so it's an ethernet connection from the windows P.C. to

88
00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:09.930
the Ethernet switch the source mac addresses the P.C. destination MAC address is the broader basically

89
00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:15.060
the traffic is being switched from the P.C. to the broader because that's how it gets onto the Internet.

90
00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:21.510
So at least to source MAC address will be the P.C. destination MAC address will be the broader but at

91
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:29.100
least three IP version 4 source IP addresses the P.C. destination IP address is Google.

92
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:34.000
Now you may notice that this is a RF C 1918 address.

93
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.790
In other words it's a private IP address it's non-refundable.

94
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:43.040
On the internet but the router is implementing network address translation or Nat.

95
00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:48.400
This is very typical of what your right at home will be doing.

96
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.100
So notice it's enacting this IP address.

97
00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:58.150
Now it is narrowing it to a another ROIC 1918 address but that's because this road is connected to a

98
00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:01.600
cloud which is actually bridging my P.C. physically.

99
00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:08.110
So this P.C. here onto my physical home network and I have an Internet router that runs this onto the

100
00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:08.860
Internet.

101
00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:11.530
So it's actually being nutted multiple times.

102
00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:19.030
But what's important to point out here is notice the protocol at least for each UDP or user data grand

103
00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:23.550
protocol source port number use this 5 2 7 4 9.

104
00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.980
That is what's called any femoral or random port number.

105
00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:32.160
Destination Port numbers 53 which is the well-known port number for DNS.

106
00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:38.830
When a server is configured to host multiple services it's got to serve a purpose.

107
00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:44.840
So it's a server that's acting as let's say a file server when you connect to that server it's going

108
00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:45.880
to give you a file.

109
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.260
But when you connect to it using DNS it's listening on Port 53.

110
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:57.310
If it's being configured as a DNS server so you send traffic to port 53 the server is listening on Port

111
00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:04.750
53 to running an application like which I'll show you in a moment DNS mosque which is a DNS server application

112
00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:10.300
and then it responds back to that to request on the port number that you chose.

113
00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:15.330
So if you connect to a DNS server like this piece is doing you will use a random port number or ephemeral

114
00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:20.830
port number going to a well-known port number and then it'll reply back from that well-known port number

115
00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:29.530
and we can see that here Google is replying from a source port number 53 going to the port number that

116
00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:33.420
the P.C. chose the Windows 10 piece he chose this port number.

117
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:41.790
The Google DNS server replies back to that port number so again it's UDP destination port number as

118
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:43.620
a source port number as this.

119
00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:47.370
Digging deeper into the DNS information we can see.

120
00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:48.440
Domain Name System.

121
00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:49.680
It's a query.

122
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.060
It's a standard query for a name.

123
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:57.690
We're trying to resolve a name the name that we resolving.

124
00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:05.300
Is David Bumble dot com and the DNS server replies back saying this is the answer.

125
00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:12.290
This domain name has this IP address 2 1 7 160 0 69.

126
00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:17.120
So back on our windows P.S. That is the IP address that we see.

127
00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:22.820
So I could copy that IP address go to a web browser.

128
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:29.160
If I type the domain name it's going to browse to that server.

129
00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.250
So I'm able to connect to the domain using the domain name.

130
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:40.780
And this depends on the server I should be able to connect to the IP address of the server.

131
00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:43.380
In this example I'm getting a form for error.

132
00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:48.060
Now some servers will not allow you to connect directly on the IP address.

133
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:55.180
That's typically because multiple domains are hosted on a single IP address Okay I'll stop the Y shock

134
00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:02.350
capture and what I want to show you once again is that DNS is essentially just a resolution of name

135
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:08.540
to IP address and you can do that directly on your Windows computer.

136
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:11.760
So in windows I'll open up notepad.

137
00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.520
I'll run this as an administrator

138
00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:28.060
before I open a file if I pinged brought a 1 notice we told that that domain name is not found the same

139
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:31.780
with right of one whom dot com the ping request times out.

140
00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:41.820
I can't ping that domain name but what I could do is open a file and what I'm going to do is go to see

141
00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:49.620
Windows system 32 driver's Etsy and I'm going to open the hosts file.

142
00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:53.490
This is a file on the local Windows computer.

143
00:12:53.670 --> 00:13:02.440
Just zoom in there to make it easier to read and I can edit this so I could say 10 1 1 2 5 4 is right

144
00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:09.790
1 and 10 1 1 1 2 5 4 was write a one whom dot com and save that file.

145
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:14.860
So I'm editing a local file that maps whose names to IP addresses.

146
00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:23.500
So now when I ping wrote a one notice that works when I ping write a one dot home dot com that also

147
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:24.350
works.

148
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:33.190
But if I ping wrote it to that fails because it's not in the hosts file and Google is not replying back

149
00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:34.850
with that information.

150
00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:47.550
So if I said or two like this and save that file now ping or two that resolves name got resolved to

151
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:48.330
an IP address.

152
00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:55.380
Now in this example the networks a bit unstable sort of pings a timing out they had succeeded.

153
00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:59.500
But the important part is the domain name got resolved.

154
00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:03.150
That name got resolved to an IP address.

155
00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:09.780
If I remove these entries from the hosts file and save it

156
00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:15.870
I'll clear the screen there.

157
00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:28.250
When I ping are one now that's going to timeout because I don't have an entry for that domain name.

158
00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.630
That's essentially what a DNS server does.

159
00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:36.360
It takes a domain name and maps it to an IP address.
