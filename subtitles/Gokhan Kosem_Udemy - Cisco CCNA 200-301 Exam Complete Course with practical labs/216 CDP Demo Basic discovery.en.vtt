00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In a previous video, I configured this switches and routers in this topology

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
with IP addresses as well as enabling the various ports.

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Let’s have a look at CDP or Cisco Discovery Protocol

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and LLDP or Link Layer Discovery Protocol

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and see if we can discover the links between the devices.

6
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So I'll start with switch 1, here's switch 1 type enable sh cdp neighbor

7
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
In the output, we can see switch 2, switch 3 and switch 4

8
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
switch 2 is connected on 2 ports gigabit 0/0

9
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
this local interface as well as gigabit 0/1, this local interface.

10
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
switch 2 is using gigabit 0/0 to connect to our local interface gigabit 0/0

11
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and that’s true in our GNS3 topology

12
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
gigabit 0/0 on switch 2 is connected to gigabit 0/0 on switch 1

13
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and the same is true  for gigabit 0/1.

14
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Switch 3, this device over here is connected to switch 1 on gigabit0/2

15
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.000
so this local interface gigabit0/2 is the interface that switch 3 is connected to

16
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and switch 3 is using gigabit 0/0, as you can see over here.

17
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
By the same token switch 4

18
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
this switch over here in the GNS3 topology is connected to switch 1

19
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
on gigabit 0/3 and it's using gigabit 0/1.

20
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So Cisco Discovery Protocol or CDP runs by default on Cisco switches

21
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and routers and is a nice way to see

22
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
how devices are connected in the topology.

23
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Notice, however, that you only see directly connected devices.

24
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
So switch 1 over here doesn’t see router 1

25
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and doesn’t see router 3 it only sees the directly connected switches

26
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
that are running CDP.

27
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Let’s have a look at switch 2.

28
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So switch 2 sh cdp neighbor

29
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
the commands shows us the neighboring devices

30
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
we can see switch 3, router 3, switch 1, switch 1 and switch 4

31
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
so notice that on switch 2

32
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
this switch, we can see router 3 being connected to gigabit 0/1

33
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
using FastEthernet 0/0

34
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
we can also see that it’s a 3725 router

35
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and we can see capabilities of that device

36
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
in other words, its router, it can act as a switch

37
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and it supports IGMP which is used in multicast environments.

38
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
So switch 2 can see router 3

39
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
but switch 1 cannot because Cisco Discovery Protocol

40
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
only shows you directly connected neighbors

41
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
not devices connected behind a device running CDP.

42
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
In other words, switch 1 can see switch 2

43
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
but cannot see router 3

44
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
where switch 2 is able to see router 3

45
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
but by the same token switch 2 is not able to see router 2.

46
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
To see router 2 we need to connect to switch 4.

47
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
So here’s switch 4 sh cdp neighbor

48
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Notice switch 4 is able to see switch 2 up there

49
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
it’s able to see switch 1 over there.

50
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And it’s able to see router 2.

51
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
It can also see that router 2 using FastEthernet 0/0

52
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
switch 1 is using gigabit 0/2 to connect to switch 4

53
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
and switch 1 is using gigabit 0/3 to connect to switch 4.

54
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Lastly, let’s have a look at switch 3

55
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
switch 3 is over here in our topology.

56
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
sh cdp neighbor

57
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
it can see router 1, it can see switch 1, as well as switch 2.

58
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
So CDP is a very useful protocol once again

59
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
to discover devices

60
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
that are connected to your local router or switch.

61
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
What about the routers?

62
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
So on router 1 sh cdp neighbor

63
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Router 1 can only see switch 3

64
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
as being directly connected to FastEthernet 0/0

65
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:40.000
so its local interface and switch 3 is using gigabit 0/2 to connect to router 1.

66
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
If you were connected to the console of 1 switch

67
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and you need it to discover your topology

68
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
what you could do as an example is type sh cdp neighbors

69
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
So like on switch 1 I can see my neighbors

70
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
but then I can also do this option

71
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
sh cdp neighbors detail

72
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000
so sh cdp neighbors detail

73
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
shows that switch 3 is directly connected to switch 1

74
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
but now I can also see the IP address of that switch

75
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
so I could telnet from my local switch to that switch

76
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000
and then use CDP to see the neighbors connected to that device.

77
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Notice I can clean a lot of information about the neighboring device through CDP.

78
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
So I can see that it’s a Cisco device

79
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
that supports routing  and switching in IGMP

80
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.000
I can see my local interface and the outgoing port of the neighboring device.

81
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
I can see the version of operating system running on that device

82
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
so version 152 as an example.

83
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
I can see which version of CDP it's running, so it’s running version 2

84
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
I can see its management IP address once again.

85
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
See the native VLAN, see the duplex

86
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
so a lot of information can be shown through CDP

87
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
about neighboring devices and that’s why for security reasons

88
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000
company turn off CDP typically on Internet facing interfaces

89
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
or interfaces facing the outside world.

90
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
So on router 3 as an example

91
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
sh cdp neighbors

92
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
shows me that there is a core 3750 switch

93
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:32.000
connected out of F0/1, that is a physical Cisco switch

94
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
running in my local home network.

95
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.000
So you might not want your networking devices to advertise themselves

96
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
through Internet connected interfaces

97
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
because now I can discover what IP address that device using.

98
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Now I can see what type of device it is.

99
00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:02.000
So it's 3750 but what I could do now is telnet to that device and try to access it.

100
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
So I could log in now

101
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000
and notice now I’m connected to this physical Cisco switch.

102
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
So from a security point of view

103
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
you probably wanna hide your devices

104
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
and therefore you wanna disable CDP

105
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
on internet facing interfaces or interfaces that connects you to the outside world.
