00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.600
This packet tracer lab is a continuation of a previous Packet Tracer lab in the previous lab you were

2
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:22.900
asked to subnet 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 0 slash 24 and break it up into subnets for site 1 and site 2.

3
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.880
And you were asked to configure subnets on those sites as well as on the serial links in this lab you

4
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:38.370
need to subnet the network again to extend and conserve IP addresses an additional site has been added

5
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.730
to the lab site.

6
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:51.390
3 What you need to do is take the subnet 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 64 slash 26 and subnet that to support this third

7
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.810
site as well as to reuse the subnet for the three serial connections.

8
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.970
Serial links only need a slash 30 mosque so you need to subnet the lost a new subnet that you get from

9
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:17.050
1 9 2 1 6 8 1 64 slash 26 and you slash 30 mosques so that you can allocate that subnet to the 3 serial

10
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.700
links.

11
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:26.920
So what you need to do once again is break up 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 64 slash 26 to support as many subnets as

12
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:35.380
possible with 8 hosts per subnet to allocate the first new subnet to site 3.

13
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:45.100
Some of the words on the local area network over here and then take the lost new subnet that you get

14
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:54.370
from 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 64 and subnet that with Slash 30 mosques and then allocate those subnets to the serial

15
00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:01.450
links you need to configure the riders appropriately so this writer needs to use the first ip address

16
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.040
in the new subnet.

17
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:12.790
This right of the lost one and the same is true for the other sites on the local area network at 6 3

18
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:19.270
router 4 should use the lost IP address in the new subnet the switch the second lost IP address in the

19
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:26.740
subnet and the hosts should be allocated IP addresses from the first available IP address to the lost

20
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.430
available IP address.

21
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.530
You're going to configure the IP addresses in the subnet manually.

22
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:39.850
Previously we used DHB to allocate IP addresses to pieces but in the subnet you're going to use static

23
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.680
ip addresses.

24
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.910
Now once you've configured the network verify that pieces can access Cisco dot com and Facebook dot

25
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:56.350
com using their browsers Cisco dot com and Facebook dot com Web sites on the Internet.

26
00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:05.860
You need to verify that your pieces P.S. 6 7 and 8 can access the Internet as well as choose a P.C.

27
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:12.920
inside one and site two and make sure that they can also access Cisco dot com and Facebook dot com.

28
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:20.410
So can you complete the slab download to the packet tracer file and see if you can complete the lab

29
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.400
yourself.

30
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.940
Otherwise watch the next video where I completed the lab.
