00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The default DTP mode depends on the Cisco IOS software version you're using

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and the platform of switch.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
In this example, I’ve got 2 switches that I've just booted up

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
in other words, they have no configuration

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
here switch 1 and let's change the name to S1, here’s switch 2.

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So let’s see what DTP mode the switches are using.

7
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000
You can view DTP setting by using the command sh dtp interface

8
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and specifying an interface, so I'll specify gigabit 0/0

9
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
which is this link over here.

10
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
What we can see in the output is that DTP is enabled

11
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
the mode at the moment is access port.

12
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So the switch has negotiated with switch 2

13
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
to use an access port rather than a trunk port

14
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and the reason why it’s because it's configured for dynamic auto

15
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
not dynamic desirable

16
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
as an example sh int g0/0 switchport

17
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
shows us   I'll just make this bigger

18
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
that this port gigabit 0/0 is configured for dynamic auto as the administrative mode

19
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and the operational mode or mode that it's using at the moment is static access.

20
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
DTP negotiation is on but because it’s configured for dynamic auto

21
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
it ends up being an access port.

22
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Under this side show dtp interface g0/0

23
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
you can see that it’s negotiated as an access port

24
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
because dynamic auto is configured on the switch.

25
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
sh int g0/0 switchport

26
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:18.000
once again gigabits 0/0 is enabled as a switchport, it's configured for dynamic auto

27
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
it’s operating as an access port even though DTP is enabled.

28
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So, let’s change that by going on to gigabit 0/0

29
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and typing switch port and we have a few options

30
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
so let’s say mode dynamic

31
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
which is setting the trunking mode to dynamically negotiate access

32
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
or trunk mode and we can either use auto or desirable

33
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
so I’m gonna configure this is desirable

34
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000
so previously on switch 1 when we type sh int g0/0 switchport

35
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
it was operating as a static access port.

36
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
What is it doing now?

37
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
so sh int gigabit 0/0 switchport

38
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000
this side is using dynamic auto but the mode negotiated is a trunk port

39
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.000
using the ISL encapsulation, it’s not using 802.1Q its using ISL.

40
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
On this side sh int g0/0 switchport

41
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000
notice this side is dynamic desirable switch 1 is dynamic auto

42
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
but we've configured switch 2 to use desirable

43
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
so switch 2 initiated trunking with switch 1

44
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and it negotiated to use ISL and hence it becomes a trunk

45
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
so when both sides are configured for auto it doesn’t become a trunk

46
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
when 1 side is configured for auto

47
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and the other side is using desirable a trunk will be formed.

48
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
So once again to prove that

49
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
let's go back into the interface

50
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and I'll change the mode to auto

51
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I'll shut it down and then no shut it

52
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
so that they can negotiate once again

53
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.000
on this side notice static access it is no longer a trunk

54
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.000
and on this side once again notice it's using a static access port

55
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
because neither side are initiating trunking

56
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
the port remains an access port and doesn’t become a trunk.

57
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:41.000
If either side or both sides are configured

58
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:49.000
to use desirable the port will become a trunk port.

59
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
So let’s configure on both sides as dynamic desirable

60
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
I'll shut it down and then no shut it

61
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
sh int g0/0 switchport

62
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.000
both side are configured for dynamic desirable

63
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
so the link has become a trunk port

64
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
you can also use the command sh int trunk

65
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
and as we can see here gigabit 0/0 is a trunk port

66
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000
mode is desirable and the encapsulation is ISL native VLAN is 1

67
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
all VLANs are allowed across the port

68
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
we'll see something similar on switch 1

69
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
so sh interface trunk

70
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
notice desirable ISL is being used

71
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:50.000
I'll set this side back to auto

72
00:05:50.000 --> 00:06:01.000
shut it down, no shut it, do sh int trunk

73
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:11.000
sh int trunk   we haven't got a trunk configured at the moment.

74
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Let’s see this side show interface trunk

75
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:22.000
took a while but it's now negotiated to use a trunk with switch 2

76
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
the mode on the left is auto

77
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
the mode on the right is desirable.

78
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
So these 2 switches on gigabit 0/0

79
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
have negotiated to use trunking

80
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.000
because 1 side in this case switch 2 is initiating the trunking.

81
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000
However, we change that again to auto.

82
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
sh int trunk

83
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
we don’t see any trunking.

84
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
On this side, we don’t see any trunking.

85
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:05.000
If we look at the interface you can see it’s an access port

86
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
so no trunking is taking place.
