00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:08.640
Cisco constantly releasing new versions of the so-called us which include new features as well as resolve

2
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:16.950
issues such as bugs in the IRS in this video we'll look at upgrading Cisco Iowas images the high level

3
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:25.440
steps that you firstly need to select and download the correct Iowas image for your router you then

4
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:33.410
need to verify connectivity to your TVT server where you've downloaded and stored the new Iowa image.

5
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:40.460
You should verify that your router has sufficient flash memory space for the new iOS image and then

6
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.310
you copy the Iowas file from the TFT server to the router.

7
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.690
You then configure the router to boot using the new Cisco Iowa image.

8
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:59.620
And then lastly reload the router so that it repeats and load the new Iowas image into memory.

9
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:10.650
In this example of an 1841 Grada so show version shows me the platform we are running currently the

10
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.690
SkyWest 1841 software.

11
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.580
So this is the current release and version of software that we're running.

12
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.420
This is the boot from operating system version.

13
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.560
And once again this is a Cisco 1841 router.

14
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:34.110
So on the Cisco Web site I've gone to support and downloads and I'm going to select 1841 integrated

15
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.870
services Rodda I'm going to select software on chessy.

16
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:45.180
And in this example I'm going to look at Cisco Iris images rather than run monitor all of the operating

17
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.820
systems and what you'd need to do now is download the relevant version of iOS.

18
00:01:52.830 --> 00:02:01.770
Now it's important that the DRAM and Flash be large enough for the operating system that you downloading.

19
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.070
This router has the same amount of memory.

20
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.990
So you need to add those two together.

21
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.790
So that's the amount plus the amount

22
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.700
which gives us about 130 mega RAM.

23
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.320
We've got about 60 to make of Flash.

24
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:31.340
So my Rodda would not to be able to use the version of operating system because the RAM and flash requirements

25
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.960
are greater than what this Rodek currently has installed.

26
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:46.280
So very importantly make sure that your router can support both the DRAM and flash requirements of any

27
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.970
new operating system that you download from Cisco so click on the download link to download the operating

28
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:53.730
system.

29
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.310
You need to log in and make sure that you have a service contract.

30
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:05.080
So do that and then download the operating system to your local PC.

31
00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.690
In my example I'm going to use the operating system which I've already downloaded.

32
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.270
You're going to want to make sure that your router has enough Flesch space for the new image that you

33
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:24.370
downloading so use the Camacho show flash to ensure that the amount of available space is enough for

34
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.530
the image that you want a copy to flash.

35
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:34.690
In my example of a ready copied image the image is only 15 meg in size and I have enough space in flash

36
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:42.620
to copy another version of this image or a different image into the flash of the Rodda.

37
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:52.220
At the moment this Rodda is using this operating system 12. full to T4 that can be seen in the flash

38
00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.010
of the Rodda.

39
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.550
So this is the image that's being used.

40
00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:01.730
Let's pretend that we're going to upgrade the broader to a newer version even though it's the same.

41
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.620
I'll show you the full process.

42
00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:11.560
So what you would do is download the relevant operating system from Cisco and put it in your teeth to

43
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.660
be servers directory.

44
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:21.550
In this example I'm using solar winds and this is the directory that the be serviced pointing to.

45
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:34.600
So you would Topkapi in this example P.E. Flesch Precentor what does the IP address of the server.

46
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.070
So in my example it's 1 2 1 6 8 1 9 9.

47
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.910
What is the source file that we want to copy.

48
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:47.990
So that file make sure that you put an extension in the file name.

49
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.180
What does the destination file name.

50
00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:56.460
In this example I'll make it file to we want with that that Folley already exists.

51
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.880
Do we want to override it.

52
00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.070
And in this example I'm going to override it.

53
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:09.500
So that file will be overridden with this new file that's copied down from the TFT server so we can

54
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.400
see some messages on the TV service stating that the file is being fetched.

55
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.580
So there's a get message.

56
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.600
We can see the file being copied down to the router from the TFT server.

57
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.870
That'll take a while.

58
00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:33.080
And the length of time depends on how large the Iowas fall is and what kind of connection you've got

59
00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.920
between the two FTB server and the router.

60
00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:43.460
If you're doing this across or when a wide area network as an example it could take a lot longer.

61
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:50.210
Now in that example there was a problem where part of the file wasn't successfully copied but it wouldn't

62
00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.860
be a problem.

63
00:05:50.870 --> 00:06:01.910
Even though we're using TFT P because the TFT protocol has retransmissions and checks of files received.

64
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.830
So even though you use a datagram protocol UDP is being used.

65
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:14.090
The TFT protocol ensures that the full file is copied and we can see that we had a check of the file

66
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.500
that succeeded.

67
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.530
So the file was copied successfully.

68
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:27.050
So once again in Flash This is the file that we've copied down and now we can tell the router to boot

69
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:38.270
the system from the flash and the file that we're going to use is this new file so I've added that command

70
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.900
to the running config.

71
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.360
Once again at the moment it's not using that file.

72
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.990
It's using the file 64 DUP.

73
00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:56.410
Ben but we have now told the router to use T4 underscore too.

74
00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.670
So it's a different file to the original file that the router is using.

75
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:06.380
So I'll save the configuration and then I'll reload the router.

76
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:14.210
So when the router boots now it will use the new file rather than the previous file as the operating

77
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.550
system that's loaded into memory.

78
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:22.130
I'll speed up the boot process and the video to save you the time of watching the rot a boot up.

79
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.860
OK serratus booted up.

80
00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:32.250
I'll press enter to continue.

81
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:36.110
Put in my relevant password.

82
00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:46.040
Show version shows us now that it's using that teach for under school to burn file.

83
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:52.670
So it's now using the new operating system that we downloaded from the TFT server.

84
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:58.740
It's not using the original file that we had in Flash.

85
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.030
It's using this file rather than the file.
