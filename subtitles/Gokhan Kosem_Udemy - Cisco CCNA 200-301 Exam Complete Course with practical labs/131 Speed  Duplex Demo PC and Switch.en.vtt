00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Duplex and speed negotiation is also important for connections between a PC and a switch.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in this example the PC is connected to the switch using this interface Ethernet 2

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
at the moment the speed negotiated is 100 Mbps.

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
so here’s the switch, sh int f1/0/5

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
this interface is currently running at full duplex 100 meg on the switch

6
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and that’s what been negotiated on the PC, so we can see 100 Mbps.

7
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
now we could change some of these settings on the PC.

8
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So if we wanted to, we could change the speed and duplex negotiation at the moment using

9
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
auto negotiation but we could make a mistake and set it to 1 gigabit per second full duplex.

10
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.000
On the switch we see that the interfaces gone down, it’s supposedly come up again

11
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
so I'll just look at the duplex and the output.

12
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The switch is using 100 meg full duplex and on the network card

13
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
it's actually moved down to 100 meg rather than using the gigabit speed

14
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
that we configured but if the PC had accepted that speed of 1 gigabit per second

15
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
full duplex we would have a duplex and speed mismatch

16
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
between the switch and the PC which would have caused problems.

17
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Let’s set the PC to 10 meg and see if they can still negotiate properly.

18
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So interface has gone down, it's come up and in this case it has negotiated properly.

19
00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:02.000
In gigabit Ethernet even when set manually the device will still tell the other side

20
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
what speed and duplex it's using.

21
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So things are a lot better than they were in the past.

22
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Let's set the side for auto negotiation

23
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
but what I’ll do now is on the switch configure it manually.

24
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:15.000
so interface F1/0/5

25
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:33.000
do sh run int f1/0/5 duplex and speed are not set

26
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
but let's set the speed to 100 meg duplex to full.

27
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000
So the configuration looks as follows interface has come up

28
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
what is the side using? It’s using 100 Mbps.

29
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:58.000
so do sh int f1/0/5 type include duplex that looks good.

30
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Let's set the duplex to half and the speed to 10.

31
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
On this side negotiation has taken place successfully.

32
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So things are a lot better than they were years ago

33
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
with duplex and speed but generally the recommendation is to use

34
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Auto negotiation of speed and duplex, allow both sides to negotiate

35
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
to the highest speed and duplex that they both support.

36
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
So I’ll try and break this by going to the 100 full duplex.

37
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Interface is going down and come up but it's still successfully negotiated

38
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
so it's still showing speed of 10 meg.

39
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Let’s however configure it to go to the best possible speed and duplex.

40
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000
So I’ll set it to use auto negotiation and on the switch.

41
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Well set this, speed to auto, duplex to auto

42
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and as we can see sh int f1/0/5 include duplex.

43
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
The output shows full duplex 100 meg

44
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000
so it has successfully negotiated with the PC to use 100 meg full duplex.

45
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
So in summary again auto negotiation is the way to go today

46
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
if you are gonna hard-code, make sure that you hard-code correctly on both sides.
