00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
On the DHCP server, we could use commands such as,  show ip dhcp binding

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to see the client ID that's associated with an IP address.

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So this IP address is being allocated

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
to this client ID here and it was allocated automatically.

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Now that client ID isn’t very easy to read.

6
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So what I’ll do is go into the interface on the client

7
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and shut that down, in  this example a DHCP release message was sent

8
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
to the DHCP server before the interface was shut down.

9
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So when we look at the binding on the DHCP server, no binding now exist.

10
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So ip dhcp client   and we'll specify a client-id in ascii

11
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and you'll simply set it to PC 2 and hit enter

12
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and then use the command  no shut  to bring the interface up.

13
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So we see a discover message, there’s an offer request from the client

14
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and an acknowledgement from the server.

15
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
show dhcp lease  what we can see here is the client ID is set to PC 2

16
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and this is the client ID hexadecimal dump.

17
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:41.000
On the server   show ip dhcp binding   notice the user name is the same as on the client.

18
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
This can be converted from hexadecimal to ASCII and you’ll get PC 2.

19
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
As an example, the hexadecimal value 50 is the decimal value 80

20
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and equates to capital P

21
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000
in the same way hexadecimal 43 is capital C and hexadecimal 32 is value 2.

22
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So this equates to PC 2 which can also be seen on the server.

23
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
So I wanted to shut that interface down, and show you Wireshark.

24
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So I'll shut it down, I’ll start a Wireshark capture.

25
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
On the server router 2 and on router 1

26
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I'll   no shut   the interface and let’s see if we get some DHCP messages.

27
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
So firstly, here's a DHCP discover message.

28
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Bootstrap protocol discover, so DHCP discover

29
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
source port is UDP port 68, destination port is UDP port 67

30
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
it’s a boot request or DHCP request

31
00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
notice the client MAC address is A,B,C as configured, the client IP address is 0.

32
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
The PC doesn’t know what IP address to use

33
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and it doesn’t know about any DHCP servers. so it sending a message

34
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
to the broadcast address 255.255.255.255   so you can see it’s a discover.

35
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
There's other information here including the host name

36
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
of the device making the request, as well as a client identifier.

37
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Scrolling down a bit further, we can see the offer from the DHCP server.

38
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
So this is from the server to a broadcast address

39
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
because the client doesn’t have an IP address, it needs to be a broadcast.

40
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
So it's a DHCP offer, offering this IP address to a client with this MAC address.

41
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
We can see information such as, once again it’s an offer

42
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
client identifier, so that's the server IP address

43
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
lease time is 7 days because we configure that manually.

44
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
We can see the subnet mask being /24, we can see option 3

45
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
default gateway, we can see option 6, DNS server

46
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and we can see option 150 TFTP server.

47
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
The client then request that address

48
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
the clients still doesn’t have an IP address

49
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000
so it sends it from a source IP address of 0.0.0.0 to a broadcast

50
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and it's asking the server through the request

51
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:43.000
if it can have this IP address that was previously offered 10.1.1.14

52
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
the server then acknowledges, that the client can have that address

53
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
notice it's still a broadcast

54
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
so the server is telling the client that, yes they can use this IP address.

55
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
so the client, with this Mac address once again

56
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
has now being drawn to the right to use that IP address 10.1.1.14

57
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
so the client can now start using this address

58
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and we can see that on the client, that it was assigned this IP address.
