00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:09.370
Let's look at functionality of the passwords Radu one has an enable and secret password configured router

2
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.230
to at the moment doesn't have a password configured.

3
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.860
All boot the router and open up a console.

4
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:26.400
So top disable and rotten do the same on rockety when I type enable and Rodda one I need to enter my

5
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.190
password which is my secret password and router 2 I don't have to enter anything because no password

6
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:38.750
has been configured if Alltop been able and do nothing.

7
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.070
The Rondo's going to wait for a period of time for me to enter a password and if I don't it's going

8
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.960
to prompt me and I'll speed up the video to save you the time waiting for this but notice the time it

9
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.750
has expired that's going to happen three times.

10
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.920
While we're waiting for that I'll set up an enable password on route to

11
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.130
and I'll show you what happens when I touched the wrong password in.

12
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.960
So I'm not type in password one possible to password to three.

13
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.270
Notice it tells me bad passwords so I'm not locked out of the router.

14
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:24.130
I'm simply told that I've entered a bad number of passwords notice and wrote a one second time that

15
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:37.440
has occurred on rockety it's doing Nabl secret Cisco one disable.

16
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.980
Now this is going to be my secret password.

17
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:47.050
One two three told bad secrets.

18
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:55.950
Previously I was told bad passwords on Router one I'm told bad secrets because I've had three timeouts.

19
00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:03.060
So the moral of the story is that if you wait too long you'll be prompted again offers free incorrect

20
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.420
tries of a password.

21
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.490
It reverts back to user mode and that's the default behavior.

22
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.270
It's not going to lock you out of the router.

23
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:17.010
You can enable more security but that's not covered in the CCN a course so I won't explain it here but

24
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:27.270
you can lock someone out of a router if you want to and something to take note of is show run piping

25
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:33.500
Kloot enable you can't use this as your password.

26
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:40.830
So I'll copy that type disable and pasted in but it's not accepted as a password.

27
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.450
So I'll say no enable secret

28
00:02:50.210 --> 00:03:02.780
show run pipe include enable So my password is Siska top civis password encryption show run piping CLEET

29
00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.890
enable my cryptic password.

30
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.020
I'll try and paste that in when prompted for a password.

31
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.890
And it's not accepted.

32
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.360
I need to use my unencrypted password when going from user mode to enable mode.
