00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:07.410
Now as part of this course you'll have access to a binary decimal and hexadecimal converter that we've

2
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.470
created to make this very easy.

3
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:19.990
So a decimal IP address of 255 255 255 255 converts to binary numbers consisting of four groups of eight

4
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.190
binary ones and eight hexadecimal F's as discussed.

5
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.450
Now an inverse mosque is also shown here.

6
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:38.590
So if you inverse the number 255 in decimal equates to zero in decimal inverse binary is a zero inverse

7
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.420
hexadecimal is a zero.

8
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:54.000
Let's do an example of 240 1 to 3 and convert that he has your binary number.

9
00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.210
Is your hexadecimal number.

10
00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.560
He has the inverse.

11
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.410
So the inverse is based on the binary.

12
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.320
Notice these four binary values are a 1.

13
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:10.150
So inverted that equal to 4 binary 0 is the last of four binary numbers are set to 0.

14
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.760
The inverse is setting that two ones and that works out as if in hexadecimal or 15.

15
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:23.700
In decimal the same for decimal 1 equals this in binary.

16
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.720
Equals this in hexadecimal.

17
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.890
If you look at the binary and you invert the zeros to a 1 and the 1 2 0 0 you you're going to end up

18
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:39.040
with this number and if you convert that to decimal you get to 5 4 or hexadecimal.

19
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:47.190
If e and so forth and so one the calculator also allows you to take a sort of binary number and then

20
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:56.280
convert it to decimal hexadecimal and the inverse values as well as taking hexadecimal values and converting

21
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.980
that to decimal and binary.
