1
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:20.300
So on the switch show run we need to configure additional configuration on these interfaces.

2
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.000
The switched virtual interfaces on the switch.

3
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:31.810
We need to configure what's called an IP help her address to forward DCP requests to the router.

4
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:41.750
So there are a number of things we need to do on the switch including forwarding the DHEA HP request

5
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.850
to messages to the router.

6
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.040
So let's do that on Vigeland 10 and on VLAN 20.

7
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.850
So firstly show run.

8
00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:01.110
Notice as prior diagram this interfaces and VLAN 10 and do this interface is in VLAN 20.

9
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.350
So P.S. One is in VLAN 10.

10
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.800
P.S. 2 is in VLAN 20.

11
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.240
And that's correct.

12
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.850
Per the configuration shown here.

13
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:22.550
Now that we've configured the IP help her addresses DCP requests will be forwarded to the router but

14
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:33.480
the router needs to know about those networks if a rider receives a DHB request from a network that

15
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.210
it's not aware of it won't allocate IP addresses on the router.

16
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:50.620
I'm going to create a static Grant pointing to the switch for Network 10 1 10 0 as well as 10 1 20 0

17
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:52.960
so after the moment.

18
00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:02.370
Now at the writing table contains those two static routes in addition to the directly connected interfaces

19
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:09.580
so the router should be able to ping the switches switched virtual interfaces or SFE eyes which it can.

20
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.090
So the rod is able to ping this IP address as well as this IP address.

21
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.750
Don't forget to add Rance either using a dynamic routing protocol or something else so that you have

22
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.260
IP connectivity in your network.

23
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:32.760
We've been told that pieces need to be able to ping the loop back of wrought a one rod one has an IP

24
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.740
address of wandered wandered wandered one configured on the loop back

25
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.580
the switch doesn't know about that network.

26
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.470
So we would have to add a static round

27
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.900
or enable a writing protocol such as I was P.F. to allow the devices to ping each other.

28
00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.440
So now the switch keeping the loop back of the router.

29
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.400
In this example I'm using static routs but you could have used a writing protocol such as over SPF or

30
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.000
rip.

31
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:14.510
Another thing we need to do on the switch is enable IP routing when traffic is sent from Vila intend

32
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:15.940
to VLAN 20.

33
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.820
The switch needs to do the interview lan routing of that traffic so into VLAN routing needs to be enabled

34
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.940
by using the IP routing command.

35
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:35.750
The switch needs to be configured to route from one switch to a virtual interface to another so hence

36
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:43.690
we add the command IP routing to the switches configuration.

37
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:51.080
So now let's test all the pieces he's able to get IP addresses from the DCP server and ping the loop

38
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.000
back of the router.

39
00:03:53.090 --> 00:04:01.700
The first thing we need to do on the P.C. is ensure that it's using DCP and then we need to ensure that

40
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.780
it's retrieved an IP address through DCP.

41
00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:12.000
We can confirm that by using the command IP config notice in this example it's retrieved an IP address

42
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.210
of tendered wonder tender tendered 18.

43
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.710
Can it ping the switch.

44
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:18.250
Yes it can.

45
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.380
Can it paying the router yes it can.

46
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.960
Can it ping the loop back of the router.

47
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.460
Yes it can.

48
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.470
So that looks great.

49
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:34.820
What about PCI to we need to configure it to use DHEA P.

50
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:42.480
You can see here that it's already been allocated a gateway and DNS server on the desktop.

51
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:49.860
We can go to a command prompt and we can use the command IP config to verify whether it got an IP address

52
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.190
through DCP.

53
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.770
It has.

54
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.100
So can it ping the default gateway the switch.

55
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.400
Yes it can.

56
00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.860
Can it paying the routers Ethernet interface.

57
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.220
Yes it can.

58
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.310
Can it ping the writers loop back address.

59
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.190
Yes it can.

60
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.280
So that's looking great.

61
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.410
What about the piece he's pinging each other.

62
00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.300
So here's P.S. One yes.

63
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:27.740
P.S. two IP address of P.S. One is 10 dot one attended 18 ping tendered one to tender 18 that works.

64
00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:33.430
IP address on the side is tendered one to twenty dot 13.

65
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.030
So can P.S. 1 ping tendered one to twenty dot 13.

66
00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.290
Yes it can so at this point we've got to the lab working

67
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:54.830
so can write a one paying P.S. To yes it can cannot ping P.S. 1

68
00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:08.550
yes it can we can use the command help to C available commands on the P.S. One of those commands is

69
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:14.400
trace round so trace right to the back of the rudder.

70
00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.580
Notice the traffic goes to the switch and then it goes to the router

71
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:29.830
trace ranch to the rota same happens here

72
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:42.350
what happens if we trace two pieces two from P.S. One trace goes via the switch so I'm happy with that

73
00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:50.490
we've successfully configured the network don't forget to save your configuration when you've finished

74
00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:56.080
with your lab I always do that in the exam just to be sure.

75
00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.730
I hope you found this video and lab useful.
