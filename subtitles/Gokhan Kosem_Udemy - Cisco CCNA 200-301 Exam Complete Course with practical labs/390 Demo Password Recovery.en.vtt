00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.580
A possible recovery requires two things you need to be able to power cycle the device.

2
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:13.390
I'm going to be using an APC to do this so that I can power cycle the device remotely.

3
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:19.160
I'm also connected to the console of this router via a terminal server side.

4
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:28.980
Telnetting to a server and then accessing the console of the router through the terminal server in the

5
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.520
real world you may have to physically walk to the router and plug your laptop into the console and then

6
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.460
power cycle the device.

7
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.260
Or if you've got access to an APC and a terminal server that's giving out-of-band console access to

8
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.370
the device you can do what I'm doing here.

9
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.270
The process is the same.

10
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:56.100
The APC and terminal server only gave me the ability to access the console and power cycle the device

11
00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.600
remotely I'm connected to the console of the router and I'm told that I need to press Return to get

12
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.180
started some in user mode.

13
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.620
I can top show version and we can see that this is a Cisco 1841 router.

14
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:22.160
We can see that the configuration register is set to 2 1 0 2 that is the default value which means that

15
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:30.110
the router will boot normally and has a console speed of 9600 bits per second startup config will be

16
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.890
used.

17
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.140
And we can change the config register if necessary as follows.

18
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.080
However we're not typing able.

19
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.700
Let's assume that I don't know what the password is

20
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.590
so I'm unable to access.

21
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.720
Privilege mode on this router.

22
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.620
It does seem that the secret password was set and we don't know what that password is anymore.

23
00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.280
So what we can do is power cycle the router.

24
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:08.450
So I'm going to set the APC to do any immediate reboot on the router.

25
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.610
And what we will notice on the router is it's rebooting.

26
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.380
I'm going to send a special command which is the break to the Rodda.

27
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.360
And notice I am now in Ramond mode.

28
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:28.600
So through the APC are remotely re booted the router rather than physically doing it Rodda has rebooted.

29
00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:38.260
And I sent a break signal to the Rodda so you could use your keyboard or your terminal emulation program

30
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.110
to send the break.

31
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:46.420
In this case I'm using putty and I just sent the break c'mon to the Rodda which meant that it broke

32
00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.590
the boot process and went into Romont mode.

33
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.230
Question mark shows me options and Rahmon.

34
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.650
You'll notice that this is different to the traditional Cisco Aiwass.

35
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.950
This is the command that we looking for configuration register utility.

36
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:11.580
So we're going to set back to count 0 1 4 2 the possible procedure I'm using is a little bit different

37
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.720
to the twenty nine hundred password procedure.

38
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:23.280
But notice the same command is used the Cisco Web site will give you the details for individual routers.

39
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.280
So as an example for an 18 41 router the full procedure is shown here.

40
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:36.810
Just follow the procedure for the relevant device that you want to do by password recovery on that includes

41
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.450
both routers and switches.

42
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.130
So in a document like this we have highand routers LAN switches and other devices.

43
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:52.380
So confrere just set we told that we need to reset our power cycle the device command to do that is

44
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.400
going to be reset

45
00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:05.530
and what will happen now is the will boot normally but it will bypass the startup configuration because

46
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:17.180
when setting this value to 4 6 is set which means ignore and be RAM contents so to save you some time

47
00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:20.300
I'm going to speed up the boot process.

48
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:27.360
What will happen is when the router boots up it will bypass the startup configuration and ask us whether

49
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:34.800
we want to add to the initial startup dialog and noticed now that the router is prompting us with the

50
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:42.030
system configuration dialog we don't want to enter that's going to say no we're told to press Return

51
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.040
to get started.

52
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:55.370
And notice the name of the Rodda is router where as previously it was called C 1841 or 1.

53
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.450
So here's the critical piece enable.

54
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.410
I can move to enable mode without a password.

55
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:12.760
Show startup config shows that there is an enable secret password configured in the startup config and

56
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.840
we can see the hostname of the router as an example.

57
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.320
We can see other information such as IP addresses on serial interfaces.

58
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:29.230
We can see that OSPF was configured as part of the startup config in the running config However we don't

59
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.840
have the hostname configured.

60
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.800
We don't have a secret password.

61
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:41.350
We don't have IP addresses on our serial interfaces and we don't have be configured so to get the config

62
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.900
back.

63
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.710
I'm going to top copy startup config running config.

64
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.940
Notice the router name has now changed.

65
00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.250
Show run.

66
00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:59.390
Shows us the IP addresses and OSPF configuration in running config.

67
00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:08.270
Now OSPF was complaining that it couldn't allocate a unique Rodda ID and that's because all interfaces

68
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:15.890
on the router are shut down so I'm going to go into serial zero slash seriously zero and no shut the

69
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.100
interface and do that.

70
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:26.880
On the other serial interface and notice now I always be able to allocate errata ID and then form a

71
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:35.880
neighbor relationship with a neighboring router so as an example show IP P.F. neighbor shows us that

72
00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:42.130
the neighbor relationship has formed that's important to remember that we are now in privileged mode.

73
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:46.060
We enable mode but we don't know the password.

74
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:54.120
Show run shows us that the secret password is configured but we don't actually know what that password

75
00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.090
is.

76
00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:00.120
We moved from user mode to privilege mode without entering a password.

77
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.810
And then we copied the startup config to running config.

78
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:08.550
If we exit to privilege mode now we won't be able to get back in.

79
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:17.050
So what we need to do is change the password so change the secret password to something that we know.

80
00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:24.330
So it's really important that when you do the password recovery that you go to privilege mode you enable

81
00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:32.910
mode first and then copy the config from startup config to running config and then change the password

82
00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.130
and then save your config.

83
00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:44.930
So it's really important that you set the password and that you then save the configuration before continuing.

84
00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:53.560
Now show version shows us that the configuration register is still to 140.

85
00:07:53.910 --> 00:08:00.120
The configuration register configuration is separate to the running and startup config of Varada.

86
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.720
So what I'm going to do is save the config right now.

87
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.550
So copy running config startup config.

88
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:07.380
All right mem

89
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:14.730
at the moment the config register is 0 x 2 1 4 2.

90
00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:22.680
If I rebooted the broader now it would end up booting without using the startup config again.

91
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:23.850
Now we don't want to do that.

92
00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:30.290
We want to use the config register command and set it for normal boot.

93
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:37.240
So set it to 1 0 2 show version.

94
00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:46.510
Notice it will be thus at next reload I can reload the Rotto without saving the configuration and it

95
00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:51.290
will reboot using the previously saved config.

96
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:58.170
If you remember before I made the change I saved the config.

97
00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:01.860
So thats the configuration thats going to be used.

98
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:08.090
I don't need to save the configuration again for the configuration register change to be saved it saved

99
00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:12.480
independently of the running configuration on the router.

100
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.140
Speed up the boot process again.

101
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:25.620
So notice that we are told to press and to get started and interfaces come up and the in OSPF neighbor

102
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:35.200
relationship is formed and that's because the startup config was applied when the Rodda booted up.

103
00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:41.240
Now in the top enable We can log in with the password that we configured.

104
00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:48.800
In other words the reset secret password we can't see that in the upper Chiheb because it's hashed.

105
00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:55.150
But this is the password of Cisco that we configure the router to use.

106
00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:58.420
So that's an example of how to do Ponsford recovery.

107
00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:06.900
Don't forget that on Cisco's Web site there are possible recovery procedures for various routers that

108
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:12.370
you may be using in your lab or that you may be using in the real world.

109
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:18.870
Simply follow the step by step procedures to bypass an encrypted password.

110
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:22.740
This does require physical access.

111
00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:29.220
In other words you need access to the console to be able to do a password recovery.
