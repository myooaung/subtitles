00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.280
In question 5 we we're told to assume that one MAC address is empty.

2
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:37.090
We can verify that by looking at the output of the show MAC address table command on the switch as we

3
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.500
can see here the MAC address table is empty.

4
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:48.310
We asked when P.S. five pings P.S. eight what type of packet is sent to the switch initially.

5
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.100
And can we prove it.

6
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.950
So

7
00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:01.000
IP config on P.S. 5 shows us the IP address of P.S. 5 10 1 1 5.

8
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.150
P.S. 8

9
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.630
has IP address 10 1 1 8.

10
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:15.430
So what kind of frame or what kind of packet is sent to the switch when using terms such as frames and

11
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:25.070
packets once again are we referring to layer 2 or Layer 3 or Layer 4 of the other side model.

12
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:32.720
So what I'll do on P.S. 5 is paying 10 1 1 8 before I do that.

13
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.960
Notice the OP cache is empty.

14
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.880
On P.S. 5 if it had just a rebooted the OP cache would be empty.

15
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:49.580
Something to send two pings into the network we can see that the first packet that was generated is

16
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:59.780
an all package looking at the actual packet or frame we can see that add layer to the frame has a destination

17
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.100
address of a broadcast.

18
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:10.530
That type of package at least 3 is OP so in the Layer 3 headers we can see that this is an off packet

19
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:23.840
requesting the MAC address of host with IP address 10 1 1 8 so the Ethernet type is 0 6 0 8 0 6.

20
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.280
In other words it's an op packet capture forward

21
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:43.360
and before I continue the answer to Question 5 is this is an op packet it's a broadcast packet we can

22
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:51.100
see that again by looking at the inbound PD you honor the switch notice destination address is a broadcast

23
00:02:52.190 --> 00:03:00.170
who receives the packet because it's a broadcast it's going to be flooded to the other devices in the

24
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:09.970
network and then P.S. 6 and P.S. 7 are going to drop it because of the packet is not destined to them.

25
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.650
So the answer for question 6 is.

26
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:20.860
P.S. 6 P.S. 7 and PCH will receive the packet.

27
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.400
Now here's where things change.

28
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.140
Who receives the you return packet.

29
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:33.450
So here we've got our op reply on the inbound PD U to the switch.

30
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.290
We can see that the target mac address is this.

31
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.330
That's the MAC address of P.S. 5.

32
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.290
So the MAC address is actually written into the frame.

33
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.120
This is a unique cost packet center from P.S. 8 to P.S. 5.

34
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.790
It's not a broadcast unlike the OP request to notice what happens now.

35
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.790
The packet is only sent to P.S. 5.

36
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:16.960
It's not flooded out of all ports so the only piece that receives it is P.S. 5 that is different to

37
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:27.460
our previous example where P.S. One P.S. 2 and P.S. 3 received the return traffic and notice the difference

38
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:34.320
in question 8 when Pink traffic is sent from P.S. 5 to PCH who receives it.

39
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:35.160
So here's

40
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:51.790
ICMP request or echo request message we can see that it's ICMP destination MAC address is P.S. 8.

41
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.040
Source MAC address is P.S. 5 source IP address is.

42
00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.150
P.S. 5 destination IP address is PCH.

43
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:10.670
So notice now that the packet is only sent to PCH so that's a very different to what we saw when we

44
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:19.130
were using a hub a switch is different to a hub in that it has a separate collision domain on every

45
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:30.190
port so when packets are sent from P.S. 5 to PCH they are sent directly between the devices they don't

46
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.270
get flooded to the other pieces in the network.

47
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:44.080
That is very different to a hub so to prove that what I'll do is populate or the OP cache of P.S. 6

48
00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:45.890
so I'll get it to ping.

49
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:56.730
P.S. 8 and I'll run this in real time so if we look at to the OP cache of P.S. 6 OP caches populated

50
00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.160
the same is true on P.S. 5.

51
00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:06.000
So both.

52
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:15.180
P.S. 5 and P.S. 6 know the MAC address of PCH I'll change this to simulation mode.

53
00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:21.980
And I'll get both of these pieces to ping PCH

54
00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.090
both of them are sending ICMP packets.

55
00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.130
They both get sent to the switch.

56
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:41.170
And notice the first one is sent to PCH and then the second one is sent to PCH.

57
00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:52.490
We don't end up with a collision so the switcher cashes the package and allows the communication and

58
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.300
to show you this in a different way.

59
00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:00.380
What I'll do is get pissy 5 to ping PCH

60
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:14.140
but get to P.S. six to ping P.S. seven CPC five is pinging pieces eight pieces six is pinging pieces

61
00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:21.920
seven in this case pieces six and needs to ARP for the mac address of P.S. seven.

62
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:29.960
Notice however that there is no collision taking place.

63
00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:41.520
So now notice the OP cache of pieces 6 is populated with the MAC address of both P.S. 7 and PCH so I'll

64
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.750
run that again

65
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:49.370
and I need to be in simulation mode to do that.

66
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.770
So they both are sending ICMP packets

67
00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.300
these are unit costs.

68
00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:09.780
They are not broadcasts notice of the destination of this frame is P.S. 7 destination of this frame

69
00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:22.860
is P.S. 8 both packets can be sent and received by the switch without interference from the other conversation

70
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:34.590
so the pieces can communicate now without collisions and they are essentially separated from the other

71
00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:42.900
conversation the conversation between P.S. 5 and P.S. 8 happens independently of the conversation between

72
00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.900
P.S. 7 and P.S. 6.

73
00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:49.610
We have 4 collision domains here

74
00:08:53.840 --> 00:09:04.350
a hub is a single collision domain a switch has a collision domain per interface but again if P.S. 5

75
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.730
sent a broadcast

76
00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:11.120
the broadcast

77
00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:20.240
would be forwarded to all devices in the network.

78
00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.770
This is a layer to switch.

79
00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:29.810
It's going to flood that broadcast out of all ports so everyone is going to receive the broadcast and

80
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:35.090
everyone is going to have to reply back to that broadcast.

81
00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:46.220
Packet tracing is not perfect software but it allows you to visually see how traffic flows in the network

82
00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:53.480
and to learn how to answer questions such as these.

83
00:09:53.570 --> 00:10:01.550
So when studying for the CCMA exam you can use packet tracer to learn how traffic flows to learn what

84
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:08.090
frames look like what packets looked like what segments looked like and it helps you essentially become

85
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.430
a better network engineer.

86
00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:12.890
So were you able to answer these questions.

87
00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:20.360
Do you understand how data flows in a network when you have a switch or when you have a hub.

88
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.920
Make sure that you understand how data flows through networks.
