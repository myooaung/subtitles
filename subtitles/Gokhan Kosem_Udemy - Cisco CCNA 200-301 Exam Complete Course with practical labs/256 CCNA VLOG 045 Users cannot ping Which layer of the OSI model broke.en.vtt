00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.200
In this video we are troubleshooting network connectivity problems.

2
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:23.610
We've been told in this scenario that broader one which is a viral rudder running ingenious three is

3
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:30.980
not able to ping the looped back of viral rudder to put the loop back of quadruple full.

4
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:41.420
And that's true show IP raft shows us that we only have a connected and local network in the routing

5
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:51.240
table show IP protocols shows us that we are running the risk P.F. routing protocol and it's enabled

6
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:59.190
on all interfaces on the router show IP SPF neighbor shows us that we have a full relationship with

7
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:10.010
a neighboring Rada with IP address 10 1 2 1 which is this right one rather so on a one show IP always

8
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:19.730
P.F. neighbor we only have a neighbor relationship to tend to one but wondered one rod on the left that's

9
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:30.190
on interface fast ethernet zero zero show IP protocols or SPF is enabled on this broader and is enabled

10
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:39.390
on all interfaces show IP SPF interface brief we have a SPF enabled on the serial interface and Andrew

11
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.670
the fast ethernet interface can you see the problem.

12
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:54.150
Notice the state of the serial interfaces down to show IP interface brief we can see that the serial

13
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.460
interface is up or down.

14
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:06.390
Something wrong with the serial interface show run interface serial to slash zero shows us that an IP

15
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:13.080
addresses configured on the serial interface but to the interface is no shut in other words it's administratively

16
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:20.250
up nothing else is shown so show interface several to slash zero we can see that the interface is up

17
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:30.090
down we can see the encapsulation keep alive is set to ten seconds let's have a look at it to show IP

18
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:38.520
with P.F. interface brief we can see once again that oh SPF is enabled on the surreal interface but

19
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:48.730
the neighbor relationship is down show IP interface brief interface is up down so this interface has

20
00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:59.100
not been administratively shut down show interface Cyril to slash 0 Can you see the problem.

21
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.430
What's wrong in this output notice here.

22
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:14.560
Encapsulation HDL C on the side encapsulation p p p show run interface several to slash zero.

23
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:23.690
We can see that the site is being set to use PPC encapsulation so we need to either set it to use HDL

24
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:34.880
C which is the default on Cisco's serial interfaces or we need to set the encapsulation to BP on both

25
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:43.410
sides so set the encapsulation to HDL C show IP interface brief

26
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.780
interfaces up and down.

27
00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:57.360
But notice it's just come up and notice the OSP f relationship has gone to full so on right one show

28
00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.940
IP of SPF neighbor.

29
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:09.840
Notice we now have two neighbor relationships one to write a two across the several interface and one

30
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:17.940
to this I was V rather on the left using the first Ethernet interface so that looks a lot better.

31
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:27.090
Let's have a look at the writing table of router 1 which is a viral I V router we now see the loop back

32
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.050
quadruple for in the writing table.

33
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.520
So can we ping that loop back.

34
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.350
Yes we can.

35
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:46.380
I'm going to disable IP domain look up to speed up tracing so trace could ripple for the trace.

36
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:52.620
Shows us the path that goes to the strata one with the serpent face to write it too with a surreal interface

37
00:04:53.040 --> 00:05:02.910
and then on to the eye a v rudder with the loop back could ripple for now to prove that I could do a

38
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:13.420
debug set debug IP ICMP to ping and notice we see the output on the screen of this right.

39
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:21.860
So be careful when asked to troubleshoot a writing protocol such as I was P.F. in the CCMA exam.

40
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.460
The issue could be unrelated to 0 SPF the issue could be an interface that's been mis configured.

41
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.120
In this example the encapsulation was incorrect.

42
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:38.410
You have to have either HDL C on both sides or BPP on both sides of a serial link.

43
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.030
A mismatch caused the interface to go up down.

44
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:48.190
In other words the interface was administratively up but the line protocol was down which caused an

45
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.470
issue with broad exchange and advertisement which meant that we couldn't send traffic from the left

46
00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.610
hand side of the network to the right hand side of the network.
