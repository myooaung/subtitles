00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:09.880
Now as I mentioned cyder or classless into domain routing was introduced in 1993 and Sajda replaces

2
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.140
classful IP addresses.

3
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:20.700
This allows us to use a variable length subnet mosques or violists them and uses the notation 10.0 at

4
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:30.470
0.0 slash 8 rather than the notation of 10.00 dot 0 2 5 5.0 did 0 0.0.

5
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:38.690
So for a Class 8 network such as 10 this type of notation is used and not this notation insider.

6
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:45.310
So firstly I'm going to explain the notation of slash 8 and then I'll give you the reasons why the move

7
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:53.460
was made to cyder so inside a notation we use slash X mosques.

8
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.280
So if we had a subnet of 2.5 they're too far to 5.0.

9
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.120
That converts into 24 binary bits.

10
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.390
So to work it out convert the decimal octet to binary.

11
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:16.650
So in the first octet we have 2.5 which equals eight binary ones in the second octet we have 255 which

12
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.580
also equals eight binary ones in the third octet.

13
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.440
We have 2 5:5 which equals a another eight binary ones.

14
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.940
The last octet is decimal 0.

15
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.560
So they are no binary ones in the last octet.

16
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:39.840
So we've got eight Monnerie ones plus eight binary ones which equals 16 plus an additional eight binary

17
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.120
ones which equals 24 binary ones in the mosque.

18
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:53.750
So once again if you count the binary ones you end up with 24 binary ones and therefore to 5 5.1 5.2

19
00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:01.590
for 5.0 can be written as a slash 24 because they are 24 binary ones in the subnet mask.

20
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.800
As another example 4 5 2 5.0 0 Sarah is equivalent to slash 16.

21
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.190
And why is that.

22
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:20.580
Because 2.5 is 8 binary ones and 2.5 is an additional eight binary ones so 8 plus 8 equals 16.

23
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.090
Hence slash 16 in the mosque.

24
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:31.080
So the slash mosque notation is essentially counting the number of binary ones in the mosque.

25
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.530
Mosques have to be contiguous ones.

26
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.400
As mentioned previously.

27
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:45.520
So this is simply another way of writing the subnet mask flesh 16 is equivalent to 2 5 5 2 4 5 to 0.0.

28
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:52.650
Now there are various advantages to using cider and there is a reason why the industry moved to the

29
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.790
side a notation.
