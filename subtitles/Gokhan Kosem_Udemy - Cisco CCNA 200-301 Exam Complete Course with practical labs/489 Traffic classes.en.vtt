00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:07.140
Now before traffic policies can be applied to packets the packets need to be put into a class so as

2
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.590
an example before you're allowed to take a first class seat someone checks your ticket to ensure that

3
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.250
you are a first class passenger.

4
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.050
So in other words before quality of service is applied to your packet the rod or switch needs to determine

5
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.640
which class you belong to.

6
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.130
If you belong to the platinum class you will get a platinum service but if you belong to the economy

7
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.040
class you'll only get an economy service.

8
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.410
But before the service is applied the Rado switch needs to determine which class you belong to and it

9
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.800
can do that as an example by looking at the marking a FedEx sorting depot will sort packets based on

10
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:51.090
the marking on a package packages with next day delivery or high importance will be processed differently

11
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.060
to packages that have standard delivery markings on them.

12
00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.020
Best practices state that you should classify and Mark as close to the edge of the network as possible.

13
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.460
So as an example IP phones will mark their traffic as it leaves the IP phone for other traffic types

14
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.250
you want to try and do your classification and marking on your age switches so marking takes place on

15
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.020
the edge.

16
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.240
But every device along the path uses classification to determine what quality of service that traffic

17
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.990
gets.

18
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:29.260
It can do the classification based on three criteria either by looking at the marking in a header such

19
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.500
as the costs or DSP value.

20
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:38.170
It could also look at IP addressing such as the destination IP subnet that you're going to or source

21
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.040
IP address or layer to MAC address or some other addressing criteria.

22
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.620
So as an example it could look at destination port number.

23
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:54.220
Are you going to a specific IP address and specific port number or are you going to something like Cisco

24
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.360
dot com vs. Facebook dot com.

25
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:05.320
So a domain address in addition routers can support deeper payload inspections by using application

26
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.310
signatures.

27
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.760
So by using network based application recognition or Anbar a writer can look deep into a package to

28
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.010
determine how important that traffic is.

29
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.670
So Inbar uses layers 47 for deep packet inspection.

30
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.990
It is more CPA intensive and therefore you generally only do it at the edge of your network.

31
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:32.410
Most applications can be identified using Layer 3 will layer for criteria such as IP addresses or well-known

32
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.390
port numbers but other applications require deeper packet inspection.

33
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.820
As an example HDP uses port 80.

34
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.740
You don't want your riders classifying traffic going to Cisco dot com in the same way as Facebook dot

35
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:45.550
com.

36
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:52.930
Both of them could be using port EDI or port FL for 3 h GDP s so you may need to look deeper into the

37
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.920
packet to determine where it's going.

38
00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.510
So as an example look at the domain name and then do your quality of service based on their destination

39
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.510
domain name.

40
00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:09.820
Inbar supports two modes of operation we have passive mode and active mode passive mode provides real

41
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:16.060
time statistics on applications per protocol per interface and gives bi directional statistics such

42
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.970
as bitrate packet and byte counts.

43
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:26.060
Active mode classifies applications for traffic marking so that quality of service policies can be applied.

44
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.030
So are we actively looking at traffic types and then applying quality of service.

45
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:37.690
Or are we just reviewing statistics of traffic going through a network so passive mode provides statistics

46
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:44.110
but doesn't do marketing active mode allows you to do markings and apply quality of service policies.
