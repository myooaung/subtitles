00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:09.060
Now previously before cider was used we had class full address masks so we had class a addresses Class

2
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:17.460
B addresses and Class C addresses a class a subnet supports about 16 million addresses and uses the

3
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.080
mosque to far 5.0 dot 0 0 0.

4
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:31.800
Class B networks support about 65000 host addresses with a mask of 2 5 5 or 2 4 5 0 0 0 plus C networks

5
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:39.680
support 254 host addresses and use a mask of 255 or 2.5 by 5.2 per 5.0.

6
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:47.640
The problem with this method is what happens if a company wants to support 3000 hosts for example.

7
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.160
So if the network had 3000 hosts which of these three address classes.

8
00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.270
Would the company get well they could get a Class B address but that's an awful waste of a lot of addresses.

9
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.610
About sixty five thousand addresses are available in a class B subnet.

10
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.500
But in this example the company only needs 3000 host addresses.

11
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:19.140
They could get multiple class C networks but that means that they going to be allocated many Class C

12
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.720
addresses which has a negative effect on Internet routing tables.

13
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.310
Now rather than doing that we can move the subnet mask insider.

14
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.320
Notice in Class A B and C addresses the subnet mask is set on the Octet boundary.

15
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:45.030
Notice in Class A B and C addresses the subnet mask is set on the Octet boundary plus a first 8 bits.

16
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.760
Class B first 16 bits.

17
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.600
Class C first 24 bits.

18
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.780
But rather than doing that with CIDA the subnet mosque can be somewhere in the middle.

19
00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.740
It doesn't have to be on the test boundary.

20
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.580
Here's another example.

21
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:14.760
In this example we've got a subnet mask of 255 dot 2 2 4 0 0 2 4 5 in binary is 8 binary ones 2 to 4

22
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.140
is 3 binary ones followed by 5 binary zeros.

23
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:29.760
So if we count the number of binary ones that gives us 11 so 255 2 2 4 2 0 0 0 is the same as Slash

24
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:36.930
eleven the network portion is on the left hand side the host portion is on the right hand side.

25
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:45.870
But notice once again that the divider between network and host is not on the Octet boundary it's somewhere

26
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.710
within this octet.

27
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:54.690
So in this example the most significant three bits of that octet are network and the remaining portion

28
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.830
of the octet is host.

29
00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.090
Now in the subheading videos I'm going to show you this in a lot more detail.

30
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.710
We're going to work out various types of sub netting.

31
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:11.250
What I need you to understand with regards to cider at this point is that cider allows us to implement

32
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:20.190
a variable length subnet masks no longer do we have plus a b and c networks where class A is always

33
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.220
slash 8.

34
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:30.150
Class B is always slash 16 and Class C is always slash 24 when cider is used.

35
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.900
The mosques can vary and that's what we use today.

36
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.540
So from 1993 cider is more preferable than classical network mosques.

37
00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:48.210
Now once again in the subheading videos I'm going to discuss subletting in a lot more detail so please

38
00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:54.990
refer to those videos if you want to learn more about how to subnet a network or how to work out the

39
00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:02.190
maximum hosts that can be supported on a subnet or which addresses the first address or lost address

40
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.810
or what is the broadcast address and so forth for a specific subnet.
