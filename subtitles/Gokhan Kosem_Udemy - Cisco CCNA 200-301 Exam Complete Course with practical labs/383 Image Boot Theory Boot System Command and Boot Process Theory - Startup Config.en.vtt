00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.430
When a rocket boots up it's so just for Siska iris image in a specific sequence.

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:12.990
It will search for the Cisco IOS based on what's configured in the configuration register whether there's

3
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.940
a Iowas in Flash.

4
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.410
If a TFT server is available or it will use run monitor.

5
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.290
So when the router boots up the first thing it checks is the configuration register boot field.

6
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:33.360
If the boot field is set to zero in hexadecimal it will load run monitor remember the configuration

7
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.560
registers 16 binary bytes.

8
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:43.610
By default it would be 0 x 2 1 0 to the last hexadecimal value specifies the boot field.

9
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.560
So if that's set to 0 it will go into run monitor mode if it's set to a greater.

10
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.590
In other words two three four five six seven eight and so forth up to f it will check for Buddh commands

11
00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.670
and load the Cisco Iowa image as specified in the boot command if no boot command is being configured

12
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.920
it will boot an image in Flash.

13
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.250
And typically it will boot the first Iowas image found in Flash.

14
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.670
Unless you specify a boot command telling it to boot off a different operating system if no files are

15
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.380
available in flash it will look for an Iowa image on a TV B server so it'll try and load a Cisco iris

16
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:35.210
image from A to B server but if none is available then it will load Romont after the Strada.

17
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:43.320
It has multiple files in flash so it has this operating system and this operating system in Flash.

18
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.820
Notice the difference in the name.

19
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:54.240
The one that was loaded is the one with underscore two in the name that was loaded from flash.

20
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.910
The reason why that operating system was loaded is the configuration register set to the default.

21
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:08.640
So the boot field is set to two but in the running configuration there is a boot command telling the

22
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.230
router to boot from that second operating system.

23
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:23.110
So the two files in flash this one and this one put the router was configured to boot off the second

24
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.940
image has the full show run command.

25
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.360
Notice she has the command in the running config telling the Rodda which image to boot from.

26
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.240
So show version shows that image was loaded by the router on this router.

27
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.280
However there are no boot commands.

28
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:43.770
So show run pipe.

29
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:51.580
Include boot doesn't show any boot commands specifying that the Rodda should boot from some other operating

30
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.240
system.

31
00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:02.950
Short version shows which operating system was loaded and we can see that the configuration registers

32
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.110
using the default value.

33
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.210
So the router loaded the first operating system that it found in Flash.

34
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.380
In other words the operating system.

35
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:24.710
So you can specify with boot commands which operating system should be loaded by the router but by default

36
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.630
it will simply use the first operating system found in Flash.

37
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.040
Unless you override that with the boot system command.

38
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:42.900
You could as an example specify that it boot from a TFT server or server as an example.

39
00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.390
So how do Cisco routers load highway configuration files when the operating system is loaded and started

40
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.550
the rot it needs to be configured with IP addresses and other valleys to make it of any use.

41
00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.980
So it will typically look for the startup config in NV RAM.

42
00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:08.340
If there's no startup config and nv ram it will either begin or to install or enter the setup utility.

43
00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.130
So when the router boots up it looks for a startup config and nv ram.

44
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.470
If it exists it will load that startup config.

45
00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:23.180
If there's no startup config it looks for an active link to another router and then tries to load a

46
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.200
configuration from a TFT server using a protocol called slop.

47
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.360
If that doesn't work it will prompt for the initial configuration dialog.
