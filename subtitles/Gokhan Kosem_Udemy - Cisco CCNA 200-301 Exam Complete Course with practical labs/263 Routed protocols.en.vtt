00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So routed protocols include IPv4 and IPv6

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
these protocols are independent of each other

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and to illustrate that let's look at a simple topology.

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So here’s a question for you; Are these routers able to ping each other?

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And the answer is yes and no

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
there’s a  problem in the IPv4 addressing structure in this topology.

7
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.000
These 2 interfaces have IP addresses of 10.1.2.1/24 and 10.1.4.2/24

8
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
they are in different subnets but have been configured on the same link.

9
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So router 1 and router 2 will not be able to ping each other using IPv4

10
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
however, IPv6 has been correctly configured

11
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
so these 2 addresses are in the same subnet

12
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and router 1 and router 2 will be able to ping each other using IPv6.

13
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The point is what 1 routed protocol does is totally independent and separate

14
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.000
from another routed protocol, routed protocols such as IPv4 and IPv6

15
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.000
act and work independently of each other and use different routing protocols

16
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
In the networking world, this is often called ships in the night

17
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
in other words, what 1 ship in the night is doing is different

18
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
to what another ship in a night is doing.

19
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
A routed protocols are independent of each other and do not rely on one another.

20
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Routed protocols used different routing protocols

21
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
as an example, OSPF v2 is a routing protocol used in IPv4

22
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000
OSPF v3 is routing protocol used in IPv6

23
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Different routed protocols used different routing protocols

24
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and they act independently of each other.

25
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Even if 1 routed protocol is broken other routed protocols may still function.
