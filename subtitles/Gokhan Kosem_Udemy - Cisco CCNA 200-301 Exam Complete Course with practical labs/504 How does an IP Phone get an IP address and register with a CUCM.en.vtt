00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.770
Welcome back.

2
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.630
This is part two of our discussion on the Cisco IP phone startup process.

3
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.580
Previously we looked at how an IP phone obtains power how it learns its real information using CTP what

4
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.950
level DP How are we going to continue the discussion by looking at how an IP phone acquires an IP address

5
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.650
how it downloads its foemen configuration and how it registers with the CCN.

6
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.440
We'll also discuss the two signalling protocols of skinny and set.

7
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:48.280
Now once the phone has obtained power routed and received its Villon information by CGP you LLB It then

8
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:55.070
requires an IP address you could manually configure an IP address on a Cisco might be fun.

9
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.990
That's fine when you only have two or three phones.

10
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.730
But if you have a deployment of several thousand phones it's very unlikely that you want to configure

11
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.480
the IP addresses manually.

12
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.120
So a more common method of allocating IP addresses in the real world is to use a DHP server.

13
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:19.970
So in this example the phone is on The Voice Fillon the PCs on the data villain and you've configured

14
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:27.650
ADHD the server with a scope for both the data plan and the voice the land and you've set up a layer

15
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.990
3 switch to forward DHP requests to the DHP server.

16
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:41.030
Otherwise you could configure a DHB server on the voice villaine or on the switch or other networking

17
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.790
device.

18
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.430
Not a lot of VOIP deployments the DHP server is configured on the layer 3 switch so that when the phone

19
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.550
sends out a broadcast requesting an IP address it receives directly from the switch.

20
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.980
However you could run the DHP server on a Cisco Unified Communications Manager.

21
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.630
That's not generally recommended.

22
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:11.470
You would only run the DHP service on the C UCM if you had less than 1000 phones in your topology in

23
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.360
a Cisco IP phone environment.

24
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.720
It's very important that you configure the following options on the DHP server.

25
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.320
So you need to configure the network a mosque for the voice Villon.

26
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.190
So what subnet are they on the phones on.

27
00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.920
And what mosque are they going to use.

28
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.070
You're going to specify option 3 commonly known as default router or default gateway.

29
00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:42.270
And then you need to specify option 150 which specifies the IP address of the TFT server.

30
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.560
The phones need to get that configuration and updated firmware from a TFT server.

31
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.600
So option 150 is critical.

32
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:57.720
So once the DHP request has been received the DHP server will send a DHP offer back to the phone and

33
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.840
that offer will contain these parameters.

34
00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:08.960
Now once again the Unified Communications Manager can be configured to act as a DHP server for up to

35
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.830
1000 phones.

36
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.730
This is not recommended because only one DHP server can be configured per cluster.

37
00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.660
In other words it's a standalone DHP server with no backup.

38
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.450
The service would normally be run on the publisher multiple subnets can be configured on the DHB server

39
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:33.940
but it's generally not recommended to do this because of the issue of no redundancy and lack of scalability.

40
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:40.450
So it's better to use an external DHP server running on a rod or a switch or on a Windows server or

41
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.120
a Linux server.

42
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.880
In other words use an external DHB server rather than the C UCM.

43
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:56.060
I'd like to show you however how to set up DHC on the Cecka Unified Communications Manager.

44
00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:04.260
What you need to do is open up a browser and point it to HDD POS Karlen Forte's Lesch forward slash

45
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.690
the address of your Unified Communications Manager Ford slash CCMA service.

46
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:19.220
Now because the see UCM is using a self-signed certificate your browser won't recognize the certificate.

47
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:24.610
So you've got to click Continue to this Web site to accept the certificate.

48
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:31.470
The only issue you need to be aware of is that the self-signed certificate is not recognized by operating

49
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.750
system and Internet Explorer or Firefox.

50
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.890
You've just gotta make sure that the server you're connecting to is the correct server so the server

51
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.460
that you think you are connecting to is the correct CCMA server.

52
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.080
Notice on the top right inside there are various menu options and will cover a lot of this during the

53
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:58.670
course we are currently on the serviceability menu which allows us for instance to start and stop services.

54
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:09.880
You need to log in with your username and password.

55
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.960
I'll just increase the size of the browser window here.

56
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.250
You need to go to Tools service activation.

57
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.020
We are going to activate the DHP service

58
00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:30.800
and you can see a list of services the service that we need to activate is the Cisco DHP monitor service.

59
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.380
I'll discuss the various services in more detail later in this course.

60
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:41.210
But notice for instance there's the Cisco co-manager service the Cisco TFT service and so forth and

61
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:51.210
so on that you need to click save the sea UCM will warn you that activating and deactivating services

62
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.240
can take a while to just click OK.

63
00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.250
You just need to wait for the page to refresh.

64
00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.040
And it'll be a confirmation that the service is activated.

65
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:11.110
OK the update operation was successful to check if the service is running we can go to Tools control

66
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.840
same to feature services

67
00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.740
and in the list of services

68
00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:30.210
we can see that the Cisco DHB monitor service has started and it has been activated.

69
00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:38.760
So getting to the top of the page I can select the Cisco unified CME administration option and click

70
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:39.720
go.

71
00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:46.420
This will take me to the administration pages of see UCM.

72
00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:54.480
I just want to point out the role notice notices HTP is colon Ford slash Ford slash ten to one one.

73
00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:59.630
In other words the IP address of you see UCM Ford slash caesium Edman.

74
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.550
This is a famous year old to remember.

75
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:10.980
See UCM is the administration pages of the Siska unified communications manager or call manager or whatever

76
00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:11.990
you prefer to call it

77
00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.010
going to the system menu.

78
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:27.390
I can choose the option the HGP the HGP server.

79
00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:35.610
There is no default the HGP server just to show you that I can click find and you'll notice Yeates is

80
00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.410
zero records found.

81
00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:43.530
So let's click at me.

82
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:48.110
I choose the IP address of must see UCM.

83
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.520
So that's the server that I'm going to configure the HGP on.

84
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:58.010
I can then specify a primary DNS server so whatever the IP addresses of my DNS server

85
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:06.200
it's a primary and secondary DNS service can be configured.

86
00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:09.310
I can specify the primary TFT server.

87
00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:10.600
Now this is very important.

88
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:18.640
Remember option 150 is required for the phones to get their configuration and firmware so this will

89
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:24.200
be the IP address of my see UCM server or comms manager server.

90
00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:30.600
There are various other options that I can specify here like the IP address least time and so forth.

91
00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.370
Which just going to leave all of those default values and click save

92
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:42.920
so I've specified information like my DNS server and my TFT server.

93
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:50.600
Now going to system the HGP DHC subnet I can create various subnets

94
00:08:53.770 --> 00:09:02.050
I'm going to click add what you're doing here is essentially creating scope's or sublets for devices

95
00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:06.870
on different villans or subnets within your organization.

96
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:10.690
Once again I can select my DHP server.

97
00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.470
I can now specify the subnet.

98
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:21.150
So for instance attained or to or 2.0 specify the starting IP address to allocate to my phone's chain

99
00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:26.190
door to door to door 1 and IP address.

100
00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:32.590
So these are just values that specify the IP addresses to give to the phones.

101
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:39.730
I can specify my Rafter's IP address 10 door to door to the 101.

102
00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:49.400
I can specify my 78 MOS 255 255 260 5.0 I could specify my domain name.

103
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:52.490
Once again I could specify in my TFT server

104
00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:06.110
notice it's the same IP address as the IP address of my DHP server because both the TFT server and the

105
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:10.030
DHP server running on my C UCM server.

106
00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:16.780
Once again I could specify various other options including the lease time for this scope or the specific

107
00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:17.920
subnet.

108
00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:23.380
I could then click save.

109
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:30.100
That's how you configure DHC on CCN in a separate section of course.

110
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.660
I'm going to show you how to set up.

111
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.640
See you see me with DHP.

112
00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:38.400
In other words configuring the sheepy on a router.

113
00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:44.720
Once the phones have received an IP address the phones will attempt to download the firmware and configuration

114
00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.290
from a TFT server.

115
00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:55.020
Phones get updated from way and the phone configuration from the TFT server running on the CCN the Cisco

116
00:10:55.020 --> 00:11:03.090
TFT P service Boll's configuration files and SUSE imbedded component executable ring of files and device

117
00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:07.050
configuration files to the phones.

118
00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:13.350
So when the phone connects to the TFT server it's going to attempt to download a device specific configuration

119
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:14.610
file.

120
00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:20.400
In other words a phone with a Mac address quadrupole a quadruple B quadruple C will attempt to download

121
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:25.070
a file starting with ECP which once again just stands for Celsius.

122
00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:29.300
Ethan at phone with its MAC address dot CNF dot.

123
00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:37.400
Example that configuration file is built automatically on the C UCM when you add that phone to the C

124
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.970
UCM configuration.

125
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:46.380
If the phone is not being created on the communications manager or see UCM the phone will attempt to

126
00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.210
download a file.

127
00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:51.480
Default dot CNF dot X amount.

128
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:56.650
This is a configuration file that contains basic settings like the firmware.

129
00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:02.160
The phone should be using and the communications manager that the phone should be communicating with.

130
00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:10.860
So it points to the C UCM server and provides details like the IP address of the UCM and the port number

131
00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:14.720
the phone should be using when communicating to the CC.

132
00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:22.600
It can also contain other information like location information and your roles for phone buttons to

133
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:27.240
configure TFT P on the sea you see and you need to do the following.

134
00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:38.320
On the navigation pages go to the serviceability menu so select serviceability and then click go.

135
00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:47.920
You could also go directly to HGT P.S. IP address of the CC and forward slash CCMA service under the

136
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:48.950
Tools menu.

137
00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:56.580
We're going to select service activation once again under the service as you'll notice Cisco TFT.

138
00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:03.150
So we'll select that and then save we once again warned about activating and deactivating services and

139
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:04.480
we'll just click OK.

140
00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:10.510
And the update operation has been successful.

141
00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:15.270
Notice the Cisco TFT service is activated.

142
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:20.080
That's all there is to configuring TFT P on the C UCM server.

143
00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:28.040
Once the phone has downloaded it's configuration and updated its firmware it will attempt to communicate

144
00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:36.890
with the UCM two important court numbers that you need to remember or RTC Peapod 2000 used by skinny

145
00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:43.600
plan control protocol or skinny and TZP port 50 60 used by Sepp.

146
00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:49.740
The two signalling protocols used on handsets in Cisco environments are skinny or.

147
00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:55.430
So the phones will now try to connect to the C UCM and register.

148
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:58.630
These are default code numbers and can be changed.

149
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:03.810
To change them on the UCM you would do the following.

150
00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:13.550
Under the navigation menu you would go to Cisco unified CMA administration click go under the system

151
00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:14.350
menu.

152
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:18.170
You can go to the option Siska unified C.M.

153
00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:23.410
and then notice this option find

154
00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:34.770
you can see in this example we have one see UCM someone to click on that option and scrolling down to

155
00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:36.030
the bottom.

156
00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:40.830
You'll notice you have options here for the TZP port settings for the server.

157
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:43.530
The first one is isn't it phone port.

158
00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:46.600
In other words skinny which is port 2000.

159
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:55.020
Then we have in GCP listen board in MGC beekeeper lives in GCP is typically used on Gateway's rather

160
00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:59.720
than phones that you could change the port members used over here.

161
00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:02.980
Yes the port used by Sep 50 60.

162
00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:07.900
And if you want to use a clear set the port number by default is 50 61.

163
00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:15.230
You can change the port numbers just by changing the options in the slowest now skinny call Control

164
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:23.370
Protocol or a CCP commonly known as skinny is a Cisco proprietary terminal control protocol.

165
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:30.200
This is the first of two protocols used for signaling and control of Cisco IP phones.

166
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:37.030
The second one is Sishen Initiation Protocol or the recommended protocol but implementation of Cisco

167
00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:44.590
IP phones has for many years been skinny that is changing these days as more features are added to.

168
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.140
But for now understand that skinny is a proprietary protocol.

169
00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:51.160
It's a stimulus protocol for every event.

170
00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:58.880
The device sends a message to the UCM the phones themselves are clients to the Unified Communications

171
00:15:58.880 --> 00:15:59.570
Manager.

172
00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:07.680
They can not even provide Darlton without the C UCM telling them to provide to that dial tone.

173
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:14.120
It's proprietary which has the advantage of quick additions and changes but disadvantage of not being

174
00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.490
interoperable with other vendors.

175
00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:22.370
Once again that's a client server architecture where the C UCM is in control of the IP phones.

176
00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:28.840
It allows for a simple configuration where the phones themselves have no configuration but get the entire

177
00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:35.570
configuration from the C UCM the C UCM maintains the dull plan and route patterns.

178
00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:41.570
In other words it maintains all the information for the phones the phones themselves can do nothing

179
00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.310
without the sea UCM telling them what to do.

180
00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:54.060
So for example if we had a situation like this with IP phone 1000 IP phone 1001 connected to a switch

181
00:16:54.120 --> 00:17:02.370
physically but registered with the Cisco Communications Manager these phones are totally under the control

182
00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:10.660
of the UCM if one falls and when off hook the phone would send the skinny message to the CM saying I'm

183
00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:11.240
off work.

184
00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:12.640
What must I do.

185
00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:17.880
And the C UCM would send a message to the phone saying play dull tone.

186
00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:22.990
It's important to notice that adult time does not come from the C UCM like it would in a traditional

187
00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:23.950
environment.

188
00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:32.340
The dull tone is played locally from the phone if the phone dulled a digit digit one that would be sent

189
00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:40.700
to the UCM the comms manager would process that message and send a message back saying stop Dalton.

190
00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:43.510
Now there are a lot of other messages taking place in the background.

191
00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:47.270
But I just want to show you a high level overview of the process.

192
00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:49.920
Subsequent digits the same thing would happen.

193
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:56.170
The phone would send a message to the comms manager and the comms manager would send messages back.

194
00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:03.750
For example when your dollar digit let's say digit 1 that digit displays on your phone because a message

195
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:09.510
is being sent to the comms manager and a message is being sent back again saying display this digit

196
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:16.150
on the phone once 1000 has dialed digits 1 0 0 1.

197
00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:21.590
The comms manager can match those digits to a phone that's currently registered.

198
00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:27.980
In other words this handset the comms manager has a record of all phones that are currently available

199
00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:29.590
and registered.

200
00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:35.680
So the comms manager will send a skinny message to the phone telling it to ring.

201
00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:40.210
It'll also tell the phone to make its lamp flash.

202
00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:46.640
Other messages that are sent to the phone are to change the display so that one thousand one can see

203
00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:51.480
that the call is coming from 1000 when the user answers the call.

204
00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:57.460
A skinny message is sent back to the comms manager telling the comms manager that the phone is now off

205
00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:58.270
work.

206
00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:04.460
The comms manager will send a message back to the phone telling it to stop ringing telling it to stop

207
00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:09.790
flashing its lamp telling it to change its display and so forth and so on.

208
00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:15.710
The moral of the story is that these two phones can do nothing without the comms manager telling them

209
00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:16.750
what to do.

210
00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:26.030
They are clients to the server the UCM will then send messages to both phones telling the phones to

211
00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:29.990
set up an RTP stream to each other.

212
00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:37.010
It's important to remember that the RTP streams are direct between the two phones so there's a separate

213
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:44.600
RTP stream from one thousand two one thousand one and a nother separate unique directional RTP stream

214
00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:55.240
from 1001 to 1000 the RTP streams do not flow via the CCN they are direct between the two handsets.

215
00:19:55.250 --> 00:20:00.590
Obviously physically they are flowing through the switch but logically they are going directly to one

216
00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:01.160
another.

217
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:07.360
So the comms manager communicates with both phones telling them about each other.

218
00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:14.670
Because phone 1000 needs to know the IP address of one thousand ones so that it can stream the RTP to

219
00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:21.550
the right IP address 1000 or so needs to know the port number that 1001 is using.

220
00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:28.260
So it can stream to the right port number and by the same token one thousand one needs to know the IP

221
00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:31.250
address and port number that 1000 is using.

222
00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:37.830
So skinny messages are used by the C UCM to communicate that information to the handsets.

223
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:43.650
But once the call is established the C UCM is no longer involved in the conversation.

224
00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:52.090
The two devices are communicating directly with each other without any interaction from the C UCM now

225
00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:59.400
session initiation protocol or surp is an open standard unlike skinny which is proprietary.

226
00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:05.940
It's a peer to peer protocol unlike skinny which is client server but be away please.

227
00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:10.530
That set supported basic functionality and the open standards.

228
00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:17.550
But to get feature parity with skinny Cyp has been extended by Cisco to provide the functionality.

229
00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:22.890
So even though Cyp has an open standard it is extended by vendors to provide features.

230
00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:30.810
So don't expect to be able to go and buy a cheap soop handset from your local retailer and connected

231
00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:37.590
to a Cisco call manager or express environment and have the same features as Cisco phones.

232
00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:38.720
That's not going to happen.

233
00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:44.280
You're going to be able to make and receive calls and have basic functionality but don't expect the

234
00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:47.960
same features as what you'll get on a Cisco handset.

235
00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:52.260
A peer to peer protocol isn't a great idea when you have 10000 phones.

236
00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:58.650
So in Cyp we have a concept of a proxy server which as an analogy controls the call between the two

237
00:21:58.650 --> 00:21:59.960
phones.

238
00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:06.330
Please note this is not a pure client server environment like you have been skinny certain processing

239
00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:13.500
can be done by the local handset with most of the processing done by the CCMA whereas in skinny wool

240
00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:20.220
processing is done on the caesium sip is becoming more and more popular and over the last few years

241
00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:26.040
Cisco has been investing more and more in the features and functionality of base phones.

242
00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:29.720
One of the great things that you get with this presence.

243
00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:35.760
Also provides interoperability with other vendors and is the protocol of choice for interoperability

244
00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:45.050
between vendors once registered with the see UCM the phones will download the soft key templates.

245
00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:49.970
We'll be talking more about the softkey template later but essentially that is the layout of some of

246
00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:51.300
the buttons on the phone.

247
00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:57.350
That concludes our discussion of the Cisco IP phone start a process.

248
00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:00.070
We looked at how an IP phone obtains power.

249
00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:04.820
We discuss different methods of provisioning power to an IP filing.

250
00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:11.680
We looked at how an IP phone obtains the information IP addressing configuration and firmware and how

251
00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.950
it registers with the C UCM.

252
00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:22.090
We also discussed the two signalling protocols that can be used by Cisco IP phones skinny and Cyp thank

253
00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:22.750
you for watching.
