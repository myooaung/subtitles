00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Switches are very similar to bridges as they both resides at layer 2

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
or the data link layer of the OSI model.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The big advantage of switching when compared to bridging is that processing

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
can be done in hardware using what are called ASICs

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
or Application Specific Integrated Circuits.

6
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The number of ports supported by switches is also a lot higher

7
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
hundreds of ports are supported on certain switches.

8
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Whereas with bridges you were limited to a few ports.

9
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Switches are able to do this because processing is done in hardware and in actual fact

10
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
these days processing is done at wire speed which means that there is no degradation of

11
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
performance between 2 devices when they are connected via a switch in other words

12
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
switches can move traffic from one port to another port at the same speed

13
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
as if they went there, they can process and switch frames from one port to another port

14
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
without slowing the frame down.

15
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So here’s a quick comparison between switches and bridges

16
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Switches processed in hardware using ASICs.

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Bridges process in software and are therefore a lot slower

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
switches support many ports, bridges are limited in the number of ports

19
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
that they support, bridges have been replaced by switches in today’s network.
