00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:07.340
Now something that may be a stumbling block for you and often trips up engineers when they first start

2
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.260
out he's lugging when they tell that to a Rodda.

3
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.650
So in this example I'm going to connect to the Rodda

4
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:30.970
from my local Windows PC so I'm going to connect the router to the outside world and I'm just going

5
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:42.630
to use my Local Area Connection Card to connect to Jena's three to the outside world.

6
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.830
And then what I'll do is connect the router to the cloud

7
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:55.850
so on rather one interface if a zero slash one.

8
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.340
This is the interface connected to the outside world.

9
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:08.320
I'm going to shut the interface and type IP address DHC so that the router gets an IP address via a

10
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.520
DHV.

11
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:17.770
So hopefully I should see a message stating that an address has been allocated in this case she can

12
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:28.270
see that an address level 6 in slog which is an informational message shows me that an address has been

13
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.490
assigned to the Rogers is interface with this IP address.

14
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:44.200
So in Windows I'll tell that to the Rodda who told that I need a password.

15
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:54.740
Line Viti 0 4 luggin password Cisco enable Posawatz Cisco.

16
00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:04.010
Obviously in the real world you'll use a better password than that but that's fine for our demonstration.

17
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.320
So show logging.

18
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:16.930
Now according to this I have debugging a level of monitoring on a monitor.

19
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.680
So let's check the debugging showed debug.

20
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.120
This is on the console.

21
00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.710
You can see OSPF adjacency events.

22
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:37.600
Debugging is enabled so let's see if we get any output on our telnet session I'll shut down the interface

23
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:48.470
on Rodda to and then enable it so notice I'm getting debugs on the console but nothing is displayed

24
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.570
on the telnet session.

25
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.300
Lots of debugging on the console.

26
00:02:53.300 --> 00:03:03.400
Nothing on the telnet session and that's because you have to type terminal monitor or turn Mon so term

27
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.520
monitor for terminal monitor or month for short.

28
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.510
Any one of those options will do.

29
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:21.920
So let's try now shut the interface and write it to No shutout and notice suddenly I'm seeing debugging

30
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:30.200
messages on both the console as well as the telnet session.

31
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:37.480
So don't forget that you can set logging on I'll do that through the console.

32
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:46.770
You can set the logging for a monitor line but by default the output is not displayed on your telnet

33
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:47.630
session.

34
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.270
You must type terminal monitor.

35
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.770
You don't have to do that on a console.

36
00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:03.110
So to foretop terminal monitor notice I'm told that the console already monitors.

37
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.850
You don't have to enable terminal monitor on the console.

38
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:14.120
By default debugging and syslog messages will be displayed on the console but that won't be displayed

39
00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.710
on a telnet to line.

40
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:25.470
So as an example if I press controls Zahed control Z on the terminal so the Viti y line I see output.

41
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.260
But if I type term no monitor and do that again.

42
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.410
Controls to control Z.

43
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.070
I don't see anything on the terminal line.

44
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:44.740
It's a term one very important to remember that allows you to see debugging messages and console messages

45
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.180
so slug messages on the Viti one line.

46
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.140
It's not there by default.
