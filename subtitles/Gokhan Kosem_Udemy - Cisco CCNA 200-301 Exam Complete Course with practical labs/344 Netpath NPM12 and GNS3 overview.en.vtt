00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:07.770
In this example I've got NPM connected to four routers which in turn are connected to my local area

2
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.110
network.

3
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:15.680
That means that my virtual Jeana's three network is connected to my physical network.

4
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:23.730
This allows me to use NPM running within VM way connected to my GI and has three routers to monitor

5
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.020
links on the Internet.

6
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:34.320
So this example on monitoring traffic from our local network in the UK through British Telecom to sales

7
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.930
force dot com.

8
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:45.060
So it's possible to get NPM to connect to Jeana's 3 network but also Bridgitte to the outside world

9
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.690
so that you can integrate Jinnah's three with physical networks and connect to the Internet.
