00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.490
Now we've been told to configure of one with the lost IP address in the that subnet.

2
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:19.640
Now this is the subnet that we concentrating on initially so let's start with that subnet.

3
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.970
The way you work out first.

4
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.430
Lost and broadcast addresses as follows.

5
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:32.310
The network has the host portion populated with binary zeros.

6
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.470
So notice whose portion is all zeros.

7
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:43.590
The first host has the host portion populated with binary zeros except for the lost but which is set

8
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.300
to a one in binary.

9
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:53.910
So that's the first host in the subnet The Lost host in the subnet as the host portion populated with

10
00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:02.310
binary ones except for the lost but which is set to binary 0 and I'll show you in a moment what that

11
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.970
is but it's easier to work out the broadcast address first.

12
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.500
So the broadcast address equals that subnet

13
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.690
and the host portion is populated with binary ones.

14
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.190
So it's 1 1 followed by 4 ones.

15
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.510
Now you can work this out by saying 32 plus 16 plus eight plus four plus two plus one.

16
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:39.040
But I find it easier to do the following if this is set to 1 and everything else is set to zeros so

17
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:48.130
it looks like this that equals 64 one less than that equals 63.

18
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.060
So if you asked for something like this what is the broadcast address.

19
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:59.190
Have a look at the next subnet and subtract one to get to the broadcast address of the previous subnet.

20
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.460
The next subnet is 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 64.

21
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.980
The broadcast address of the previous subnet is that subnet minus 1.

22
00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:13.320
So in other words it's 63 and then this is 62.

23
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:21.750
So for this subnet that's the network and first host This is the lost and broadcast address.

24
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:32.440
Second lost which we need for this switch is essentially one less than that can work out the binary

25
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.670
but it may be easier just to subtract one from the decimal.

26
00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.200
So that's 61.

27
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.890
And the third lost is one less than that which is 60

28
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.770
so we now know the network the first host the broadcast the lost host.

29
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.420
Second lost host and third lost host.

30
00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:01.650
Easiest way to work this out is to work out to the network and then work out the next network one less

31
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:08.730
than the next network gives you the broadcast address for the current subnet and then you can just subtract

32
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.880
one from that to get to the lost host.

33
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:18.330
Second lost host and third lost host first host is equal to the network portion plus 1.

34
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.340
So they are our values.

35
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.590
That means we can now configure this router with the lost IP address in the subnet.

36
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:34.350
So currently on this router it only has a loop back interface configured it it doesn't have an IP address

37
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.400
configured on gigabit.

38
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.700
0 0 0.

39
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:48.570
Remember the network 1 9 2 1 6 8 1.0 slash 26 has two bits that are part of the network portion two

40
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:49.830
binary bits.

41
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.350
Looks like that which equals 192.

42
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.270
So we can configure the gigabit.

43
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:09.610
0 0 0 interface with an IP address of 1 8 2 1 6 8 1 62 because that's the last IP address in the subnet.

44
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.940
So 62 and the mask is 2 4 5 2 4 5 2 4 5 1 92.

45
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.650
And that's because these two bits are part of the network.

46
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:28.710
So we've got 255 255 255 two bits there which equates to 192.

47
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:36.220
So show IP interface brief we can now paying our local IP address.

48
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.530
The switch needs to be configured with the second a lost IP address in the subnet.

49
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:47.770
Per these instructions so configure the switches with the second lost IP address and then the DHB servers

50
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.440
with the third lost IP address.

51
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.440
So again he has I'll switch

52
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.050
I'll give it a name.

53
00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:09.880
Switch one interface of Ilan one no shut IP address 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 and the next IP address that we can

54
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:16.200
use is 60 1 2 4 5 2 4 5 2 4 5 1 92.

55
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:27.940
So show IP interface brief that's the IP address of the switch can the switch now ping the router yes

56
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:34.450
it can switch has been successfully configured router has been successfully configured let's configure

57
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:42.340
the DHB server so on the Ethernet interface we going to configure a static IP address of 1 9 2 1 6 8

58
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:50.740
1 and the IP address will be 60 in this example third lost IP address subnet Moscow will be 2 4 5 2

59
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.900
4 5 2 4 5 1 92.

60
00:05:52.990 --> 00:06:03.250
Now the default gateway will be the router 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 and the Rada once again has IP address 62 so

61
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:13.240
62 DNS server and this example will be 8 today to today to date this is the internet DNS server it's

62
00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:22.700
configured with DNS names for Cisco dot com and Facebook dot com so the server has been configured.

63
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.610
Can we ping the switch.

64
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:26.810
Yes we can.

65
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:27.950
What about the router.

66
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.130
Yes we can.

67
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:37.820
So we've configured IP addresses and default gateways on the network devices.

68
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.980
Now one thing I still need to do on the switch is specify a default gateway which will be the router

69
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.360
Rod it has IP address 62

70
00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:59.470
so again the switch can ping the router we've finished configuring the switch now on the DHB server

71
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:09.640
we need to configure a DHB pool default gateway is going to be the router 62 DNS server is going to

72
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:18.160
be the Google DNS server and we can allocate IP addresses from 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 2 1.

73
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:24.080
So from the first ip address in the subnet to a number that we decide.

74
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:30.790
So we could as an example allocate 100 IP addresses so I'll save that.

75
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:38.330
So we've specified the pull name default gateway DNS server starting IP address in the pool and the

76
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:44.610
number of IP addresses that can be allocated now can I specify a hundred hosted addresses the answer

77
00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:53.400
is no I should actually specify only something like 50 because of the subnet only supports 62 IP addresses

78
00:07:54.270 --> 00:08:00.930
so remember the formula 2 to the power of something which is the number of but minus 2 gives you the

79
00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:04.230
number of hosts that are supported in a subnet.

80
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:07.030
Yeah we've got six binary bits.

81
00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:09.180
So two to the power of six.

82
00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:15.380
That's the number of bits in the WHO's portion what's two to the power of six two to the power four

83
00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:19.880
is sixteen two to the power of five equals thirty two.

84
00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:31.970
Two to the power of six equals 64 so 64 minus two gives us sixty two hosts that are supported in a subnet

85
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:39.740
but we want to allocate some of those IP addresses to network devices so we don't want to allocate the

86
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:50.540
full submit to the DHB server we'll only allocate a portion of the addresses to hosts via DCP so on

87
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:59.870
P.S. One does the piece you have an IP address yes it does it's been allocated 1 on 2 1 6 8 1 dot 3

88
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:04.520
cannot ping the default gateway yes it can.

89
00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:14.570
P.S. 1 as an example IP config it's also been allocated an IP address 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 2 2 cannot ping

90
00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:21.370
its default gateway yes it can and on P.C. to do something similar.

91
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:31.790
IP address has been allocated and it can ping its a default gateway so we've successfully configured

92
00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.490
subnet 1.

93
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:40.520
Now we need to configure the serial link and then once I've done that I'll check whether these devices

94
00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.630
can access devices on the Internet and then I'll configure the other subnets.
