00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here’s my local PC

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
if I type ip config I can see my PCs IP address

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and I can see the default gateway

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
my PC will send traffic to the default gateway

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
for any IP addresses not in the 192.168.56.0  subnet.

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
so as an example, if I ping google.com

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that traffic is going via my default gateway

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
in the same way, I could telnet to a router.

9
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
here’s a Cisco router that I’ve got in my lab.

10
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And if I type the command sh ip route

11
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I can see the routing table of the router.

12
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The router has directly connected networks.

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So C is directly connected networks

14
00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:02.000
as an example 192.168.56.0/24 is directly connected on this interface F0/0

15
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:12.000
so if I ping 192.168.56.1 that traffic is going to be sent out F0/0

16
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
because that network is directly connected to this interface.

17
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Packets will traffic to 192.168.58.0 will be forwarded out of interface 0/1

18
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
notice this route S and * this is a candidate default route

19
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
in other words this static route is the default route that a router gonna use.

20
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
If I look at the running configuration of this router

21
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and then include only lines that have IP router in them.

22
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I can see this command was added to the router

23
00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:00.000
so I type IP router 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 and then 192.168.56.1

24
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
This portion is saying that we are adding a default route

25
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
to the IP routing table of the router

26
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
with the gateway of last resort being 192.168.56.1

27
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000
so basically this router will forward traffic to 192.168.56.1

28
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
for any networks not in it's routing table.

29
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
So once again sh ip route

30
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:34.000
shows me I have the 3 network 192.168.58, 192.68.56 192.168.97 in the routing table

31
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
but I don’t have as an example a route for google.com.

32
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Google’s IP address is 216.58.213.100 that’s not in the routing table

33
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.000
but I was able to ping that address because of this entry in the routing table.

34
00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:02.000
In other words, the local router forwarded traffic to 192.168.56.1

35
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
to firstly get to the DNS server 8.8.8.8

36
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and secondly, to ping Google.com we can see that by using the traceroute command.

37
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So let's trace route to Google.com

38
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.000
notice the first hop is 192.168.56.1 the local gateway of last resort

39
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.000
traffic is then sent out into the internet to get to google.com

40
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
so my traffic is being forwarded from router to router

41
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
until it gets to 216.58.213.100

42
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:48.000
this stars or * indicates that the router is not replying back

43
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
to the ICMP messages sent to it.

44
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
So ICMP maybe drop as an example

45
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
but the point to take note of is based on the IP routing table

46
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:07.000
on this router, the gateway of last resort or the default gateway is 192.168.56.1

47
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
this static route has been added to the routing table

48
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
and I could remove that by typing no ip route

49
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Selecting the route so now when I type sh ip route

50
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
notice the static route that was their previously has now been removed

51
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
so now if try and ping  google.com

52
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000
the DNS resolution is failing and we won't be able to ping google.com

53
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000
because we can't resolve the DNS name to IP address of Google.com

54
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
in this case, it's re-using the cache entry

55
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
and is sending traffic to 216.58.213.100

56
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
but notice the pings fail, we had a 0 success rate.

57
00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
If I add this static route back again

58
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
and type sh ip route static route is back

59
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and now when we ping Google.com the ping succeeds.

60
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
So static routes are still used quite heavily

61
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
especially on routers at remotes site or small sites.

62
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Here’s my router at home.

63
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
This is the 192.168.56.1 router

64
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
that’s my Cisco router had as it's default gateway

65
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and this router will also have a default gateway connecting it to the Internet.

66
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
So I'll log in if I look at the broadband connection

67
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
notice my local router has this IP address

68
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and the default gateway is set to the IP address, primary DNS and secondary DNS

69
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
are set to these values, so my home broadband router

70
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
or DSL router has its own default gateway.

71
00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:01.000
This Cisco router is forwarding traffic to the BTDSL router using this static route

72
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and the BT router is forwarding traffic to this default gateway.

73
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Every router makes its own decision on where to forward traffic to

74
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
hence following the hop by hop paradigm.
