00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In this video were going to continue looking at how data flows

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
in various network devices but specifically in this video we're gonna look at routers.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Routers are layer 3 devices, in other words they operate at the network layer

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
of the OSI model

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Routers do not make routing decisions based on MAC addresses

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
but rather use IP addresses when determining

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
out of which interface is traffic should be sent.

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Routers still use MAC addresses on Ethernet interfaces

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
but the decision making process of which interface traffic

10
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
should be transmitted out of, is made based on IP addresses rather than MAC addresses.

11
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
A router may have serial interfaces as well as Ethernet interfaces.

12
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
An Ethernet interface uses a MAC address for forwarding of traffic at layer 2.

13
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
but a serial interface using PPP doesn’t use MAC addresses.

14
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So when traffic arrives on 1 interface and the routers need to determine out of which

15
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
interface to forward the traffic that decision is made based on IP addresses

16
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
rather than MAC addresses.

17
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So in this topology once again rather than using full 48 bits MAC addresses.

18
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I’m going to represent a MAC address as a single character for readability

19
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and ease of use, so A is the MAC address of the first PC

20
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and it has an IP address of 10.1.1.1 we have a router with 2 interfaces.

21
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.000
F0/0 has an IP address of 10.1.1.100 and MAC addresses G.

22
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
F0/1 has an IP address of 10.1.2.100 and MAC addresses of H.

23
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
There are also some other PCs shown in the topology

24
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
with the relevant MAC addresses and IP addresses.

25
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
In this topology we're using a subnet mask of /24

26
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
which can also be written as 255.255.255.0

27
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
for simplicity in this topology both PC A and PC C

28
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
are connected to a hub which is connected to a router on F0/0.

29
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000
PC B and PC D are also connected to a hub which in turn is connected to the router

30
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
on F0/1 the router has therefore been configured

31
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
with an IP address in the same subnet as host A and host C

32
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:35.000
it's F0/1 interface is configured in the same subnet as B and D.

33
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
when you configured an IP address on a router or layer 3 switch

34
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
you configure the IP address with the mask.

35
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
So the router knows that a /24 mask has been used here

36
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
because it was configured as part of the IP address command

37
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
when the IP address was configured on an interface.

38
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
The router will therefore update it's routing table

39
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
to indicate that network 10.1.1.0/24

40
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
is directly connected to F0/0

41
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000
and network 10.1.2.0/24 is directly connected to F0/1.

42
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Routers don’t populate their routing tables using IP addresses

43
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
but rather populate the routing tables with network addresses.

44
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And they make their routing decision based on the network address

45
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
rather than individual IP addresses.

46
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
So the routers in this example are configured with IP addresses and the /24 mask.

47
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
So IP address 10.1.1.100 with the /24 mask

48
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
equates to a network of 10.1.1.0/24

49
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and that network is added to the routing table of the router.

50
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.000
in this example the routers knows that to get to network 10.1.1.0

51
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
traffic should be sent out of F0/0

52
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and to get to network 10.1.2.0

53
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
traffic should be sent out of interface F0/1.
