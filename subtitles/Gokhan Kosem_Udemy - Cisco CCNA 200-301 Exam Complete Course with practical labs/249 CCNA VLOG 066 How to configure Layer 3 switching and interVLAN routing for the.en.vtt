00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:17.490
One of the questions I've received is how to configure a layer 3 switch in Jinnah's 3 for this demonstration.

2
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:28.010
I'm going to use an Iowa V later to switch the Iowas Ivy League to sports both late to as well as Layer

3
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:38.680
3 switching what I'll do is use two routers as PCs and the topology these devices take a while to boot

4
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.980
up.

5
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:45.540
So I'll start them and open up console's to them as you can see on the output.

6
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.840
Here we've got Iowas the booting on the three devices.

7
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:58.980
What I'll do now is Connect the rods to the switch.

8
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.220
So at the moment we've got two Rajahs connected to this Leia's three switch.

9
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:17.710
The rod is in this example are acting as PCs so I'm simply going to use them to demonstrate villans

10
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.150
and layer 3 configuration on this layer 3 switch

11
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:36.730
the focus of this video will be the configuration of villans on the switch and the configuration of

12
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.660
interval and routing.

13
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:47.390
In other words getting the switch to act as a last three device so the switch is booted up show IP interface

14
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.530
brief.

15
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.590
There are various interfaces available on the switch.

16
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:58.480
Show villaine brief shows us that only the default villains exist on the switch.

17
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:07.490
So what I'll do is give the switch a name switch one and then I'll create two villains on the switch.

18
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:16.050
So show the LAN brief we've got the one the line two and violent 3.

19
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.840
Configured on the switch at the moment.

20
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:27.310
The road is booted so I'll bypass the initial config on those two routers acting as our PCs in the topology

21
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.870
unnoticed show interface you give it 00 switch port.

22
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.780
This port is in Villon one that's the default.

23
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.880
The same is true for the second port.

24
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:55.780
What we'll do however is configure gigabit 00 to be in violent too and gigabit.

25
00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:05.030
0 1 will be put into villaine 3 So now show interface gigabit 00 switch port.

26
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:18.960
Shows us that gigabit 0 0 is in V land to and gigabit to 0 1 is he's in learn three show IP route on

27
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.870
the switch.

28
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.770
Shows us that IP running is enabled.

29
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:31.890
If I disable IP routing and use the command show IP route notice the output is very different to when

30
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.890
IP routing is enabled.

31
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:42.360
Now in these Iowa Sivy late two switches IP writing is enabled by default but it's often not enabled

32
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:50.520
on real physical switches so we enable into line routing or layer free functionality we need to have

33
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.410
the IP routing Kamandi enabled on the switch.

34
00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:04.260
Show IP interface brief shows us the physical interfaces to enable in TV land routing between the villains

35
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:13.290
we need to configure IP addresses in the relevant villans on what are called switch virtual interfaces

36
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.600
or a Fiore's some Both are violent too.

37
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:24.350
And we learned three we need to configure IP addresses in the relevant subnet.

38
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:35.320
So show IP interface brief we can see that an IP address is configured on the land too and on the 3

39
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.930
I need to know shut those files.

40
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.300
So now show

41
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:56.620
IP interface brief we can see that those two Fiore's or Layer 3 interfaces for the villains are configured

42
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.360
and the eyes are up.

43
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.800
That's how you configure a switch for into the land routing and layer 3 functionality.

44
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:16.970
So on the router acting as a PC I can no shut the interface and give it an IP address in the villain

45
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.040
such as the following.

46
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:31.460
All disable IP routing on the router and configure an IP default gateway of 10 to 1 to 2 2 to 5 4.

47
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:41.430
So show IP route on the router shows us that IP riding's disabled can be paying the default gateway.

48
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.270
Yes we can on this side will do something similar.

49
00:05:45.480 --> 00:06:00.890
So confetti host rodder to interface could give 0 0 no Shutt IP address 10 1 3 1 2 4 5 2 4 5 2 4 5 0

50
00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:12.580
0 0 IP routing to disable routing and make this act like a PC IP default gateway 10 1 3 2 5 4 paying

51
00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:20.520
10 1 3 2 5 4 so Rodda two components default gateway.

52
00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:28.090
So what we should be able to do now is ping Rodda 2 from router 1 which we can and to prove that all

53
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:38.220
de-bug IP ICMP on the side and paying the router from Rodda to and you can see that the pings arrived

54
00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.320
and an echo reply was sent.

55
00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:50.410
So now if we disable IP writing on the last three switch what will happen is the pings no longer work

56
00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:58.810
because the switch is no longer acting as a layer 3 switch layer 3 capability has been disabled on the

57
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:07.270
switch enable IP rotting and rotting takes place and pings can be sent from one router to the other.

58
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:12.880
So rotted to gimping right a one and Rodda one can ping router too.

59
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:18.460
So that was a simple example of how to enable him to villaine rotting on a switch.

60
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.770
In other words make it act as a layer three switch.

61
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:27.860
