00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now let’s look at the RIP protocol in more detail and troubleshoots some issues.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
show ip protocols

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
shows me once again that RIP is running on this router

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
sending updates every 30 seconds

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
other timers on each of these routers are not synchronized

6
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
so they're not all sending it at exactly the same time.

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.000
In this example, the next 1 is due in 21 seconds, invalid of the 180 seconds

8
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
this specifies the invalid parameter

9
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
when that expires the route is declared invalid

10
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and they're should be at least 3 times the value of the update interval

11
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
a route becomes invalid when no updates refresh the route.

12
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
In other words, if router 1 doesn’t get an update

13
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
about a network from router 2 for a period of 180 seconds

14
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
the router's declared invalid.

15
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The route will then enter what's called a holddown timer

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and this is when a route is marked as inaccessible and advertises unreachable.

17
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
However, the router will still forward packets in its routing table

18
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
even if they're marked as inaccessible

19
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
so traffic will be forwarded during the holddown interval

20
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
a route is only flushed after this timer expires

21
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
in other words, it's removed from the routing table

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
after the expiry of the flush timer.

23
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We can look at the RIP database

24
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000
These are the routes that RIP has learned about

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
notice it includes automatic summary routes

26
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
The RIP database can be different to the routing table

27
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
when multiple routing protocols are used

28
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
EIGRP, as an example, will take precedence over RIP

29
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and EIGRP routes will be preferred over RIP if there are conflicts

30
00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
so EIGRP routes will be put into the routing table in preference of RIP routes.

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Now automatic summarization is a problem when you have discontiguous subnets.

32
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So on router 3

33
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I’m going to create another loopback of 1.1.1.2/32

34
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
router 1 has a loopback of 1.1.1.1/32

35
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and now router 3 has a loopback of 1.1.1.2/32

36
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I’m going to advertise that into RIP

37
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000
this is going to cause a problem now because on router 2

38
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
when we use the show ip route command

39
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000
you'll see that router 2 see's 2 paths to get to network 1.0.0.0/8

40
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
it thinks it can get to 1.0.0.0/8 via router 1 and router 3

41
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
so in some cases the problem you're going to have

42
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
is that when router 2 wants to ping 1.1.1.1 as an example

43
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
it will send some packets to router 1 and some packets to router 3

44
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
because it thinks it has 2 ways to get to the destination network.

45
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.000
On router 1, as an example, if I try and ping 1.1.1.2 that doesn’t work.

46
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
On router 1 if I use the command show ip route

47
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I can see the routing table

48
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
it hasn’t learned about the network 1.1.1.1

49
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
this can cause all kinds of problems in your network.

50
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
So, what you should do to solve this is going to the RIP process

51
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and type no auto-summary this does affect EIGRP in a similar way.

52
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
So with EIGRP also want to disable automatic summarization

53
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.000
so I'll disable automatic summarization on all these routers

54
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and now when I use the command show ip route.

55
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
I should see more specific routes.

56
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
So notice now I’m seeing 2.2.2.2/32

57
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
I’m still seeing the old 2 network which was advertised previously.

58
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
So when if I type clear ip route *

59
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
that allows me to remove all routes from the routing table

60
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:29.000
and force an update so that I don’t have to wait for routes to expire

61
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and then be relearned and notice now I see 1.1.1.1 on router 1

62
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
as directly connected, so it’s the loopback of router 1

63
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Now I also see 1.1.1.2 advertise via router 2, 10.1.1.2

64
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
so now router 1 should be able to ping

65
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
the loopback of router 3 with this IP address.

66
00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:02.000
So I have added this loopback to router 3

67
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
and that now works and on route 3

68
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000
we should be able to ping router's 1 loopback

69
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
that works and on router 2 when I use the command show ip route

70
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
I see specific routes via different interfaces.

71
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.000
So 1.1.1.1 is available via F0/0 this interface

72
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000
1.1.1.2 is available via F0/1 this interface.

73
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
This is a lot better than it was previously.

74
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
So the moral of the story is when you setup RIP

75
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
make sure that you disable automatic summarization

76
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and ensure that you use version 2

77
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
otherwise, you're going to have problems in a lot of topologies.
