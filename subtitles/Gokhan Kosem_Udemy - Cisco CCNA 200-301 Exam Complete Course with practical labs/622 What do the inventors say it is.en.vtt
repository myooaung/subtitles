Martin Casado who is seen as the father of SD and an open flow and developed ethane as part of his thesis

at Stanford University says I don't know what a DNA is.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:29.690
It's kind of become this umbrella term used for multiple visions of software defined networking some

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:37.230
of which don't include open flow at all he says as an example that it's become a general term as if

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.120
all networking is software defined networking that becomes tough.

7
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:47.640
Then if the people involved in the original development have said that the term has become generalized.
