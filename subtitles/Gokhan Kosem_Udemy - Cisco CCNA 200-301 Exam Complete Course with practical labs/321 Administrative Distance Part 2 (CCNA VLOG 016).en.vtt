00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.800
This flock is a continuation of a previous blog discussing administrative distance or the believability

2
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.270
of a routing protocol.

3
00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:36.830
In this example we've got four routers Rato one Rodda to write history and write a full Rodda to in

4
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.260
the apology.

5
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.800
He's only running away if we can see that by using the show IP protocols command.

6
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:55.510
It has a relationship with both rodder one and wrote a full rodders three in the apology he's running

7
00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.960
up and GOP now in the real world you typically don't enable a whole bunch of writing protocols on your

8
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.180
is we doing it here to explain that Mr. of distances.

9
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:17.190
So show IP protocol and Rotto one rat of one is running rip your GOP as well as OSPF Rotto for he's

10
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.290
doing the same.

11
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.160
So on route of one show IP route the route of interest in this typologies could ripple fall.

12
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.690
That's a loop back on Route 4.

13
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.770
We can see in the writing table of Rato one that the rumped appears in the writing table and the protocol

14
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.310
selected was GOP.

15
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.580
That's because the GOP has an administrative distance of 90 which we can see here.

16
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.320
SPF has an image of distance of 110.

17
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:52.380
The loopback of Route 2 has been learnt via OSPF because we are not running the GOP on a t.

18
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.880
The lower the administrative distance the more believable the routing protocol.

19
00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:06.250
So this ROFFT was selected because your job has a lower admin distance show IP OSPF database shows us

20
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:13.900
that the route is available in the OSPF database but the GOP was selected because it has the lowest

21
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.220
administer of distance.

22
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:24.220
So at the moment show Bruhn section GOP shows us that the GOP is enabled on right of one.

23
00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:31.420
So if we remove the GOP from rodded one and then look at the routing table what you'll notice is that

24
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:38.410
the rot has been added from OSPF the next hop is via a 10 1 1 2.

25
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:48.360
If we scroll up previously the next top was tendered one to 1 to 2 which is routed three but because

26
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:56.790
my job is no longer running on Route 1 The route is now available via Route 2 and was lent through OSPF

27
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.850
So as an example if we trace to that route.

28
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.580
Now notice that it goes via rodded too.

29
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:14.740
We are still running up on this router so is running a rotas 3 router 1 and a full but the route is

30
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:23.160
not selected for quadruple for because a rep has a higher administer of distance when compared to P.F.

31
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:30.140
So the loopback of router 3 is advertised via up to one.

32
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.640
And because I was P.F. is not advertising that route the route is put into the writing table but because

33
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.640
I always be advertising this route and it has a lower administered distance when compared to up the

34
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:49.670
OSPF route is used not route so to confirm that and try and prove it to you.

35
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:57.430
I'm going to remove job P from router 3 serratus 3

36
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.900
is running up.

37
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:10.020
It's not running IGMP rope is the only running protocol running on road 3 to 1.

38
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:17.790
We can see the loopback of router 3 learnt via a rep but we don't see the loop back of router for because

39
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:28.840
OSPF takes precedence so let's remove who is P.F. show IP rot we haven't learnt about the route through

40
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.820
yet.

41
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.830
So let's do some investigation to make sure things are working.

42
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.500
Show IP wrapped on rotatory.

43
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.840
Notice the rot has been learnt via a rope on Rotto one.

44
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.930
It's now available.

45
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.600
I was a bit impatient.

46
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:56.440
Takes longer to advertise routes so now paying quadruple for trace could ripple for it's going via a

47
00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.850
router 3.

48
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:06.960
And that's because the only routing protocol that's running on Route 1 is reep So the writing table

49
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:16.020
is populated with broths the reader won't be able to ping the Lubeck of Ratatouille because Gruppe is

50
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.380
not running on Rodda too.

51
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:23.130
So we need to enable replan right to feed one for connectivity in the network.

52
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.840
But for now I'm not going to do that.

53
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.280
I want to prove to you that OSPF takes precedence.

54
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.740
So notice the wraparound isn't the writing table with an administrative distance of 120 counties to

55
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.400
it's available via tendered one to two to two.

56
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:45.150
It's been in the writing table for 19 seconds and it's available via a gigabit 0 1 that's lets enable

57
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:58.010
OSPF network and all the naval P.F. on all interfaces show IP OSPF neighbor.

58
00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:03.030
We have a neighbor relationship with reality show IP route.

59
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:12.780
Notice the writing table has been updated always takes precedence over ripe so the path you use to get

60
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.300
to quadruple four is via router too.

61
00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.290
If we enable the GOP on this Rodda

62
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:33.140
traffic will still go via rodded too because we need to enable the GOP on Radio 3 so let's do that Rodda

63
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:40.630
you know job P enable your job and all interface's neighbor relationship has been established.

64
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.280
So show I.P your job.

65
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:49.760
Neighbor neighbor relationship is available show IP rocked the GOP Raat has now been put into the writing

66
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:50.680
table.

67
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:58.660
And if we trace that loop back it's going via router three site administer distances work as follows.

68
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.580
The lowest number wins.

69
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:05.330
Different routing protocols have different administrative distances set by default.

70
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.120
You can change them.

71
00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:18.740
Wrap is 120 SPF is 110 hijo internal Roths is 90 but I could as an example add a route to the writing

72
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:24.880
table steadily at a static route to force the traffic to go via rockety.

73
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:31.640
Now when we look at the writing table notice the static route has replaced the GOP because a static

74
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:36.320
route to a next top IP address has an admin distance of one.

75
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:43.580
Is nothing more believable than you as in the router believes you more than it believes a algorithm

76
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:51.170
such as your job is P.F. and thats because you know what you are doing and the rodded believe you more

77
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:54.260
than the police or the rodders.

78
00:07:54.280 --> 00:08:01.950
So once again trace via wrote a TV show run popping clewed rot.

79
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:12.140
We've got the static route forcing the traffic via roads to well remove the static ROFFT should not

80
00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:13.610
be dropped.

81
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:15.530
Your job is the most believable now

82
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:22.360
traffic is going via road history.

83
00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.210
Remove your choppy

84
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:29.380
always be fraught takes precedence.

85
00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:40.160
Now traffic is going via router too so that is a demonstration of ministry of distance or the believability

86
00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.040
factor of a rant for the CCMA exam.

87
00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.630
You need to know admin distances in a separate video.

88
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:49.180
I'll show you an example with BGP.

89
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:54.820

90
00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:56.120
