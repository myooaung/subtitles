00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.910
You're

2
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.720
in this video I'm going to demonstrate how to download and import a genius free appliance.

3
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:23.330
I'm using James 3 on a Mac but the principle is the same if you're using a Windows PC.

4
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.870
So good to the genius free web site and Plec marketplace.

5
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.830
And then appliances and find the appliance that you want to download.

6
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:43.800
In this example I'm going to download the Cisco Ioway the lead to appliance so click on the appliance

7
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.590
and then click download template the appliances then download it to your local machine.

8
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:58.650
You'll typically need to provide your own operating system for the genus 3 appliance that you are using.

9
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.480
The appliance doesn't contain the operating system.

10
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:11.010
It's simply a way to quickly get a device working ingenius 3 using the recommended parameters or recommended

11
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.270
settings.

12
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.870
So in this example I've already downloaded the appliance operating system from Cisco viral and I've

13
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.600
got it stored in my downloads directory.

14
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.530
I've also got to the Janissary appliance downloaded to my downloads directory.

15
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:38.250
So to import the appliance ingenius three he'd go to file import appliance navigate to the directory

16
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.260
with the appliances stored in this case the appliance was downloaded to my downloads directory.

17
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.930
So I'm going to select the appliance and click open the ad appliance window displays and a summary of

18
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.800
the appliances shown here.

19
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.610
Click next.

20
00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.010
Now it's recommended that the appliance run on the Jinnah's 3 VM and that's what we are going to do.

21
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.120
So I'm going to select that option and click next.

22
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:12.570
We told that to the genius three server requirements are OK so we can continue with the installation.

23
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.370
So click next.

24
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:21.900
Now genius 3 will search for the operating system in the download directory and the gene has three images

25
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.950
directory.

26
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:32.610
In this case because the image is in the Downloads directory genus 3 has picked that up and has found

27
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.200
the image.

28
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.420
Now if you don't have the image click on the download button.

29
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:46.960
So that you've taken to the vendor's website to download the image for viral images you could download

30
00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:56.030
to the image directly from the viral Web site or use the link provided in Genesis 3 so in this case

31
00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.880
the image found is the image which is in the Downloads directory once again.

32
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.440
So I'm going to click next genius.

33
00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.640
He asks Do we want to install this image.

34
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.310
And the answer is yes.

35
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:16.780
We told the settings used by the appliance and this is what makes it a lot easier using the appliances

36
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.900
from the genius free Web site.

37
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.940
You don't have to know the correct settings.

38
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.090
It's done for you so click next.

39
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.150
We then told that to the appliance will be available in the multi-layers switch category.

40
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.370
We are told that there is no default password.

41
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.260
We enable password.

42
00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.470
There's also no default configuration.

43
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.600
So click Finish.

44
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:46.750
Jean history tells us that the appliances installed septic OK we can go to switches and here's the new

45
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:54.210
appliance that we just added notice we told that the image is not available on the genus 3 VM.

46
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.580
Do we want to upload it.

47
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.930
And the answer is yes.

48
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:04.590
What happened is that the image was automatically uploaded from the Janissary client or Kuei running

49
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.160
on my Mac to the genus 3 VM running with in a VM way.

50
00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:19.340
I can add another device to the topology of zoom in to make it easier to see what's going on.

51
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.180
We could connect a link as an example between the two switches

52
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:32.910
move the topology around as desired and let's click start to boot the images up and then let's open

53
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.060
up a console to each device.

54
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:45.680
So his switch one and he has switched to we're told that Iowas V is booting those images are running

55
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:53.960
once again within the genus 3 V.M. we can see the C.P. of the genus three V.M. has climbed quite a bit

56
00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:03.230
often when you first boot up the C-p use at 100 percent we see some output on the screen showing us

57
00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:14.930
that the Cisco virtual us relate to software interfaces are coming up on both switches and after a while

58
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:28.870
we can log in so show version his the command Cisco Iowas software the iOS advanced enterprise services

59
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.950
show IP interface brief.

60
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.410
We can see some interfaces on the switch conforte.

61
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:46.180
Let's give the switch a name to a host switch one on the switch host switch to Visalia two switches.

62
00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.240
Let's give them an IP address on and as VOA.

63
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:55.210
So 10 1 1 1 slushed 24 no shut the SBI

64
00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:10.400
on switch to interface villaine 1 IP address 10 1 1 2 No shutout ping 10 1 1 1.

65
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.570
I was a bit quick there but notice the pings started succeeding.

66
00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:14.920
Do the ping again.

67
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.940
Switch who is able to pings which one.

68
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:24.540
And by the same token which one can ping switch to.

69
00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.240
These are very powerful images.

70
00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.390
Let's do last quick demonstration.

71
00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:40.720
I'll try to loop back on switch one try to loop back and switch to and then let's see Nabl Eli GOP and

72
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:47.580
all enable you know GOP on all interfaces to do the same here.

73
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:54.090
Enable the GOP on all interfaces.

74
00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:59.540
You don't have to do this come on because it's a default on a lot of the modern Cisco Iris's but to

75
00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:06.990
disable or to summarization show IP Jappy neighbor we have a neighbor relationship with switch to show

76
00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:14.200
IP ront we can see that we've learnt a route through the P paying quadruple T.

77
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:22.500
So one can ping the Lubeck of such to such to can ping the lookback of such one.

78
00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:28.900
So that was a quick demonstration of how to download an appliance from the Jinnah's 3 marketplace.

79
00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:36.180
They are many appliances available in this marketplace and I showed you an example of how to import

80
00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:47.960
a Cisco Iowas V A lead to appliance and get it working in Jeana's 3 The recommendation is to use the

81
00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:48.820
genus 3.

82
00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:57.210
VM don't use an appliance on a local install of genius 3 on a Windows PC or a Mac.

83
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.630
You.
