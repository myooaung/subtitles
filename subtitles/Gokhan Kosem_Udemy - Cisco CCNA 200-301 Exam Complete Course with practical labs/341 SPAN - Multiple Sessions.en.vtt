00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:09.600
So let's have a look at some of the options show monitor session all at the moment.

2
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.000
No spend configuration is present on the system.

3
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:15.780
We can look at a local span.

4
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.030
We can even look at remote span.

5
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.990
Remote Spanish used where you have a different source and destination switch.

6
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.250
So the source port could be this port on switch to and the destination could be this port on switch

7
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.090
one.

8
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:40.530
So traffic will be captured on this port and sent to the capturing device on this switch switch one

9
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:51.840
so I'll configure a monitor session to monitor session pick a number like one source interface fast

10
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.150
ethernet 1 0 1 the destination.

11
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:08.900
In our example is going to be 1 0 5 seduce show run pipe include monitor that's what we've done.

12
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:20.760
If we tried to configure a another session using the same destination port of interface if 1 0 5 notice

13
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.090
we told that to that port is already being used.

14
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.910
So we configured this port as the destination of session 1.

15
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:36.990
We can't now configure it to be the destination for Session 2 but we could as an example configure session

16
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.710
to and specify a different source.

17
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.620
So one zero one as an example.

18
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.110
So do show run pop include monitor.

19
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.480
We've got two sources configured but only one destination.

20
00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:07.010
So show monitor session or we've got session one configured and session to configured but only session

21
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.330
one is configured with a destination port Session 2 is not currently being used.

22
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:20.340
On one shock device we should be able to capture traffic from Rota one to write it to which we can see

23
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:27.660
unit cost traffic sent from Rado want to write it to it's being forwarded out of this port because of

24
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:38.910
this monitoring session traffic sent and received on f 1 slash 1 is going to be sent out of 1 0 5 and

25
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:48.220
hence we see the ICMP echo request and echo reply messages.

26
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:55.160
Now there's nothing stopping us moving the destination port from one session to another so we could

27
00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:03.430
put a no in front of that command will now move it to session 2 so that's accepted.

28
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:12.310
So what we've done now is move the destination port from session one to session to I'll clear that why

29
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:22.020
shock capture do the ping again and they're just we capturing the traffic because we capturing some

30
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.500
laconic traffic but in a different session.
