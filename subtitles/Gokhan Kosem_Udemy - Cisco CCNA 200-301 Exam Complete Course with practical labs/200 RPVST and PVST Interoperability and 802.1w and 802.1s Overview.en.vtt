1
00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:07.370
More rapid spending is backward compatible with a little to one D and in the same way Rapide previous

2
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.770
t is compatible with previous t on switch 3.

3
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:17.840
These ports were converging quickly because we're using rapid spending tree between switch 1 2 and 3

4
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.670
but the links to switch for are stored using Peavey's.

5
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.990
So what you'll notice is it takes longer for those links to converge

6
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.930
show spanning tree as an example shows me that the ports are now forwarding but they've taken a lot

7
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.930
longer to converge than they would have with Reppert Peavey's cheat.

8
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:48.170
So once again on interface gigabit zero one all know port shows spanning tree.

9
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.790
We can already see that gigabit.

10
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:59.000
0 1 is the root port and is forwarding and gigabit 0 0 is an alternate port and is blocking However

11
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.780
other ports such as gigabit 0 2 and 0 3 are still learning.

12
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:11.070
So it's going to take time for these ports to move to the forwarding state.

13
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.830
You can see they have now moved to the forwarding state but that's because there is an older version

14
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:24.520
of spanning tree negotiated between switch three and switch for switch three once again is using Reppert

15
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.400
previous the switch for however

16
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.330
is using per villans spanning tree not rapid Peavey's T.

17
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.720
So triple is shown in the output whereas once again on switch 3 it's Rapide previous t.

18
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.360
So that is backward compatibility between rapid previous t and previous t.

19
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.110
But the convergence will be slow between rapid previous and previous TB because of backward compatibility

20
00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:03.650
and within the previous part of your network let's have a look at the capture.

21
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.290
So this is on switch three as advertised to the hub.

22
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:15.870
And what you can see here is that the protocol used a spanning tree not rapid spending tree and that's

23
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.730
because switch three has negotiated to use spending tree with switch for not rapid spending tree.

24
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:30.050
So in the output once again it's spanning tree protocol not rapid spending tree protocol path cost route

25
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.850
identify and bridge identify are shown here but it's negotiated to use the older version of spending

26
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.550
tree even though this document is old.

27
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:46.470
It provides a great explanation of rapid spending tree or ADA to the one w and multiple spending tree

28
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.740
or ADA to that one yes you can find this document as part of the course or you can search in Google

29
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:59.900
as an example for the Cisco Avot network infrastructure this document explains the evolution of spending

30
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:07.820
tree and house spending tree has existed for a long time in an unchanged format that has been enhanced

31
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.150
through the use of rapid spending tree and multiple spending tree it a two to one.

32
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:20.000
Once again is the initial version of spending tree and was designed to stop loops in switched or bridged

33
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.310
networks.

34
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:28.850
It was very difficult to get fast convergence with Ada to 1 D.

35
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:35.250
One of the problems with Ada 3:01 D is that it uses time as supports go from blocking to listening to

36
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.540
learning to forwarding and that process can take 50 seconds.

37
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:49.530
When a port comes up as an example it goes from listening to learning to forwarding which takes 30 seconds.

38
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:56.870
Now Cisco enhanced it through one D in the 1990s by introducing uplink Foster backbone first and port

39
00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.650
fust for the CCN course today.

40
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.160
You don't need to know about uplink fast or backbone fast.

41
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.270
You can just ignore those.

42
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:13.460
The important one to remember is port fast or ports which are ports connected to and a use of devices

43
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:21.280
such as PCs or servers that transition immediately to the forwarding state.

44
00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.270
The trouble e incorporated most of these concepts into two standards.

45
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:33.110
Rapid spending tree and multiple spending tree with these protocols convergence time as were a lot quicker

46
00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.420
Cisco have taken that those protocols and enhanced PV is ti.

47
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.930
So today we have Rapide previous to t and Cisco switches.

48
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:54.630
So as an example on the switch we can type spending tree mode and we can specify Reppert previous TTY

49
00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:03.240
or MSCE the industry standard version of rapid spending tree only has one root in the entire topology

50
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:10.880
where as a Reppert Peavey's T gives you a route on a per villaine basis.

51
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:18.390
So it's a lot better than pure Reppert spending tree or editor one w multiple spending tree doesn't

52
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:26.940
give you a route per Villon but it gives you the ability to associate multiple villans to a spanning

53
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.000
tree root.

54
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.680
So you could say in a campus network as an example that villans 1 to 100.

55
00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.330
So which one is the root.

56
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.610
But villans 101 to 200 have switched to as the root.
