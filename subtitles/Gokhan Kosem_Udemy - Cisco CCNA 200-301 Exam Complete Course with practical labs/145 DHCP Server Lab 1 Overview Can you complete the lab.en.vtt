In this lab we've been asked to configure DTP on the right of one as follows.

2
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:36.000
The excluded address range is going to be from 10 dot Wandered Wandered 1 to 10 dot one dot one top

3
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:45.810
100 the pull name is going to BPC the network to use these 10 dot wondered 1.0 slash 24 the default

4
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:54.860
gateway for the DCP pool will be right to 1 and the DNS server for the DHB pool will be right of one

5
00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:05.070
you should configure this network and test it make sure that PCI 0 gets an IP address from the router

6
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:15.190
and is able to ping the loop bank of a 1 so ensure that things actually work so can you configured the

7
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:23.200
router download the packet to trace a file and see if you can configure the router per these requirements

8
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:30.600
in the next video I'm going to show you how to do this but try it first and see if you can do it yourself.
