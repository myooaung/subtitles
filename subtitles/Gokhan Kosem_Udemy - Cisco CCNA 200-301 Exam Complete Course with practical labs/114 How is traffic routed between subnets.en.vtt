00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So in summary when the device wants to communicate

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
with another device in the same subnet.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It will send a broadcast onto the local segment to find

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
the MAC address of the device using the target IP address.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So in this case A sends the frame to the hub.

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The hub because it's a multi port repeater will send the frame

7
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
out of all ports except the port on which it arrive.

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So both the router and host C received the frame.

9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Network Interface Card will only accept unicast traffic destined

10
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
to the Mac address or they’ll accept broadcast traffic

11
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
as well as accepting multicast traffic

12
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
for multicast addresses that they've subscribed to.

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The router has a MAC address of G on interface F0/0

14
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
so the router will receive the broadcast

15
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and forward the ARP request to high layer protocols.

16
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The router will be able to see at layer 3 that this is an ARP request

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
for IP address 10.1.1.2 but the router in this example is configured

18
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
with IP addresses 10.1.1.100 and 10.1.2.100 so the router will drop

19
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
the frame because the ARP request is not for one of one its IP addresses.

20
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Routers do not forward broadcast, so this broadcast is not forwarded

21
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
out of interface F0/1.

22
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So the broadcast received by the router is dropped.

23
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
The network interface card on PC C will received the broadcast

24
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and see that this is an ARP request forwards IP address.

25
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
So it will then reply with an ARP reply

26
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
as we’ve seen in the Wireshark capture.

27
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
PC C will update its ARP cash to show that IP address 10.1.1.1 is

28
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
associated with MAC address A and it will then send the frame to the hub

29
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
The hub will forward the frame out of all ports

30
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
because it’s a multiport repeater.

31
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
The router in this example will receive a frame from the hub

32
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
but because the destination MAC address is A

33
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and it’s not the MAC address of the router

34
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
which is G the router will drop the frame.

35
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
A will also receive a copy of the frame

36
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
when A receives the frame it will accept it

37
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
because the destination address is A and its MAC address is A.

38
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
it will then update its ARP cache with and ARP entries

39
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
stating that IP address 10.1.1.2 is associated with MAC address C.

40
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
so the ARP reply allows A to update its ARP cache.

41
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
At this point no user traffic has been transmitted

42
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
what’s happen here is that the devices have simply worked out

43
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
which MAC addresses are associated with which IP addresses.

44
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
So A now knows that MAC address C is associated with IP address 10.1.1.2
