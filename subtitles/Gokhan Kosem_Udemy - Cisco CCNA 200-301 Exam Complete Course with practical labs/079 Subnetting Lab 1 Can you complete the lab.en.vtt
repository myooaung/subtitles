00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.320
This is a practical IP version for submitting lab.

2
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:17.050
Now this is a practical lab helping you test and verify your knowledge of IP vision for subletting.

3
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:23.860
We're not simply going to talk about the theory of IP version 4 subletting you need to subnet but in

4
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.080
addition configure the network and get it working.

5
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:35.020
You need to configure IP addresses on routers on switches and on DHB servers and then you need to configure

6
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:41.300
the DHB servers to allocate IP addresses to the clients in the correct subnet.

7
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:48.880
So once again this is a practical demonstration and lab of IP version for submitting in this packet

8
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.770
to trace a lab.

9
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:57.370
We have multiple sites side 1 and side two connected via serial links to an Internet writer.

10
00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:05.650
You need to configure the network as follows you've been allocated subnet 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 0 slash 24 and

11
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:12.430
you need to subnet this network into 4 subnets as follows subnet 1 needs to be allocated to site to

12
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:22.360
1 subnet 2 to the serial link between right of 1 and the Internet broader subnet 3 2 site 2 and subnet

13
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.470
4 to the link between Rider 2 and the Internet rather.

14
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:34.930
Now we are not going to initially optimize the sub netting you're only going to create 4 subnets and

15
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:42.460
then split them across these four networks in a subsequent video we'll optimize the serial links to

16
00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.350
use a slash 30 mosque and then make more subnets available for additional sites.

17
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.690
But in this initial topology you simply need to create 4 subnets.

18
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.410
You should configure the route as per the instructions in the diagram.

19
00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:02.660
In other words this interface on broader one should use of the Lost IP address in the relevant subnet.

20
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.260
This interface should use the first ip address in the subnet on the serial link.

21
00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:14.770
The Internet right is going to use the lost IP address in both subnets on the serial links and router

22
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:22.300
2 will once again use the lost IP address in the subnet on the Ethan end interface and to the first

23
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.210
ip address on the serial interface.

24
00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:31.570
You need to configure the switches with the second to last IP address and the subnet and the DHB servers

25
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:40.990
with the third lost IP address in the subnet so as an example at Site 1 The Switch such one should be

26
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:47.650
configured with the second lost IP address and the subnet and the DHB server with the third lost IP

27
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:48.590
address.

28
00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.630
The same should be done for switch to incite to and the third lost IP address should be configured on

29
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.280
the DHB server at the site to.

30
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:06.550
You also need to configure the DHB servers to allocate IP addresses to the clients in the relevant subnets.

31
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.850
So as an example DHB server 1 should allocate IP addresses to PCI 0.

32
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:20.620
P.S. 1 and P.S. 2 in the subnet allocated to this network DCP server 2 should allocate IP addresses

33
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.680
in the correct subnet to PCI 3 4 and 5.

34
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:31.270
Once you've done your configuration verify that pieces can access Cisco dot com and Facebook dot com

35
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.100
using their browsers.

36
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.380
The server today to day to day date is configured as a DNS server.

37
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:46.330
So think of this as the Google DNS server that is configured with a records for Cisco dot com and Facebook

38
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.430
dot com.

39
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:54.040
So once you've got your network configured with the correct IP addresses your DHB servers are allocating

40
00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:01.070
IP addresses to the clients the clients should be able to access Cisco dot com and Facebook dot com.

41
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.320
Again this is the DNS server in the network.

42
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.050
OK so can you complete the slab.

43
00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:14.550
Can you work out the relevant subnets the relevant IP addresses and configure the routers switches and

44
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.410
DHB servers to get this network working.

45
00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.230
Download the packet trace a file and see if you can complete to the lab yourself.

46
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.050
Otherwise watch the next video where I complete the lab.
