00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:08.000
It's on your log messages you have a few options for top show run pipe include service

2
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.570
what you'll notice is on my log messages I have a date time set.

3
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:25.820
I will have that to set to on debugs you can enable sequence numbers as an example if you want to see

4
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.340
sequence numbers on your log messages.

5
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.720
For price controls here.

6
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:38.000
Notice I see a slug message number and that's now appearing in my QB.

7
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.870
So looks over do that again.

8
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.200
Notice the message number has increased if I shut to need to face don't

9
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.210
always be shutting down the neighbor relationships but notice you can see the numbers incrementing on

10
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.870
the router.

11
00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:02.250
These numbers on the left are QB syslog sequence numbers but the 500 numbers sheer numbers on the router

12
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.790
as you can see over here 593 and 5:23 over there.

13
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:14.390
Sequence numbers obviously make it a lot easier to find messages and sort them when you're receiving

14
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.650
multiple messages and want to order it.

15
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:27.520
Logically So when I type and as an example notice the sequence number shown in QBE.

16
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.390
So it looks over as well as on the router.

17
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:38.530
You can type service timestamps and specify that for both log and debug messages.

18
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.670
You can either showed by date and time or by the system up time.

19
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.840
So at the moment it's set to date and time.

20
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:54.700
You can see the date is made the 16th can see the time up time allows me to specify the uptime on the

21
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.590
router.

22
00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.550
So how long is the route to be a full and you can see this route it has been up for almost one hour

23
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.030
and 20 minutes notice the format has changed.

24
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:13.710
You probably want to do it based on date time and then you can specify how you're going to do it.

25
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.680
So milliseconds allows me to specify milliseconds in the timestamp.

26
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.850
I could also specify the euro at the moment.

27
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.050
Notice there's no Euro specified on these messages.

28
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.110
Controls again or control said.

29
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:37.610
Notice now I'm getting May 16 2016 and the time on the road to I can disable that.

30
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.070
So you could say no service time stamps.

31
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:50.050
And when a price controls Zino what controls that notice I don't see the date and time stamps do it

32
00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.570
again.

33
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.750
Controls that notice now is the date and time.
