00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Use whichever method is most logical to yourself

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Once again, many people have many different methods to speed up calculations

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Don't try and learn them all, just learn the ways that makes the most sense to you

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and that are easy to learn

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Now let's extend our discussion to IPv4 Addresses

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
An IPv4 Address is used to uniquely identify a device in an IP Network

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
IPv4 Addresses are 4 octets in lenght, in other words they are 4 grouping of 8 bits

8
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
or 4x8, each octet is 8 bits in lenght in the range 0 to 255

9
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Juts imagine that a bit is a logical cable that can have current or not have current

10
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
In other videos I'm gonna explain IP Addressing in a lot more detail as well as Subnetting

11
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
but for now just understand that an IPv4 Address is 4 octets

12
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
in other words 4x8 bits

13
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
IPv4 Addresses can be represented in both binary and decimal format

14
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So here's an example 10.1.23.19 is the decimal representation of an IP Address

15
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
in this case IPv4 that can be represented as follows in binary

16
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
so 10 equates to 0000 followed by 1010

17
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
0000000 followed by a 1 in binary is the equivalent of decimal 1

18
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
00010111 is the binary equivalent of 23

19
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and 00010011 is the equivalent of 19

20
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000
This is kind of like saying tomato versus tomatoe or router versus router

21
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
use whichever term you prefer, for networking however it's important that

22
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
you know both decimal and binary

23
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:10.000
So let's start with 10, 8+2= 10, in other words this bit is on and this bit is on

24
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:21.000
the other bits are set off, 8+2= 10 and thus 00001010 is the equivalent of 10 in decimal

25
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
8+2= 10 other bits are set off, only these 2 bits are on

26
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:37.000
What about 129? 128+1= 129, this bit and this bit are set on

27
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and other bits are set off, thus 10000001 is equivalent to 129 in decimal

28
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
using our language analogy, this is French and this is English

29
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
different language but we are saying the same thing

30
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.000
What about 16? So 16 = 16, this is an easy one

31
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
this bit is the equivalent of 16, so that bit is set on and the other bits are set off

32
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:19.000
so 00010000 in binary is equivalent to 16 in decimal

33
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and lastly 123, 64+32+16+8+2+1= 123, in other words the first bit is off

34
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000
second bit is on which =64, third bit is on which is 32, 4th bit is 16

35
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.000
5th bit is 8, 7th bit is on which is 2 and last bit is 1

36
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
so 64, 32, 16, 8, 2, 1 gives us a 123

37
00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:02.000
In other words 01111011 is the equivalent of a 123 in decimal

38
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
So just to reiterate, remember 2 to the power of 0 equals 1 in decimal

39
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
2 to the power of 1 equals 2 in decimal, 2 to the power of 3 equals 8 in decimal

40
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
2 to the power of 4 is 16, 2 to the power of 5 is 32, 2 to the power of 6 is 64

41
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:27.000
So 64+32+16+8+2+1= 123, so the most significant bit is set off

42
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th bit is set on, the 6th bit is set off

43
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and the 7th and 8th bit is set on, that gives us this value in binary

44
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
which is the equivalent of 123 in decimal

45
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
I'm hoping that this shows you how to convert a decimal IP Address into binary
