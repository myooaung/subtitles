00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.630
Now if you connecting one device to another you once again need some kind of media that allows for a

2
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.720
data transmission from once device to another.

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:16.420
In other words you need some type of data link to allow data to be transferred from one device to another.

4
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.760
I've already shown you Ethernet.

5
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.080
This is a very common type of Ethernet this is Cat 5G or Category 5.

6
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.230
We'll talk more about Ethernet later but Cat 5.

7
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.460
This is an example of Cat 6 Ethernet cabling unsheltered twisted pay Ethan cabling like this is probably

8
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.340
the most common type of cabling that you're going to encounter but it didn't stop there.

9
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.910
Now Ethernet didn't start with until that twisted peak cabling.

10
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:55.420
It started with 10 base five cabling very big cabling that's not easy to use.

11
00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:02.580
It actually has these black markings on the cable and that's where you would use a wire tap or vampire

12
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.480
tap if you prefer to connect to the network.

13
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:12.570
You couldn't just connect anywhere you had to connect on these black markings if you wanted a good signal.

14
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.810
And this is how that would look.

15
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.070
Notice this crazy large transceiver.

16
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.430
This is how you would connect to the network.

17
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.480
So to give you an idea of scale.

18
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.040
I've got a one dollar US banknote so one dollar.

19
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.240
He has a British pound so notice how big that is.

20
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.730
This is massive cabling.

21
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.740
Really really old technology.

22
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.040
And it gets worse to actually connect your P.C. to the network.

23
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:56.280
You needed a drop cable like this so you would have to connect that to the transceiver.

24
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.900
And as you can see it came up there.

25
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.500
This is very thick cabling not very easy to use

26
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.310
and that would connect to your network called so you would have this kind of setup.

27
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.710
That's how you would get on to the network.

28
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:13.850
It's an absolute nightmare.

29
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.770
This cabling very hard to work with.

30
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.850
It was very temperamental.

31
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.190
This is using what's called a bus network in a bus network.

32
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.050
All the devices are connected on one long cable like this nightmare.

33
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:36.040
I'll demonstrate this in a separate video where I'll build a 10 base five network and show you one that's

34
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.940
working.

35
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.910
But for the moment just notice how ridiculously difficult this cable is to work with how thick it is.

36
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.540
This is called thick net for a good reason because it's so thick.

37
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.340
So after we had thick net they then fortunately developed for net or ten base two.

38
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.830
And if you ever wondered why it's called the net versus thick net just notice the difference in the

39
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.880
size of these cables.

40
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.380
This is the net versus thick net.

41
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:14.020
This cabling is much much thinner than this cabling but also used a bus topology also had various issues.

42
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.330
Today we tend to use UDP so until the twisted pay cabling like this.

43
00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.510
That's very common.

44
00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.810
Or we use fibre cables and they're different types of fibre cables.

45
00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.360
I'll talk more about fibre cables later.

46
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.090
We have multi-modal fibre and single mode fibre.

47
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:37.830
But the idea is is that I have a network interface card like this or more modern example like this.

48
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.990
This gets inserted into a computer.

49
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:46.460
And this is how I gain access to the network a network interface code has a mac address or Media Access

50
00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:53.060
Control address that is essentially a burnt in address burnt in by the manufacturer that identifies

51
00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.540
this network interface code on the ether network.

52
00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:03.290
If you don't have a network interface card in your laptop you could use a USP to Ethan and adapter like

53
00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.100
this.

54
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:10.210
So that would allow you to connect to the network using ethernet or once again using wireless.

55
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.370
Here's an example of a wireless network interface card.

56
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:20.930
You essentially need a way to get a node onto the network and a network interface called is the way

57
00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.340
that you connect yourself to the ether net network.

58
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.910
A lot of devices like iPhones as an example have built in network interface cards.

59
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.600
They connect directly onto the wireless and they have something like this bolt inside of them that allows

60
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.150
them to connect to the wireless network.

61
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:46.020
Remember we are transmitting data from one device to another using some kind of media which could be

62
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.090
the air could be physical cabling.
