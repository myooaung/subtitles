00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.300
Now you will learn a lot more by doing rather than just watching me talk about protocols and talk about

2
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.110
things.

3
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.370
So make sure that you download this packet tracer file and try this yourself.

4
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:24.000
I'm going to walk you through a scenario and a few scenarios in this video and in subsequent videos

5
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.140
and labs.

6
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.920
But try this yourself you will learn far more by doing than by watching or listening.

7
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.000
You learn to ride a bicycle by riding.

8
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.170
You don't learn to ride a bicycle by watching someone else ride a bicycle or watching videos.

9
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.660
So try this yourself.

10
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.990
Okay.

11
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:49.740
So in this example I've got a topology consisting of multiple devices so zooming out I've got a whole

12
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:50.810
bunch of devices.

13
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:59.640
But for this initial video we're going to concentrate on this P.C. which is in our internal network.

14
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.360
In other words think of this as being at your home or company.

15
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.510
And then we've got a device that's connected to the Internet here.

16
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.450
So this would be our Internet reporter.

17
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.260
What we're going to do however is connect to a server in our internal network.

18
00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.030
Now at home you may have multiple Internet connected devices.

19
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.980
You could as an example simply open up a web browser on your P.C. and connect it to your Internet router.

20
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:33.360
As an example if I open up a web browser and connect to an IP address in my network and don't worry

21
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.470
too much about IP addresses at this point if you don't understand them.

22
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:43.110
Basically an IP address is a number that you allocate to a device that allows it to communicate using

23
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:50.220
a protocol which in this example is IP IP version 4 in this specific example here.

24
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.810
I've got a Beatty home hub when you connect to Web sites such as Facebook dot com that is going to be

25
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:06.020
using a protocol in this example HDP X which is an encrypted version of a GDP.

26
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.970
A different protocol but that's kind of what it is.

27
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.940
We encrypting HDP so you may have devices at home that you can connect to.

28
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.180
We going to mimic that or represent that in Packet Tracer.

29
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.510
So on the left here I have some servers running internally.

30
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:27.680
I have a Internet router which is connecting me to the Internet as a further demonstration.

31
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.770
I've got an iPhone.

32
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.690
I could connect to that light.

33
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.350
That's a cue like using Bluetooth and then do something to that light in your home you may have some

34
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:44.690
devices that are connected via IP as well that light isn't using IP as in normal IP using Bluetooth.

35
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:51.210
I'm connecting to that light via Bluetooth from my iPhone and turning it on and off but this light as

36
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:59.280
an example is connected via IP so I can go on to my phone and then I could say OK let's turn that light

37
00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.940
off.

38
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.040
So it's gone off.

39
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:09.790
Turn it on now the way that works is I'm simply connecting to that light via TTP IP.

40
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.190
You can actually look at the traffic on your home network using an application called wire shock.

41
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.770
I'll talk about that in a separate video but in this example let's use Packet Tracer so that we can

42
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.620
talk about the same protocols together.

43
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:34.430
So on this P.C. I'm an open up a desktop and I'm going to open up a web browser now before I connect

44
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:41.510
to a server I'm going to change the packet tracer mode to simulation mode so that we can see the actual

45
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.390
packets going across the network.

46
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.490
Now I need you to know some terms for the CCMA exam.

47
00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.650
It's basically how we referred to stuff if you like at the different layers.

48
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:59.390
So when data is sent at the physical layer we sending zeros and ones across the physical layer that's

49
00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:00.680
known as butts.

50
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.500
So the bits of data are represented on a fibre cable as light.

51
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.590
So as a basic analogy if there's light it means a one.

52
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.030
If there's no light it means a zero.

53
00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.480
So zero one would represent.

54
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.820
That's why binary values on copper.

55
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.290
Do we have electricity or not.

56
00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:28.730
So most fundamental example would be if there is electricity on a wire it means one if there is no electricity.

57
00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.020
It means a zero.

58
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.010
So think of this as a light going on and a light going off is it on.

59
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.530
Is it off.

60
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.000
And that represents of.

61
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.890
That's so it layer one we have bits on top of that we have frames.

62
00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.820
So at layer two we talk about a frame.

63
00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:50.670
So when we sending data through an Ethan it switch which is a so-called layer two device we are sending

64
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:51.250
frames.

65
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.170
So I'll use these terms.

66
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.880
Frame is getting switched from one port on a switch to another.

67
00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:04.200
So when you hear the term frame remember layer two at least three we have what are called packets so

68
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:10.560
a router which is a layer 3 device will rot packets from one interface to another and add layer four

69
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.100
we have segments.

70
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:19.830
So layer 1 is bits Layer two is frames Layer three is packets layer four segments and then at layer

71
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.540
five to seven we have an application.

72
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.510
Now let me warn you as I demonstrate these protocols it's going to take time because there's a lot of

73
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:33.990
information you may find that it gets a bit boring if you do then do this yourself have a look at the

74
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:39.270
protocols yourself and try and understand the messages but I'm going to spend quite a bit of time going

75
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:46.110
through layer to layers really of four and the layer seven applications to try and help you understand

76
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.330
what's going on.

77
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.360
This kind of stuff is really important to understand.

78
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:56.160
It's basic nitty gritty foundational stuff can be boring but it's important to understand you can't

79
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.890
understand networking if you don't understand the stuff.

80
00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:04.830
So spend the time learning your protocols you will need to put in the effort and spend time learning

81
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:10.350
your protocols if you really want to understand networking if you want to become an ethical hacker you

82
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.760
need to understand the protocol so that you can hack them if you want to become a network engineer you

83
00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:20.580
need to understand the protocols to be able to configure network devices properly and troubleshoot network

84
00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.950
devices or troubleshoot network issues if you want to become an a good application developer you need

85
00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:31.650
to have an understanding of the underlying applications many nightmares are caused today for network

86
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:37.350
engineers because of badly written applications application developers assume some of them who write

87
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:43.500
bad applications that there's unlimited bandwidth there is no unlimited bandwidth if you write a per

88
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:50.310
application it's going to make a network engineer's life very difficult as a lot of old network engineers

89
00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:57.120
will say it's always the networks fault and all the rubbish comes from the top and lands on our heads

90
00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:02.910
because people will blame the network even when there's an application that's at fault make sure that

91
00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:08.160
you spend your time learning your protocols so that you can prove it's not a network issue but it's

92
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.150
an application issue.
