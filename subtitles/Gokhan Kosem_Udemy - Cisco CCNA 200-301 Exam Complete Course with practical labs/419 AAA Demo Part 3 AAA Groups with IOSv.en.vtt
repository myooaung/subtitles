00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:07.910
Now the main difference between the old way of doing it and the new way is that we can create groups

2
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:15.560
to use the common tax server and you give your server a name you specify the IP address and key of the

3
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.120
tax server.

4
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:23.490
Previously you top those two commands but now you can figure the configuration as follows.

5
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:31.250
You also create groups which you can use to provide different services so you type Triple A group server.

6
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:41.210
In this case tack X and create a group which then maps back to the server previously created and now

7
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:49.500
when you specify your log in you point to this ACARS group here rather than pointing simply to attack

8
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.360
x.

9
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:58.090
This gives you more flexibility than what you had previously this rather is running Iowa's v version

10
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.730
15 dot 6 of Iowa's.

11
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:11.440
So it's a lot newer version and then the other riders noticed 15 dot 6 2 so all configure the strata

12
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:12.840
using the new method.

13
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:23.290
Which is the method that you need to know for the CCMA Exam committee Triple A new model.

14
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:32.040
Now before I enter that at the moment please note that there is no authentication to log in but what

15
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:42.880
I'll do now is enable Triple A New Model specify a backup use the name of David with a positive Cisco

16
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.370
note once again that

17
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:56.080
the console has no authentication configured on it and neither do the other lines such as the orcs and

18
00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:05.950
v2 why lines tack X and the difference now is we have space server and now we can specify a name so

19
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.920
AC s or whatever name you want.

20
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:17.550
This gives us different options but as an example we can specify the IP version for address of the server

21
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.350
and the key that's going to be used.

22
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:31.100
So we've specified the address of the server and the key for the encryption to the server top exit.

23
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:39.620
And now we can use the command Triple A group server in our example it's going to be TAC X and we've

24
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:47.650
just given a name of AC as group various options are available but now we can specify server and the

25
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.950
name of the server which we created previously.

26
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.330
So this is referring back to the server that we created.

27
00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:01.460
So these commands are sub commands as follows top exit.

28
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:09.120
And now we can type Triple A authentication log in we're going to use a default list to apply it to

29
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.580
all the lines.

30
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.740
And now we're going to specify a group which in our case is going to be a CSKA group and then we'll

31
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:27.060
use local as a backup mechanism.

32
00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:33.910
Now the IP address on gigabit 00 is tendered wandered wandered to a 4 so back in ACARS.

33
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:42.710
We need to specify rather for tendered wandered 1 to a 4 click submit and apply.

34
00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.380
Route has now been added.

35
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:54.840
So now on the console of the rota notice we have prompted for a username specify admin specify positive

36
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.350
Cisco

37
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.300
try that again admin Cisco

38
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.010
try the local username and password that works so there there's a problem

39
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:18.940
between the broader and the ACARS server and we'll just confirm our configuration so we've created a

40
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:25.540
group called ACARS group which is the same over here that's failing at the moment and we're getting

41
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.720
a local authentication the server that we're pointing to is ACARS

42
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.960
which we can see over here.

43
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:44.490
Password is Cisco for the communication to this ACARS server let's confirm that we did that right on

44
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.120
the ACM server.

45
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:55.210
Notice I forgot to put a key in Sol specify key of Cisco click submit and apply and now we'll try again.

46
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.780
So username is admin password is Cisco.

47
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.890
We are straight in so that works if we try.

48
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.430
DAVID In other words the local username and password that should fail.

49
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:21.250
And it does because that user is once again not configured in AC S. So on our reports failed attempts

50
00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:31.890
we can see that David's authentication failed for this router ten dot one dot one or two for so let's

51
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:43.160
copy this configuration and I'll configure this iris v layer to switch with that configuration at the

52
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:50.630
moment the switch has no configuration so I'll create an IP address tendered wondered one to a five

53
00:05:53.620 --> 00:06:02.330
on the switch can it paying the AC ACARS server yes it can.

54
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.500
So now we can paste that ISIS configuration into the switch and there you go.

55
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:17.950
Back on the ACARS server we need to add our switch so switch one tendered wondered one or two a five

56
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.350
positive Cisco submit that.

57
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.900
So there we go.

58
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:33.220
So now when we exit out of the switch and log back in we are prompted for our username and password

59
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.420
and admin.

60
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:45.600
Cisco succeeds where as a user of David and Cisco fails because that user name is not configured on

61
00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.130
the AC a server.

62
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:51.270
So once again admin Cisco succeeds.

63
00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:58.170
So this is the advantage we've got one two three four five devices using a centralized AC server.

64
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:07.600
If someone else joined the company we could create another user account such as Peter and click at

65
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:22.700
specified Peter's password click submit so we now have admin Peter and use a one configured on the switch.

66
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.970
Notice there is no user name

67
00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:40.730
called Peter is only a user called David but if we log in with the new user of Peter they can log in

68
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.760
and we can do that on any of the devices.

69
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:50.900
So as an example on Roddick 3 we can log in without a problem.

70
00:07:50.980 --> 00:08:03.300
We could even Telnet to say Radha to and log in as Peter by configuring AC Yes we don't have to configure

71
00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.810
multiple databases of usernames and passwords.

72
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:14.840
We don't have to configure the V.T. y orcs and console ports on every individual device.

73
00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:23.280
The authentication of all those ports will be handled through triple A and will leverage a central database.

74
00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:31.860
In my example I'm using a Cisco ACM server that's integrated through G and S3 and is providing the authentication

75
00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:40.680
for all of these devices centrally using a local database but ACARS could point to an active directory

76
00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:48.660
database and use the usernames and passwords stored in windows for authentication to network devices.

77
00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:56.820
As soon as you have many devices in your network it makes sense to use a radius or tax server such as

78
00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:04.580
Cisco AC ACARS for your centralized authentication authorization and accounting.

79
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:12.310
In this example I was demonstrating X but you could also use radius as the protocol between the Rado

80
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.760
or switch and ACM server.
