00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.780
So in my network I'll have my sister looks over connected to Rod one which in turn is connected to rodded

2
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.410
to my sister looks over has an IP address of 1 2 1 6 8 1 2 5 4

3
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:28.790
and it can ping the loop packs of both routers Kibby says luck is running on the Windows PC over here.

4
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.550
So now let's configure logging messages on the Rodda to say logging

5
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.910
and I need to specify an IP address if I want to log to that server.

6
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.600
So 1 2 1 6 8 1 1 0 8.

7
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.330
That is once again the IP address of the PC

8
00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:08.040
and then I'm going to say logging crap seven now before enable logging on Rodda to let's have a look

9
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.940
at logging.

10
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.830
So show log

11
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:21.340
we can see that trap logging is set to debugging and I'm logging to this server according to the Rodda.

12
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:30.100
Two messages have already been logged to the server and I can actually see that here in my Kibby says

13
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.050
log server.

14
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.190
So something was configured by the console and logging has been enabled.

15
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:44.880
So what's nice now is I could actually do something simple like just pressing control the controls it.

16
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.210
And notice I can see the output on the SSAs looks over.

17
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:56.390
Now I'm not seeing anything on my console because my console at the moment is set to level arrows.

18
00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.150
So let's change that.

19
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:07.920
So logging console 7 or debugging I see the output here and I also see it on my server.

20
00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:14.800
Now one of the things that you'll notice is that the date and time stamps are not correct but top show

21
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.950
clock you can see that the clock is set to March 2002.

22
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:35.060
So let's set the clock to the current time at the moment here in the UK and it's the 16th of May 2016.

23
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.360
At the moment.

24
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:45.410
So show clock Notice please that on my server change from March to May.

25
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.060
So that update has been done.

26
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:58.170
You can also see in this case that there are some SPF messages because I am running a debug adjacencies

27
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.690
on the router so my time stamps have been enabled properly.

28
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.660
Foretop show run piping clewed log.

29
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:17.130
Notice service time stamps log date time milliseconds allows me to specify that time stamps will be

30
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.460
included in logging messages.

31
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.500
That's a very important command to add to your router so that you actually get the date and time stamps

32
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.030
on your log messages.

33
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.320
Otherwise you would know when things took place.

34
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:39.530
So before I explain some of the options let's do a test of shut the interface down on rodded to and

35
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.790
then shut it.

36
00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:48.970
And what you should see now is I get logging messages on my console but I'm also getting those logging

37
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.970
messages on my server.

38
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:59.050
So I'm seeing all the logging messages not only on the console but I'm seeing it on my sis server.

39
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.800
So this is a better way of storing log messages.

40
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:11.050
There are other options available and you can have a look at the online help for more details.

41
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:18.730
I simply wanted to show you here how to get a log system running and integrate it between a Cisco router

42
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.530
running and Jena's 3 and the solar wind syslog server.
