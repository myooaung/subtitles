1
00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:07.270
En route to show IPO SPF Neighbor noticed the neighbor relationship has changed.

2
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:17.020
To use the loop back address of quadruple 1 so let's enable 0 Escape From router 3 to ensure full connectivity

3
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.670
between all subnets

4
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.860
show IP interface brief will allow me to see the interfaces configured on this Rada and you can see

5
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:33.850
forced Ethan at 0 and the 2 0 interfaces Serial 1 slash 0 and 0 1 slash 1 have IP addresses enabled

6
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:41.520
on them and the interfaces are up let's configure a loop back for the strata interface loop back 0 IP

7
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:52.820
address they just make it quadruple 3 topping the command show IP protocols will allow me to see that

8
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.690
there are no protocols enabled in Misrata once again show IP protocols displays no output has no routing

9
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:10.020
protocols I enabled going into global config mode Rada OSP at and I could use process IP 3 in this case

10
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.700
I'm using different process ideas just to prove the point that the process ideas are local to the Rada

11
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.400
and do not have to be the same across all routers in the real world it would make more sense to use

12
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:31.920
the same process no on all of your orders if possible in other words standardize on a process idea in

13
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:44.420
this case I could top the command network send out wonder 3.0 and put in the wildcard MOS as follows.

14
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:52.500
In other words use the exact inverse of the network mosque and as you can see here a neighbor relationship

15
00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:02.070
was established between Route 3 and Rod a team I could use the command to show IP OSP if neighbors to

16
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:09.610
see that that neighbor relationship has established I could then enable o SPF on Serial 1 Select one

17
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:19.990
so Network 10 dot one dot 5.0 with the wildcard mosque putting it into area 0 and now neighbor relationship

18
00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:27.580
has been established with a root one so do show IPO SPF neighbors shows me that on Route 3 I have two

19
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:37.000
neighbor relationships withdraw to 1 and withdraw a team talking to come on Network 10 1 4 0 will enable

20
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.000
0 SPF on the Fost Ethan at 0 0 interface.

21
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:49.870
So now typing the command to show IP 0 SPF interface allows me to see that always faith is enabled on

22
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:59.960
the first Ethan at 0 0 interface the Serial 1 slash one interface 0 once latch 0 interface but not on

23
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:07.810
the loop back interface even though 0 SPF is not enabled in the loop back interface the Rada I.D. is

24
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.590
set to the loop back IP address.

25
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.880
Lastly I should do this.

26
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:18.290
Network or Drupal 3 exact match area 0.

27
00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.890
Not topping the command to show IPO SPF.

28
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:22.670
Interface

29
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.650
allows me to see that always paper is enabled on the loop back.

30
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:38.970
Interface getting back to privilege mode I can top that Come on show IP 0 SPF neighbor to see my neighbors

31
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:46.350
and once again you can see Rado 1 and at 2 but I could also do this command show IP SPF neighbor and

32
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.340
specify individual neighbor.

33
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.320
And this allows me to see more detailed information about the neighbor.

34
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:59.820
You can see that the neighbor with Roorda i.e. quadruple 1 an interface address 10 1 5 1 is connected

35
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.950
by a serial 1 slash 1 and the neighbor relationship is full.

36
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:10.410
In other words we are exchanging updates with one another background Rado one you can see that the neighbor

37
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.060
relationship with Robert a 3 came up.

38
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:23.640
Right out of that and I can topic and on show IP rot and I can see that I've learned about network quadruple

39
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:32.910
to network quadruple three as well as network 10 1 3 0 and Network 10 1 4 0.

40
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:40.340
Notice this gap means that we're doing load balancing because the costs are the same.

41
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.990
In other words from to one's point of TV to get to Network 10 1 3 0.

42
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.740
We could either use this link which is one hundred twenty eight gigabits per second or we could use

43
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.890
this link which is always under into any extra bits per second.

44
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.300
So they are two possible paths to use to get to this network.

45
00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:07.050
Oh SPF supports equal cost load balancing topping the cam on show IP 0 SPF database allows me to view

46
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:16.050
the 0 SPF topology database and as you can see here for SPF Rada with Idi quadruple 1 process I.D. 1

47
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.380
area 0.

48
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.530
We have learned about three rowdies ourselves.

49
00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.060
Robert 2 and Robert at 3.

50
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.820
The number of links on Rado 1 is set to 6.

51
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:39.690
The reason for that is a serial link as a link count of two a one has two serial links 0 1 6 0 and 0

52
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.160
1 slash 1.

53
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:48.050
In other words two plus two equals four root a one also has a loop back interface plus one equals five.

54
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:54.210
And it has a fast ethernet 00 interface plus one equals six.

55
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.710
I can see that in more detail by topping the Come on show IPO SPF database.

56
00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:05.210
And notice this option Rata and then specifying the Rada I.D. in this case ourselves.

57
00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:14.150
And you can see once again that in area 0 Rada with Rada Ida quadruple 1 has a stub network which is

58
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:20.990
a looped back interface with an IP address of quadruple 1 and Moscow slash that 80 as well as a point

59
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:29.140
to point link connected to neighbouring router quadruple 3 with local IP address 10 1 5 1.

60
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.970
In other words this serial point to point link

61
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:40.950
as well as stub Network 10 1 5 0 slash 24.

62
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:50.420
In other words the network on the serial link it is also connected to RADA quadruple 2 with local IP

63
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.630
address 10 1 2 1.

64
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:59.990
In other words this interface and on that interface we have network 10 1 2 0.

65
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:12.170
We are also connected to network 10 1 1 0 to count those network we have 1 2 3 4

66
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:24.480
5 6 networks connected to Rado 1 notice on serial links there are two entries the entry connected to

67
00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:30.280
the neighboring router on the point the point link as well as the actual subnet.

68
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:39.010
On that point to point link to once again show IP always a database shows me that for local Rada we

69
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:45.270
have 6 as the linked count because there are two entries for the serial links.

70
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:54.910
This is the top a logical database which is shared by all Rodders so unrelated to show IP or SPF database

71
00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:01.270
will allow me to see that that Rada has the same information as Rada 1.

72
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:11.410
It's the same database on router 3 show IP 0 SPF database will allow me to see the exact same database

73
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:17.800
link state routing protocols share the same database within the network or area.

74
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:25.580
These 3 rod is on the same area so all three of them share the exact same database backend Rado one

75
00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:36.790
I could top the command debug IP OSP if events to see event information on router 1.
