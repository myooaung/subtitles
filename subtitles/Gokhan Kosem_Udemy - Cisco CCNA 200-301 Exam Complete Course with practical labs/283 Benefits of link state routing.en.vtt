00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So what are some of the benefits or advantages of link-state routing protocols?

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Well firstly, faster convergence, changes are reported immediately

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and links state routing protocols tend to converge a lot quicker

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
than distance vector routing protocol such as RIP.

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
now that said EIGRP which is an enhanced distance vector routing protocol

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
does also converge very quickly, it has the simplicity of configuration

7
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
of a distance vector routing protocol

8
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
but does have many of the advantages of a link state routing protocol

9
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
link state routing protocols are also more robust as the routers

10
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
know the full topology of the network or area

11
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
they thus tend to be less susceptible to routing loops

12
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
because of their great visibility of the network.

13
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Routers know the topology and can does work out the best route to every destination.

14
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Link state packets are also sequence and acknowledged within OSPF.

15
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So if an update I not received by a router

16
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
it will be retransmitted

17
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
RIP doesn’t form neighbor relationship or peer relationships but OSPF does.

18
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So if 1 router sends an update to a peer

19
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and that peer doesn’t acknowledge receipt of the routing update

20
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
the router will retransmit the update.

21
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The hierarchical design of OSPF

22
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and other link state routing protocols optimizes resources.

23
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
It allows for smaller routing tables

24
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
because of address summarization and fewer Shortest Path First calculation

25
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
because of address hiding, essentially if the network is designed properly

26
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
some routers will have very small routing tables

27
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
compared to others and will do foul fewer calculations.

28
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Routers in area 1, for example, will not be aware

29
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
of all the routes in area 2 or area 3

30
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
because of the use of summarization on the Area Border Routers

31
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and the configuration of special areas such as stub areas.

32
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
The hierarchical design also allows link state routing protocols to scale

33
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and thus work in much larger environments than distances routing protocols could.

34
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Large ISPs in the Internet, for example, may run OSPF or ISIS internally

35
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
within the autonomous systems, OSPF and IS-IS are preferred

36
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
to routing protocols such as RIP because they are a lot more scalable.
