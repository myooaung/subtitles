00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The gigabit Ethernet standard requires that all pins be connected.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So this is an example of a crossover cable for gigabit using the T568B standard.

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Notice all pins are configured in a crossover fashion

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
all 4 pairs of wires are used in this example.

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Now in the past you’d have to know when to use a straight through or crossover cable.

6
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Any of these implementations would use a straight through cable.

7
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So router to switch, PC to switch, PC to bridge or PC to hub.

8
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Any of these implementations would use a crossover cable.

9
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So router to router, switch to switch, PC to PC or hub to hub

10
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
or bridge to switch, PC to server, hub to switch and once again

11
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
router to router, all require crossover cables.

12
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
However today automatic crossover or auto MDIX is widely used.

13
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Auto MDIX was introduced in 1998

14
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and it made to the requirements for crossover cables obsolete

15
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
MDI devices are typically routers or PCs

16
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
MDIX devices are typically switches or hubs.

17
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So they are Medium Dependent Interface crossover devices.

18
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And in the past you would need to connect an MDI device

19
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
such as a PC to switch or hub.

20
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
In the old days once again, certain ports would have a button to flip the roll

21
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
from MDIX to MDI which would allow you to connect a switch to a switch

22
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
using a straight through cable.

23
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
However today in a lot of cases, auto MDI/MDIX

24
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
allows for automatic switching once the cable is connected.

25
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The devices can auto detect the cable type

26
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
so there’s no need to worry as much about cable types today.

27
00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
The straight through cable as an example

28
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
could be used between hubs or between switches.

29
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So in the past, you used to have to use a crossover cable

30
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
between 2 switches but that’s not necessarily required today.

31
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Straight through cables could be used

32
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and devices would work out which side is MDI and which side is MDIX.

33
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
However be careful that’s not always true.

34
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
When on sites you may encounter an older Cisco switch

35
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
that doesn’t support auto MDI/MDIX.

36
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So you may have to use the correct cabling type between all the devices.
