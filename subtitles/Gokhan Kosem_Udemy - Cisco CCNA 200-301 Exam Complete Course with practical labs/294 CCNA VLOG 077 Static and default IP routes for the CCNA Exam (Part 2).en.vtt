00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.650
This is one of multiple videos discussing static routing.

2
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:27.330
I've received a number of questions along the lines of multiple default routes supported on Narada in

3
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:33.520
this apology we have four routers and we are concentrating on Rodda one which has three paths to get

4
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.130
to the loop back over to 5 to get to 2 5.5 to 5.5.

5
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:45.210
One can go via Rodda 2 or via a rotisserie or via a full

6
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:55.770
so have a look at this writing table and tell me which way will Rodda one send traffic to the Luebeck

7
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.870
of route of 5.

8
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.820
So let's do a trace.

9
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:09.230
What you'll notice is that the pings fail and they fail because the gateway of last resort is not configured

10
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.180
and there's no specific Raat to 5.5 at 5 5.

11
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:24.000
If we use the command debug IP packet we'll be able to see what happens when one pings wrote a five

12
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.910
I'll send a single ping in this example.

13
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.450
And what you'll notice is we told that the packet is unreadable.

14
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.200
The router doesn't know where to forward the packet.

15
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.440
So it simply drops it.

16
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:46.390
If we want to send traffic to of 5 we need to configure a static ROFFT or configure a routing protocol.

17
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:56.030
This option is called a default route so we can configure a default route pointing to either a local

18
00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.170
interface or to the next hop IP address.

19
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:08.600
So this option ABC forwarding routers IP address allows us to specify the next hop IP address and we

20
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.720
can also specify a administer of distance for the route.

21
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.110
I'm not going to do that here.

22
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.090
I'm going to press a carriage return.

23
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.490
What this has done is set a default route to route a.

24
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:32.340
So show IP Raat now shows that we have a gateway of last resort configured of tamed wondered or too

25
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:42.770
to the default network we can see a static ROFFT So notice the stall asterisk denoting candidate to

26
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:50.730
default prompt the Rodda has a default route via tendered wonder wonder to notice the administer of

27
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:58.440
distance of the rodders one the administer of distance or believability of a static route to a next

28
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.350
hop IP address is one.

29
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.980
So that's a lot lower than a writing protocol such as I was P.F. or up as an example has an admin distance

30
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.550
of 120 if you can figure out a static route to the local outgoing interface it would have and it must

31
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.850
of dozens of Zerah.

32
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:24.660
So now when we paying quadruple five the ping works all turn off that debug and do that again.

33
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:33.410
So Ping succeeds and if we trace to the loopback it's going via router to 10 1 1 2 and that's because

34
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.180
once again the default route is pointing to router 2.

35
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.120
So can we configure another default route.

36
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:48.730
So as an example can we configure it to go via router 3 10 1 to 2.

37
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.150
And the answer is yes we can.

38
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.890
If we configure it to default the gateways.

39
00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:02.100
Notice how it shows in the running table we can paying wrote a 5.

40
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:08.580
And when we trace to ratify if the route is going to load balance across those two paths.

41
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:16.040
So it's going to load balance with one packet going to 10 1 to 2 and one packet going to 10 1 1 2 and

42
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.250
we can see that in the output here.

43
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.100
Notice the traces are load balanced across rodded 2 and router 3.

44
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:31.170
And then we see Rodda 5 as the next top depending on which path that traffic took.

45
00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.740
So that either goes via the top link or the second link.

46
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:48.420
So show I P-ROC shows us that again we could add a third route via Rodda for a show IP route notice

47
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:56.070
we have three entries in the writing table and if we trace to 5.5 to 5.5 traffic is load balanced across

48
00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.640
those three static rounds.

49
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.930
So in answer to the question can you have a multiple default routes.

50
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.820
The answer is yes you can.

51
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.890
The ratable load balance across those parts equally.

52
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.730
Now you can change the ministry of distance.

53
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:20.640
So at the moment if I top do show run piping clewed route will see the three static routes in the running

54
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:29.840
config of the router and what we could do as an example is remove the Roths from the writing table

55
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.880
and add them back with different admen distances.

56
00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:44.170
So previously the administer of distance was one but we cannot change that before we change it.

57
00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:51.120
Notice to show IP Raat shows us that we no longer have any routes to route a 5.

58
00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:57.980
And if we are paying that back to look back the pings are failing because theres no rot in the rotting

59
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.070
table.
