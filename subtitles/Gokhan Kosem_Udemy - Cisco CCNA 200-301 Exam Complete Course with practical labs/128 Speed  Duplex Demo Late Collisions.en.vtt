00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Here’s router 1, which is this device

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and I'll ping router 2 from router 1 to see if ping succeed.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So ping 10.1.1.2 ping succeed.

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
But notice we are getting a message that there's a duplex mismatch

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
between the router and the 2950-1 switch.

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So we’ve been told that there’s a duplex problem here and on the switch

7
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
we're seeing that there’s a duplex mismatch on F0/3 to the router.

8
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So we’ve been told that there’s a duplex problem here

9
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:51.000
but we're also told that there’s a duplex issue on F0/4 to the 2950-2 switch on F0/4

10
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
so there’s a problem here as well.

11
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Now you may not be physically connected to the console

12
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and hence you may not see this issues

13
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
that’s a good reason to use a syslog server or a management application

14
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
from a company such as SolarWinds.

15
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So let’s ping router 2 again.

16
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Ping succeeds, so pings aren't necessarily a good way to test for duplex mismatches.

17
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:32.000
However I'll do an extended ping to that router so let’s try that again 10.1.1.2

18
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I'll send a thousand pings and I’m gonna make the datagram size, a large size

19
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000
so we wanna send a large of traffic unto the network and hopefully we'll encounter

20
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
problem and there you go, we’ve got a message saying a late collision has occurred.

21
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So this is a problem you my encounter.

22
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
One side may tell you that there are late collisions as you can see over there.

23
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Were getting a number of late collisions, on the other side were not seeing that.

24
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:24.000
so on the switch sh int f0/3 we're not seeing a lot of late collisions

25
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
the configuration of that interface is set to a speed of 10 meg

26
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and duplex are full but notice on this side sh running-config int f0

27
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
this side has its speed sets to 100 lets confirm that.

28
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:54.000
sh int f0 notice the duplex is half, speed is set in this example to 10 Mbps

29
00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
so the router because it can't negotiate properly with the other device in this case

30
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:10.000
the 2950 switch has set its speed to a value of 10 meg half duplex.

31
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
So the point to remember is when there is a mismatch

32
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.000
the side that is set for half duplex will see a late collisions on the connection

33
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
but this only occurs when you're sending enough traffic.

34
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
so a standard ping doesn’t show that problem

35
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
but when a large amount of traffic is sent on this half duplex connection

36
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:49.000
we're getting a late collisions on the switch side sh int f0/3

37
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:58.000
notice the speed is full duplex 10 Mbps where's in the router it's half duplex 10 Mbps.

38
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:06.000
even though I configured it to use 100 Mbps, its using a failed back position

39
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
of the worst case scenario which is 10 meg half duplex

40
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
and in this case we're having that problem.

41
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Notice this is 100 bases TXFX where's this side is 100base TX.

42
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000
So in this example the router has gone for half duplex 10 Mbps

43
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
where's the switch is is using 10 meg full duplex

44
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and hence we’ve got a duplex mismatch.

45
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000
So in summary we get told by CDP that there is a duplex mismatch.

46
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
The local interface is not using full duplex

47
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
where’s the other side is using full duplex.

48
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Pinging a device doesn’t tell us that there’s a problem

49
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
but when large packets are sent

50
00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:03.000
It uses main counter drops for throughput and you may see late collisions.

51
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:11.000
So let me exaggerate that link again, send a thousand pings

52
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:21.000
large data gram size, sh int f0/3

53
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Notice we are now seeing the late collisions taking place on the interface.

54
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.000
So on a half duplex side, we see this output of late collisions.

55
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.000
On the interface, sh int f0 notice the number of late collisions has increased.

56
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000
On the full duplex side we make it input errors such as CRC errors or runt frames.

57
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
so in this example we’ve got 28 input errors, 15 CRC's

58
00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
were aren’t seeing any runts but we are receiving duplex mismatch messages.
