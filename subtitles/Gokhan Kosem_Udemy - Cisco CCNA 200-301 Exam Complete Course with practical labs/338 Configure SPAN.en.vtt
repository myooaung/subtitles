00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:15.000
So now on 37 51 the switch that the monitoring station is connected to confetti monitor session.

2
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:22.880
We want to configure a spend session so we use the session command on do the switch 66 span sessions

3
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:30.320
could be configured if we wanted to configure span on the twenty nine fifty switch it doesn't support

4
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:39.480
the same number of sessions on the switch it only supports two sessions the number of active span sessions

5
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.320
however is switch dependent.

6
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.880
Have a look at the documentation of the switch here we'll simply configure session one to keep it simple

7
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:56.340
we need to specify a source as well as a destination of the span session so the source in our example

8
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:08.200
will be the LAN one and I want to capture traffic both sent and received in VLAN 1 you need to be careful

9
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:15.730
spanning a v lan if a lot of traffic is transmitted and received on that VLAN you could oversubscribed

10
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:23.230
the port as an example of the switch had 24 ports and you spanned all of those ports to this single

11
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:30.040
interface you would possibly overwhelm this physical interface as another example you don't want to

12
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:37.120
span a gigabit port to 100 make port and in the same way you need to make sure that your capturing device

13
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:43.180
can handle the traffic that it's receiving you don't want to as an example forward one gigabits per

14
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:51.490
second of traffic to P.C. with a slow CPSU that can't capture or handle the amount of traffic that you

15
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.270
throwing at it.

16
00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:01.390
As an analogy we as people may drink water from a gloss or from a tap but generally not from a fire

17
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:08.860
hydrant because the rate of water that's sent out of a fire hydrant is far more than you can drink.

18
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:16.810
So don't overload or overwhelm the port as well as the P.C. by sending too much spam traffic out of

19
00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.120
this port.

20
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.130
So now monitor session we need to specify the same session no.

21
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.670
And we're going to specify a destination in this case it's going to be a local interface on the switch

22
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:40.580
fast ethernet 1 0 5 I'll talk about the encapsulation and ingress options in a moment.

23
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:47.600
For now we're just going to forward the traffic out of the port so do show run pipe include monitor

24
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.060
we configured this command as well as this command on the switch show.

25
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.670
Monitor

26
00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.420
we can see that we have one active session it's a local session it's looking at traffic sent and received

27
00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:15.020
on VLAN 1 that's the source destination is Port Fost Ethan at 1 0 5 we're using the native a villain

28
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:23.910
as the encapsulation ingress traffic is disabled so now on the capturing piece P.S. we'll filter for

29
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.540
ICMP and let's restart that capture

30
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:40.230
and en route a one all ping routed to and notice we can see the traffic which we weren't able to see

31
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.780
before.

32
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:48.880
Here is a source ICMP packet from router 1 Notice the MAC address ending in 0 1.

33
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:58.450
Going to write it to it's a unit cost here the IP addresses a 10 1 1 1 going to 10 1 1 2 it's an echo

34
00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.620
request.

35
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:12.120
Here's the reply It's also a unique cost frame from Rod a 2 to write a 1 unit cost IP addresses it's

36
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.890
a ping reply.

37
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:24.990
Now if a 1 Telnet to write a 2 and logs in we should be able to see that telnet traffic on the capturing

38
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:36.920
device and we can so notice as an example he has some telnet information I'll scroll down the rod is

39
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:47.630
asking for a password he has the password C I S SEO we could also follow the DCP stream

40
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:56.380
and we'll be able to see the password in this example because we are capturing traffic sent and received

41
00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.270
on the V Line.

42
00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:07.920
We're getting some duplicates but as an example if on top enable password show run and look at the running

43
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:22.490
config of that router if I fall to for telnet traffic again we'll be able to see the line Viti Y and

44
00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.750
the password is shown on the line Viti y in the running config of the Rada.

45
00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.050
So that's the conflict on the router.

46
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.950
And here it's seen in the wash out capture.

47
00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:42.920
I could once again follow the TCB stream and I'll see the full configuration of the rudder as captured

48
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.320
on the monitoring station.

49
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:50.930
So what's happening now is when traffic is received or sent on VLAN 1 it's been forwarded out of this

50
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:51.610
port.

51
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.080
And the capturing device running why shark is able to view the traffic.

52
00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:03.710
So what we did is create a monitoring session monitor session 1 capturing on VLAN 1 and the destination

53
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:04.900
as fast Ethernet.

54
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:18.300
1 05 if we remove the monitoring session so do show run pipe include monitor we can see that there's

55
00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.960
no output.

56
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.320
In other words the monitoring session has been removed.

57
00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.930
Now when we do the capture

58
00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:42.130
and we for instance filter for ICMP traffic and paying a T from Route One we don't see any output.

59
00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:47.140
So no ICMP traffic is shown if we fall to for telnet

60
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:54.650
and then Telnet to 10 1 1 2.

61
00:06:54.860 --> 00:07:04.190
We don't see anything but if we put to the monitoring session back so monitor session choose a number

62
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:05.040
one.

63
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:14.750
And in this case all monitor and interface if one 0 3 which is this interface over here and we'll do

64
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:29.490
both and then we'll specify a destination of first Ethan at 1 0 5 what we should see now is once that

65
00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:37.420
kicks in as you can see over there we are able to see the Telnet information.

66
00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:39.450
So there's the prompter wrote it too.

67
00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.140
And if I scroll up we can see the password.

68
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:49.080
So the right is asking for a enabled password and he has the password that I typed which is Cisco and

69
00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:58.520
then I pressed into once again if we follow that stream you can see the password that was typed so it's

70
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:02.710
as simple as that to create a monitoring session it's a show.

71
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:11.950
Monitor in this example we've got session one which is a local session capturing traffic in and out

72
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:24.110
of this port and it's going to this destination port 1 0 5 encapsulation is native English traffic is

73
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:25.370
disabled.

74
00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:26.990
So let's talk about ingress traffic.
