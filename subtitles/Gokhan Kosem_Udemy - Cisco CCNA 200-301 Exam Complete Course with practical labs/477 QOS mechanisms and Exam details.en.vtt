00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.530
So what is the Cisco quality of service toolset.

2
00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:11.670
The S.R. indie guy discusses the following mechanisms or quality of service tool sets that allow you

3
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.140
to implement quality of service.

4
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.020
This is what is emphasized in the CCMA exam.

5
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.470
The exam talks about marking device trust.

6
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.710
Pro translation shaping policing and congestion management.

7
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.420
And if you look at the mechanisms listed in the s or indeed guide we have classification and mocking

8
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:43.520
policing and markdown scheduling link specific tools and there are some additional options such as order

9
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.260
cause and called Mission Control.

10
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.070
He has a graphic showing the quality of service toolset.

11
00:00:51.170 --> 00:01:00.530
Now these mechanisms apply to differentiate its services or serve into serve has its own mechanisms

12
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:01.790
and best effort.

13
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.600
Essentially it doesn't have these mechanisms.

14
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.320
It simply treats all traffic the same.

15
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.630
Firstly we have a mission control.

16
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.300
Will your call as an example be permitted across the IP network.

17
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.790
If there is over subscription of the link a voice call may need to take an alternate path classification

18
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.280
and marking is essentially looking at traffic types and putting them into classes.

19
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.950
So is it voice traffic.

20
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.350
If it is then it goes into a certain class.

21
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.740
Is it video traffic then it would go into a different class.

22
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.940
Is it FCP FCP would go into a third class.

23
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.190
We have policing and markdown.

24
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.570
If you're sending too much traffic your traffic could be dropped or the quality of service given to

25
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.270
you could be lowered.

26
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.060
Then we have scheduling which includes queuing and dropping.

27
00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:04.680
We have traffic shaping and link specific mechanisms we'll start off with classification and marking.

28
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:14.090
When you send a package with FedEx or DHL that package needs to be marked for next day delivery or urgent

29
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:22.370
delivery or standard delivery a label gets put onto the package to indicate how important that package

30
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.080
is when the package is sent from one depot to another.

31
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.760
They don't open the package to determine the quality of service that that package would get.

32
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:40.160
They look at the label and the label determines the quality of service that the package gets in the

33
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.890
same way when a telephone sends packets into a network.

34
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.620
It needs to mark those packets as important so that every switch and router along the path can treat

35
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.810
the packet differently when compared to say FCP sent by.

36
00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:04.640
P.S. so when packets are forwarded from the phone to the first switch it needs to indicate using some

37
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.800
kind of marking or label or field that the packet is important.

38
00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:17.780
It needs to be treated better than say in FTB packet when switch one sends the packet to switch to it

39
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:24.350
needs to indicate to that switch that the packet is important and in the same way when the second switch

40
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:30.980
sends the packet to the rudder it needs to indicate to the broader that the packet is of great importance.

41
00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.220
Now this introduces the concept of a trust boundary.

42
00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.500
Who do we trust in the network.

43
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.320
As an example does the rod of trust switch to the switch to trust.

44
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:43.530
Which one as an example.

45
00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.990
If these devices trust the markings that they receive from each other or the quality of service settings

46
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.950
that they receive from one another then the trust boundary ends over here.

47
00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:02.670
In other words the switch doesn't trust the phone and the switch doesn't trust the P.C..

48
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:10.730
If however the switch did trust the phone the trust boundary would be extended to the phone as is the

49
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.710
case with a lot of IP phones.

50
00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:22.170
We could have a P.C. connected to a phone so we could connect to the P.C. to the back of the phone and

51
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.830
in that case the trust boundary would end at the phone.

52
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.910
In other words the switches and the router trust the phone but they don't trust the P.C..

53
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:38.580
So if the P.C. sends traffic to the phone telling the phone that its traffic is important the phone

54
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.520
will not trust those markings.

55
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:48.120
All those values and would override them in the same way switch one doesn't trust the markings or values

56
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:54.720
sent by the P.C. but it would trust the markings or values sent by the phone and again switch to would

57
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.180
trust what switch one tells it and the writer would trust.

58
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:06.030
Switch to as an analogy if you go to the airport and your ticket says that you have a first class ticket

59
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:12.380
you will be treated differently to someone who has a economy class ticket.

60
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.410
But the people at the airport won't accept a ticket that you've just made up.

61
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.430
So if you just printed out your own ticket they're not going to trust that unless they can reference

62
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:23.160
it officially.
