00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This is one of the GNS3 topologies which we’ll configure as part of this course.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
This GNS3 topology is utilizing the GNS3 VM

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and I’ve loaded IOSvL2 images to the GNS3 VM

4
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
In addition I am using a Cisco IOS router image

5
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
also running within the GNS3 VM

6
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and I have that image available on both the local GNS3 server

7
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
in other words running within Windows as well as on the GNS3 VM

8
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Under edit I am going to preferences and I’ve configured an image

9
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
running on the local serveras well as the GNS3 VM

10
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You don’t have to configure the image in both places

11
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I’ve just done that for a various demonstrations in the Course

12
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I’ve also got an NPM server which I’ll use to manage this network using SNMP

13
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I’ll configure the various parts of this network throughout the course

14
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
but at the end of the course

15
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I’ll have all of these videos together in one place

16
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
so if you want to watch all of the config in a one go you can do that

17
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Now don’t worry too much if you don’t know all the terms

18
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
that I am going to be using in this explanation

19
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
We’ll be discussing this throughout the course

20
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
but this topology gives us a nice scenario

21
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
to build upon and shows you how the different technologies

22
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
that we’re learning about can be implemented in a proper network

23
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
In this topology we have 2 core switches

24
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
as well as 2 access switches

25
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
but pretend that we have more than 2 access switches

26
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Configuring more than 2 is kind of redundant

27
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
in what we're doing here but I'll perhaps

28
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
extend this topology and make it more complex

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
to show you a larger topology as part of this scenario

30
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Various things need to be configured in this network

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
we have to configure IP Addressing

32
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
we have to confugure VLANs

33
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
we have to configure VTP or VLAN Trunking Protocol

34
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
We've got to configure Inter-VLAN routing

35
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
between the various IP Addresses

36
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
We've got to configure links such as these as trunk ports

37
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
these links Gigabit02 on the Access Switch

38
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
needs to be configured as Access Ports

39
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
the reason why is that

40
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
this router, router1 is going to be configured in VLAN10

41
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and is going to act as a host in the network

42
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
so we're actually using a Cisco IOS image

43
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
but it's going to mimic a host device

44
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
tha same with this router which is going to be

45
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
configured in VLAN20

46
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
So this will also act as a PC in our topology

47
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Router2 is acting like PC2 in our topology

48
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
but ratehr than using PCs to do this

49
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I want to show you how to configure routers

50
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
with static routes and various other options

51
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
to enable connectivity in the network

52
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Router3 is going to act as our gateway to the outside world

53
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
so this router will be configured with NAT or Network Address Translation

54
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and an actual fact it will be using Port Address Translation or PAT

55
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
to NAT these routers acting as PCs

56
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
unto the Internet so that they can access

57
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
sites such as Google.com and others

58
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
This topology is gonna run as a Layer2 topology

59
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
so we need to configure Spanning Tree

60
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Spanning Tree is enabled by default on Cisco Switches

61
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
In this example we want to optimize

62
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Spanning Tree so we will configure PVST

63
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
with this switch as the root for VLAN1 and VLAN10

64
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and this switch has the root for VLAN20

65
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
so Router2 acting as PC2 is gonna send traffic to the core

66
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
using this uplink whereas Router1

67
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
acting as PC1 is gonna sent traffic to the core using this uplink

68
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
We also have to think about the default gateways

69
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.000
If Router1 acting as PC1 has Switch1 as its default gateway

70
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Switch1 will only be able to do

71
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Inter-VLAN Routing for Router1 or PC1 when it's up

72
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
However if Switch1 goes down this PC

73
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
will no longer be able to ping PC2

74
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
or be able to access the Internet

75
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
So we're going to want to implement

76
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
HSRP or Hot Standby Routing Protocol

77
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
to ensure that the default gateways of the PCs

78
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
is in our topology are still available

79
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
when one of the switches go down

80
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
so we will configure HSRP for our user PCsin this topology

81
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
sio that they can continue working

82
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
even when one of the core switches goes down

83
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
This toplogy have redundancy in it

84
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
but Spanning Tree will block ports

85
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
to stop loops in the topology

86
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and may stop ports that you least expects

87
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
So we need to optimize Spanning Tree

88
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
but not only making Switch1 the root for some VLANs

89
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and Switch2 the root for other VLANs

90
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
But we also want to enable Link Aggregation or EtherChannel

91
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
on these 2 core links

92
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Spanning Tree is gonna block one of this ports

93
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
which negates the purpose of having

94
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
multiple ports in the core between our core switches

95
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
so we're gonna want to bond these 2 links together in the Link Aggregation

96
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Once we've configured the network

97
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
we'll test connectivity between PC1 and PC2

98
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
and will test failover to ensure

99
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
that our network provides redundancy

100
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
when one of the switches in the core goes down

101
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
we'll also as mentioned test connectivity to the Internet

102
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and thus we will need to enable a NAT on Router3

103
00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.000
we will also need to enable Routing Protocols on our routers

104
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
and inject a default route from Router3

105
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
So we'll need to enable OSPF or EIGRP

106
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
on our core devices and then advertise

107
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
the default Internet route from Router3

108
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
to both core switches

109
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
We'll also need to enable Simple Network Management Protocol or SNMP

110
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
on our switches so that Network Performance Monitor

111
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
can manage the network

112
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
In addition we're gonna want to use a syslog server

113
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
to sent or restore our log information

114
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
so we'll use NPM to receive syslog messages

115
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
from our devices

116
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
I'll include link to load a video

117
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
where you can load a free trial version

118
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
of Network Performance Monitor

119
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
So there's a lot to do to get this topology to work

120
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
I'll explain the configuration as I am going through this

121
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
but for the basic theory please refer to the

122
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
relevant modules in the course

123
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
So lots to do. Let's get started configuring this topology
