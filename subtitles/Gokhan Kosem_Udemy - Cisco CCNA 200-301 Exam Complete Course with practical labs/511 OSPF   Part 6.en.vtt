00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.370
About five minutes ago and it executed three times.

2
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.730
So let's enable OSP from Robert T and see how the output changes.

3
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:17.260
So in order to show IP interface brief will allow me to see the interfaces configured on this rather.

4
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:25.620
As you can see here 10 1 2 2 as being configured on 0 1 slash 0 and 10 1 3 1 has been configured on

5
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.150
0 1 slash 1.

6
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.690
Let's configure a loop back on this rather interface loop back to 0 IP address

7
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:46.050
and it's configured as portable to topping the command Rata 0 SPF 2 will enable 0 SPF on this rata with

8
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.680
process IGT.

9
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.900
And in this case let's enable 0 SPF using this format.

10
00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:03.430
So I've essentially said just enable 0 SPF on all interfaces and let's put those interfaces in area

11
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.960
0.

12
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:14.180
As you can see here a neighbour relationship or adjacency is being formed neighbour 10 1 5 1 on Serial

13
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:22.850
1 slash 0 has gone from the loading state to the full state the full state means that the rod is exchanging

14
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.820
links state updates with one another.

15
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:35.720
This can get confusing neighbour 10 1 5 1 is not directly connected to us IP address 10 1 5 1 is not

16
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:46.220
directly connected to write it 2 however that IP address is the Rada I.D. of Rada 1 and Rada 2 has formed

17
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:54.140
the neighbour relationship with a Rada 1 and thus the Rada I.D. Barada 1 is shown in the output not

18
00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:02.450
the IP address of Serial 1 select 0 by the same token on Rado 1 notice a neighbour relationship has

19
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.310
been formed with quadruple 2 on Serial 1 Section Zero.

20
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:16.680
Notice that the process idea on Rada 1 is 1 Where's the process idea on Robert T it's t process ideas

21
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:24.850
are local to the is and do not have to be the same so I can top that come on show IP 0 SPF interface

22
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.320
and you can see that SPF is enabled in the loop back interface 0 1 so one interface serial one slash

23
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.110
0 interface which are the three interfaces configured on Rod a T.

24
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:46.360
Going back to RADA 1 and topping the command show IPO SPF will allow me to see that the SPF algorithm

25
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:56.520
has now been executed five times because new rods have been added to the topology show IP 0 SPF neighbor

26
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.970
will allow me to see my OSB of neighbors a one at the moment only has a neighbor relationship with Rod

27
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.970
to notice the relationship is full.

28
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:15.790
Notice the dash the dash means that no election has taken place on this interface and the reason why

29
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:22.330
is that it's a point to point link on a fast ethernet network you would see various states share like

30
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:30.680
D.R. for designated Rada BTR for backup designated Rada and D or rather in other words the neighbor

31
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:40.600
is neither ADR or a BTR it's important to realize this come on show IPO SPF neighbor is giving me information

32
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.350
about my neighbor rather not about me.

33
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:51.760
In other words neighbor with IP address quadruple 2 is connected to our local serial 1 slash 0 interface

34
00:03:52.300 --> 00:04:03.110
and the neighbors IP address on that interface is 10 1 2 2 en route at 2 show IP SPF neighbor will allow

35
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:10.950
me to see similar information for router 1 Notice right one's neighbor ideas 10 1 5 1 now as per base

36
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:17.620
practice we should be using a loop back for the right I.D. rather than a physical interface so on Rado

37
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.780
1 let's create a loop like interface

38
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:37.670
and topic am on do show IP 0 SPF interface and you'll notice that the Rada ideas remain the same.

39
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:45.420
You'll also notice that the loop back interface is not in the list of interfaces and the reason for

40
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:54.930
that is that we only enabled OSP upon specific interfaces so topping the command do show run pipe section

41
00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:03.410
Oh SPF will allow me to see the configuration of SPF and the running configuration.

42
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.490
And as you can see here oh SPF has not been enabled on the looped back interface.

43
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:22.540
So let's type Rada or SPF 1 network and let's specify a loop back address now topping the command do

44
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:34.140
show IP SPF interface shows me that my Rada ideas stole 10 1 5 1 Let's type this game on clear IP 0

45
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:42.700
yet process and say yes to care will always be processes as you can see the neighbour relationship went

46
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:52.270
down and then re-established show IP 0 SPF interface will show me that the Rada ideas stole 10 1 5 1

47
00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.100
not could remove a wispy if and re enable it.

48
00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:05.080
That's a bit of a blunt instrument to change the right idea so I'm going to go quantity Rada 0 SPF 1

49
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:14.140
Rada I.D. and then specify the Rada ideas quadruple 1 and notice what the Rada says either reload or

50
00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:25.930
use the clear IP SPF process command for this to take effect so let's type clear IP 0 SPF process say

51
00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:33.910
yes to kill all processes and see what happens once again in a relationship went down and re-established

52
00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:43.900
topping it come on show IP SPF interface shows me that the Rada I.D. is now set to quadruple 1 en route

53
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.140
it to show IPO SPF neighbor.

54
00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:55.130
Notice the neighbor relationship has changed to use the loop back address of quadruple 1 so let's enable

55
00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:00.170
0 Escape from Route 3 to ensure full connectivity between all subnets

56
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.240
show IP interface brief will allow me to see the interfaces configured on this rather.
