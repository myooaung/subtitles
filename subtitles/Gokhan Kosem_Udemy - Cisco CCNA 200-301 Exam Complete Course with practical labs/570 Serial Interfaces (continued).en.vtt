00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:08.880
So this is once again an example of an external Sea issue issue connected using a v 35 cable to a router.

2
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:14.320
Here's an example with the weak card having the C as you d issue built in.

3
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:22.340
So what's the bolting C issue D issue such as a weak one D issue t 1 the card would be used to connect

4
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.860
it to either T1 or fractional T1 connections.

5
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:33.250
The advantage of using this card over an external C issue D issue is that you have fewer devices and

6
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.910
cables to deploy and manage.

7
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:42.930
It also allows you to remotely configure monitor and troubleshoot using the well-known Cisco C ally

8
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.310
and it obviously saves some space because you have fewer devices.

9
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.790
So in many cases in the United States people would use the Bolton C issue D issue but in other parts

10
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.840
of the world you may still be required to use an external C issue issue.

11
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.310
So what are some of the advantages of a leased line.

12
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:08.850
Well firstly it's very simple to configure you can get a lease line up and running with just a few commands

13
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.560
so it's very simple to install and maintain point to point lease lines.

14
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.920
Also offer a high quality of service provided that there's adequate bandwidth for the traffic traversing

15
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.900
the link.

16
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.490
In other words the bandwidth of the connection is dedicated to you and you alone.

17
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.510
No one else will be able to use the bandwidth on that circuit.

18
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:36.960
You are typically paying a monthly charge for the leased line and the bandwidth on that leased line

19
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.320
is dedicated to you alone.

20
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.150
The connection is also permanent so you don't have to try and set it up every time you send traffic.

21
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:52.750
The bandwidth is there and they're always for you to use the major disadvantage of the leased lines

22
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.340
however is normally the cost of the lease line.

23
00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.890
Now if you've only got two sites the cost may not be that great.

24
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.800
However if you've got 10 sites that you need to connect in a full mesh.

25
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.680
In other words every site needs to be connected to every other site.

26
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.700
The cost can become very prohibitive as there's an exponential increase in the cost as you add more

27
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.170
and more sites.

28
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.610
That's one of the reasons that small medium businesses today prefer to use DSL connections with a VPN

29
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.770
rather than using leased lines and large businesses.

30
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.260
When making connections to remote branch offices may also prefer to use the Internet with DSL as the

31
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.840
local connection type with VPN is overlaid across the Internet.

32
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.590
It's a lot a lot cheaper especially when you have many many sites.

33
00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.780
Another problem is you are charged for the bandwidth whether you use it or not.

34
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.800
So as an example if you've got a 2 megabits per second circuit or two megabits per second leased line

35
00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.640
you are charged a monthly fee for that leased line whether you use the bandwidth or not.

36
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.640
If you're only using some of the bandwidth some of the time you are paying for bandwidth that you don't

37
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.520
use.

38
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.090
So that's another disadvantage of a lease line.

39
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.260
You also have no ability to burst or go above the fixed limit of 2 megabits per second.

40
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.610
You are limited to the speed of the link.

41
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.900
The bandwidth is yours to use all the time but you can't go above the speed of the leased line.
