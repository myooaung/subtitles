00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So my home router is connected to the Internet

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and can forward the traffic into the Internet

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
even though it doesn’t know all the routes in the Internet

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Internet routing tables are growing all the time

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
so there are more than 500,000 routes on the Internet

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and a small router wouldn't be able to handle that number of routes in its routing table.

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Now it’s possible to telnet to live BGP routers on the Internet.

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So in this example, I’m going to telnet to route-server.ip.att.net

9
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I’m told that I can log in with this user name

10
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
which gives me read only access to the router

11
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and I’m going to type show route summary.

12
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
As you can see here there are 8.5 million odd routes

13
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
in the routing table with 567,000 destinations

14
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
show bgp summary will show me the BGP routing table.

15
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
BGP is the routing protocol used on the Internet.

16
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So total path is 8.5M active path is 567,000

17
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
as you can imagine a small router

18
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
is not going to be able to handle this number of routes in its routing table.

19
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Here you can see examples of routes in the BGP routing table

20
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
on this router and how long thoses route have been in the routing table.

21
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Small routers aren't not going to handle that number of routes

22
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
so you would typically use a default route pointing your router to a gateway of last resort.

23
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So a default route is a special type of static route

24
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
pointing your device or router to a gateway of last resort.

25
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000
This is similar to the concept of a default gate way on a PC or a device

26
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
such as an iPhone or iPad

27
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
when a router doesn’t know where to send the traffic

28
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
it simply sends it to the gateway of last resort.

29
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
In other words, it will send it to this IP address

30
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
as configured with the static default route.

31
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Another advantage of static routes is that you as the administrator

32
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
determine explicitly where traffic flows.

33
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So rather than a routing protocol making the decision for you

34
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
you decide and have control over where traffic goes

35
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
or where packets are routed but on the flip side

36
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
the burden of management and keeping things up to date also fall on your shoulders

37
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
so you have to administer the routing table, keep it up to date

38
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
make sure that routes are not pointing to non-existing devices

39
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
where networks go down, you would have to update the routing table

40
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and that’s simply not scalable in large topologies

41
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
so hence dynamic routing protocols

42
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.000
such as OSPF or EIGRP are used to dynamically add or remove routes from a routing table.

43
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
BGP as mentioned is the routing protocol

44
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
used on the Internet for very large scale implementations.

45
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
The major advantage of dynamic routing protocols is that

46
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
there is the dynamic or automatic adjustment of the routing table

47
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
based on topology changes in your network.

48
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
So rather than you having to manually adjust to a topology change

49
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
the routing protocols update, insert or removed routes

50
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
from the routing table based on changing conditions in the network.

51
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
As soon as you enable a routing protocol

52
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.000
such as OSPF or EIGRP the routers will form a neighbor or peer relationships

53
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
with each other and exchange routes with one another.

54
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
The routers will does automatically learn about the networks available in the topology.
