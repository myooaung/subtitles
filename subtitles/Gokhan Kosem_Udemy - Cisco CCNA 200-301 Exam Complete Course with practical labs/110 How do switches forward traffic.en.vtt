00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So here’s our topology which is very similar to the previous topology

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
but notice the bridge has been replaced by a switch.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Switches are once again layer 2 devices or data link layer devices

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and also have a MAC address table in the similar way to a bridge.

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The network topology is also a star topology where devices are cabled directly

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
to ports on the switch, as an analogy, think of the switch as a bridge

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
but it’s much more powerful and quicker.

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
If you had a problem in a bridge environment

9
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and you replace the bridge with a switch, you would still have the same problems

10
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
but they would occur a lot quicker.

11
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Bridge problem are not solved by switches. Switches simply increase the performance.

12
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So here’s our sample topology once again,

13
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
but in this case we have replaced the bridge with the switch.

14
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
How will traffic flow in this example?

15
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So we once again using easy to read MAC addresses ike A, B, C and D

16
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
rather than full 48 bit MAC addresses and we're doing that to simplify these examples.

17
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So if A sends a frame to C and the frame arrived at the switch on port 1.

18
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
What would the switch do with the frame?

19
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Now in this example let’s assume that the switch is just started up.

20
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So the MAC address table is empty, it hasn’t learnt where devices are on the topology.

21
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Now the switch just like a bridge will flood the frame out of all ports

22
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
because it doesn’t know where C is

23
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
when the frame arrives at the switch to an unknown destination MAC address

24
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
that frame is flooded out of all ports except the port on which the frame arrived.

25
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
However just like a bridge the switch doesn’t just flood the frame out of all ports

26
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
but it also learns where devices are in the topology.

27
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So because the frames was received on port 1

28
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and the source MAC address in the frame is A

29
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
that information is written to the MAC address table of the switch.

30
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
The switch now knows that MAC address A can be found on port 1.

31
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
When C replies to A, the frame would be received on port 3 of the switch.

32
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And the switch would update its MAC address table with that information

33
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
in other words the switch knows that MAC address C can be found on port 3

34
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
but in this case because it knows where the destination MAC address is

35
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
in other words A, it will only send the traffic out of port 1 and that’s because A

36
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
is found in the MAC address table as being available out of port 1.

37
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
The switch doesn’t flood the frame out of all ports.

38
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
So in the same way as a bridge all subsequent frames between A and C are forwarded

39
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
only out of those 2 ports, when A sends another frame to C

40
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
the frame is only sent out of port 3

41
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
because the switch knows that MAC address C can be found on port 3.

42
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
when C replies sending traffic to a destination MAC address of A.

43
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
the switch only forwards that traffic out of port 1 because that is learnt

44
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
that MAC address A can be found on port 1.

45
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
So all traffic between these 2 devices will only flow between port 1 and port 3.

46
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Traffic is not sent out of port 2 or port 4 in a similar way to how a bridge operates.

47
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
In the same way as a bridge

48
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
each interface on the switch is a separate collision domain.

49
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
So if a collision took place on this hub

50
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
it would not affect other ports on the switch.

51
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Each port on a switch is a separate collision domain.

52
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
They are therefore 4 collision domains in this topology.

53
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
A hub once again is a single collision domain.

54
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
So this interface is a single collision domain

55
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
separated from the other interfaces on the switch.

56
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
A switch however, will flood broadcast and multicast traffic by default.

57
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
So this is a single broadcast domain.

58
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
If A sends a broadcast that broadcast will be flooded out of all ports

59
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and will be received by all devices in the topology.

60
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
This is very similar to the way bridges operated.

61
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
You once again have the same issues in a switch environment

62
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
as you would have in a bridge environment.

63
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000
But switches operate at much higher speeds and support a greater number of ports.

64
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
So typically you wouldn’t have only 4 ports on the switch.

65
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000
But in this example we have 4 collision domains and the single broadcast domain.

66
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Now the reason why a broadcast is flooded out of all ports except

67
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:50.000
the ingress port is not a broadcast address consist of 8 hexadecimal Fs at layer 2.

68
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.000
So when a switch receives the frame with a destination address of 8 Fs it will flood

69
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.000
that frame out of all ports because this address of 8 Fs at layer 2 indicates everyone.

70
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
In other words the switch will flood this out of all ports

71
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
except the port on which it received.

72
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000
So in this example, it was received from A and that frame is then flooded everywhere

73
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
because of broadcast is supposed to go to everyone at layer 2.

74
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
That’s what a broadcast is designed to do.

75
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Broadcast addresses also indicate all devices rather than

76
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
a single device so the MAC address table is never populated with the broadcast address.

77
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
This information is not written to the MAC address table

78
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
as the Unicast MAC address would have been.

79
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Broadcast addresses are not associated with specific

80
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
or an individual ports on which the broadcast is received

81
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
it is always flooded out of all ports except the port on which it's received.

82
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Now as always there are exceptions and we'll talk more about those exceptions later.

83
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000
There are some major advantages to using switches over hubs and bridges.

84
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
The first advantage is that, switches can support many ports

85
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
and some switches can support 100 of ports.

86
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
The second advantage is that switches can operate at wire speed.

87
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
So as I've mentioned previously the switch will not slow frames down.

88
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
The switch can physically move a frame from one port to another port

89
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
without slowing the frame down.

90
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Some switches have backplanes that operate a terabits per second.

91
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
In other words a very, very fast backplanes in comparison to interface speeds.

92
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
So the back plain of the switch is operating at the much greater speed

93
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
than the physical ports. So what does that mean?

94
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
The switch can move traffic from 1 port to another port

95
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
faster or quicker than it can received traffic on an interface or port.

96
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
So traffic from A to D is not slowdown by the switch.

97
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Another major advantage of switches over hubs is that

98
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
each device is directly connected to a switch port.

99
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.000
So A is connected to port 1, B to port 2, C to port 3, D to port 4.

100
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Each device is individually cabled to port on the switch.
