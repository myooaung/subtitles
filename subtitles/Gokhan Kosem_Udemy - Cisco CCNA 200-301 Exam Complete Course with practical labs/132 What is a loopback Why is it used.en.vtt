00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.870
Pedro sent you a question.

2
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.920
Thanks Pedro for the question.

3
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.700
Pedro asked What is the purpose of the loopback interfaces.

4
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:38.110
Now if you do a search in google you'll find all kinds of answers including that the loopback interface

5
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:44.680
allows you to test connectivity to the 127 0 0 1 IP address.

6
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:51.890
Now that may be true on the PC but on a Cisco device a loopback interface has an entirely different

7
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.040
meaning in the apology.

8
00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:01.760
I've got three routers Router one wrote two and wrote a three configured with these IP addresses on

9
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:10.840
rodded to show IP interface brief shows us that the router has IP addresses configured on the gigabit

10
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:18.790
interfaces so gigabit 0 0 0 0 1 and 0 2 have IP addresses.

11
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:25.300
Now in this example these are virtual routers but if they were physical routers and a cable got disconnected

12
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.650
or got cut or broken in some way the interface would go down.

13
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:38.920
The difference between a physical interface and a loop back interface is a loopback interface is a logical

14
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.620
interface on a router and you can create many of these.

15
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.190
So I notice as soon as I Karaite to that logical interface the interfaces come up.

16
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.430
I can then give that interface an IP address such as this.

17
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.070
Notice it's a Slusher 32 IP address.

18
00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.900
In other words this is the only IP address on that interface.

19
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:08.980
A loopback interface is a logical interface on a router that won't go down unless you manually shut

20
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.680
the interface down.

21
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:18.520
It typically only has one IP address but you could configure multiple IP addresses on that interface

22
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.370
if you wanted to.

23
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.620
The first advantage of the loopback interface is the interface doesn't go down unless you explicitly

24
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.140
shut it down.

25
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.290
So it's not like there's a cable that can be unplugged and then interface goes down.

26
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.040
Now why is that important when you telnet to a router so let's say telnet from wrote a one to Rodda

27
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.210
to.

28
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:48.630
I could telnet to one of the gigabit interfaces on the router so telnet tended wondered wonder to notice

29
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.720
I can log in.

30
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.120
So I'm not connected to rodded to go back to route of one.

31
00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:01.020
And then all telnet to the second IP address 10 1 to 2.

32
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.890
Now that's fine.

33
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.870
But firstly you need to remember which IP address is configured on which router.

34
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:16.510
And secondly if for some reason an interface went down so let's say the cable was disconnected rather

35
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:23.380
than me shutting it down manually here you would have a problem telnetting back to that IP address 10

36
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.210
1 1 2 because the interface has gone down.

37
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.790
However if you have the loopback IP address configured on the router and you advertise that loop back

38
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:41.210
through a writing protocol such as always P.F. you can telnet to that loopback using this network or

39
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.850
this network.

40
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:49.490
So if one of the interfaces goes down it's not a problem because she can still reach the loopback interface.

41
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.410
So at the moment on route one we can't ping the loopback of wrote it to because it's not advertised

42
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.070
in a writing protocol.

43
00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.900
So what I'll do here is enable your GOP

44
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.820
and I'll do something similar.

45
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:05.860
Yes.

46
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.640
Enable you GOP and all interfaces and let's do the same thing.

47
00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:19.600
I wrote a three.

48
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.130
Now once the neighbor relationships have been established which they have done in this example so show

49
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:31.600
IP GOP neighbors neighbor relationship rodder one can ping the loop back over it too.

50
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:43.490
So now I can telnet to the loopback of Rodda too even though the interfaces don't notice gigabit 00

51
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.230
is currently down.

52
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:57.020
So by the same token if we brought up that gigabit 00 interface but then shut gigabit 0 to

53
00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.690
my telnet session still continues.

54
00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.010
So I notice that telnet session stayed up that would always happen in the real world.

55
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:13.250
It depends how long the connection takes to establish but not a show IP interface brief.

56
00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:20.720
I'm still able to telnet to the loopback of route a two from Router one because the telnet traffic is

57
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:31.540
using the alternate route so it doesn't matter if interface's go down or come up as long as I've got

58
00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.080
one route between wrote a one and wrote it.

59
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:40.160
I can connect to the loopback and manage the router through the loopback interface.

60
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:46.360
It's also a lot easier if you use a separate subnet for your management network.

61
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:52.780
In this example I'm just going to keep it simple and create loop packs with IP addresses.

62
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.260
Quotable one credible two and quadruple three.

63
00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:07.950
So I'll simply create an IP address on one with the loopback address and I'll do the same on rotas 3

64
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.530
on one show IP route.

65
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.390
We have two routes to get to the loop of route.

66
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:23.020
Two and two routes to get to the Luebeck of rotas street.

67
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:30.560
So paying quotables three telnet quotables three telnet is not working.

68
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.590
Let's have a look.

69
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:36.220
So show run pipe begin Vicci why.

70
00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:46.860
Notice I've got transport input none line Vicci y 0 for transport input and I'll just say all tell it

71
00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.180
again.

72
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.930
We can log in to write a three.

73
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.580
So from a management point of view it's a lot easier to use LOOP banks.

74
00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.800
You might not want to do it the way I've done it in the real world.

75
00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:04.220
You might have a separate network that you use for management.

76
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:09.670
So in this example I'll just use one on two network.

77
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:13.970
And actually what I'll do is create a separate loopback.

78
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:24.900
So put this back to quadruple T and create a additional loop back for 1 and 2 1 6 8 1 to 2.

79
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.440
So I could do something like this to make it consistent.

80
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:34.850
So use interface loop back to it's always good practice to keep it simple.

81
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.970
So I use the same loopback number.

82
00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:40.740
Don't do what I've done here.

83
00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.340
Try to keep them consistent.

84
00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.510
So let's change that.

85
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:46.000
No interface.

86
00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:53.120
Loopback one interface loop back one line to notice however it's very easy to create loopback interfaces

87
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:55.370
just create as many as you like

88
00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:03.680
there are normally some kind of limitation on the router.

89
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:05.920
But notice the numbers that we could use here.

90
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:14.740
You could use really long numbers if you wanted to but in this example I'll just keep it simple and

91
00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:15.510
use one on two.

92
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.540
So show IP ront.

93
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:25.060
We've now learnt the roots of the loop backs and now all I need to remember is that when I telnet to

94
00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:32.830
write it to it's 1 2 1 6 8 1 dot and the router which is door to when I want to tell me it derogate

95
00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:40.450
3 it's 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 dot Roda 3 so 10 1 and 2 1 6 8 1 2 3.

96
00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.050
And I can log in.

97
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:50.660
So that's the first reason Pedros for using loopback interfaces cover a another reason in a separate

98
00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:50.990
blog.
