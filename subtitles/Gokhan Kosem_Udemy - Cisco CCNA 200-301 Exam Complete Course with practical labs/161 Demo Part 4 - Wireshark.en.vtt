1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So switch 1 we're gonna shut this interface down

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
to force traffic to go via the hub

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So interface gigabit 0/2 shut it down

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
sh in g0/3 switchport

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
this port gigabit 0/3 is acting as a trunk

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
using 802.1Q all VLANs are allowed.

7
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So let’s do a capture on the hub, were receiving PVST information

8
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and notice the difference here's an 802.1Q header

9
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
so we have Ethernet but notice the type is not IPv4

10
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:54.000
the type is 802.1Q, so the type is 0x8100 rather than 0x0800 for IP.

11
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
so 802.1Q frame, we can see here

12
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
that the VLAN ID for this PVST message is VLAN 1

13
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Per-VLAN Spanning Tree sends what are called BPDUs on every VLAN

14
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
so here we can see some Spanning Tree information

15
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and as we scroll down

16
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
we can see that as an example CDP and VTP messages

17
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
or in this case, DTP is sent as an untagged frame.

18
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So we can see some DTP information arriving here.

19
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And that will continue on.

20
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So let’s do a ping from router 2 acting as PC 2 to router 4

21
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and see if we can see why the frames are not permitted.

22
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So ICMP is showing nothing, so we can see a broadcast here

23
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
this is an ARP message saying who has 10.1.2.4

24
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.000
so in this ARP message, I'll just stop that capture for a moment.

25
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Here’s the ARP you can see it's an Ethernet 2 frame

26
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
with the broadcast so the destination is broadcast.

27
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Source MAC address is the MAC address of router 2.

28
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
We can see that by looking at the interface

29
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.000
so sh int f0/0 notice there’s the MAC address of the router

30
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
and they're already shown in the Wireshark capture

31
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.000
but notice the type is once again 802.1Q and the VLAN is set to VLAN 2.

32
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.000
So in other words, the router is sending the frame untagged to the switch.

33
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
But when it go across this link it's going as a tagged frame.

34
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
The switch is setting the VLAN tag to 2

35
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
because it arrived on this port which is in VLAN 2.

36
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I’m just reset that capture

37
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and what I want to show you is on this port

38
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
it's gonna show us untagged, so it's standard Ethernet

39
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
but on this one, it's gonna show us tagged

40
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
because the switch is tagging the frame.

41
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.000
So I'll do the ping again

42
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
now this is the frame to the switch from the router

43
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
and we'll the switch for ARP, you can see this, the ARP traffic

44
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:46.000
from the router to a broadcast address it's untagged, this is the type for ARP.

45
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
There is no 802.1Q header here at all.

46
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
But when we look for ARP on the link between these switches

47
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
notice you can see the 802.1Q tagged set to 2.

48
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:09.000
So the traffic is arriving here as untagged

49
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and the switch is tagging it to send the frame to switch 2.

50
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
The problem here is when the traffic hits switch 2

51
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
switch 2 is not configured with trunking

52
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
this is just an access port in VLAN 1.

53
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
So that traffic will be sent to this port

54
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
but not out of this port which is in VLAN 2.

55
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
So on switch 2 let’s see if we can see that.

56
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
sh int trunk

57
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
At the moment no interfaces are trunking

58
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
so sh int g0/3

59
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
and let’s put switchport at the end

60
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
so sh interfaces g0/3 switchport

61
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
this interface gigabit 0/3 is enabled

62
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.000
it's set for negotiation of trunking. So it’s in VLAN 1.

63
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:10.000
This port belongs to VLAN 1, it’s an access port, no trunking is enabled

64
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
so traffic from router 2 is simply gonna be sent out of this port.

65
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
So let’s do a capture there to prove that

66
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
and then we'll do a capture on this port

67
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
to check if any traffic arrives on this port.

68
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
So there's the Wireshark capture

69
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
do the ping again on router 2

70
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
I’ll do a filter for ARP

71
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
and notice there's the broadcast traffic from 10.1.2.2

72
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:44.000
which is router 2 asking for the MAC address of 10.1.2.4

73
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000
So router 2 is asking for the MAC address of router 4 but it never receives it.

74
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
So what you'll also notice here is there is no 8021.Q tag.

75
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
So the frame was sent untagged here

76
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
it was sent tagged cross here

77
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
arrived here but this port was configured as an access port in VLAN 1.

78
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
So the traffic was simply copied out on this port in VLAN 1 and with no tag.

79
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
The traffic never arrived in this port.

80
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
So let’s prove that do a capture here.

81
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:23.000
I’ll do the ping again, and try and filter for ARP

82
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
and what you’ll notice is there's no ARP traffic

83
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
because the traffic is arriving on an access port.

84
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Port 1 it’s only gonna be sent out of this port which is port 1.

85
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
It’s not gonna set out of this port at all.

86
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
so let’s stop all captures

87
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and then what we'll do now is configure this port to be a trunk port

88
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
and this port to be a trunk port

89
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
but we'll leave this port shutdown for the moment

90
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
so that we can see the traffic being captured.
