00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:09.860
So he has brought a three configure hostname of Rada 3D rather interface loop back zero.

2
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:24.300
My Peavey six address 2001 column face colon three colon colon one slash 64 interface gigabit 00.

3
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:36.250
This should have an IP address of two 01 colon to Colon colon three slash 64 and all no shot to the

4
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.030
interface

5
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.370
interfaces come up gigabit.

6
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:54.470
0 1 This should be 2001 colon 3 colon column 1 slash 64 and also no shut the interface.

7
00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:03.760
So IP Peavey 6 unit cost writing needs to be enabled IP vs 6 Roorda 0 SPF 1

8
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.620
Roorda I.D..

9
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:20.040
As we told you there needs to be manually configured so 3 3 3 3 interface gigabit 00 IP vs 6 0 SPF 1

10
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.060
area 0 this interface needs to be an area 0.

11
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.830
A neighbor relationship has been established interface loop back at 0.

12
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.450
I'll put that in to

13
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:50.320
Area 2 and we'll put gigabit 0 1 into area to show IP 0 SPF protocols or other show IP protocols

14
00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:01.180
and this is the mistake that's easy to make its IP vs 6 protocols rather than IP version 4 0 SPF is

15
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.920
enabled with 0 SPF process idea 1.

16
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.060
The process numbers don't have to be the same.

17
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:12.490
I'll configure the lost rudder with a different process I.D. but it makes sense to keep it simple and

18
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.290
use the same process idea on all your rudders to normal areas.

19
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:25.440
These interfaces have been configured in the various areas show IP vs 6 round who is P.F..

20
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:31.940
Notice 3 routes have been learnt through 0 SPF and these are into area who is preference advertised

21
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.230
by Rod a 2 using its a link local address.

22
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:47.330
Ping 2001 colon face colon 1 colon colon 1 Robert a 3 is able to ping this address.

23
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:58.280
And what about a trace route to the same address we can see that we going via rod a 2 and then via Rod

24
00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.210
1.

25
00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.030
So we've configured 0 SPF successfully on this part of the network.

26
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.360
Let's can figure out a 4.

27
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:12.230
And as I mentioned I'll configure it with a different process I.D. just to show you that you can do

28
00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:19.400
that even though I'd probably want to keep it the same on all riders for consistency and simplicity

29
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:36.510
so host is our for IP vs 6 unit cost routing interface a loop back 0 IP vs 6 address 2001 colon face

30
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.140
colon for colon colon one slash 64.

31
00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.880
Now I'm using virtual writers here you can see that it's having a problem with one of the processes

32
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.200
but hopefully that won't cause problems.

33
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.790
As always what I should have done is save my configurations on all my roads.

34
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.070
Let's do that here.

35
00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:05.810
In case I have to reload genie three not sure if he can hear that but my SIU is taking a hammering at

36
00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.300
the moment so configuration is saved on

37
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:23.620
the full rods so show IP six interface brief we have configured the loop back but we haven't configured

38
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:33.460
the other interfaces so interface gigabit 0 0 IP vs 6 address 2001 colon three colon colon to slash

39
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:39.100
64 no shut we have a ready configured

40
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.570
IP six unit cost routing.

41
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:57.270
So now we can configure SPF So IP vs 6 Rada or SPF 1 Rada I.D. in this example will be quadruple for

42
00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:11.720
interface gigabit 00 IP vs 6 0 SPF 1 area 2 and we'll do the same thing on the loop back neighbour relationship

43
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.200
has formed to show IP v 6 of SPF neighbor

44
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:31.110
neighbor relationship is established show ITV 6 route SPF we've got a single intra area 0 SPF Rod these

45
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:40.770
two loop backs are in the same SPF area area 2 but these loop backs on Rod a 2 and Rod a 1 are in different

46
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:52.200
ways P.F. areas and so is this network here so ping 2001 column 1 column Column 1 That's right a ones

47
00:05:52.470 --> 00:06:02.820
gigabit 00 interface that works ping 2001 face 1 Colin Colin 1 that's the loop back of right to 1.

48
00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:11.550
So debug IP and I'm going to make a mistake now debug IP ICMP won't show anything because we're not

49
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:22.240
sending IP version 4 pings we are sending IP version 6 pings so debug IP v 6 ICMP notice we now get

50
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.180
output on the debug.

51
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:32.380
So just be careful make sure that you specify IP these six rather than IP vision for when using your

52
00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:32.940
commands.

53
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:43.200
So show IP these six protocols there we can see that OSP is enabled on this router show IP v 6 0 SPF

54
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:53.270
interface brief 2 interfaces are in 0 SPF on rudder 3 show IP 6 0 SPF interface.

55
00:06:53.430 --> 00:07:02.260
So this is not brief this is the interface command and you can see that gigabit 00 this interface is

56
00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:11.080
a broadcast interface the local Rada has a link local address of this process I.D. is one the interfaces

57
00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:20.470
an area zero router 3 has a router I.D. of this it is a backup designated Rada the designated Rada on

58
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:29.530
this segment is at 2 with this link local address backup designator Rada is the local Rada Hello time

59
00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:36.640
isn't dead Thomas as shown here scrolling down neighbor count is one adjacent neighbour count is one

60
00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:45.580
neighbouring Rada is rather two which is the designated Rada on gigabit 0 1 we see similar kind of information

61
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:53.020
the local Rada is the designated Rada so Rada 3 is the designated Rada here but rather 2 is the designated

62
00:07:53.020 --> 00:08:05.880
Rada here show my Peavey 6 O SPF this just gives us general information about oh SPF version 3 we can

63
00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:14.850
see the Rada I.D. and the process no so we using SPF vision 3 and not 0 SPF vision 2 we can also see

64
00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:23.570
a backbone area area 0 1 interfaces in that area the SPF algorithm has been executed three times there

65
00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:32.370
are twelve Elysees area 2 there are two interfaces and area 2 SPF algorithm has executed three times

66
00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:43.550
show IP V six who SPF database we have and this is where you need to be careful to Rodders in area 0

67
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:51.440
but scrolling down there are also two rotters in area two the databases are separate so there's a separate

68
00:08:51.440 --> 00:09:00.350
database for area 2 versus area 0 so that's how you configure a basic IP version 6 and network with

69
00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:01.790
0 SPF version 3.
