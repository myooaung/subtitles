00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Rather than using the built-in switch in GNS3

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
you can use an EtherSwitch module directly within one of your routers.

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So here’s what they physically look like

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and this would allow you to connect devices to a router

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and then provide things such as power over Ethernet in the physical network

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
so your router with the EtherSwitch module is acting a like a switch

7
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
there's information about this on Cisco website

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
as an example, you could install the EtherSwitch modules in routers such as 3725

9
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and 3745 or something like a 3600 switch.

10
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So there are different EtherSwitch modules available

11
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
you could even buy this on eBay

12
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.000
but rather than doing that and paying $170.00 or $245.00 as an example

13
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
for an EtherSwitch module or something like $20.00

14
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
what we gonna do is we gonna take 1 of the routers and then we're gonna configure it

15
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and in slots, we gonna specify the network module 16ESW.

16
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So this router now has switching capability built-in to it.

17
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I’m gonna do the same thing with router 2

18
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
right click select configure select a slot and insert NM-16ESW.
