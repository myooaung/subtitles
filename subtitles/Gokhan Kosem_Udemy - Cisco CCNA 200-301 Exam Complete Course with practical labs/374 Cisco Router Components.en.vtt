00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:07.860
A Cisco rodder consists of multiple components the major internal components of a karate include a central

2
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:14.760
processing unit or C-p you know various physical interfaces such as series interfaces or fast ethernet

3
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:24.270
interfaces or gigabit interfaces a random access memory or RAM ROM or read only memory flash memory

4
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.630
as well as nv ram or non volatile RAM.

5
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.980
A Rodda is similar to a computer and has several hardware and software components.

6
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:42.350
So as an example in a PC today you may have a flash drive or hard drive and in a similar way Aurora

7
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:52.230
has flash as well as memory and C.P Dorados you or central processing unit executes operating instructions

8
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:58.620
such as system initialization routing functions and switching functions.

9
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:06.660
A router may run a running protocol such as OSPF and when OSPF recalculates the rats to add to the running

10
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.410
table.

11
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.710
The central processing unit needs to do those computations.

12
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.620
The Rotto also has RAM or random access memory and spooled.

13
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.240
This is very similar to a PC.

14
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:26.920
RAM is of volatile memory and any data is stored in RAM is lost when the radio is powered down or restarted.

15
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:35.540
So in the same way as on a PC if you are working in Microsoft Word and you lose power to your PC you'll

16
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.610
lose any changes to the Microsoft Word document.

17
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.820
If you haven't saved the document to your hard drive.

18
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:50.310
So if you turn the PC off and you've made some changes without saving them those changes are lost because

19
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.630
the word changes are only stored in RAM and haven't been written to the hard drive.

20
00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:04.320
So a router has RAM which is read write memory and contains software and data structures that allow

21
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.030
the rodded to function.

22
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:14.700
Now in some cases with PCs when you boot up a PC the operating system which is stored on the hard drive

23
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.200
is loaded into memory.

24
00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.890
That's not always possible because of the size of operating systems and the amount of RAM available

25
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.170
in a PC.

26
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:35.780
However a Cisco router today copies the entire Cisco Iowas software into RAM Gerring the boot process.

27
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.430
That didn't take place in the past but that's what happens today in a similar way.

28
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:47.290
When you make changes on a Rodda those changes are written to the running configuration.

29
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:53.670
The running configuration is stored in RAM and unless you save that configuration to the startup config

30
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.730
which is stored in nonvolatile RAM or nv ram your changes will be lost.

31
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:06.460
So the running configuration of arrays stored in RAM and when you save your configuration it's copied

32
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.510
to the startup config which is stored in nonvolatile RAM which means that when the router is turned

33
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.460
off those configuration changes are saved and not lost.

34
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:27.090
So nv ram or nonvolatile RAM is used to store information such as the startup config which is not lost

35
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:34.470
when the router is turned off or loses power so the running configuration file is the file that stores

36
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.580
the configuration commands that the Cisco Iowas software is currently using on the router.

37
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.950
Typically all commands that are configured on the Rodda are stored in the running config.

38
00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:53.900
There are always some exceptions to the rule but generally the show run command shows you the configuration

39
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.200
that's currently being used by the router.

40
00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.080
Once again nv ram doesn't lose its information when the radio is powered off.

41
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:09.320
This is the Iowa software uses nv ram to permanently store the router's configuration in the startup

42
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.520
config.

43
00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:17.090
When you make changes to the Cisco router using the C'mon lining to face those changes are made to the

44
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:24.560
running can fake if you want to save for those changes you need to use commands such as copy running

45
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:33.140
config startup config to copy the configuration from RAM to nv ram or from the running config to the

46
00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.100
startup config.
