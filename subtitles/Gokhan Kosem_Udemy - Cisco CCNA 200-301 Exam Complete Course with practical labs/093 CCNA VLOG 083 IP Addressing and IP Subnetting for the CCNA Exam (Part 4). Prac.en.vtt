00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:19.360
This is one of multiple IP addressing and submitting scenarios rather than just working out the subnets

2
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.290
for a scenario.

3
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:28.390
We're going to work them out and then configure the devices so that we can practically design and configure

4
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.590
a Cisco IP network in the previous video we can forget those genius three network.

5
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.720
And we proved that devices can ping one another as an example.

6
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.280
Xubuntu one PC one can ping both Ubuntu three and a boon to four.

7
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.340
In other words this host can ping these hosts on the right hand side.

8
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:59.210
Now one of the things that we did was we configure it to the serial link with Sublette 1 and 2 1 6 8

9
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.870
1 128 slice 26.

10
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:09.530
Now that subnet can support 62 hosts that's a waste of IP addresses when in actual fact a serial link

11
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.830
only requires two IP addresses.

12
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:20.960
So we allocated to this full subnet to the serial link the host portion currently contains six butts

13
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:29.630
to the power of six minus two gives you the option to configure 62 host addresses but we only require

14
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.350
two.

15
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:41.000
So actually all we need are two bets in the host portion which will give us the option of having to

16
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.030
host addresses in a subnet.

17
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.060
Again they are two formulas for network she use the formula 2 to the power of x where x is the number

18
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.220
of bits for host you use two to the power of x minus two.

19
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.380
Two is the number of bytes in the host portion.

20
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.220
We have to subtract two because we need a network address and a broadcast address in IP version 4.

21
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.480
So two to the power of two minus two gives us for minus two which equals two.

22
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:23.050
So taking this subnet which weve currently got configured on the Saral link lets submit it further.

23
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:31.730
So as an example one brought a one currently show IP interface serial to slash zero.

24
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:40.990
Shows us that 1 and 2 1 6 8 1 1:29 slice 26 is configured on the serial interface and that's because

25
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.680
we configure the address on the serial interface.

26
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.120
Now let's change that and optimize the subnet.

27
00:02:50.430 --> 00:03:00.910
So we only need two bits for the host portion so we can extend the subnet portion as follows.

28
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.420
Now we are taking a already configured subnet and we submitting it again.

29
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:14.230
So I'm going to denote this portion as the network portion because that's what we were given.

30
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:20.810
This is the new subnet portion and this is the new host portion.

31
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.690
So that's what we had originally.

32
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.660
We've not changed it to slash 30.

33
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.040
So this would be then new first subnet

34
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:44.400
the second subnet would not be 128 we'd have to cycle through the binary options so we'd make this a

35
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.330
one which in decimal is four.

36
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.190
So 128 plus four.

37
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.690
And let me update the subnet mask portion while we're here.

38
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.690
So that's the new subnet mask.

39
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.570
So this would be 128 plus 4 which is 132.

40
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.380
So that would be the second Sublette.

41
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:17.290
Now you might notice a trend here the difference between 128 and 132 is full.

42
00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:26.810
So the third subnet would be 132 plus 4 which would be 136 if you wanted to work out the binary you

43
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:35.550
would cycle through the various options so current on this wire no current on this wire.

44
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:42.630
That's an 8 in decimal 128 Plus 8 in decimal is 136.

45
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:49.020
So if I were you to only work out say the first two or three subnets and then just see the pattern.

46
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.190
These are incrementing in fours.

47
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.820
So the next one would be 140.

48
00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:00.470
So just look at the pattern and it'll be a lot easier to work out to the next subnet.

49
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.160
Now some other tricks that you can use if this is the next subnet.

50
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:13.700
Then the first subnet broadcast address is one less than the next subnet.

51
00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.340
The next subnet is 132.

52
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.140
So this subnets broad cross address is 131

53
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:32.440
again to work out the broadcast address you fool the host portions with the ones so this is 128 plus

54
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:39.900
two plus one or it's one less than the next subnet.

55
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:45.310
So that's the new first subnet broadcast address.

56
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:53.050
So the first host address is one more than the subnet address so it'll be a hundred and twenty nine

57
00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:07.070
in binary it looks like that the new first subnet last host is one less than the broadcast address so

58
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.410
the broadcast address is 131.

59
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.810
So this will be 130 in binary file.

60
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:22.940
The host portion with Bhandari ones except for the last but here we've only got two bits.

61
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.580
This is on and this is off.

62
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.380
So that gives you the last host in the subnet.

63
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:38.700
So that's an example of taking a subnet that we've created from a previous subnet and submitting it

64
00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.380
again to get new subnets in the network.

65
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:52.820
So currently on our network we are using a 26 year what we'll do is change that to a slash 30 with the

66
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.760
first host being 1 on 2 1 6 8 1 29 slash 30.

67
00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:03.520
And the second host being 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 130 slash 30.

68
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:13.470
So that's the IP address on the first host of first Rodda.

69
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:22.060
This is the IP address on the second Rodda we are going to stay with 1:29 and 130 but we are going to

70
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:29.680
change the subnet mask its interface serial to slushes 0 IP address 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 1:29

71
00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:46.340
and the scenario needs to be mosque is a slush 30 because it's 8 plus 8 plus 8 plus six of slush 30

72
00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:46.920
mosque

73
00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:57.470
so this needs to change to 1 2 1 6 8 1 128 slash city that's the mosque you'll often find on several

74
00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:02.280
links because it supports two host addresses.

75
00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:09.560
So again this is a slash 30 mosque because we've got 30 binary ones in the subnet mosque.

76
00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:18.990
So this is 2:55 dot 2:55 dot 2:55 dot to 5 to.

77
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:24.150
So this is going to be 2:05 to as the IP address.

78
00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:32.430
Notice the relationship goes down has come up again but we will probably have problems running it that

79
00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:33.100
way.

80
00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:38.000
So the site or say needs to be 2:05 to.

81
00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:48.780
In other words a slash 30 relationship has come up show IP interface serial to slash zero.

82
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:58.350
Notice the mosque now used is a slash 30 and on side show IP interface serial to slushes zero.

83
00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:05.660
Notice the mosque used to use a slash 30 second right of one ping brought it to.

84
00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:06.780
Yes it can

85
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:16.880
Ken PC one still paying PC three yes it can and can ping

86
00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.790
PC for yes it can.

87
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:31.040
So let's trace to 1 on 2 1 6 8 1 65.

88
00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:35.500
You can see it goes to route 1 rather 2.

89
00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:45.740
And then the remote PC so we've successfully updated the subnets in this typology to only use two IP

90
00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.590
addresses on the serial link.

91
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:56.160
The reason for doing that is we can increase the number of subnets that we have.

92
00:09:56.170 --> 00:10:04.620
So rather than only having a one subnet we've now increased the number of subnets to two to the power

93
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:05.340
of four.

94
00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:14.770
So we've actually got 16 separate subnets that we can use each of which support to host addresses are
