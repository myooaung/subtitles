00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Routing protocols use different criteria to determine the best part to a destination.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
As an example with static routes the administrator

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
decides which path the traffic will take.

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
With RIP hop count is the determining factor or criteria

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and with OSPF bandwidth is the determining factor.

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We as humans do this all the time when driving from point A to point B

7
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
we will determine the best path to take based on criteria

8
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
such as the speed limit, congestion on a highway

9
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
or motorway, the amount of time we have

10
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and perhaps some other criteria, essentially you are working out

11
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
the best route to take from point A to point B

12
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
based on some criteria that’s important to you.

13
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Typically to get from point A to point B in the shortest time possible.

14
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
in the same way in this topology

15
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
when traffic is sent from San Francisco to San Jose

16
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
which path will the traffic take?

17
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
as an example, when using the RIP routing protocol

18
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
RIP would send the traffic directly from San Francisco to San Jose

19
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
RIP doesn’t take bandwidth into account

20
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
so if we had a network of 10.1.1.0 in San Francisco

21
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and a network of 10.1.2.0 in San Jose

22
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
RIP would take the direct path between those 2 networks

23
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and that’s because the number of hops is less than going via New York.

24
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
RIP will not send traffic via New York

25
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
it will send the traffic directly between San Francisco and San Jose

26
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
RIP, however, is not considering the bandwidth of the links

27
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
so even though there are fewer hops

28
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
it may be quicker to send the traffic via New York rather than directly.

29
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
OSPF, on the other hand, takes bandwidth into account

30
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
so, in this case, OSPF would send the traffic via New York

31
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
because the link speeds are greater.

32
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
OSPF is a more powerful routing protocol and makes better decisions

33
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
because it takes bandwidth into account when determining the best path.

34
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
RIP doesn’t it simply looks at the number of hops from point A to point B.

35
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
this is a very basic topology

36
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
simply used as an example to show you how routing protocols

37
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
determine the best path or best route to a destination.

38
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
The moral of the story is as follows:

39
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
different routing protocols have different criteria

40
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
to determine the best path from A to B.

41
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
OSPF once again takes bandwidth into account when determining the best path.

42
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000
RIP doesn’t, some routing protocols will make better decisions than other routing
protocols.

43
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Generally, today you’re going to use either OSPF or EIGRP in most enterprise networks.

44
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
EIGRP is a popular routing protocol when you have a Cisco only network.

45
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
EIGRP is a proprietary Cisco routing protocol

46
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
and may not be supported by other vendors

47
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
OSPF is an industry standard routing protocol

48
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and is therefore better to use when you have a multi-vendor network.
