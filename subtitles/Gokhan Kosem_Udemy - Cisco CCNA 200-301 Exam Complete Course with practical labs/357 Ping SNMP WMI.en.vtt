00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:06.870
For example if the enemy is pinging a Rodda to see if it's up or down and a response doesn't come back

2
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.110
they are in a mess doesn't really know whether that device is down.

3
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.210
All it knows is that the response didn't come back.

4
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.360
The device could be down but it could also be a routing problem or an intermediate device could be done

5
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.940
or a device between the end a miss and the router could be down.

6
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:35.160
So some device along the path could be down all traffic could be blocked by an ACL or a firewall rule

7
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.410
all the enemy knows is that it can't reach the device that it's pinging.

8
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.070
It's an AP On the other hand is different with SMP.

9
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:53.250
The enemy is acquiring a device and the device is telling the enemy via an MP the state of an interface.

10
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.860
So if a device indicates that interface first Ethan is 0 0 as an example is down.

11
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.580
The enemy knows 100 percent that that information is accurate because it received that information via

12
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.170
its an MP from the device that it was queering.

13
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.600
Now in the event that the actual device is down rather than an interface on the device you'll get an

14
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.100
unknown state.

15
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.920
That's a different type of signifier than if the interface is down on a device that's up and running.

16
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:32.220
In terms of performance monitoring ICMP or ping is used for availability calculations and latency response

17
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:41.670
times SMP is used for almost all the other statistics including CPQ memory buffers interface traffic

18
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.220
and errors and many many other statistics.

19
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:55.710
In some cases for Windows systems the NMSL might leverage WMI or Windows management instrumentation

20
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.830
to check for performance counter-top values.
