00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.320
The next step is to configure the DHP server.

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.940
So I'm going to call this Rhonda DHP server.

3
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:20.850
Enable IPV 6 unicast cost routing on gigabit to 0 1 configure an IP version 6 address off 2001 Colan

4
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.940
1 2 3 4 code on call on to flash 64 and no shut the interface.

5
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:37.340
I'm also going to configure a static route to the face and network via 2001 one two three four call

6
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.890
on column 1.

7
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.360
In other words the real agent.

8
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.940
So can the DHB be server ping the relay agent.

9
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.590
Yes it can Kennet paying the face interface on the relay agent.

10
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.230
Yes it can.

11
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.860
So essentially this DHB server can ping the relay agent.

12
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.510
Now that we've completed the basic IP version 6 configuration we need to configure the DHP server.

13
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:17.630
So IPV 6 DHC P in this case we are going to configure Apoel and I'm going to call it my pool address

14
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:28.000
Prefect's is going to be 2001 face colon colon slash 64 the face network is on the left hand side.

15
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:35.660
So that's the address Prefect's that we're going to allocate with also allocate a DNS server which is

16
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.940
going to be the local Raanta and we'll configure a domain name

17
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.180
of CCMA X dot com.

18
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.460
So that's what should be sent through to the client through DHP.

19
00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:04.030
Now on the gigabit is there a wanting to face we need to use the command IPV 6 DHP server and pointed

20
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.200
to the pool that we've created.

21
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.850
So my pool.

22
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.850
So this is the configuration of the DHP server.

23
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.600
We've essentially configured ADHD people as follows.

24
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.930
And on the gigabit is there are wanting to face the interface that's going to receive the DHP requests

25
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:31.290
we have configured an IP address as well as a server pool.

26
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.540
So let's do a debug IP V-6 DHP.

27
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.820
So that's the server configuration done.

28
00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.590
OK so now let's configure the clients so called us client.

29
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.970
Ali enable IPV 6 unicast routing.

30
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.180
And then on key give it to 0 0 we'll use the command IPV 6 address.

31
00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:02.050
In this case we're going to use DHP and then I'll enable IPV 6 on that interface before I know shut

32
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.150
the interface I'm going to do a debug IPV 6 DHC P at the moment.

33
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.020
We told that gigabit 00 is not ready.

34
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.540
So show IPV 6 interface of 0 0 at the moment.

35
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:29.440
The interface is down but notice we do have a link local address interface gigabit 00 no shut.

36
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.140
Let's see what happens now.

37
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:42.600
What you'll notice in the output is that a solicitation was sent to all routers on the segment a DNS

38
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.550
server was configured as well as a domain name

39
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.020
on the relay agent.

40
00:03:53.070 --> 00:04:02.510
It received to the solicitation from from a host ending with a link a local address which is which if

41
00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.440
I scroll up

42
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:13.170
is the client the relay was forwarded to the DHP server.

43
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:22.920
A reply was received from the DHP server and the reply was sent to the client on the DHP server relay

44
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.670
was received from the relay agent.

45
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.100
My pool is going to be used.

46
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:41.560
A binding is created for the client a new address is going to be allocated to the client of this.

47
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.320
So the address is going to be allocated.

48
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:53.960
The source IP address is going to be this it's sending a relay reply and it's updating the binding.

49
00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:02.290
So Sadrist is going to be that the relay is once again sent to the relay agent.

50
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.170
So show IP the CICS interface gigabit it a 0.

51
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:18.460
Notice the link local addresses this but the router has been allocated the address that's for the subnet.

52
00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:26.630
What I'll do is shut to the interface don't we can see some messages on the DHP server.

53
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.420
And then I'll know shut the interface again.

54
00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:39.480
So interfaces come up and the rod is getting an IP address through DHP.
