00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In a similar way to our previous example, let’s assume that C is replies to A.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So C sends a frame to the bridge, the bridge will read the source MAC address on the

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
frame and then update its MAC address table with that information.

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So the bridge now knows that C is on port 3, as well as knowing that A is on port 1

5
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
because it learnt that from the previous frame.

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And now unlike a hub, the bridge does not forward the frame out of all ports.

7
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The destination address in the frame is A

8
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
the bridge knows that MAC address A is on port 1

9
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
so it only forwards the frame out of port 1.

10
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The frame from C therefore only goes out of port 1

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
its not send out of port 2 or port 4 because the bridge knows that A is on port 1.

12
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So what does this mean, all subsequent frames from A and C will only use port 1 and 3

13
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
in other words if A sends another frame to C it will only go out of port 3

14
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
this is because the MAC addresses of A and C are in the MAC address table

15
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and the bridge will forward traffic base on entries in the MAC address table.

16
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
B and D are no longer receiving frames between A and C.

17
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
frames from C to A arriving on port 3 will go out of port 1

18
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and frames from A to c arriving on port 1 will be sent out of port 3.

19
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
therefore A and C can have a conversation independently of B and D.

20
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
B and D are no longer receiving frames sent between A and c.

21
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
the frames between A and c are contained between ports 1 and 3 .

22
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000
No bandwidth is used on port 2 and 4 when traffic is sent between A and C.

23
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
devices B and D do not receive any frames sent between A and C

24
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and therefore avoid unnecessary processing of frames not destined to themselves.

25
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Bandwidth is being conserved, devices are not unnecessarily processing traffic.

26
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
not destined to them and thus bridges have major advantages over hubs.

27
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Overtime the bridge will learn where all MAC address are, so the bridge will learn

28
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
that A is on port 1, B is on port 2, C is on port 3 and D is on port 4.

29
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.000
That means that overtime B and D can have a conversation independently of A and C.

30
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
the 2 conversations do not affect each other.

31
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Frames from each conversation do not interfere with the other conversation.

32
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Therefore B and D can communicate at the same time as A and C

33
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
now continuing with the advantages of bridges

34
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
each port is a different collision domain.

35
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So a collision on port 1 will not affect port 3.

36
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Each interface in a bridge is a separate collision domain.

37
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
So in this example we have 1234 collision domains.

38
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
If A and B were having a conversation and a collision took place on port 3.

39
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
It will not affect A and B

40
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
they wouldn’t even realize that there was a collision in the network.

41
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Now in this topology we have a hub connected to port 4 of the bridge.

42
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000
A hub is a single collision domain. So any collisions that takes place on the hub

43
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
will affect devices connected to the hub but will not affect other devices

44
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
elsewhere in the topology.

45
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
so if there was a collision on the hub, it would affect host E and host D

46
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
but it would not affect host A, C and B

47
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
the problem with collisions, is that if a collision  takes place the devices

48
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
have to back off for a random period of time

49
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and then they need to try and access the network again.

50
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
So if this devices D and E are in a single collision domain the bandwidth

51
00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and throughput that they have is lower than these devices

52
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
which are in a separate collision domain by themselves.

53
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.000
A, C and B have a dedicated link they are on a single broadcast domain

54
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and single collision domain

55
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
D and E however are sharing bandwidth because they're connected to a hub.

56
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Host A, C and B are on separate collision domains.

57
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Now it’s important to remember that a bridge is still a single broadcast domain

58
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
So if A sent a broadcast it would be received by everyone in this topology.

59
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
All devices will receive the broadcast and in some cases that’s a good thing

60
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
but in a most cases it’s not.

61
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
In networking we typically want to restrict all contain broadcast traffic.

62
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
When there are too many broadcast in the network it can slow down all devices

63
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
on the network and in the worst cases it will bring your network to its knees.

64
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
In other words your network will just break and not function.

65
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
If you have what's you called a broadcast storm.

66
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Bridges once again process information in software rather than in hardware

67
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
and therefore tend to be slow in comparison to devices such as switches

68
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
which process frames in hardware.

69
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
The number of ports on a bridge is also limited when compared to switches.

70
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
In today’s environments switches have essentially replaced bridges

71
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
but it’s good for you to realize

72
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
that a bridge and a switch operate in a very similar way.

73
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
So in summary a bridge is a layer 2 device in the OSI model

74
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
in other words it operates at the data link layer

75
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
it's more intelligent than a hub because it has a MAC address table

76
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
and it learns where MAC addresses are and then add those MAC addresses

77
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
to the MAC address table and can then make intelligent decision on where to forward

78
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
traffic based on the information learned and contained in the MAC address table.

79
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
A hub is a physical device that simply repeat signals

80
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
out of all ports except the ports on which the traffic was received.

81
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
A bridge will flood a frame out of all ports

82
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
when it doesn’t know where to send the frame.

83
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
In other words it has unlearned where the destination MAC address is.

84
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
It will also flood broadcast out of all ports.

85
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
So each port on a bridge is a separate collision domain

86
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
but a bridge is still a single broadcast domain.
