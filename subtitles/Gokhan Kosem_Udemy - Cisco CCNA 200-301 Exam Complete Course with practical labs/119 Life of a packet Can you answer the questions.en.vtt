00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.580
This is one of multiple CCMA Exam Simulation quiz questions.

2
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.920
Can you answer the questions yourself in these quiz questions.

3
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:27.420
I'm using Cisco Packet Tracer to help you practically test and verify your knowledge of Cisco CCN eight

4
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.190
topics in these quiz questions.

5
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.960
We are testing your knowledge of the life of a packet.

6
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.220
Do you understand destination and source MAC addresses.

7
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.460
Do you understand where those are used.

8
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:51.640
Do you understand how traffic flows through a network and the various encapsulation is used in a network.

9
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.260
In this scenario I have two pieces.

10
00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:01.570
P.S. One on the left and P.S. two on the right they are connected to 36 50 switches.

11
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.150
These switches are configured as a layer two switches.

12
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.830
There are also two Cisco ISIL routers connected via a serial link.

13
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:18.020
The scenario is P.S. One pings P.C. too you need to answer the following questions based on the Echo

14
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.250
request message center from P.S. 1 2 P.S. 2.

15
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:30.210
So look after the echo request a message not other traffic types and answer these questions.

16
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.610
What is the destination MAC address of the frame at point A in the network.

17
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.550
In other words what is the destination MAC address of the Echo request message.

18
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.290
After this point what is the actual destination MAC address.

19
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:54.410
So in other words you need to determine what are the actual MAC addresses by looking at the frame and

20
00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:02.460
determining to which device that MAC address belongs now to help you with this task in Packet Tracer

21
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:09.920
use of the simulation mode simulation mode in Packet Tracer allows you to simulate the flow of traffic

22
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:20.450
through a network and view what happens once you open up simulation mode on P.S. 1 generate traffic

23
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:28.170
so send a ping to the IP address of P.C. to which is 10 1 3 2

24
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:40.570
and have a look at how the traffic flows as we can see here and our packet has been created and the

25
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:48.560
piece he is opting for the MAC address of the router if you don't want to see other traffic times you

26
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:57.740
can edit your filters to only look at OP and ICMP traffic within in Packet Tracer.

27
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:06.820
So what I'll do is reset to that simulation and send the packet again

28
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:18.610
so we can see the OP a request to the router and the reply and then we can see the ICMP message.

29
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:29.020
And if you click on the message you'll be able to view the inbound PD you and outbound PD you and then

30
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:42.370
answer the questions so by using simulation mode or by simply looking at the configurations of the devices

31
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:51.610
in the topology you should be able to answer these questions so they are various questions asking about

32
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:57.580
mac addresses and encapsulation is used at different stages in the life of the packet

33
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:01.530
for both.

34
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:08.290
Echo request and echo reply do you know how packets are encapsulated.

35
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.670
Do you know when MAC addresses are used and when they are not used.

36
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.430
Download the attached packet trace a file and see if you can answer these questions yourself.

37
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.600
Otherwise watch the next video.

38
00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:25.100
We are show you the answers to these questions.
