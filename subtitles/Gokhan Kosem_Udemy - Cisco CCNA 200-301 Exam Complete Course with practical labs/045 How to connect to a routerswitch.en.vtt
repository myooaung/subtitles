00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now before we look at the Cisco IOS we need to physically connect

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
to a Cisco router or Cisco switch.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So how do you connect to a router or a switch?

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Well the first thing you’re going to need is a console cable

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
when you initially configure the device through the console port.

6
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
in the old days console cables used to have RJ-45 connectors on both ends

7
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and then you used to have to get a DB-9 connector which would connect

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
to the serial port of your PC, these days they tends to look like this

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
so you have an RJ-45 connector on 1 end which you used to connect

10
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
to the console of a router or switch and then you have a DB-9 female connector

11
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
which you used to connect to the serial port of your PC

12
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
now today lots of PC's don’t have serial ports.

13
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So you’ll need to get a USB to serial converter so that you can connect

14
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
to the USB port on your PC and then used the DB-9 male connector to connect

15
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
to the female DB-9 connector of your console cable

16
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
remember a console cable is a rollover cable with pin 1

17
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
on 1 side connected to pin 8 on the other side, pin 2 connected to pin 7

18
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
3 to 6 and so forth and so on and once again pin 8 to pin 1.

19
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
So the pins are rolled from 1 side of the cable to the other side

20
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
you then going to have a run some terminal emulation software on your PC or MAC.

21
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
There are many examples of terminal emulation software.

22
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
HyperTerminal was quite popular in the past

23
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
because it came with Windows and it was free but it’s very limited.

24
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Putty is very popular today it’s free and works very well.

25
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
One of the issues with Putty is that it only runs on Windows.

26
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Other software that you may be interested in using includes tera term

27
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
which is also free and SecureCRT which is very popular with networking engineers.

28
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
It runs on both Windows and Mac but it does cause money.

29
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
On a Mac you may wanna use SecureCRT or iTerm was an example

30
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I used Royal TSX for a lot of connections on my Mac.

31
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Find software that you prefer using.

32
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Now as in a lot of things in life, there are various options choose what suits you.

33
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Putty is very good if you run Windows and it’s once again free.

34
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
If you're running a HyperTerminal you could connect to a router doing the following.

35
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
The first thing that you’re going to do is open up a new HyperTerminal session

36
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and then specify the COM port that you going to use

37
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
to connect to the Cisco routers or switch and then you need to specify

38
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
the speed data bits, parity, stop bits and flow control.

39
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
These are typically the values that you’re going to use

40
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
when connecting to Cisco router or switch.

41
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Now don’t worry too much about what the value mean

42
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
these are typically the values that you’ll configure

43
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
when configuring a Cisco router or switch

44
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Just remember that bits per second is 9600

45
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
data bits is 8, parity is none, stop bits is 1 and flow control is none.

46
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Now in this video I’m using HyperTerminal, so I'd go to file new connection

47
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
I’ve specify my connection let’s say R1

48
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
I’ve specify which COM port I’m going to use so as an example COM 3.

49
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.000
I’ll specify that the bits per second is 9600, data bits is 8, parity is none

50
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
stop bits is 1 and flow control is none.

51
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Now I can click on OK and I'll hit enter a few times

52
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
until I get output on the screen, and as you can see we're connected to a Cisco router.

53
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
so just to reiterate what your require

54
00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.000
when initially configuring a router or switch you’ll firstly need a console cable

55
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
if you've got an older console cable like this, you’ll need to get a DB-9 connector

56
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
if you’ve got a newer console cable which looks like this

57
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.000
which has a female DB-9 connector you would connect that to your PC's serial port

58
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
or otherwise if you don’t have a serial port on your computer

59
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
you’ll need to get a USB to serial port converter

60
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
connect the USB cable to the USB port on your PC

61
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and then connect the male DB-9 connector to the female console connector

62
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000
of the console cable and then you plug the RJ-45 connector into the console

63
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
of your router or switch, now as a tip, some routers

64
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
have auxiliary ports which were used in the past for modems

65
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
don’t connect to the auxiliary port, make sure you connect

66
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
to the console port for the initial configuration of your device.
