00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Routers exchange information about routes using different methods

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
but as an example, OSPF uses link-state updates

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
to advertise information about routes that are available in the network topology.

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This puts overhead on the network because additional traffic is sent

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and received by routers as they communicate with 1 another.

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
However, as the network grows thereâ€™s an exponential increase in the amount of work

7
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that would be required if static routes where used

8
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and thus because of the advantage that dynamic routing protocols

9
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
put less overhead and workload on administrators to maintain routing tables

10
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
they are used in most networks today especially larger networks

11
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
with the largest being the internet which runs on BGP or Border Gateway Protocol

12
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and once again dynamic routing protocols can adjust to changes

13
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
in the topology automatically and without administrator intervention.
