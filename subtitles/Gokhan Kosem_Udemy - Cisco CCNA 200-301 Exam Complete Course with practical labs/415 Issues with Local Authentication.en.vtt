00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:07.110
In the CCN a course we've been discussing the use of local usernames and passwords.

2
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.670
In other words the username and password information is stored on each router or switch individually

3
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:23.990
so as an example when I log on to this router rod or one there's no authentication but what we could

4
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:33.500
do is create a username on the rudder and then go into the line console and specify a log in and either

5
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.870
a line log in or specify a local log in.

6
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:46.130
So now when we log on to the router we are prompted to enter the username and the password that works

7
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.380
well when you have a small environment.

8
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.800
But as you scale it becomes a lot of work.

9
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.080
So as an example when I connect to write a two there's no username and password.

10
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:06.830
So what I need to do now is create a separate username and password on write it to and then I need to

11
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:17.140
remember to go into the line console and specify a log in local and I mustn't forget to do that on the

12
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.570
V T1 lines as well.

13
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:28.910
So logging back in I'm now prompted for my username and password on rata to but once again when I connect

14
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.950
to Router 3 There's no username and password and I have to specify that again.

15
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:44.010
Now that's not the only problem that we have to configure passwords locally on every device.

16
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:51.500
So you've got to remember to do all that configuration but what you've also got to remember to do is

17
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.320
to change your passwords on a regular basis.

18
00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.900
To implement good security practices you should be changing your password on a regular basis.

19
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:09.290
That means that we have to go to every device in the network and change the password on each device

20
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:10.750
individually.

21
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:16.850
In this example I've only got five devices but if you've got a hundred or a thousand network devices

22
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:24.380
that's a lot of configuration that increases because you don't want your users sharing the same username

23
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.730
and password.

24
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.330
So if you've got another using your environment

25
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.150
you should set up that to use account on every router.

26
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:49.400
As an example on broader one I can log in as Mary but I can't do that on broad a T because I haven't

27
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.460
configured a username.

28
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.830
Mary on Robert T.

29
00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:01.310
So the management of usernames and passwords becomes very difficult when you have a local usernames

30
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:08.890
and passwords configured on every device so it makes sense to centralize your usernames and passwords

31
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.520
on a central server.

32
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:19.840
So in this example we've got a user called admin but we could add Mary or David to this database and

33
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:28.060
then point every network device to the central AC US server which means that we don't have to configure

34
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:36.460
a local username and password on every device for every user that needs to access that device.

35
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:43.660
The server can also be leveraged once again for attitude out one ex authentication where you centralize

36
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:51.910
the username and password authentication of users accessing the network through a triple a server or

37
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.840
authentication authorization an accounting server.
