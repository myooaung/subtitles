00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.720
In this video we're going to discuss Oh SPF version 3 or open shortest path.

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.410
First version 3 0 SPF.

3
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.990
Version 3 provides a routing capabilities for IP version 6.

4
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.700
Most engineers when they talk about SPF are referring to a SPF of Version 2 which provides a unique

5
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.200
cost of routing for IP version 4.

6
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:31.710
However if you have IP version 6 addresses configured you can't use 0 SPF Version 2 because 0 SPF Version

7
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:42.090
2 only supports IP version 4 and not IP version 6 0 SPF version 3 expands on 0 SPF Version 2 to provide

8
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.670
support for routing IP version 6 prefixes and support for 128 but IP vs 6 addresses.

9
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.610
There is a lot of similarity between SPF version 2 and OSP version 3.

10
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.420
So we have the concept of LSD.

11
00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.740
We have the concept of areas and so forth but be aware that these protocols are independent of each

12
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.500
other.

13
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:09.890
There is a version to will advertise IP version for networks and OSP version 3 is able to advertise

14
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.040
IP vs 6 networks.

15
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.740
They can be configured on the same router but run independently of each other.

16
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.180
In other words they have separate databases.

17
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.240
They use different addresses for advertisements and they don't communicate with one another.

18
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.340
So here are some examples of similarities between the two protocols.

19
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.870
They are both linked state routing protocols.

20
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:41.010
They both use the same area design concepts and terms so we have a backbone area we have area border

21
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.340
routers and autonomous system border riders and so forth.

22
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.810
The way that you enable the writing protocol is different in SPF version 3 versus 0 SPF version 2.

23
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.300
You're still enabling the writing protocol on interfaces but in OSP version too you use the network

24
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:05.280
command whereas in SPF version 3 you go onto the interface and enable a SPF when 0 SPF is enabled on

25
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.930
an interface.

26
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.560
The writers can discover one another on directly connected links.

27
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.780
They both check various settings before a neighbour relationship is established so as an example both

28
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.660
riders need to be in the same area to form a neighbour relationship and share the same password.

29
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.810
If authentication has been enabled both protocols use LINQ state advertisements to advertise details

30
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.250
of the network and they both bold links state databases.

31
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.520
They both use the shortest path first algorithm or SPF or Dykstra as algorithm to determine the best

32
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.490
path to a network.

33
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.850
Networks are based on the cost of an interface with the same default metric based on 100 meg interface

34
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:56.670
LSA is also flooded throughout the 0 SPF domain but there are awesome differences in the lessees between

35
00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.660
0 SPF version 2 and OSP version 3.

36
00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.630
The differences in the LSD and the way the databases are structured are out of the scope of the CDC

37
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:13.320
and a certification both protocols use a 32 bit Rada I.D. to identify a.

38
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:20.790
If you're running a pure IP vs 6 network which we're going to do in a moment using this topology you

39
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:29.590
need to manually configure a 32 bit Rada I.D. on each rider 0 SPF version 3 uses IP version 6.

40
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:37.650
A link local addresses for neighbor relationships that's different to 0 SPF version 2 which used IP

41
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.200
version 4 interface ip addresses for the neighbor relationship establishment in OSP.

42
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.170
Version 2 you had to make sure that the neighboring routers were in the same subnet otherwise they wouldn't

43
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:55.410
form a neighbour relationship but in 0 SPF version 3 the neighbor relationship is now formed using a

44
00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:02.630
link local address instead of an interface ip address or SPF version 3 uses multicast address.

45
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.250
F f 0 2.

46
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:14.010
Colon colon 5 to advertise information to all 0 SPF rorters and f f 0 2 colon colon 6 4 0 SPF designated

47
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.400
Rada and backup designated rota.

48
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:26.210
That's very similar to 0 SPF version 2 which uses 2 2 4 0 0 5 and 2 2 4 0 0 6 the same protocol number

49
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:33.210
refused IP version 6 protocol number is 89 4 always be a version 3 and always be P.F. version 2 uses

50
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.840
IP version 4 protocol number 89.

51
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.540
So now let's look at how to configure this network using SPF.

52
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:40.670
Version 3.

53
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.060
This is a pure IP version 6 network.
