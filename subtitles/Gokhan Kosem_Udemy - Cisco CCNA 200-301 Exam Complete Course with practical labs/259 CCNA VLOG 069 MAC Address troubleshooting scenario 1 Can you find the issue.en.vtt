00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:16.130
This is one of multiple Ethernet troubleshooting videos in this topology we've been told that to write

2
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:22.920
a one on the top left is not able to ping some of the other routers in the topology so let's verify

3
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.470
that en route to one.

4
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:33.630
Show IP interface brief IP address of broader one is tendered wondered wondered one router two's IP

5
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:45.830
address is ten dot one that one dot to so from right a one can be ping wrote it to pings of failing

6
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:57.120
let's confirm the IP address information to show IP interface gigabit 0 0 IP addresses 10 1 1 2 slash

7
00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.480
24.

8
00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.820
Let's do the same over here.

9
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:09.900
Make sure that the subnet mask is correct IP addresses 10 1 1 1 slash 24 the site it's 10 1 1 2 slash

10
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.980
24.

11
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:20.310
So that looks good doesn't look like they'll be any other reason why we can't ping to write it to what

12
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.250
we'll do and write a 1 is to a debug IP packet.

13
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.840
Be careful doing these commands in the real world.

14
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.980
You may have to use an access list on that debug.

15
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.050
Otherwise you could kill your Radha with the amount of output that's generated.

16
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.480
Okay so we see messages such as sending full packet.

17
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.480
So it looks like right one is forwarding the packet out of the ether net interface onto the network

18
00:01:50.070 --> 00:02:01.110
debug IP packet on the site what I'll do now is repeat 1 ping only so only send one packet onto the

19
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.910
network.

20
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.520
It doesn't look like anything's arriving on the site.

21
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:14.950
If you can use wire shock to help you capture traffic something to capture traffic between the switch

22
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.460
and write it to and I'll do that ping again

23
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.730
but I don't see any ICMP traffic in why shock

24
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.090
we see spanning tree information.

25
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:42.320
But we don't see any other information in why shock we see for instance a loop from a device to this

26
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.650
MAC address we see some spanning tree.

27
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.480
We don't see any other traffic

28
00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:59.640
so let's see if the traffic is actually getting to the switch we'll do that ping again.

29
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:11.130
Okay so there's the ICMP message sent from Route 1 2 road to the fact that we see ICMP means that the

30
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.880
rotor has learnt the MAC address of rather to source MAC addresses zeroes ending in one destination

31
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:26.840
MAC address is zeroes ending in a two so it looks like OP worked but the pings are failing let's confirm

32
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:36.110
the MAC address on router 1 MAC address is set to this point in mac addresses this but to the MAC address

33
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.680
is being changed to that value.

34
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:48.330
What about on write it to MAC addresses this burnt in mac addresses that so it looks like the traffic

35
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:55.980
from right of one to write it to get sent on this link but doesn't arrive according to what I'll do

36
00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:02.480
is do a broadcast again you need to be careful with doing this kind of stuff in the real world.

37
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.730
Because this is a lab I'm going to show you various options so notice when I send a broadcast traffic

38
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.360
it does arrive at RADA too.

39
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:22.440
So let me on all that and only do a debug IP ICMP not a debug package because that generates a lot of

40
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.480
traffic on all over here.

41
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:36.190
In other words turn off all debugging and only send one broadcast so the broadcast gets to write it

42
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:47.190
to so here we go to reply to the broadcast it looks like but it doesn't look like uni cost traffic works

43
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:59.210
in the network so broadcast is sent it gets to write it too but a unit cost doesn't seem to get to write

44
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.200
it too.

45
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:06.730
So let's have a look at that switch and see if there's a problem on the switch on the switch.

46
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.800
Show MAC address table.

47
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.520
Okay.

48
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.160
Can you see a problem in the output.

49
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.170
What looks wrong in this output

50
00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:27.840
notice here we've got a static MAC address for MAC address to going out of gigabit 2 and kick in 3.

51
00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:40.740
But switch to show interface gigabit 0 shows us that has a mac address of 2.

52
00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:50.910
So this static MAC addresses a problem show run point include Mac we've got to this entry in the running

53
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.360
config which shouldn't be there.

54
00:05:53.370 --> 00:06:03.050
So no not paste that in so no mac address show MAC address table.

55
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.960
Now we only have a dynamic MAC addresses.

56
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:11.930
I'll do it ping from right I want to write it to that succeeds now because the MAC address has been

57
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.670
learnt properly.

58
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:20.090
Be careful with static MAC addresses in your mac address table that will override your dynamic entries

59
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:25.480
and could send traffic to the wrong port in your topology okay.

60
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:31.400
So can we ping routers 3 which has an IP address of 10 1 1 3.

61
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.570
No we can't show IP interface gigabit.

62
00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.560
0 0.

63
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:51.990
So this is the IP address of rather 3 debug IP ICMP let's do a ping again.

64
00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.580
It doesn't look like the traffic's arriving a drought a 3.

65
00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.930
Let's have a look at the MAC address table.

66
00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:01.610
I don't see a MAC address for RADA 3.

67
00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:07.410
Let's Payne wrote a one from rather three.

68
00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:16.350
Look at this output and see if you see a problem so show MAC address table showed us previously that

69
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:22.440
this MAC address ending in one was connected to gigabit to 0 0 on the switch.

70
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:31.120
In other words over here but now it looks like that MAC addresses on gigabit 0 to this port here.

71
00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:36.090
So do ping from rudder one again and let's have a look at the MAC address table.

72
00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:42.960
Notice that MAC address is now shown on gigabit 00 ping is finished.

73
00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.490
So let's do a ping from the side.

74
00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:49.420
Notice the MAC address has moved to gigabit 0 2.

75
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.340
So we're getting MAC addresses flipping on the switch.

76
00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:59.240
Let's confirm that the MAC addresses on these routers so show interface gigabit.

77
00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:03.900
0 0 that's the MAC address of Rada 1.

78
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:05.790
What does it look like on router 3.

79
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.700
So show interface gigabit.

80
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.590
0 0.

81
00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.110
This is the Rogers interface.

82
00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:15.700
Notice the MAC address.

83
00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.780
The Rogers have duplicate MAC addresses.

84
00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:22.690
That's not gonna work in an Ethan Ed environment.

85
00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:29.050
So let's configure the MAC address as follows.

86
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:40.940
And let's see if a one can ping write a three Now noticed the ping succeeds and that's because the devices

87
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:45.380
have different MAC addresses now available on different ports.

88
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:49.380
Which is correct per our diagram Ethernet breaks.

89
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:57.170
If you have the same MAC addresses on the same layer to segment MAC addresses are meant to be unique

90
00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:01.970
but in the real world you can encounter duplicate MAC addresses.

91
00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:07.580
Check your mac address tables to see if MAC addresses of flipping from one port to another.

92
00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.170
