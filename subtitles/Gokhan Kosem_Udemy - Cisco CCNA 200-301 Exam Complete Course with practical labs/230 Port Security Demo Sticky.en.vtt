00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:07.420
Previously reconfigure the sport with a steady cam MAC address the disadvantage with that method is

2
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:13.480
that you have to manually configure every MAC address that you want to add to your system.

3
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.750
So if you had a 48 port switch and you wanted to promote two MAC addresses per port that's already 96

4
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.910
and MAC addresses that you need to configure.

5
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.250
So that's a lot of work.

6
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.200
On this port gigabit 00 we simply enabled port security.

7
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.510
But the problem with that method is when the switch reboots the port goes down and then comes up again

8
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.600
a new MAC address can simply be learnt.

9
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:46.400
So if we want to limit that port to specific MAC addresses and add those MAC addresses to the configuration

10
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:57.610
automatically we can use the command switchboard port security MAC address and now rather than manually

11
00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:04.090
configuring the MAC address we can use the option stickie to configure a dynamic secure MAC address

12
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.120
a sticky.

13
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.080
Now to put that in plain English that essentially adds the MAC address to the running configuration

14
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.550
of the switch.

15
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.390
So when the MAC address is discovered we talked to this command.

16
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:27.940
But notice the command was automatically added to the configuration that MAC address wasn't previously.

17
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.260
We only taught those two commands.

18
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.790
But now when we added this command the MAC address was automatically added to to the configuration.

19
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.020
The advantage with that is that when we save the configuration

20
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:51.250
so noticed when we go to the startup config at the moment no MAC address has been added to the startup

21
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.390
config.

22
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:59.700
But as soon as we save the configuration and then look at the startup config that MAC address is added

23
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.400
so show startup config

24
00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.200
MAC address has been added.

25
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.200
So the advantage of that is once again if you have a 48 port switch and you want to add a MAC address

26
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.480
per port you don't have to configure Forty-Eight MAC addresses statically.

27
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.400
If you want to allow two MAC addresses per port you don't have to configure 96 MAC addresses.

28
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.520
You can simply use the stickie option and allow the switch to learn the MAC addresses and then you save

29
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.790
your config.

30
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.200
Just remember you need to make sure that the MAC addresses learnt initially are the correct MAC addresses.

31
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.500
The idea is that you initially control which devices access the network and hence which MAC addresses

32
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.790
are lent.

33
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.580
So the advantage of stickie once again is that you don't have to manually type all the MAC addresses

34
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.760
in.
