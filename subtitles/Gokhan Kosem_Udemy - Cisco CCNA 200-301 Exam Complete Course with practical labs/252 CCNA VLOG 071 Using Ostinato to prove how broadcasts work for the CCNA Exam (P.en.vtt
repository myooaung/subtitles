00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:19.400
This typology if PC one sends a broadcast way will it go see that switch one and switch to not configured

2
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:27.960
with any lines except the default villans and draw that to is configured with subnetwork 10 1 1 0 on

3
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.650
gigabit 0 0 and subnet 10 1 2 0 on gigabit 0 1.

4
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:43.040
In other words the router has an IP address such as the following configured on gigabit 0 00 and an

5
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.390
IP address of the following configured on gigabit to zero.

6
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:57.550
One way will traffic go if PC one sends a broadcast what do you think Austine order is a great little

7
00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:03.130
application that allows us to generate network traffic.

8
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:12.230
So before I configure the PC to for traffic what I'll do is configure the router with an IP address

9
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:20.240
on each interface no configuration has been done on the switches.

10
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.350
So where will traffic go.

11
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:38.210
If PC one sends a broadcast so show IP interface brief on the router shows us that both interfaces are

12
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.420
up.

13
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:50.010
Apart from that I've done no configuration has the console for PC one small startup Austrian ATA and

14
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.330
on the East End Interface I'm going to generate traffic.

15
00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:06.020
Now I need to use Ethan at 1 rather than Ethan at 0 on these Austrian audit devices.

16
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.770
So Rick cable the network

17
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.680
the principal however is the same.

18
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.900
All I'm doing is flipping the interface number on the Austrian order devices.

19
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.720
But waybill traffic go.

20
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.130
So I'll start a new stream generation

21
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:38.890
and I'll configure the PC to generate IP version for traffic that UDP traffic.

22
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:48.020
I'll configure the MAC address as old ones in other words it's a broadcast frame for the provision for

23
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.210
destination set it to broadcast as well.

24
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.300
So destination MAC addresses old ones.

25
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:05.680
In other words a broadcast so I provision for destination is a broadcast.

26
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:14.980
So what all fusee do sort of capture between the switch and the router and I'll also do it on the side

27
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:28.610
and then all Kaptchuk traffic between the switch on the left and Asciano the PC to as well as three

28
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.040
and four

29
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:46.250
what I'll do in this case is send a thousand frames at one frame per second.

30
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:57.490
Click Apply and start sending frames on the Ethan that wanting to face the frames being sent have increased.

31
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.000
We've had about 10 frames S. now.

32
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.030
So on the link between the switch and the broader.

33
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:13.350
So this is between I was late to switch gigabit to 0 0 and the router on gigabit is 0 0.

34
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:20.940
We are seeing that to broadcast traffic what about on the Slinky's.

35
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:29.500
So this is traffic between the router and switch to notice we don't see any UDP traffic.

36
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.980
The broadcast traffic is not being received on this link.

37
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.390
What about this link.

38
00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:46.810
So this is the link between I was VLA a one gigabit port 02 to Asciano or device to filter for UDP traffic.

39
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:55.620
You can see the broadcast traffic being sent on that port so IP address and laya to address so broad

40
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.390
cross traffic is being sent here.

41
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.060
What about on this link.

42
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:09.930
So this is the link between Ioway switch to Gigabit 0 1 and Austrian Auda 3.

43
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.280
No broadcast traffic has received that.

44
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:22.320
And what a box which to Gigabit to 0 2 to ostinato device for no UDP traffic is received there.

45
00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:32.450
We are receiving it between the switch and the router and we are receiving it between the switch and

46
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.350
the second ostinato device.

47
00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:41.720
So in other words a broadcast sent by this device is going to be flooded out of all ports on Alade to

48
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.020
switch except the port in which it arrived.

49
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.690
But a router will block port Costa frames.

50
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.860
Modern routers by default do not forward broadcast frames.

51
00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:58.210
So this topology we have what is called to broadcast domains.

52
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.970
The broader is blocking broadcasts on the link so broadcasts are not forwarded.

53
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:12.910
Now what happens if we put the PC into separate LAN abune joy to this video if it's been of benefit

54
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:17.370
to you please like it and please subscribe to my YouTube channel.

55
00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.040
I wish you all the very best.
