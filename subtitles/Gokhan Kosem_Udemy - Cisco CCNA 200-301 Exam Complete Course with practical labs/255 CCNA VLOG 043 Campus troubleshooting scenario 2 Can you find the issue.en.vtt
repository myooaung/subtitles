00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.240
This is one of multiple land or local area network troubleshooting videos.

2
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:27.570
In this example users are complaining that P.S. One can't ping P.C. to his right of one acting as P.C.

3
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:36.380
one ping tend or wonder three to two looks like the pings are failing so we don't have connectivity

4
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:48.440
from P.S. 1 G.P.S. to show IP runt default gateway of the piece he is configured to tend on 1 to 2 to

5
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.700
2 5 4.

6
00:00:49.850 --> 00:01:00.430
This is a Cisco I was V router but IP routing has been disabled hence the routing table looks as follows

7
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:09.760
IP routing is disabled but a default gateway has been configured.

8
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.180
Hence we see default gateway as follows.

9
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.850
Can we paying the default gateway.

10
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.470
Yes We Can.

11
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.870
Can we paying v land 3 on the default gateway.

12
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.750
2 is in Valence 3.

13
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:32.580
And notice here is the default gateway switch one some of the documentation in this topology hasn't

14
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.460
been updated and that's something you're constantly going to find when troubleshooting Real Networks

15
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:49.600
so we can ping the and 3 on the default gateway can the default gateway ping router to see guess switch

16
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:59.120
one acting as the default gateway cannot paying ten dot one dot 3 or two.

17
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.350
No it can't.

18
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.250
So it looks like we have a problem between switch one and this broader.

19
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:13.920
Let's check if we have connectivity between the Access Switch and the core switch my topology is not

20
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.310
showing the IP address of the axis switch so let's jump on to the axis switch and confirm and check

21
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.260
what its IP addresses.

22
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:30.190
This is a problem you may encounter if you don't have no IP domain lookup enabled these devices or Iris

23
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.320
a v layer two switches and routers in ingenious 3.

24
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.460
No IP domain lookup is not enabled by default on these devices so that's probably something we want

25
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.620
to do immediately to save us frustration.

26
00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:58.700
So the command is no IP domain lookup so show IP interface brief switch has this IP address and VLAN

27
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:05.940
one can we paying the core switch on Vigeland 1 looks like we can't.

28
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:16.520
Can we ping the score switch switch to so before going any further let's update the documentation that's

29
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.400
the IP address of the switch.

30
00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:29.280
Let's check if the switch campaign switch to see has switch to show IP interface brief okay.

31
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.120
As IP addresses on the 3 v lands.

32
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:42.970
So what I'll do is update the diagram it's 2 5 3 in all the V lines so that's IP addresses of switched

33
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:52.170
to can switch for the Axis switch ping tendered 1 1 2 5 3.

34
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:53.700
Doesn't look like it can.

35
00:03:53.770 --> 00:04:01.420
It looks like there's a problem on this link between switch 2 and switch 4 for show CTP neighbor.

36
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:10.800
We do see a neighbor relationship between the local switch and Rod of 2 as well as switch to show IP

37
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:20.590
interface brief interfaces look up show interface trunk.

38
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.350
It looks like this interfaces chunking to the core.

39
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:33.750
Let's check the configuration on the core switch so show interface.

40
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.790
Trunk can you see the problem.

41
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.200
What I'll do is move the console to the left here.

42
00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.520
Can you see the issue.

43
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:55.910
What's the problem between switch to and switch for Okay so on switch for gigabit to 0 0.

44
00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:07.480
Has trucking on encapsulation is editor of 1 que native vlan is 1 on gigabit 0 1 on switch to trucking

45
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:16.940
is on but the encapsulation is ISIL so trucking is enabled with a native villain of one but the encapsulation

46
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:27.500
is wrong or different so encapsulation is ISIL on this port whereas on this port encapsulation is dot

47
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:34.390
one Q You need to have the same encapsulation on both sides.

48
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:41.400
So what I'll do is change the encapsulation show run interface gigabits 01 that looks better

49
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:58.700
canned the switch not paying switch for with IP address 10 1 1 4 it still hasn't come up what we may

50
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:06.440
have to do is wait a bit but what I'll do just to force things is shut the interface down and then no

51
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:16.750
shut it you may have a slightly different experience in Jena 3 vs. a physical switch we still only see

52
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.450
switch one through CTP there may take a while to come up

53
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:33.960
interfaces up up show interface trunk chunking is now set to Ed the one Q on both sides can this switch

54
00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.960
now pain switch to yes it can.

55
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.060
So that looks better.

56
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:47.360
If you have issues you may want to shut and then no shut the interface so that the encapsulation and

57
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:59.060
other options are renegotiated so can P.S. 1 ping P.S. To let's check if that works OK we still have

58
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:11.400
a problem P.S. One on the left is not able to ping P.C. to let's do a trace 2 10 1 3 2 so it gets to

59
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.270
the default gateway and then the trace.

60
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:22.520
Times out can P.C. to write it to acting as P.C. to ping its default gateway

61
00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:26.280
yes it can

62
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.080
notice suddenly here we had some kind of output

63
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:45.220
and I was actually running an ICMP debug here and noticed the output so let's try and do that ping again

64
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:52.260
and what I'll do is enable a debug IP ICMP

65
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:59.210
so the ping is suddenly working and that may just be something ingenious 3.

66
00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.370
The problem here is notice this option.

67
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:09.100
Be careful especially with pieces you may have a problem where everything looks good but the pieces

68
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.200
can't ping each other.

69
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:18.280
What I should have configured as an IP default gateway of 10 to 1 dot 3 or 2 5 4

70
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:23.880
so in a real environment that ping may not work.

71
00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:31.050
It depends where the proxy OP is enabled on your interview land writing devices proxy OP will allow

72
00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:36.210
a device to proxy the default gateways of other devices.

73
00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:44.010
In many cases that's disabled so you need to have the default gateways enabled on both sides to show

74
00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:45.140
IP right.

75
00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:49.090
Notice default gateway show IP rot.

76
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:56.690
Default gateways configured so be careful in a real environment and in the exam that the default gateways

77
00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:03.020
on both edge devices are configured properly so we've not fixed this topology.

78
