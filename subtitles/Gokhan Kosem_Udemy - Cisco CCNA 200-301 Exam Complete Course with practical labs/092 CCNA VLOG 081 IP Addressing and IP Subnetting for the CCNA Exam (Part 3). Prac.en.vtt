00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:19.280
This is one of multiple IP addressing and submitting scenarios rather than just working out the subnets

2
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.130
for a scenario.

3
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:28.340
We're going to work them out and then configure the devices so that we can practically design and configure

4
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.520
a Cisco IP network.

5
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.150
So we've successfully configured this subnet.

6
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.830
Now we need to configure this subnet and this gets a little bit more interesting because it's 1 9 2

7
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.620
1 6 8 1 64 slice 26.

8
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.160
So we already know what the subnet address is.

9
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.660
Now we need to work out what the first host addresses.

10
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.040
So what is the first host for the network

11
00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.940
now to work out to the first host.

12
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:06.680
You make the host portion zeros except for the last but which is set to 1.

13
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.960
But to work out the decimal value over here you need to look at the entire octet.

14
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.770
So this is 64 because that's the network plus one is 65.

15
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.600
So the first host is 65.

16
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.230
What does the last host.

17
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:34.890
The easiest way to work that out actually is to do broadcast first and then work out the last host.

18
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:44.790
So for the broadcast what we do is we fool the host portion with binary ones.

19
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.290
So what is that.

20
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:55.460
It's 255 less 128 which is 127.

21
00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.360
So the broadcast address is 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 127.

22
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:08.850
Now the last host is one less than the broadcast address.

23
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:16.960
So for the last host we set the host portion two binary ones except for the last but.

24
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.880
So what does that equal to that's equal to 126.

25
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.920
So let's assume that we configure the right over the last IP address in the subnet and then we going

26
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.360
to enable DHP on the router to allocate IP addresses to the hosts.

27
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:42.900
So you just wrote it to on the fast ethernet interface I'm going to shut the interface and then I'm

28
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:50.430
going to configure an IP address as we worked out 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 1:26.

29
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:57.210
And then we need to specify the subnet mask 2 4 5 2 4 5 2 4 5 1 2 second we paying

30
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.530
our local address.

31
00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.780
Yes we can.

32
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.740
Now for host allocation let's use DHP.

33
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:17.440
So it create ADHD the pool with a name New York and here we need to specify the network.

34
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.360
So what is the network it's 1 2 1 6 8 1 64.

35
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:29.260
And here we have an option we can either use slushed 26 or the dotted decimal notation.

36
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:40.420
So let's use Sajda or flush 26 do show run will allow us to see our configuration.

37
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.350
So that's what we've done in the DHP pool.

38
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.080
Now we need to configure a default gateway.

39
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.740
So our default gateway is going to be 1 2 1 6 8 1 1:26.

40
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:59.190
There are other options that we can specify in DHP such as DNS server.

41
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:05.530
And in this case let's set the DNS server to the local rodder in the real world you probably have a

42
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.280
separate DNS server.

43
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:08.590
So show run

44
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:19.280
this the DHS people that we've configured we've configured the default gateway or default router and

45
00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.800
DNS server now in the hosts.

46
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.700
Let's see if they get IP addresses

47
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:36.260
so on the hosts we are going to configure them to use DHP rather than static IP addresses.

48
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:44.830
So let's do that on both hosts are both PCs.

49
00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.200
Change them to use DHP.

50
00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:54.130
And then let's start them up and let's see if they get an IP address from the DHP server.

51
00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.590
Open up a console to both of them.

52
00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:05.680
So here you can see the first host got an IP address 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 65.

53
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.200
And the second host got an IP address of 1 2 1 6 8 1 66.

54
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.750
So can the second host ping the first host.

55
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.950
Yes it can.

56
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.520
Will it be able to paying the default gateway.

57
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.060
Let's try that.

58
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.040
Yes it can.

59
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:32.410
So we've successfully configured the New York site with an IP address on the default gateway and we've

60
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.530
set up a DHP.

61
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:41.390
Now one thing you want to do when you set up a DHB pool like this is specify the excluded address.

62
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:49.130
We don't want the DHP server to allocate its own address so we can use the common IP DHP server

63
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.990
or rather IP DHP excluded address.

64
00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:04.910
And we can specify a range of addresses to exclude and this example will only exclude local routers

65
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:12.810
IP address so we excluded the local routers IP address which means that it won't be allocated through

66
00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.580
DHP.

67
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:20.520
I'll save the routers configuration and while we help save Rotto one's configuration

68
00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.300
OK so at this point we've configured both San Francisco and New York.

69
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.050
The next step is to configure the when connection.

70
00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:38.950
Now it's inefficient to use a subnet that supports 62 hosts for a network that only requires two.

71
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:44.910
But for now lets start off by using the subnet that we allocated.

72
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:51.500
And then in a subsequent video I'll show you how to optimize this one.

73
00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:57.120
Let's allocate to the first IP address in the subnet to the Rodda.

74
00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.670
So that's essentially one more than the subnet address.

75
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:07.990
So one twenty nine and one more than that.

76
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:11.410
Would be 130

77
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:25.250
with subnet mask so what you'll notice is the first IP address is one more than the subnet address and

78
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:33.750
the last IP address is one less than the broadcast address so we need to know shut these two interfaces

79
00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:42.340
and what should happen now is rodder one should be able to ping router to which it can.

80
00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:50.330
So we've successfully configured the IP addresses on the when and on both landing to faces but to enable

81
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:54.480
full connectivity in this network we need to run a writing protocol.

82
00:07:54.980 --> 00:08:04.850
And in this example all run Joe GOP and enable the GOP on network 1 2 1 6 8 1 2 0.

83
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:08.780
Now that is a class full network.

84
00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:17.720
In other words it's looking at class-C 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 2 0 and not to the subnet addresses on the side

85
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.560
we'll do something similar.

86
00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:22.530
Network 1 2 1 6 8 1 2 0 0.

87
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:30.740
Disable automatic summarization so that they don't automatically summarize any network's show IP our

88
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:36.630
job he never noticed a neighbor relationship is established to write it to.

89
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:38.780
And we should see something similar here.

90
00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:45.980
Show IP IP neighbor neighbor relationship is established to route one show IP route.

91
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:54.130
Notice Rotto one has 1 9 2 1 6 8 1.0 directly connected on first.

92
00:08:54.140 --> 00:09:02.950
Ethan It's 0 0 and 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 128 directly connected to cereal to slash zero.

93
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.700
Those are the two subnets.

94
00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:14.700
It's also learnt about network 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 64 from 1 2 1 6 8 1 130.

95
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:22.100
In other words to in the same way Rodda 2 has 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 64 directly connected to foster.

96
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:30.720
Ethan it 0 0 and 1 on 2 1 6 8 1 128 is directly connected to cereal to slushes 0.

97
00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:37.280
The Serrato has learnt about a network through choppy from 1 to 1 6 8 1 1:29.

98
00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:44.570
In other words a 1 and it's learnt about network 1 2 1 6 8 1.0 so wrought at this point should be able

99
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:51.580
to ping PC 3 and PC for the pings succeed.

100
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:59.380
Now if you remember PCs 3 was allocated the IP address and we can confirm that by using the command

101
00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:06.470
ifconfig Ethan at 0 is the IP address of PC 3 PC for RDF config.

102
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:07.880
Eath 0.

103
00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:20.360
There's the IP address of PC for so rodder one is able to ping both the PCs now can PC one ping those

104
00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:25.450
PCs so it can be paying one on to one success said one sixty five.

105
00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:26.900
Yes we can.

106
00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:29.180
And 66 Yes we can.

107
00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:35.010
Let's trace 2 1 9 2 1 6 8 165.

108
00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:38.600
Notice the trace goes to 1 2 1 6 8 1.

109
00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.660
62 Rato 1.

110
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:51.090
Then it goes to 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 130 which is routed to the serial subnet and then it goes to 1 9 2 1 6

111
00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:55.570
8 165 which is PC 3.

112
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:56.110
Be careful.

113
00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:59.220
These are separate subnets.

114
00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:04.660
These hosts are in different subnets so that was an example of subsetting.

115
00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:11.680
We took a network we created subnets we worked up to the subnet address first host address last host

116
00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:17.910
address and broadcast the address and we configured the network accordingly and then we tested that

117
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:19.290
it worked.

118
00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:24.240
That was a simple example of a practical implementation of subsetting but it's really important that

119
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.200
you know how to subnet.

120
00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:27.520
