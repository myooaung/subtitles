00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:04.610
R and D guide has a lot of examples that you can look at.

2
00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:11.640
So as an example in a campus environment we may have what's called conditionally trusted endpoints.

3
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:18.590
So as an example a switch would trust the markings that it receives on a port when it sees a phone through

4
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:19.680
CTP.

5
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.840
Phones are trusted but pieces are not.

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.860
So you'll only trust the markings that you receive when you see a phone connected to the switch.

7
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:36.330
Port so with regards to trust again the switch will trust the marking from a phone but not the marking

8
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.550
from a P.C..

9
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.660
So the trust boundary ends at the phone the switch will say I see that you're a phone so I'll trust

10
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.720
your costs but a piece costs will not be trusted.

11
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:56.780
So if a phone makes its traffic with a costs of 5 for the voice and signalling set to 3 that will be

12
00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:05.150
accepted by the switch and may change those values to DCP a 46 and a DSP of 24.

13
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:13.550
If a P.C. sets its costs to 5 The phone will automatically reset it to 0 and the switch will also not

14
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.830
trust the traffic received by P.C.

15
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:26.910
they saw indeed Guide covers many switch models and many options with regards to trusting certain traffic

16
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.600
types but not trusting other traffic types as an example here.

17
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:39.310
The switches trusting the costs of value that it receives from a phone it uses what are called Class

18
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:50.100
maps a class map is a way to create groups or classes of traffic so in this example the order was VoIP

19
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:59.970
RTP trust is matching traffic with a DSP of 46 that's voice traffic the VoIP control trust class is

20
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:08.200
matching DSP is of 24 and 26 now based on those values something can be done with the traffic.

21
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:15.870
And in this example various queuing options are set so traffic is poor terrorised on queues on the switch

22
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.170
based on the traffic type that's received.

23
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.940
There are different ways to queue traffic on a switch.

24
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.830
The hardware switches will dictate how you can queue the traffic so the number of queues supported as

25
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.090
an example is dependent on hardware.

26
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.680
But essentially the idea is that you can pro try some traffic types over other traffic types by using

27
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.470
a queue in the same way that first class passengers approach tries to over economy class passengers.
