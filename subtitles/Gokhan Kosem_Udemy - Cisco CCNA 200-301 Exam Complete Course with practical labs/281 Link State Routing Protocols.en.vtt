1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Link state routing protocols have greater visibility of the network

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and are generally more powerful than distance vector routing protocols.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
As an example, OSPF is a more powerful routing protocol than RIP.

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Links state routing protocols, to use our analogy once again

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
have a road map or a map of the entire network.

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
They can thus make better routing decisions

7
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
than distance vector routing protocols which only have a road sign.

8
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So rather than just looking at the road sign that says go left

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and your city is a 100 miles away

10
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and then drive a 100 miles to get to your city.

11
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
A router running link state routing protocols has a road map

12
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and thus has better visibility of the network or topology.

13
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Link state routing protocols will flood the network

14
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
with what are called LSAs or Links State Advertisements

15
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
this information is flooded through the entire network

16
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
if routers are configured in a single area

17
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
or are flooded within the area when special areas are created.

18
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Does information about the entire network

19
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000
or area is received by all routers in that network or area.

20
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
the LSAs are propagated between all routers without being changed

21
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
all routers will individually create or populate

22
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
what’s called a topological database which is a database

23
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
that’s the same on all routers within an area

24
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
or once again if running only a single area, all routers within the network.

25
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The topological database contains information about

26
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
all routers within that area or network.

27
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
All the links to those routers as well as the states of those links

28
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000
hence the term link state routing protocol is the link up or is the link down?

29
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So router 1 as an example will tell all routers

30
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000
within the area about the links connected to it and the state of those links.

31
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Are they up or are they down?

32
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
the routers run what’s called

33
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
the shortest path first algorithm or SPF algorithm

34
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
OSPF, as an example, is Open Shortest Path First

35
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
or in other words, it’s an open standard that runs the SPF algorithm.

36
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Open Shortest Path First or OSPF, when the routers run the SPF algorithm

37
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
they put themselves at the root of an SPF tree

38
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and then calculate or workout

39
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
the best route to destination networks from their perspective.

40
00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
a routers perspective will vary depending on where it is in the network topology

41
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and thus the best route for 1 router

42
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
maybe different to the best route for another router.

43
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
The router essentially determine the best route for themselves

44
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
by running the SPF algorithm against the topological database

45
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
and then they put the best routes into their local routing tables.

46
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
examples once again of link state routing protocols include OSPF

47
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
or Open Shortest Path First and ISIS or Intermediate System-Intermediate System.
