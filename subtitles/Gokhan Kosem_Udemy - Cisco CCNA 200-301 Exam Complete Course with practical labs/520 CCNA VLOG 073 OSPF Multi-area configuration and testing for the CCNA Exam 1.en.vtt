00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.230
This is one of multiple SPF videos.

2
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:19.380
I was asked to explain Oh SPF multiple areas and this is one of multiple videos helping explain how

3
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.590
SPF works when you have multiple areas configured.

4
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:31.840
Here's a question for you in this topology which are SPF Rodda types are you able to identify as an

5
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:40.390
example which rorters in this topology or area border Rodders or a bypass which Rada or routers or backbone

6
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:48.490
routers which Rada or Rodders or internal routers which Rado or Rogers or ESB Rs or autonomous system

7
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.330
border Rodders.

8
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:57.970
So in this topology we have EAI GOP running on the left hand side then we have 0 SPF Area 1 0 SPF area

9
00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:08.800
0 and 0 SPF Area 2 and AVR or area border router is a router that has interfaces in multiple areas so

10
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:16.930
as an example rather three is an area border Rada because it has an interface in Area One and an interface

11
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:26.230
an area zero root of 5 is an area of border rather because it has an interface in area 0 and an interface

12
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:35.310
an area to it to is an autonomous system border Roorda because it has an interface configured in a different

13
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.950
routing protocol.

14
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:46.280
In this case the GOP and it has an interface configured in 0 SPF so write it to as an ESB are were autonomous

15
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:54.530
system border Radha wrote a three and wrote a five or area border Rodders or a B RS wrote a four is

16
00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:03.770
a back bone Rada or backbone area Rada it is a Rada with interfaces in the backbone area now is can

17
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:11.750
take on multiple roles so wrote a three and wrote a five are also backbone routers in that they have

18
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:18.570
interfaces in the backbone or area zero but if you will off to this question I would answer that draw

19
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:27.350
to three and write a five hour area Border Roads area border Rogers always touch the backbone area virtual

20
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:33.260
links or out of the scope of the CCMA but I will discuss how to configure virtual links which allow

21
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:44.180
you to pull or extend the backbone area across another area so area zero would be extended across another

22
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:51.770
area such as area one to allow an area border rata to have an interface in the backbone area and meet

23
00:02:51.860 --> 00:03:00.230
the criteria that an area of border road must touch the backbone area road a six is an internal radar

24
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.850
it's a Rada with interfaces only in an internal area.

25
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.520
In other words area two.

26
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:14.450
So now that we know the road types let's configure these rotors these writers have just booted up and

27
00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:15.980
have no configuration

28
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.690
so I'll bypass the initial configuration of the routers so that we can configure them manually so on

29
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:33.970
rudder one this is the rudder on the left hand side I'm going to configure interfaces in these subnets

30
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:45.500
as per the diagram as well as configure a loop back on the routers with a IP address of the right a

31
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.910
name.

32
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.230
So this is rather one.

33
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.700
So we'll configure the loop back as follows.

34
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:57.680
So do show IP interface brief shows us the IP addresses configured on the router now this product will

35
00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:08.040
only run EAI GOP so we'll configure ya job P on this rather.

36
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:17.280
In this example in autonomous system 100 and I'm gonna configure ya GOP on all interfaces of the router

37
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:24.570
I'll also turn off automatic summarization so do show IP.

38
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:33.080
Ya GOP interface shows us that you and your PS enabled on the gigabit 00 interface and the loop back

39
00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:42.830
interface has brought it to configure a hostname of right to go into the gigabit zero interface.

40
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:54.690
No shut up and give it an IP address of 10 1 1 2 slash 24 mosque interface gigabit 0 1 IP address 10

41
00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:03.690
1 2 1 slash 24 mosque and I'll create a loop back of quadruple 2.

42
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.530
Now this Rada needs to run to writing protocols.

43
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:21.690
Firstly needs to run job P and I want to enable ya job P only on gigabit 00 so notice the IGP neighbour

44
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:32.040
relationship has come up so do show IPR GOP neighbor shows us the neighbor relationship to show IP interface

45
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:45.300
brief shows us that the IP address configured on gigabit 00 is this 10 1 1 2 and do show run pipe section

46
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:55.670
II GOP shows us that we've only configured EAI GOP on that interface will enable OS SPF in this example

47
00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:10.410
on 10 1 2 1 This is the gigabit 0 1 interface and I'll configure it in Area 1 so to show IP SPF interface

48
00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:21.360
grief shows us that 0 SPF is enabled on gigabit 0 1 in Area 1 and process I.D. 1 process idea was this

49
00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:29.700
no area no we configured over there after a while we'll see the state go to D.R. if we don't configure

50
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.300
rod a 3 quickly but I'm not going to do that right now.

51
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.100
Rider 2 is an autonomous system border rider.

52
00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:44.220
We need to do what's called redistribution from one riding protocol to another.

53
00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:54.070
So basically we need to translate if you like or import routes from one riding protocol into another.

54
00:06:54.070 --> 00:07:02.040
This is very similar to translating a language like French into English or English into Spanish.

55
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:09.960
We are going to translate routes from one routing protocol into another often as it is in the real world.

56
00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:14.780
When you translate from one language to another you can lose meaning.

57
00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:22.610
So sometimes words in one language don't quite mean the same thing in another language and that's true.

58
00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:30.420
When you do redistribution Yai GOP supports different metrics or different ways of determining the best

59
00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:33.010
route when compared to always P.F..

60
00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:41.310
So when we redistribute GOP into a SPF we can change what's called the seed metric or SPF we'll set

61
00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:42.660
it by default.

62
00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:49.470
We can also change the default cost of a rocket that's redistributed.

63
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:53.530
Yeah GOP uses bandwidth and delay to determine the best route.

64
00:07:53.790 --> 00:08:00.210
Oh SPF doesn't understand that it only understands bandwidth so you typically need to specify a seat

65
00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.570
metric when you redistribute right into a writing protocol.

66
00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:12.030
Oh SPF has a default but notice when we redistribute 0 SPF into EAI GOP we gonna want to specify a metric

67
00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:19.210
and you'll often see the metric written something like this.

68
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:27.010
So we are taking rights from 0 SPF and advertising them into EAI GOP and we are also advertising rots

69
00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:30.820
from the GOP into 0 SPF.

70
00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:35.560
That's what an area border Roddick does at the moment.

71
00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:42.820
I've only enabled a SPF on gigabyte 0 1 and ya GOP on gigabit 00.

72
00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:52.820
What I'll do with the loop back is advertised that into SPF so I'll advertise this network into 0 SPF.

73
00:08:52.930 --> 00:09:01.530
So now when we use the command show IP SPF database you can see different LSA types in the database.

74
00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:06.070
We've got what's called LSA type 1 or router LSA.

75
00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:17.000
At the moment we only have one product in the database we have LSA type 2 or summary LSA is did make

76
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:17.750
a mistake here.

77
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:21.200
And notice I put that interface into area 0.

78
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:33.410
I actually want to put that in to Area One hence us saying area zero and area 1 in the link state database

79
00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:39.990
7 to remove that from area 0 and put that into Area 1.

80
00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:43.430
So show IP who SPF database.

81
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:53.840
We only see Area 1 in the database for type 1 and Type 2 aliases Type 1 is once again rather aliases

82
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:59.210
type 2 or summary aliases and we have what are called Type 5 LSD.

83
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.870
These are rats that came from a different routing protocol.

84
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:10.370
In other words they were redistributed by an ace PR autonomous system border rider into a waste P.F.

85
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:13.660
and that's what brought it to is doing in the topology.

86
00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:21.140
So at the moment if we type show IP round we will see the loot back of Route 1 in the running table

87
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:32.780
as a yard GOP rant and on router 1 we see the loop back of it to advertised into EAI GOP as an external

88
00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:41.590
route it was redistributed from 0 SPF into yo GOP and that's also true for this right.

89
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:43.510
So those are called external rots.

90
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.660
They came from a different writing protocol.

91
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:51.060
