00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:08.170
Ingenius three I'm going to drag and a bunch to host to the workspace.

2
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.350
There's a book to host will be our PC in the typology.

3
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:22.390
I'm also going to drag a router into the topology and I'll add an Ethernet switch to the topology so

4
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.540
very simple typology of a PC a switch and a router

5
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.500
I'll connect to the PC to the switch and the switch to the router that's how the devices are connected

6
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.990
to one another and all start the devices up.

7
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.000
There's no configuration on any of these devices at the moment.

8
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.850
Let's open up a console to the PC.

9
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.700
We can see that it's in a buntu PC called a buntu one.

10
00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.240
And if I use the command I-F config eat 0 you'll notice that the PC doesn't have an IP version 4 dress

11
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.620
configured but it does have a IP version 6 alink a local address.

12
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.300
This is the MAC address of the PC.

13
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.520
Notice it ends in e 9.

14
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.730
This is the link local address of the PC.

15
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:27.680
Notice IP version 6 address if he A-T slash 64 mosque scope is link local.

16
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.690
So let's have a look at the router.

17
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.850
The Rotto has just it's a default configuration has been applied in this example.

18
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.630
But what you'll notice is all interfaces are currently shut down.

19
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.210
Show IP interface gigabit.

20
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.370
0 0 shows us that the protocol is down.

21
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.840
Show IPV 6 interface gigabit to 0 0 shows no output.

22
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.960
Show IP V-6 interface.

23
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.970
Brief no IP version 6 addresses are configured.

24
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.580
All the interfaces are shut down.

25
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.650
In other words they had Minister Avali shut down.

26
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:14.730
What I'm going to do at this point is shut down the PC.

27
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.180
So I want to turn it off and then I'm going to configure the router.

28
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:27.430
What it also want to do is run a wire shock capture on this link so that we can see any messages that

29
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:35.890
are sent by either the PC or the router so at the moment we're not seeing any one shot captures but

30
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.100
what I'll do on the Rodda is give it a name.

31
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:50.920
All the Nabl IPV six unique cost routing go on to Keiga it is 00 and lets configure and IPV 6 address

32
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.790
of 2001 face colon colon one slash 64.

33
00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.970
So do show run interface could give it to 00.

34
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:09.070
All I've done is configure an IP version 6 address on the interface and enable IPV 6 unicast rotting

35
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:16.180
when I know shut to the interface what we should notice is IP version 6 and messages are sent and there

36
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.150
they are.

37
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.430
So here's a multicast message.

38
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:29.580
This is to do with a melody that multicast is used for the multicast listener discovery protocol or

39
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.470
MLT version to

40
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.110
so MLT.

41
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.810
Reports are sent to this address if zero to call on colognes 16.

42
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.670
But for now we won't concern ourselves with that protocol.

43
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:55.090
Notice she has an example we have a neighbor's solicitation message from a device with this source MAC

44
00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:01.000
address 8 2 9 0 0.

45
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:06.740
So let's have a look at the MAC address of that interface.

46
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.920
So show RPV 6 rather interface gigabit 00.

47
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:19.370
What you'll notice is this is the link local address of the router and the router has joined multiple

48
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.480
multicast groups.

49
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:28.190
This is the global unicast address and if we do show interface could give it to 00 you can see that

50
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.020
that's the current in address of the router.

51
00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.280
So ending an 8 9 0 0.

52
00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.210
So this is the router sending a message.

53
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:46.560
If we open this up we can see him all the messages and noticed she has a neighbor's solicitation message

54
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.290
from the Rodda

55
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:57.530
filter for IPV 6 so we only see those messages.

56
00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.360
And here again you can see the neighbor's solicitation message.

57
00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:08.090
Here we have a Rodda advertisement message so the rod is advertising itself.

58
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.040
Notice it's advertising the source a link layer address.

59
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:19.770
That's the MAC address of the Rodda we can see the empty you and notice Schir prefix information.

60
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:25.940
2001 colon face colon colon slash 64.

61
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:34.460
So again show run interface gigabit 0 0 that is the network that we configured on the router show IP

62
00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.000
version 6 interface gigabit to 0 0.

63
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:43.710
That is the global unicast address on the router and that is the subnet that's being advertised.

64
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:51.120
So the router is advertising that network through a Rodda advertisement message.

65
00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:58.230
If we scroll down you'll notice that that is continually advertised.

66
00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:06.450
Here is another neighbor advertisement from the router's IP address to all devices on the local segment

67
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:16.010
and going back to rought advertisement notice sending it to all hosts on the local segment.

68
00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.730
Why Shock shows this quite nicely.

69
00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.800
There is a neighbor advertisement.

70
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:27.600
Here again is a router advertisement message with the Prefect's and the rod is continually advertising

71
00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:28.620
that network.
