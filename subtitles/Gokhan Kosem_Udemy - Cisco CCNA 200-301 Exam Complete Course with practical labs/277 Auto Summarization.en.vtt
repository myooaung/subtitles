00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I’d like to show you an example of automatic summarization

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
or auto summarization because it can cause confusion.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Please note that the network on the left-hand side

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
is a class A subnet 10.1.1.0/24

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
this is a subnet of the classful class A network 10.0.0.0

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
on the right-hand side in this topology

7
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
we also have a class A subnet but between router 1

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and router 3 we have 2 class B subnets.

9
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Now classful routing protocols automatically summarize

10
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
when going across classful boundaries.

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So when moving from a class A network to class C network

12
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
or class B network in this example

13
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000
what happens is that router 1 will advertise network 10.1.1.0/24

14
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
as 10.0.0.0/8 to router 2.

15
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
In other words, it’s summarizing to a classful boundary

16
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
in other words /8 because this is a class A network.

17
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Now in the same away router 3 will advertise network 10.1.2.0

18
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:29.000
to a router 2 as 10.0.0.0/8 it is also automatically summarizing

19
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000
because there’s a class boundary on router 3 between a class B and a class A network.

20
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Now router 2 received the same network from both neighbors.

21
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Now router 2 believes that it has equal cost path

22
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000
to network 10.0.0.0 in other words, it can get to that network via router 1

23
00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and router 3, it thinks that network 10.0.0.0 exist on the left hand-side

24
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
as well as on the right hand side in this topology.

25
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So as an example, if you ping from router 2

26
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
to IP address 10.1.1.1

27
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
router 2 will see that it’s routing table

28
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
it’s got 2 equal cost paths to get to that IP address

29
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
because it’s part of network 10.0.0.0/8

30
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and what it's going to do is send 1 packet to router 1

31
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and then the next packet to router 3

32
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
1 packet to router 1, next packet to router 3 and so forth and so on.

33
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
In other words, it’s going to send alternate packets

34
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
to each neighboring router

35
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
because it believes that it has equal cost paths to that IP address

36
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and can load balance across both F0/0 and F0/1.

37
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
The result is that half your pings will succeed and half of them will fail.
