00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.690
So at the moment I've configured and enabled password of Cisco no service password encryption is configured.

2
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.150
Which means that the password is shown showing clear text the advantage of an enable password is when

3
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.410
I type enable I'm asked to enter a password.

4
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.500
When you connect to a live router by default you're in user mode and if an enable password hasn't been

5
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.550
configured you are immediately able to access privilege mode or OK mode.

6
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.440
But when a password is configured you'll be prompted to enter the password before you can access that

7
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.090
mode.

8
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:42.920
Now Cisco recommend that you use enable secret rather than an able password.

9
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:50.530
And that's because this uses a better encryption Jesus empty five hashing to hash a password.

10
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.020
I'll show you a demonstration of hashing in a moment.

11
00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:01.210
In a similar way to the Enable password we can enter is zero which means we entering the password as

12
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.400
unencrypted or 5 which means that the password that follows is encrypted.

13
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.930
You don't have to enter Zerah by default either.

14
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.090
So I'm just going to say enable secret Cisco.

15
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:18.120
But notice what happens I'm told that the Enable secret you have chosen is the same as the Enable password.

16
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.810
This is not recommended.

17
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:27.130
Re-enter the Enable password when I type show run pipe include enable.

18
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:35.050
You'll notice it did except the secret password but I'm told that I should re enter the password.

19
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.080
So let's follow Cisco's advice and I'll set the password to Hello.

20
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.020
So enable secret Hello.

21
00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:52.030
Now when I typed controls that are control Z and disable and top enable I'm actually typing Hello rather

22
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:59.980
than Cisco to access the privilege mode or enable mode when I type show run will do the full running

23
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.900
config so that you can see it in the output.

24
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.950
Notice nocive is possible encryption is configured but the secret password is hashed.

25
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:10.780
It's encrypted by default.

26
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.080
You can't decrypt that in the same way that I showed you using the hacking tool.

27
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:25.040
The hacking tool only works with type 7 passwords and this is a lot more secure than Top 7.

28
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.720
Now I've shown you how to hack.

29
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.210
Type seven password.

30
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.470
It's not as easy to do that with a empty five password.

31
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.030
This tool is also available as part of the cost.

32
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.250
Look below the video to use it.

33
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.860
This is a hashing application that shows you empty five hashing versus Shaugh hashing versus Shaar 256

34
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:56.140
schaw 512 and Shaw 384 M.D five hashes 128 Butson lengths and it's actually recommended for VPN or virtual

35
00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.460
private networks that you don't use empty five hashes.

36
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.450
But Cisco routers are still using M.D five hashes for the secret password.

37
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:12.970
If I can figure a password of Cisco and then click hash this application will show me the hexadecimal

38
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:20.950
hash of that password the binary hash as well as the Shaw hashes of that password.

39
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.990
And what you'll notice is the sharp passwords are a lot longer.

40
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.710
These are hex values.

41
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.640
So each of value that you see here is four binary ones.

42
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:37.280
These are going to be a lot longer and a lot more secure than an empty five hash of 128 bits.

43
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.900
But for now keep your eye on the binary and the empty five.

44
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.140
And all I'm going to do is add one more character.

45
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:52.420
So at a one at the end and click hash again and what you should have noticed is that the hash changed

46
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.830
quite dramatically from the previous example.

47
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.350
Notice that the is 0 8 1 6.

48
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.730
When I put another character in and I'll just put in a dot click hash.

49
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.880
Notice the entire number has changed.

50
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:13.450
So even a minor change in the source text will cause the hash to change entirely.

51
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.120
So in other words if you change your password the whole hash changes.

52
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.790
So it's much more difficult for someone to try and crack this password than say using service password

53
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.140
encryption.

54
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.890
So once again recommend that you use a secret password rather than an enable password.
