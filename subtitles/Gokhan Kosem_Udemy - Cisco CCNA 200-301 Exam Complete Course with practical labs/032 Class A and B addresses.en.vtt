00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.090
The first class is once again class.

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.650
When looking at the first octet of an IP version 4 address.

3
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:16.150
In other words if we've got x x x x we're looking at the first octet of first 8 bits the first octet

4
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.160
always starts with a binary zero.

5
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.620
So in the first octet of the first eight bits the first bet is set to zero.

6
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.090
Now if we go through all the combinations in binary in the first octet that means we'll end up with

7
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.510
combinations from 0 in decimal up to 127 in decimal.

8
00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:46.840
So the range for cross addresses is from 0 0 to 2.0 up to 127 or 2.5 to 2.5 2.5.

9
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:54.300
So for completeness Let's briefly look at that plus a in the first octet has binary values way the first

10
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.070
but is set to zero.

11
00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.990
So the first entry would be 8 binary zeros which equates to 0 in decimal.

12
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:08.650
The next binary entry is seven zeros and a binary one which equates to decimal 1 going through all the

13
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:14.500
combinations to 3 4 and so forth and so on will end up at 127.

14
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:21.850
So in the first octet a class A address always starts with 0 for the first but and the combinations

15
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.580
are from 0 to 127 in decimal.

16
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.420
Now as always in life there are some exceptions.

17
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.080
So in Clauss say there are exceptions we 1:27 is reserved for the loopback.

18
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.710
I'll explain the loopback address in more detail in a moment.

19
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:48.820
You cannot as an example configure an IP address of 1:27 0.0 to one on a PC that is not an address that's

20
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.760
available for you to configure manually as a static address on a PC.

21
00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:01.480
For example zero is reserved for the whole network so that can't be used either to configure an IP address

22
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.220
on a PC so you couldn't give your PC an IP address of 0.1 1.1.

23
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:16.510
So the actual range for Clauss races is the range one dot 0.00 going through all the combinations up

24
00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.570
to 126 dot 255 255 255.

25
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.910
So in the first octet the values are from 1 to 1 26 for CLOS addresses.

26
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:35.710
Notice that on my PC as an example if I go to the local area connection properties and select IP version

27
00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.270
4 and then I try and configure an IP address of 1:27.

28
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.030
The PC tells me that that's not possible.

29
00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.300
IP addresses starting with 1:27 are not valid because they are reserved for loopback addresses.

30
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.390
We need to specify an IP address in the range 1 to 2 to 3 in the same way.

31
00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:02.020
If we try and configure an IP address of zero windows and this example tells us that that IP address

32
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:10.810
is not valid and we need to specify a value between 1 and 2:58 so Clauss addresses are in the range

33
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.700
1 to 1 26 in the first octet.

34
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.030
So in summary in a class you address the first 8 bits.

35
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.440
Note network and the last 24 bits to note.

36
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.310
HOST.

37
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.720
This is determined by the owner.

38
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:34.420
So an address like 10.0 1.1 that one implies that this is a class A address the first 8 bits is network

39
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.600
and the remaining 24 bits is host.

40
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.450
The next class of address is class B Class B addresses talked with binary 1 0.

41
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.270
Please note that's not 10 in decimal.

42
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.720
It's binary 1 0.

43
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:58.420
Cl. addresses had the first but in the first octet set to 0 1 class B addresses the second position

44
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.330
in the first octet is set to 0.

45
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:08.900
So if you go through all the combinations you'll end up with numbers in the range of 128 to 191.

46
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:16.610
So clause B addresses are available in the range 128 to 191 in the first octet.

47
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:25.740
So in clause B addresses the first 16 bits denote network the second 16 bits denote the host portion.

48
00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.560
So first two octets are network.

49
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.170
The last two octets are the host portion of the address.

50
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:42.700
So for example 1 7 to 16 of 1 1 to 1 7 2 in the first octet tells us that this is a Class B address

51
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:54.010
because it's in the range 128 to 191 So 1 7 2. 16 is the network portion 1.1 is the host portion of

52
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.380
this address and we know that because this is a class B.

53
00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.900
Address.
