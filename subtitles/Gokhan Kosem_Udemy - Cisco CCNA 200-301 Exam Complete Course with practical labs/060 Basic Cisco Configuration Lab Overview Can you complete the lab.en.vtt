00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.070
Liftoff.

2
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.450
Are you ready to start your first lab in this lab.

3
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.220
You need to complete the following tasks.

4
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.600
You need to power on the devices and then configure them as follows.

5
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:32.780
The first thing we need to do is configure whose names or device names configure IP addresses as shown

6
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.350
in the diagram.

7
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.590
Ensure that the right is camping each other configure and enable positive Cisco.

8
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.530
You need to encrypt the enabled password.

9
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.390
You need to configure a secret password of Cisco One two three.

10
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:53.330
You then need to configure the first five telnet lines and use a line password of Cisco on those telnet

11
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.550
lines.

12
00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.130
You should make sure that you can telnet from right to one to write to and then from wrote to to write

13
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.940
one.

14
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:08.260
And you should configure and test a console password of Cisco so can you do this yourself.

15
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.930
Download the packet trace a file and see if you can get the network working.

16
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.170
Per these instructions.

17
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.490
Now if you're not sure how to complete this lab.

18
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.010
Have a look at the next video but try and complete it yourself.

19
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.320
Even if you make mistakes it doesn't matter.

20
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.260
This is just a lab and it's the right place to learn.

21
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.470
You shouldn't be learning on live and networking equipment but here we are using a lab.

22
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.360
Even if you make mistakes you can simply start over again.

23
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.740
So don't worry if you break the network or things don't work.

24
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.250
Just start the lab over again.

25
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:56.250
The best way to learn again is practice and the best way to practice is to do labs so try and do this

26
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.500
lab yourself.

27
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.430
Or go to the next video and watch me complete the lab.
