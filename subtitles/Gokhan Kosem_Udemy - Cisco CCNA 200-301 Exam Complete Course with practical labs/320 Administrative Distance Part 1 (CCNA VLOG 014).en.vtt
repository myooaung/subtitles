00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:16.970
Welcome to the blog in the video we're going to look at why specific Roths were chosen rather than others

2
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.240
network running Cisco routers

3
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.340
so apologies for routers running with ingenius 3.

4
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:41.090
Let's have a look at Router one and use the Camacho IP ROFFT to view the writing table.

5
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.080
So various routes have been learnt.

6
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:51.560
The one I want to point out is the one in the writing table of Rato one this network has been added

7
00:00:51.740 --> 00:01:01.740
by E-I GOP d indicates the GOP as the routing protocol that added to the rot.

8
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.210
So we've got multiple routes but this route is the one of interest.

9
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.050
So we should be able to paying for that for that for that for which we can that's the loopback of Rado

10
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.860
for to get to that network.

11
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:25.180
We go via 10 1 to 2 and then 10 140.

12
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.130
In other words it's going via this link.

13
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:36.550
And then this link to get to the loopback of Route A for let's have a look at which routing protocols

14
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:46.010
are running on the road show IP protocols shows us that is enabled we are running OSPF on all interfaces

15
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:55.230
on the router UI job is also enabled on this router and so is up.

16
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.400
So Rotto one has three routing protocols enabled.

17
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.890
Now typically you won't do that in the real world but we are doing that here to prove a point.

18
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:12.430
So let's look at the OSPF database to show IP speak a database in the OSPF database.

19
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.520
We have a run of ID 4 out of four.

20
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.650
In other words that ROFFT exists in the OSPF database.

21
00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:30.290
So why is OSPF not chosen for those ROFFT SPF is being used for this route.

22
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.740
But it's not being used for this Schrott.

23
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.250
Why is that.

24
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:43.110
So to help troubleshoot we can use the following commands show IP OSPF interface brief OSPF is enabled

25
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:51.240
on both interfaces of Rodda one show I.P who is a neighbor but it only has a neighbor relationship to

26
00:02:51.240 --> 00:03:04.050
broaden to show IPTA GOP neighbor young Job he only has a neighbor relationship to rodder three.

27
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:15.660
Now in this typology I didn't enable the GOP on Rodda to router to only has OSPF enabled on rattus three

28
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.900
in this typology.

29
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:29.670
We only have enough GOP and ripp enabled but on Rodda too it is learning about the network 4.4 that

30
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:37.810
4.4 through OSPF from Rodda for Sarada to he's able to ping that loop back.

31
00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:47.000
But on route one the network is not shown in the writing table and that's because of administrative

32
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.840
distance UI GOP has an administrative distance of 90 who is has an administrative distance of 110.

33
00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:01.890
In other words if a road is such as Rato one learns about a network such as Ford or Ford for 4.4 from

34
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:10.630
both and OSPF router and in each job the router the GOP Rodda is deemed to be more reliable.

35
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.760
It's more believable.

36
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.590
The lower the administrative distance the more believable a route.

37
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:23.160
In this example I always P.F. has a higher admin distance when compared to your job.

38
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:32.380
So to get to this network your GOP is believed because it has a lower administrative distance when compared

39
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.040
to SPF.

40
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:41.470
So for both the loop backs of rotisserie and Rodda for the GOP is used but who SPF is used for the Lubeck

41
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.550
of Ratatouille.

42
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:53.060
So let's concentrate on the network your job used at the moment so on rotas 3 this is the configuration

43
00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.450
of your job.

44
00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:01.940
If I shut down the link on rodders 3 so I'm going to shut down the sport.

45
00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:08.820
That means Rodda 3 will no longer advertise network for 4.4 to Tarrar one.

46
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.380
What happens now.

47
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:18.470
And what you'll notice is the entry is now replaced with an OSPF ROFFT And if we trace to quadruple

48
00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:28.920
for it's going via routed to if I know shut that link on Rodda 3 the links should come up and your GOP

49
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.900
should advertise the rot once again on Route 1.

50
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:40.800
The road is replaced with an easy GOP entry rather than an always P.F. entry because the GOP has a lower

51
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.520
admin distance than I was P.F. does.

52
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.010
So your GOP is chosen rather than always P.F..

53
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.360
So just to prove the point again or shut the interface.

54
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.420
The interface on router 3.

55
00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:05.350
Before I did that and job he wrote was used but now and always be if route is used tracing to that loopback

56
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:13.390
its not going via OSPF no shut the link to a Trace again.

57
00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.450
Still hasn't switched over yet.

58
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.400
Let's try again.

59
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.800
Notice it went from that to us so different path was taken.

60
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.530
So because both your GOP and OSPF are advertising the same network.

61
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:35.070
There is a conflict and only one entry can be put into the writing table because the GOP has a lower

62
00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:42.510
head minister of distance than OSPF your job he by default has an admin distance of 90 for internal.

63
00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:49.490
Your GOP rants always P.F. has an Edmund distance of 110 and because of that job he was chosen.

64
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.410
I'll cover other scenarios based on this policy and separate videos.

65
00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.710
I hope you enjoyed the video.
