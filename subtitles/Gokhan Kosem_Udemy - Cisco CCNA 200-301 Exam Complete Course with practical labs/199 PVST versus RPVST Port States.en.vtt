00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
What you’ll notice is Spanning Tree convergence is very quick

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and that’s because we’re running Rapid PVST+

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I didn’t make any changes on these switches from the Spanning Tree point of view.

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So the command sh run | include span   shows the default config

5
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and notice the Spanning Tree used is Rapid PVST.

6
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
in the output, it shows us RSTP or Rapid Spanning Tree

7
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
but this is actually Rapid Per-VLAN Spanning Tree.

8
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We can change the mode of spanning Tree

9
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
but before I do that just to make the point again.

10
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
at the moment sh spanning-tree on switch 3

11
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
shows that the root port is gigabit 0/1 this port.

12
00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.000
If I shut that port down and then type sh spanning-tree again

13
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
what you’ll notice is gigabit 0/0 is the root port.

14
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
convergence is very quick with Rapid Spanning Tree

15
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
because it doesn’t use timers.

16
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So the max age and forward delay timers are not used for convergence.

17
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The switches send messages to each other

18
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
with Rapid Spanning Tree to enable quick convergence.

19
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So now if we change the Spanning Tree type or mode to PVST

20
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
we should see that Spanning Tree takes a lot longer to converge.

21
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So I’ll change that on all switches; switch 3, switch 4, switch 5.

22
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So back on switch 3 sh spanning-tree

23
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
notice we can see that the switch is still learning

24
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
which ports are the root port

25
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
designated port or blocking port, when in the learning state

26
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
traffic will be block

27
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
user traffic will only be forwarded

28
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
when ports transition to the forwarding state.

29
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
At the moment you can see that the Spanning Tree

30
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
protocol used are shown here is IEEE

31
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
but once again you need to be careful

32
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
because on Cisco switches even though it displays IEEE

33
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
we're actually using PVST

34
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
PVST is once again backward compatible

35
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
so it will be able to talk to an 802.1D switch

36
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
from another vendor as an example

37
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
so we can see IEEE in the output here.

38
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
So once again sh spanning-tree

39
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
the root port, in this case, is now gigabit 0/0.

40
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So what happened because previously we had switch 1 as the root.

41
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.000
It still has our command sh spanning-tree

42
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
shows us that the switch is the root of the topology

43
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
but gigabit 0/1 is not shown in the output here

44
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
because I need to no shut that port.

45
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
So conf t interface g0/1 no shut

46
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
sh spanning-tree

47
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
notice that port is a listening port

48
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
gigabit 0/0 is a blocking port.

49
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
So this port is blocking, this port is listening

50
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and what you’ll notice is it will take it a while to converge

51
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
I'll put an IP address on this switch

52
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I’ll be waiting and then I'll demonstrate this again.

53
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Put an IP address on switch 1.

54
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
I’ll no shut the interface

55
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000
so ping 10.1.1.1 it can ping itself

56
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
switch 3 no shut the interface

57
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Ping 10.1.1.1 ping succeeds so I'll just do that again.

58
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Notice the ping from switch 3 to switch 1 succeeds.

59
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
sh spanning-tree  convergence has taken place

60
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
because gigabit 0/1 is the root port

61
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and it's forwarding but now if I shut down gigabit 0/1

62
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.000
and then try and ping switch 1, the port has gone down

63
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
but pings are failing even though we have a redundant link.

64
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
sh spanning-tree

65
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
shows me that root port is still learning.

66
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Still learning, pings failed, PVST takes a long time to converge

67
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and take 30 seconds for that convergence take place.

68
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
As you can see there, it's just happened

69
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
sh spanning-tree

70
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
shows us now that gigabit 0/1 is forwarding.

71
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
But once again if I no shut gigabit 0/1

72
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
and did the ping again, the ping would fail

73
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
because it now needs to learn that this is the better path.

74
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
sh spanning-tree

75
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000
notice the root port gigabit 0/1 is in the listening state.

76
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
So we have listening, then we have learning

77
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and after while it should go to forwarding

78
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
but that can take 30 seconds

79
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
so it’s still learning, now it's gone to forwarding

80
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and now pings will succeed.

81
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
So ports have different states.

82
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
in a blocking state, user traffic is not forwarded

83
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
the switch doesn’t learn MAC addresses based on frames received.

84
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
This is a stable state for a port.

85
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
A listening and learning port do not forward frames either

86
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
listening ports don’t learn MAC address based on frames received

87
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
In other words, they don’t update the MAC address table.

88
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
A learning port does update the MAC address table.

89
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
This is a temporary state or transitionary state

90
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
while the switch has learned the topology.

91
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
In a forwarding state frames are forwarded

92
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
MAC addresses are learned and this is a stable state

93
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
in other words, this is not a transitionary state

94
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
this state will stay that way until there's change in the topology.

95
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
A disabled port doesn’t receive6:01 PM 6/21/2017 frames, doesn’t forward frames

96
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
doesn’t learn about MAC addresses on a port

97
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
and this port will stand at state until you enable the port.

98
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Now if we change that to Rapid Spanning Tree

99
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
So spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst

100
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
what we should notice is that convergence takes place a lot quicker.

101
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
I’ll only enable Rapid Spanning Tree on switch 1, 2 and 3

102
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:34.000
sh spanning-tree rather sh spanning-tree

103
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
shows us that the Spanning Tree mode now enabled

104
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
is Rapid Per-VLAN spanning Tree

105
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
we’ve got a path cost using gigabit 0/1

106
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
so as you can see gigabit 0/1 is the root port.

107
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
The switch can ping switch 1

108
00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:02.000
I'll shut that port down and when we do a ping again

109
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
it instantly can ping switch 1

110
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
even though we’ve just seen the interface go down in the output here

111
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.000
because Spanning Tree converge is a lot quicker when using Rapid Spanning Tree.

112
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
So the moral of the story is that in the real world

113
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
you wanna use Rapid PVST rather than PVST.
