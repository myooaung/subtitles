00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:15.730
This is one of multiple IP version 6 of trouble shooting videos in the typology.

2
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:23.200
We've been told that rodder one on the left is not able to ping the loopback of router 3 on the right.

3
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:33.010
So let's verify that ping and one face three we getting an unreachable message.

4
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.040
So let's have a look at the writing table.

5
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.600
Show IPV six.

6
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.370
We've got a default route to rodded to.

7
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:50.550
So when we use a trace route to that address notice the traffic gets to write it to but gets no further.

8
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.580
So we're getting unreachable messages.

9
00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:01.950
Let's have a look at Rodda to ping 2001 face 3.

10
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.450
Notice the output.

11
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.530
No valid ranked for destination.

12
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.180
So let's have a look at the writing table.

13
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.540
So show IPV six ROFFT do you see a rat in the writing table for the loop back of rodders 3.

14
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.670
This is a connected and local Raat connected local.

15
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.870
There is no static route for the loop back of rightish 3.

16
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.960
This is a static route for the loop back over out of one.

17
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.070
So show run pipe include ront.

18
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:41.570
So here's the static route to rodder one has a default prompt pointing to rodders 3.

19
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.840
So what do you think is the problem here.

20
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.210
We have a static route configured but it's not showing up in the writing table.

21
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.530
What's the problem.

22
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:56.380
Let's have a look at our interfaces show IP B-6 interface brief.

23
00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.750
Can you see the problem in the output

24
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.810
notice you give it to 0 1 is administratively down.

25
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:06.660
That's a problem.

26
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:16.160
So interface gigabit is 0 1 No shut show IPV 6 route.

27
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.530
Suddenly we see the default route in the IP writing table.

28
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:32.680
And if we paying 2001 face 3 the pings succeeds on the site when we do the trace route notice that succeeds.

29
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:39.080
So rather one is able to ping the loopback of router 3.

30
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:48.070
I don't forget IPV six is a layer 3 protocol in the same way that IP version full is a layer 3 protocol

31
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.090
layer 3 protocols rely on Layer two protocols and layer 1 protocols.

32
00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:01.600
So show CGP neighbors would allow us to verify and check layer 1 and 2 and we could also look at the

33
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:08.800
interfaces on the router by using commands such as show interface gigabit zero or one that would allow

34
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.960
us to check if the interfaces up up

35
00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.050
or show IP V-6 interface gigabit to 0 or 1.

36
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.230
This would show us whether the interface is up and also allow us to verify IP addresses configured on

37
00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.860
that interface.

38
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.130
One of the hardest parts was troubleshooting networks is to narrow down where the problem is in the

39
00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.040
network.

40
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:39.130
It can be something as simple as an interface shut down or a cable that's unplugged or a damaged cable.

41
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:47.870
Hialeah protocols rely on the lower layer protocols so you need to use the oocyte model in your troubleshooting

42
00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.330
to help you find where the problem is.

43
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.460
This wasn't a layer 3 issue.

44
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.330
In other words it's not a routing issue or an IP version 6 issue.

45
00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.710
It was a physical issue.

46
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.460
The interface on the road was shut down.

47
00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.400
