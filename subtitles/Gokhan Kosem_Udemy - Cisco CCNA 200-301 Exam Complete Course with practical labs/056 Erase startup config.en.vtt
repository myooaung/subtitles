00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now a erase startup config erases the startup config on the switch or router.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So on my router show startup-config

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
shows output, so I can see that I’m using so many bytes out of so many bytes.

4
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So there’s my startup config

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
erase startup config

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I'm told that erasing the nvram filesystem

7
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
will remove all configuration files.

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I’m gonna hit enter to continue.

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We can see in the output that nvram has been erased

10
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and we can see that there's been the initialization of the geometry of nvram.

11
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So now sh start shows that startup config is not present.

12
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
wr is a shorthand command for write memory

13
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
so could’ve type right memory, which is an older command

14
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000
that once again is easier to use and quicker than typing copy running config

15
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
startup config and confirming the save of current config to NVRAM.

16
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So now if I type sh start my config is there

17
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
once again erase startup config erases the configuration

18
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
so sh start shows me that the config is not present.

19
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
If I reloaded the router at this point

20
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
it would boot up with no configuration

21
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
as the startup config has been erased.

22
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Running config is stored in RAM which is lost when the router is rebooted

23
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
so it’s good practice to save your configuration on regular bases.
