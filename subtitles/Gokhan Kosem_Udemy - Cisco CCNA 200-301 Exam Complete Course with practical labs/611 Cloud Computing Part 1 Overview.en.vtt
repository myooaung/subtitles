In this video we going to talk about cloud computing now most of us are familiar with the concept of

2
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.540
running an operating system on a P.C..

3
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.870
So as an example I've got a Windows 7 P.C..

4
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.690
This is a Windows 7 operating system installed on a physical server.

5
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:28.690
I'm connecting to that Windows P.C. using Microsoft remote desktop and I'm using a Mac for these recordings.

6
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:34.650
So I've got a Mac and I'm running Janus 3 as an example locally on my Mac.

7
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:42.900
Now in the same way that operating systems are installed on laptops and PS servers in the past we have

8
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:49.960
physical pieces that you would install operating systems on and you would run applications on individual

9
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.770
physical servers.

10
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:59.920
So as an example if you wanted a e-mail server you would order a physical server you'd install the Windows

11
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.610
operating system and then you would install exchange and configure Exchange to give you email if you

12
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.970
wanted to file server you would order a physical server then you would install Windows on it and then

13
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:19.270
you would store your files on that physical server if you wanted a web server you would order a third

14
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:26.320
server install an operating system such as Linux or Windows on that server and then run a web server

15
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.540
using ISIS or Apache.

16
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.460
So in the past companies had physical servers and in many cases it was one server per function if you

17
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:45.730
needed a file server an email server a web server a database server etc. you would buy a physical server

18
00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:53.970
per application and if you needed more capacity you would buy more physical servers.

19
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.110
Now in many cases that's inefficient.

20
00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:04.250
Not all applications require all the memory and all the CPSU on a physical P.C. all the time.

21
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.320
So for a number of years there's been a trend to virtualization.

22
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.610
In other words you virtualize the operating system in what are called virtual machines rather than running

23
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.280
individual operating systems on bare metal or physical pieces.

24
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:29.830
You run operating systems in virtual machines and you host multiple servers virtually on a single physical

25
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:30.250
server.
