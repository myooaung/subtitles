00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:02.490
Let's do some testing.

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:12.210
One writer one interface cereal 0 1 0 encapsulation.

3
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.270
I've said this to me before I do that.

4
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.000
Notice there are various options and I'll say this too.

5
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:28.390
And what we should see is that the interface goes down and there you go line protocol these don't show

6
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:35.140
interface serial 0 1 0 0.

7
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.540
What you'll notice is the physical interfaces up but the line protocol is down.

8
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:49.600
So there's a problem at the layer to this interface is using PDP where as router to show interface serials

9
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.390
0 1 0.

10
00:00:53.410 --> 00:01:00.910
So what is routed to using as we can see here ratus using HDL see the physical interface is still up

11
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.300
to the line protocol is down because different solutions are being used.

12
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:16.430
The one side is using the other side is using HTL see physical clock rate is there but the line protocols

13
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.060
are down.

14
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.280
So on the site I'll change the encapsulation

15
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:32.820
to BP and hopefully we should see the interfaces come up and they you go into faces come up and on the

16
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.510
side interfaces come up.

17
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:42.960
What I'd like you to see is that different encapsulations can be used on interfaces on a router but

18
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.870
across a point to point link.

19
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.080
Both sides have to agree on encapsulation.

20
00:01:48.300 --> 00:02:05.860
So as an example on this 1841 router Sariel 0 1 0 is using PDP but on this interface serial 0 0 0 encapsulation

21
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.170
is HDL C..

22
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:15.730
That means that this cable is using HDL C and this cable is using GPP the 1841 rodded to device needs

23
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.930
to be using PDP and the 17:21 needs to be using HDL.

24
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.270
So the same encapsulation has to be used on both ends.

25
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.760
If I shut down an interface I'm going to shut down.

26
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.370
Serial is 0 1 0.

27
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:43.370
Notice on this side we see that the interface went down and the line protocol went down.

28
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.590
Show interface serial is 0 1 0.

29
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.920
Here the physical interface has gone down as well as the line protocol.

30
00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:02.640
If there's a problem between the DTV and the DC we are going to see the physical interface go down shut

31
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.830
it on the side.

32
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.760
You should see the interface come up in the same way if I shut it down on this side

33
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:23.050
we'll see the interface go down on Rotto one and there you go into face went down the line protocol

34
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:29.200
and don't shut it.

35
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.850
It may take a few seconds and that's because

36
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.030
the keep alive the same every ten seconds on a link.

37
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.640
So it may not be instant.

38
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.130
Here it is because this cable is connected back to back.

39
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:50.240
But in the real world that may not be true may take a while for the interface to go down to come up.

40
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.390
So what do you need to remember.

41
00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:01.560
It's fairly easy to configure serial interfaces on the one interface.

42
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.730
We changed the encapsulation but on the other we didn't.

43
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:14.360
So all we need to do is no shut the interface and put an IP address on and configure the relevant bandwidth.

44
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:21.620
If it is a DC interface like in this example we need to put the clock rate on.

45
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:31.250
So on DC interfaces you put the clock rate but not on DTV interfaces on a DTV you put the bandwidth

46
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.850
and the relevant encapsulation HPLC once again is the default.
