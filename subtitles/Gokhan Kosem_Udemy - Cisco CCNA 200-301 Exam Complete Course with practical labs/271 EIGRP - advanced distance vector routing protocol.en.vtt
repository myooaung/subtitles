00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The third category of routing protocols is Advanced Distance Vector.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000
In theory, EIGRP or Enhanced Interior Gateway Protocol takes the best

3
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
of both distance vector and links state routing protocols and combines that

4
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
into a single routing protocol

5
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You may see that EIGRP is described as a hybrid routing protocol

6
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
where it combines elements of both distance vector

7
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and link state into a single routing protocol.

8
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
That isn't entirely true and in the EIGRP videos

9
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
we'll discuss that in a lot more detail.

10
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
In theory, EIGRP takes the best of distance vector and that is very easy to configure.

11
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
You could configure EIGRP on a router as an example

12
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
by using just 2 commands and thus it' very easy to configure

13
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
in the same way that RIP in the past was easier to configure.

14
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
EIGRP, however, forms neighbor relationship in a similar way

15
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
to link state routing protocols such as OSPF.

16
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So unlike distance vector routing protocols like RIP

17
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
that do not form neighbor relationships.

18
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
EIGRP does form neighbor relationships.

19
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So, in theory, it's taking best of both distance vector

20
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and link state and combining them into a single routing protocol

21
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
that gives you the power of a link state routing protocol

22
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
with the ease of configuration of a distance vector routing protocol.

23
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
the disadvantage of EIGRP is that it's Cisco propriety

24
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
so unless you running a pure Cisco network

25
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
you may have to choose a different routing protocol

26
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
such as OSPF if however, all your devices are Cisco devices

27
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
EIGRP is a very good choice.

28
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
It’s very easy to configure

29
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
it’s very quite, it updates very quickly

30
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and is a good choice for most enterprise networks that only have Cisco devices.
