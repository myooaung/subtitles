00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Classless routing protocols, on the other hand, do advertise the subnet mask.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So as an example, they would advertise network 10.0.0.0/24 or 10.0.0.0/30

3
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
They are advertising both the network and the subnet mask

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
in the routing protocol advertisements

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
routers are therefore able to see the exact network mask

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and do not have to assume what the network mask is

7
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
on routing updates received from neighbors

8
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
classless routing protocols also support Variable Length Subnet Mask or VLSM

9
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
in other words, the mask of interfaces do not have to be the same.

10
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
one interface could have a mask of /24

11
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and another interface could have a mask of /20

12
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
as an example on serial interfaces or serial links

13
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
you may want to use a /30 mask on a loopback interface on a router

14
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
you may wanna use a /32 mask and on networks

15
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
where hosts reside you may wanna use /24 mask

16
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
in other words, on routers, Variable Length Subnet Mask are supported

17
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
different interfaces can have different masks.

18
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Classless routing protocols also support manual summarization of routes.

19
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
This depends on the routing protocol as an example

20
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
OSPF supports summarization on what are called Area Border Routers or ABR's

21
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
as well as Autonomous System Border Routers or ASBR's

22
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
EIGRP supports summarization on any interface

23
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
examples of classless routing protocols include RIP version 2, EIGRP, OSPF and ISIS.
