00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.300
This is one of multiple videos discussing IP submitting.

2
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.070
I've received a number of questions asking me to explain various submitting scenarios and this is one

3
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.310
of them.

4
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:30.720
So can the PC on the left configure it with this IP address 10 dot 1 or 2 4 8 to 1 slash 20 paying the

5
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.810
PC handled right with IP address tendered one at one time to do or to slash 20.

6
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:46.440
In this example I'm using Cisco Brodeur's as my PCs and I'm doing that because it's important that you

7
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.000
learn the Cisco Seelye.

8
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:56.680
However the subsetting behavior will be the same on Cisco versus a PC but it gives us a lot of options

9
00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.950
to troubleshoot and test our subsetting scenarios.

10
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:10.290
So this is the IP address configured on gigabit 00 show run interface gigabit 00 shows us the IP address

11
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:19.670
configuration and show IP interface gigabit 00 shows us the IP address in a notation.

12
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:27.270
So that's the address inside a notation and that's the address configured in dotted decimal notation.

13
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:34.520
I'll do the same here show run interface gigabit 00 there's the IP address of PC to a router to acting

14
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:41.520
as PC to dotted decimal notation and show IP interface gigabit 00.

15
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.660
And what I'll do is only include the IP address of 10.

16
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.910
So there's the IP address in cit. notation.

17
00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:03.350
I could do it this way which shows all the output but it's nice to have that output as well as the South

18
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.760
put on the same screen.

19
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:16.580
I'll do the same here show run interface gigabit 00 show IP interface gigabit 00 and I'll include 10.

20
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.130
So there's the IP address inside notation and dotted decimal notation.

21
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.310
So the question again can these two PCs ping each other.

22
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.780
So let's test it.

23
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.950
Paying 10 to 1 2 2 4 8 8 1.

24
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:40.660
Notice the pings are failing ping tendered wondered when I need to talk to pings or failing.

25
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.620
Why are they failing.

26
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.000
The answer is the PCs are in different subnets.

27
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.130
They connected physically to each other and we can see that by using the command show SCDP neighbors

28
00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:01.640
notice Radio One is connected to Rodda to on gigabit 00 and brought a tube connected back on gigabit

29
00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:02.870
00.

30
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.670
So they definitely connected to each other physically but they can't ping each other.

31
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:17.320
To help explain I've taken the IP addresses in decimal notation and converted them to binary.

32
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.100
So this is the binary representation of 10 of 1 to 2 4 8 to 1.

33
00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:32.630
Here's the binary representation of 10 to 1 at 1 9 2 2. to slash 20 means 20 binary ones in the subnet

34
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:33.450
mask.

35
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.040
Here's the subnet mask with 20 binary ones.

36
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:44.810
I typically don't have a space between your binary bits but I've just added that to make it easier to

37
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:45.830
read.

38
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.380
So here's the first octet second octet third octet.

39
00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:57.010
But notice four binary ones in the third octet and four binary zeros.

40
00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.840
The same is shown here.

41
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.240
Slash twenty.

42
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.200
So are these two devices in the same subnet.

43
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.800
The answer is No.

44
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.710
Because notice the nitwit portion is different on these two devices.

45
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:18.180
I've highlighted the network portion in red the host portion as shown in balloon for devices to be in

46
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:25.980
the same subnet the network portion or subnet portion needs to be the same on both devices noticed via

47
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.070
the Submit portion is different.

48
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:34.530
So they are in different subnets and won't be able to ping each other unless you put a road between

49
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.580
them or change the subnet mask.

50
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.790
What would you change the subnet mask to to allow them to ping each other

51
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:58.500
and the entrÃ©es make the subnet portion this which means that the host portion is not changed.

52
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.260
To that.

53
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.090
So this is the host portion.

54
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.000
This is the network portion network portion is now the same.

55
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:20.290
That equates to 8 plus 8 16 17 18 binary bits which equates to 2 4 5 2 4 5 192.

56
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:30.010
So previously that was the IP address on the side and that was the IP address on the right hand side.

57
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:42.500
So we would change the IP address to 10 to 1 2 1 9 2 2 2 2 4 5 2 4 5 1 9 2 0 and on the side interface

58
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:51.500
gigabit to 0 0 IP address tend to add 1 to 2 4 8 2 1 2 4 5 2 4 5 1 9 2 0.

59
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:57.620
So same IP address will have changed is the subnet mask.

60
00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:05.680
So can the rod on the right acting as our PC ping the Rhoda on the left acting as a PC.

61
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.970
And the answer is yes it can.

62
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:14.910
It dropped the first ping while doing an op but notice the device on the right ping the device on the

63
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:20.170
left and the device on the left can ping the device on the right.

64
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:32.560
And that's just because we changed the subnet mosque to slash 18 and put the devices in the same subnet.

65
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:38.860
