00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now let’s look at the passive command

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
so on router 2, I’m going to go to router RIP

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
passive-interface and in this case I'm going to specify fastEthernet 0/1

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
show ip protocols

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
notice here RIP is no longer advertising routes out of F0/1

6
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
clear the IP routing table and do the same on router 3 to speed things up

7
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
so on router 3 show ip route

8
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
notice router 3 does not have any RIP routes in its routing table.

9
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Debug ip rip will show me any RIP events

10
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
now here, the router's sending updates, it's ignoring a loopback interface

11
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
it's sending an update notice using the RIP multicast address 224.0.0.9

12
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
but it’s not receiving any updates on F0/0

13
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
on router 1, however, debug ip rip and I'll clear the routing table

14
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000
to make it happen quickly, notice it's sending updates and it's receiving updates.

15
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So scrolling back it's sending updates using the RIP multicast address

16
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
out of all interfaces that have RIP enabled on them

17
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and notice here, it received an update from 10.1.1.2 on F0/0

18
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.000
so it received just turn that off, so un all

19
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.000
so it received an update from router 2 about these networks

20
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and notice it is including 3.3.3.3

21
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
so router 1 is receiving updates and it's sending updates.

22
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:13.000
on router 2, it's still receiving updates about network 3 from router 3

23
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
but it’s not advertising any routes

24
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000
so in this example, its able to ping 3.3.3.3

25
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
because the ping goes out on F0/0

26
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and this interface is directly connected to router 3

27
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
but router 3 as an example, won’t be able to ping the loopback of router 2

28
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
because router 3 is not learning about that loopback.

29
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
The passive-interface command doesn’t stop the receiving of routes

30
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
but it does stop the advertisements of routes through an interface.

31
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
So on router 2, once again show ip protocols

32
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
so even if the show ip protocols command shows me

33
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
that it's only sending and receiving on this interface and this interface

34
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000
the loopback, it is still actually receiving updates on F0/1

35
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
but it’s not advertising updates on F0/1.

36
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
So when router 3, sends an updates out of F0/0

37
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
that’s accepted by router 2 and advertised to router 1.

38
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
So router 1 learns about network 3.3.3.3

39
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000
but it’s not able to ping it because the traffic will be routed to that loopback

40
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
but router 3 doesn’t know how to send it back again

41
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
we can prove that by doing a debug ip icmp

42
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
so when we do the ping notice, it was received by router 3.

43
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
But router 3 doesn’t know how to send the traffic back to router 1.

44
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:55.000
I’ll do un all and use the debug ip packet command

45
00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
to prove that, notice unroutable.

46
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Router 3 doesn’t know how to send the traffic back to router 1.

47
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
It doesn’t know how to get to IP address 10.1.1.1

48
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
so be careful with troubleshooting the passive command

49
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000
will stop routers from advertising routes, the show ip protocols command

50
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
once again allows me to see which interfaces are passive on a router

51
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and in this case it's  F0/1.

52
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:41.000
So router rip no passive interfacefastEthernet 0/1

53
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000
show IP protocols, no passive interface is configured.

54
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
show ip route on router 3

55
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
notice suddenly it has RIP routes in the routing table.

56
00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Ping 1.1.1.1 routers 3 is now able to ping the loopback of router 1

57
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
be careful of passive interface commands.
