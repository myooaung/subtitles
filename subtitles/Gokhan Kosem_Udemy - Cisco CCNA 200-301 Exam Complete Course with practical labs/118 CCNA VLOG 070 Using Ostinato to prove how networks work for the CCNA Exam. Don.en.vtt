00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.970
This is one of multiple questions from my CC a course for this particular question I've had a lot of

2
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:20.010
queries and a lot of students have debated the answer with me.

3
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.940
So what I'm going to do in this video is demonstrate what actually happens using ostinato.

4
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.290
So I'm going to generate frames as per this question and show you what actually happens.

5
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:40.290
So in the quiz question I've got four PCs PC one PC to PC three and PC four with these MAC addresses

6
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.030
configured and the MAC address table of the switch has the address configured.

7
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.250
If the switch in the image receives a frame with the destination port of four zeros followed by four

8
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:59.710
ones followed by four ones from PC four out of which ports will the frame be sent.

9
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:06.330
In other words if the switch receives a frame with the destination MAC address of PC one from PC four

10
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.530
out of which ports will the frame be sent.

11
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.230
Notice again that the MAC address table.

12
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:19.610
Or to use another Cecka term they can table all content accessible memory table has the MAC address

13
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.970
in the table associated with port 2.

14
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.400
So out of which port will the frame be sent.

15
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.720
What do you think.

16
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.800
OK so let's verify what's going to happen.

17
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.500
I've replicated the quiz question in ingenius 3 I've got a single switch

18
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.470
and at the moment in the MAC address table of the switch we have the MAC address associated with gigabit

19
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.030
0 1.

20
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:56.160
In other words very similar to the quiz question we also have for PCs configured with the relevant MAC

21
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.160
addresses.

22
00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.450
So this is the MAC address of PC 1.

23
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.500
This is the MAC address of PC to

24
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:13.010
Mac address a PC three and MAC address of PC full.

25
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.870
So in other words the MAC addresses of these four PCs is configured per the scenario.

26
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.190
Ostinato allows us to generate arbitrary frames.

27
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.520
In other words we can create any kind of frame that we want.

28
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:35.530
So in the question we asked are what happens when PC for sins frames to the destination MAC address.

29
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:44.760
So what I'll do is connect to the console or PC for and I'll open up to you and all the.

30
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:55.730
So what I can do here is generate a news stream or create a new traffic flow through this application.

31
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.620
So we'll be able to properly test what's going to happen.

32
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:08.740
So money is set to Ethernet to IP version for at least three TCAP lay layer for.

33
00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:16.770
And what I'm going to do is set the destination MAC address per hour question.

34
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.770
So we asked again what happens when PC for since traffic to the destination MAC address.

35
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.520
So that's the destination MAC address configured.

36
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.770
What I'll do is send 100 packets.

37
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.350
So again destination MAC address is as follows.

38
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:43.140
It's an a two frame IP version for at least three.

39
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.020
It's going to be TCAP with some payload data.

40
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:55.120
So what I'll do before I start the traffic flow is capture traffic on could give it 00 kept capture

41
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.070
traffic on gigabit 0 1 and capture traffic on gigabit.

42
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.370
0 2 of the switch

43
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:11.050
so we'll be able to see what happens on this link this link and this link for traffic sent by host for

44
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.340
world traffic out of all ports.

45
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:20.680
Well it got a port one port to port tree port 1 2 and 3 pt. 1 3.

46
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.470
What's going to happen with a traffic.

47
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:33.370
So the MAC address of the switch once again only contains the entry.

48
00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.170
So what I'll do now is start sending frame's from ostinato.

49
00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.930
You can see the frame sent is incrementing about 6 7 frame S..

50
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:50.770
So let's have a look at gigabit 00 or filter for TCAP frames.

51
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.910
And as you can see we are receiving frames to that destination MAC address.

52
00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:57.930
What about gigabit.

53
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.620
0 1 filter for TZP frames.

54
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.920
We are also receiving frames to that destination MAC address on gigabit.

55
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:16.660
0 1 What about to give it a zero or two full to 4 TZP.

56
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:23.700
We are also receiving frames on could give it to 0 2 for traffic destined to that MAC address.

57
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.520
Now the frames are obviously being sent on this link to the switch.

58
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.240
And we can see that here on gigabit is 0 3.

59
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.100
So frame's hit the switch and are flooded out of all ports.

60
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:44.380
Even though we've got to this entry in the MAC address table the switch is now learnt about a MAC address

61
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.800
0 on gigabit 0 or 3.

62
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:55.830
And that's because in ostinato we out the source MAC address as a bunch of zeros.

63
00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:01.900
What's important to note is that traffic is being flooded out of all ports except the port in which

64
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.190
it was received.

65
00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.450
And that's because it's going to an unknown MAC address.

66
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:13.480
Unicast frames are flooded out of all ports except to the port in which they arrive.

67
00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:19.480
So no answer to this question out of which ports will the frames be sent.

68
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.930
It will be sent out of port one two and three.

69
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:33.380
And that's because in this diagram P.S. 1 2 and 3 are connected to ports 1 2 and 3 PC 4 is connected

70
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.890
to port 4 when PC 4 sends traffic to the MAC address.

71
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:44.330
It's flooded out of all ports except to the port in which it arrived some hoping that that demonstrates

72
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.230
practically how switches work.

73
00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:52.400
Notice once again my why a shot captures

74
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.320
showing traffic on all ports.

75
00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:04.680
The frame is being flooded out of every port so it's received on gigabit series 3 and is then flooded

76
00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:06.930
out of every other port.

77
00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:13.590
It's not flooded back out of the port that it was received but it's flooded out of every other port.

78
00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.030
Hope you enjoy this video if it's being of benefit to you.
