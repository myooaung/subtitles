1
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.600
So again in this topology we need to configure BGP on Route 1.

2
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:28.540
Yes write a 1 IP addresses configured on Route 1 or 10 dot wondered 1 2 5 4 on gigabit 0 slash 0 slash

3
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:29.200
0.

4
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.020
And we have this loop back address configured in global configuration mode.

5
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:47.020
We need to configure a DHB excluded range so IP DCP excluded address range tend not one tenth of 1 to

6
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:57.880
10 to 1 to 10 10 that completes the exclusion of the first 10 IP addresses for VLAN 10.

7
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:09.780
I need to do something similar for VLAN 20 and now we can create a DHB pools the first pull is going

8
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:20.690
to be called a VLAN 10 the network is gonna be tendered one and tendered 0 with a slash 24 mask.

9
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.020
The default router is going to be the switch.

10
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.830
Now we need to know what the IP address is of the switch on the switch.

11
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:40.510
Show IP interface brief scrolling down we can see that on VLAN 10 this is the IP address of the switch.

12
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.380
And this is the IP address on VLAN 20.

13
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:50.850
So we need to configure the switch as the default gateway so that would be tendered one to 10 dot 1

14
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.670
again.

15
00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:03.270
Per this IP address configured on VLAN 10 on the switch we told that the DNS server needs to be the

16
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:14.460
router so DNS server tendered one to 10 to 5 for a gain to show IP interface brief shows us that this

17
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.670
is the IP address of the router.

18
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:28.300
So I've done that wrong that needs to be tendered one not one not two five four.

19
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.290
So let's look at our configuration.

20
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.780
There's the first DCP pull network looks correct.

21
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:46.180
Default gateway is the switch DNS server is the router in your exam use show run.

22
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:53.580
If the command is supported in your simulations to check your work make sure you haven't made a mistake

23
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.540
like I did.

24
00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:03.820
The next DHB poll that we need to configure is V Line 20.

25
00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:14.400
If the network care will be tendered one to 22 0 default broader will be tendered one not twenty one.

26
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:24.590
Again we can see that on the switch by using the show IP interface brief command or show run.

27
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:35.090
Scroll down and we can see the IP address on VLAN 20 DNS server tendered wondered 1 to 2 5 4 which is

28
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:42.800
the right to once again show run allows us to check our configuration that looks good.

29
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:53.570
Let's make sure that we can ping the switch which has IP address 10 1 1 1 on V land 1 ping succeeds

30
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.790
again on the switch.

31
00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:04.970
There's the IP address on V land 1 or show IP interface brief would allow us to see the IP address on

32
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.550
V land 1.

33
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.000
If you're not sure about that.

34
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.360
Have a look at your lab topology.

35
00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:17.900
You could either use shows to be neighbors to confirm whether things are working right.

36
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.090
In this example CTP wasn't enabled.

37
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.340
In the exam you may not be able to do that.

38
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.810
So have a look at your topology.

39
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:36.610
Have a look at the running configuration we can see here that that interface hasn't got V'landys configured

40
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.270
so it belongs to villain 1.

41
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:49.420
Or we could use this command show interface gigabit 1 0 1 switch port to see which v lan this interface

42
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.600
belongs to.

43
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:56.230
You can see it belongs to v land 1 shows to be neighbor.

44
00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.600
Hopefully at some point will show us a neighbor relationship.

45
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:08.510
We can see on the road as an example that the switch is connected via gigabit.

46
00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:15.440
1 0 1 to the router on gigabit 0 slash 0 slash 0.

47
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:28.050
So we've confirmed the cabling and we can ping the switch now we've configured DHB on the router but

48
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.960
the rod is separated by a layer 3 switch.

49
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:39.030
We need to do some configuration on the switch to allow DCP request messages to be forwarded to the

50
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.110
router.

51
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.620
So now we need to do some configuration on the switch to enable that.

52
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:51.390
So don't forget that in some of these labs you have to do configuration on multiple devices.
