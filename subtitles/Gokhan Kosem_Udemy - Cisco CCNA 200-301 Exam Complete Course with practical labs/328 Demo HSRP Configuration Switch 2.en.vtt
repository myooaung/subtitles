00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.820
He has switched to

2
00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:12.100
enable county interface VLAN 10 standby.

3
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.310
Now it's important for that to the same group number be used on both sides.

4
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.180
Otherwise we'll have two active routers in different groups and you'd want to do that if you want to

5
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.050
split the load with inner villain and use two separate IP addresses.

6
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.280
We won't be doing that right now.

7
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:37.100
We wanted the election to take place between these two switches for the same virtual Rada.

8
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.610
So we're gonna specify IP address and the IP address in our case is tendered one tender to fight for

9
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:55.960
we can now hit carriage return and we won't change the property by default.

10
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.760
It is 100.

11
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:07.840
So if we configure that again as one hundred and type to show run interface VLAN 10 you'll notice that

12
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.060
the property doesn't display because that's the default once again.

13
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.280
So all I need to configure is that command.

14
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.650
And now when we type should stand by

15
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:29.000
we can see that for group one on VLAN 10 the local rowdies is the standby Rada the virtual IP addresses

16
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.400
tendered wonder tend not to fight for.

17
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.840
That's the virtual age's IP router that's been configured.

18
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.760
There's the virtual MAC address.

19
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.540
Hello and whole time are set to the defaults.

20
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.760
Make sure that you set them the same if you do change them so make sure that it's the same on both riders

21
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.740
pre-emption is disabled.

22
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.340
In this example the active Rod is tendered one tendered one and the property's 200.

23
00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.550
In other words switch one is the active Rada and has a property of 200.

24
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:09.330
The local Rada is the standby rota and has a default property of 100 back on switch one show standby

25
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:17.730
shows us that the rod is still active So local Rod is active but the standby Rada of tendered one to

26
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.030
attend to.

27
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:28.570
In other words switch to is now shown with its property of 100 so that's how you configure basic HSR

28
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.260
P on the active rota.

29
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.320
We've configured this and on the stand by Rada we only configured a single command.

30
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:48.080
Now once we've done that on broader one which is acting as our P.S. let's see if we can ping the virtual

31
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:56.250
router so ping tendered wonder tender to fight for the thing works and if I type show up IP address

32
00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:03.570
a virtual router mac address a virtual router now this thing doesn't exist at the moment even if I turn

33
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:09.700
that off that's right it isn't physically connected to our topology ingenious 3 at all.

34
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.960
I'm only showing the icon here to show how it fits in the topology so it's not on it's not physically

35
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:24.270
connected anywhere but rather one acting as P.S. one is able to ping that IP address because in actual

36
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:35.240
fact it's pinging switch one on switch one we can use a debug debug IP ICMP get back on to write a 1

37
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:45.200
and notice for getting output on the console or switch one it's sending an echo reply back to 10 dot

38
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:53.060
1 to 10 tendered eleven which is rather one acting as P.S. One from a source IP address of tendered

39
00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:02.890
wonder to tender to find for the virtual routers IP address so debug IP ICMP on Roorda one acting as

40
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:13.470
our P.C. notice this piece he believes that it's talking to this IP address and it believes it's talking

41
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:20.880
to this MAC address where as in actual fact it's communicating with switch one now before we run a test

42
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:28.780
and test fail over we need to configure H.S. IP on VLAN 20 and then we'll be able to test connectivity

43
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.420
between rider 1 and Rider 2 and then verify what happens when an interface goes down.

44
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.710
Alternate debugging on switch one go on VLAN 20 standby.

45
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.940
GROUP No.

46
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:50.010
I'm going to specify one to show you that you can use the same group number in different villains but

47
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:56.420
these are separated from each other because they are in different V'landys IP address 10 dot one dot

48
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.870
twenty dot to fly for in this example.

49
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.050
So v land twenty virtual IP address.

50
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:10.620
That's all I'm going to configure on such one.

51
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:16.650
I'd like to show you how preemption works so I'm going to wait a while so that this router can become

52
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:24.510
the active router and then I'll enable preemption on switch to to show you that it forces itself to

53
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.640
become the active Roorda for that VLAN when we enable preemption.

54
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:35.610
So the state is speak it did change to active but this output is when it was still in the speak stage

55
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.820
so active Rod is unknown stand by Rod is unknown.

56
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:47.640
Local property is one hundred active virtual Mac addresses unknown but when we do show standby again

57
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:56.400
local road is now active stand by road it is unknown so active Roorda is the local Roorda using this

58
00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:03.570
mac address so it's the same MAC address on VLAN 10 and veal and 20 but it doesn't cause a conflict

59
00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:11.730
because mac addresses all layout to addresses and are contained within the relevant VLAN so show run

60
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:22.690
interface VLAN 20 that's the config of HSR p on switch one for VLAN 20 on switch to now interface VLAN

61
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:38.520
twenty standby group number one IP tendered one twenty two five four standby one priority two hundred.

62
00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:48.330
So let's see if it forces itself to become active without the pre-emption keyword so do shows stand

63
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:57.280
by preemption is currently disabled it's in the speak state and it's just gone to standby so notice

64
00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:05.320
even though this router has a higher priority of 200 the active router remains the active Roorda because

65
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:14.850
we haven't put the preempt keyword in to force the strata to become the active rota we use the com on

66
00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:24.970
standby 1 preempt and what we should see and it just happened over there.

67
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:33.940
Notice state changed to active so for Vila and twenty group one the state just changed and we can see

68
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:39.210
that in the output through the show stand by command again.

69
00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:46.710
Notice the local Rada is the active Rada for VLAN twenty group one and the standby Rada is switch one

70
00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:55.640
we can see as an example that the state changed on switch one so pre-emption forces the local switch.

71
00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:02.070
In this example to be the active Rada for V land twenty so what have we done.

72
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:09.960
Such one is the active Rada for VLAN ten switch two is the active Rada for VLAN twenty we have configured

73
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.360
HSR p on both v lands in this example.

74
00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:20.670
So the next step is to configure the default gateways on the pieces and then test connectivity when

75
00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:22.590
a interface goes down.
