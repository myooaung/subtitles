00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.940
This is one of multiple videos discussing Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol or DHC.

2
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.900
This is a DHP trouble shooting video.

3
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:28.500
We've been told that the client on the left in the apology is not receiving IP addresses from the DHP

4
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.380
server on the right.

5
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.810
So let's investigate what's happening.

6
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:42.540
So here's the client I'm using an Iowas Virata to mimic a client in this Janissary typology show IP

7
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.270
interface brief.

8
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:53.270
We have a gigabit 00 configured for DHP but the interface is currently administratively down.

9
00:00:53.310 --> 00:01:01.860
So lets enable that interface show IP interface brief interfaces.

10
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:12.220
Now up up as we can see here but at the moment we are not receiving an IP address from the DHP server.

11
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:23.570
This road is acting as the DHP server so show IP DHP pool allows us to see that a DGP pool is configured

12
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:32.840
on this Rodda with the name PC pool there are 254 addresses configured in the pool in this range.

13
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.410
No addresses have been least at the moment show IP DHP binding.

14
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:48.550
So shows us that no addresses have been least to any devices so D-bag IP DHP server packet.

15
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.200
Let's have a look in real time what's happening.

16
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.160
The client still doesn't have an address.

17
00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:04.820
So what I'll do is shut the interface down and then no shut it to see if that makes any difference.

18
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.720
So the interface comes up.

19
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.100
But notice we see no output on the DHP server.

20
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.390
In addition to using CLIA commands.

21
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:20.080
What I'm going to do here is use white shark and capture traffic on the link between the client and

22
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.630
the router to see if DHP requests are being sent.

23
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:33.380
So notice we do see a DHP discover it's coming from a device with no IP address and it's going to broadcast

24
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:45.180
of 4:35 five to four five the source port is UDP or use a datagram protocol port 68 destination 67.

25
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.340
This is the bootstrap protocol.

26
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.180
In other words it's a DHP discover message.

27
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.700
The client is trying to discover a DHP server on the network.

28
00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:07.400
In additional Stata y shot capture on the site to see if any DHP messages are received on the server

29
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.420
side set back on the client.

30
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.170
I'll shut the interface down

31
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.590
oh no shut it.

32
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:24.320
And let's see if we see any DHP traffic on the server side server side is seeing no traffic at all.

33
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:35.080
But the client site is seeing DHP discover messages and there are quite a few of them.

34
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.730
Now and why is shocked if you full to full DGP it doesn't work.

35
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.830
So you need to full to boot.

36
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:52.720
So use Boot P rather than DHP when filtering for messages we see a lot of DHP discover messages on the

37
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.800
client side but none on the server side.

38
00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:05.820
So it looks like the DHP discover message is hitting the router but is not being sent to the server.

39
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.750
Now notice the type of message used.

40
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:17.680
This is a broadcast a broadcast is not forwarded by a broader or lazy switch.

41
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:24.000
Something needs to be configured on the router to able that traffic to be sent to the server.

42
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.110
So show run interface gigabit 00 can you find the problem.

43
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.370
I've given you a few hints.

44
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:40.420
Once again DHP messages are being received by the router but they not being sent to the DHP server.

45
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:52.000
What's missing in this configuration OK so DGP messages are dropped by the router because they broadcast

46
00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:01.310
messages unless you enable the IP help address command so we need to enable the IP help address and

47
00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.440
then send the traffic to the DHP server.

48
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:11.390
Now this typology the DHB server has the same IP address.

49
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:19.860
So we need to configure the IP help address on Rodda too and pointed to the DHP server.

50
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:26.790
Now that I've done that let's see if DHP messages are forwarded to the server.

51
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:37.010
And notice without doing anything else we can now see the DHP discover this is between the Rodda and

52
00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.780
the server full to boot.

53
00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:53.420
Notice there's the Discover message from 10 1 1 2 5 4 to 10 1 to 1 not 2 5 4 is Rodda to

54
00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:08.020
notice the Discover message was forwarded to the DHP server for a client with the name client.

55
00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:14.500
In other words Rato one acting as the client.

56
00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:21.120
You can see in the output here that the broader received an IP address from the DHP server and you can

57
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.560
see that here as well.

58
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:34.590
So this is the DHP discover forwarded to the server the servers then replying back to the Rodda with

59
00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:45.070
the not for saying that this is the service IP address list time is one day default gateway or default

60
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.660
grottos 10 1 1 2 5 4.

61
00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.720
The client is requesting the address.

62
00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.170
So is why Shaw captures on the right hand side of this typology.

63
00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.100
So the client would have sent that message to the router and the router is now forwarding that message

64
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:04.440
to the server.

65
00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.130
We can see that by looking at the Y shall capture here.

66
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.420
Here's the offer from the server to the client.

67
00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:18.520
And he has the client sending a broadcast requesting the address brought costs and not forwarded by

68
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:25.530
the broader the client is requesting the address from the DHP server.

69
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:31.670
The DGP survey acknowledges that and gives the client the address 10 1 1 2.

70
00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:40.820
So previously the address that was offered to the client was 10 1 1 2 and that was given to the relay

71
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.570
agent 10 1 1 2 5 4 in other words the broader

72
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:54.670
the client is requesting that address and the DHP of acknowledges that.

73
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.300
So hence the client will rot.

74
00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:05.000
One is given this IP address and if we look at the writing table it's been allocated 10 1 1 2 5 4 as

75
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:12.410
its default gateway and that's because on the DHB server and notice we can see all the debugs showing

76
00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:17.870
you DHB discover DHP request and so forth.

77
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.270
DHP server has been configured

78
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:31.410
with this configuration client is being allocated an address in this range.

79
00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:41.450
Default Rodda is 10 1 1 2 4 4 DNS server is 10 1 to 1 which is the DHP server.

80
00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:47.740
So that was an example of how to troubleshoot Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol or DHV.

81
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:49.640
I hope you enjoyed the video.
