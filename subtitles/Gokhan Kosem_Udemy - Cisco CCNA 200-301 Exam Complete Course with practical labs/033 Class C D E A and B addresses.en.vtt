00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.470
Glossy addresses start with binary 1 1 0.

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:13.350
So once again this is not 110 in decimal but 1 1 0 in binary the 0.

3
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.840
In this case is in the third but position in the first octet.

4
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:26.460
So Class A had zero in the first but position clause be in the second and now Class C has the zero in

5
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:34.290
the third position going through the combinations in the first octet will give us a range of 192 to

6
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.810
2 to 3.

7
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:44.330
So this is the range of class C addresses in class C addresses the first 24 bits he's next.

8
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.090
The last 8 bits is host.

9
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:55.680
So for an address of 1 and 2 1 6 8 but one that one we know that this is a Class C address because the

10
00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.220
first octet is in the range 1 9 2 2 2 3 3.

11
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:08.190
So we have a class C address which means that the first 24 bits is network and the last 8 bits or octet

12
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.250
is the host portion of the address.

13
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:18.240
So in other words just by looking at an address you'll now be able to determine if it's close a Class

14
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.890
B and Class C based on the ranges we've now discussed.

15
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.110
You'll also be able to know which portion is network and which portion is host.

16
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:37.110
But be careful has mentioned these clauses have been superseded by cyder we'll see IDR now Class D addresses

17
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:45.480
are different to class A B and C Class A B and C are used for unicast traffic Clause D addresses are

18
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.870
used for multicast traffic.

19
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.140
Now with multicast addresses in the first octet the zero is in the fourth but position.

20
00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:03.390
So in these addresses the first three binary bits are set to 1 followed by binary 0 going through all

21
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.600
the combinations.

22
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.110
The range is from 2 to 4 to 239 in the first octet.

23
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.590
So this is the range of multicast addresses in IP version 4.

24
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:24.000
So here's an example address 2:39 dot one dot one dot one is a private to multicast address which could

25
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.640
be used internally within your organization.

26
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:34.740
Other examples of multicast addresses include well known multicast addresses for routing protocols such

27
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:45.980
as SPF the OSPF writing protocol uses multicast to do for data 0.04 five and two to 4.00 added six.

28
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:54.540
These multi-course in the 3:58 range are known as a link a local multi costs as these multi costs do

29
00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:03.210
not propagate off the local link or local segment and multi-course in this range are often used by writing

30
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.610
protocols such as OSPF rap and others a multicast implies.

31
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:17.700
Once again that one device hes talking to a group of devices rather than one to one communication plus

32
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.930
email addresses or reserved addresses.

33
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:32.220
They start with four binary ones and on the range to $40.00 ero all the way to 255 255 255 255 which

34
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.270
is a reserved address for broadcasts.

35
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.220
We'll talk about broadcasts in a moment but once again the important piece to understand here is that

36
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:50.430
Clauss addresses on the range to 40 to 255 in the first octet class addresses are reserved addresses

37
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.190
for both testing and other purposes.

38
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.880
So a class 8 race uses the first 8 bits as the network portion.

39
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.400
So in a pure class you address the first 8 bits on network.

40
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.860
So in this example we've got network 10.0 does 0.0.

41
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:13.620
So that's the network address and we have an IP address of 10 to 1 or 2 to 3 which is the address configured

42
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.870
on a host.

43
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.180
So this is the host portion of the address.

44
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:24.630
And this is the network portion of the address plus a networks are once again in the range 1 to 126

45
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.240
in the first octet.

46
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.710
So if a router such as the one in this picture receives traffic going to an IP address of 10 that 1

47
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:38.630
to 1 to 1 the Radu would know that the host is on network 10 because this is a class A network.

48
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:44.910
So in this case it would route the traffic to the left hand side in the same way if it receives traffic

49
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:51.990
going to an address of 12. one would wonder when it knows that the host is on network 12 and it would

50
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.920
therefore rumped the traffic to the right hand side.

51
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.490
This is the reason why two hosts can have the same host portion.

52
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:06.870
So in pull the host portion is one dot one dot one because they are on different networks the network

53
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.330
portion is different.

54
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.820
The Rodek can use the colossal network.

55
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:19.130
In other words the first octet consisting of ten or 12 to differentiate between multiple networks.

56
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:25.200
So in this case it's routing on the first 8 bits of the address with Clasby networks.

57
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.970
The first 8 bits denotes the network portion of the address.

58
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.150
So in this example 1 7 to 16 is the network portion.

59
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:39.380
So this is the network address and our host may have an address such as one 17:16 one or two.

60
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:47.880
So one or two is the host portion of the address Clauss be networks on the range 128 to 191 in the first

61
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.950
octet.

62
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:56.850
So in the same way as the previous example a Rodek can rant traffic to an address of 1 7 $2.60 or 1.1

63
00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:03.420
because it knows that the network is 1 7 to 16 and it can therefore react to the traffic to the left

64
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:09.240
hand side traffic going to host 1 7 2 Doctah 17 dot 1.1.

65
00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:16.680
He's Rodek to the right hand side because the network portion is 177 team whereas this host with IP

66
00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:24.390
address 1 7 2 or 16 not one to one has the network portion of 1 7 2 to 16 routers can run it correctly

67
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.660
once again even though the host portion is the same.

68
00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.420
In other words in this example its 1.1.

69
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.510
But in this case the network portion is different.

70
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.910
So rafting takes place correctly.

71
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:42.150
The router knows that these two hosts are on separate networks because the network portion is different

72
00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:49.950
and in the addresses one to once exec 1.0 would be a network address a host address would be something

73
00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:59.380
like 1 9 2 2 1 6 8 or 1.1 glossy addresses on the range 192 to 2G 3 in the first octet.

74
00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:06.600
So once again there are two devices in this example and they have the same host portion.

75
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:12.250
In other words not one but the network portion of these two host addresses is different.

76
00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:16.080
On the left hand side we have 1 9 2 8 1 6 8 1.

77
00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:25.590
And on the right hand side we have 1 9 2 1 6 8 2 2 in class C addresses the first 24 bits for the first

78
00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.750
three octets of an address notes network.

79
00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:36.900
And the last octet or last 8 bits denotes host portion in a class C network.
