00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.450
This is one of the multiple videos discussing or writing information protocol.

2
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.460
This is a troubleshooting video.

3
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:23.660
In this scenario we've been told that route one is not able to ping the loop back of rota for so let's

4
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.940
verify that paying for it for that for that for

5
00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.010
we can see that the ping fails.

6
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.860
So let's have a look at the writing table.

7
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.930
Show IP right.

8
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.770
OK so here's a problem we don't have any rats in the writing table.

9
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:58.010
Show IP protocols rope is enabled on the router it's enabled on the gigabit 00 interface and the loopback

10
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:05.000
interface which looks correct on brought a one according to this output we are receiving information

11
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.640
from Rodda 10 1 1 2.

12
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.290
But in the writing table we don't see those rats.

13
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.930
Notice the last update was 11 minutes ago.

14
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:24.530
So this is stale information or old information 12 minutes since we had an update from that Rodda show

15
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.870
CGP neighbors.

16
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:37.560
We do see Rodda to as a neighbor can we paying rodded to yes we can debug IP RPX are we receiving any

17
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:46.330
updates from router to OK Serrato one is sending an update out of the gigabit interface.

18
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.430
But at the moment we are not receiving any updates from router to while we waiting for that up put all

19
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.120
debug on brought it to debug.

20
00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.510
IP rep.

21
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:07.720
So back on Route 1 we are sending an update out of gigabit 00 we sending an update out of the loop back

22
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.330
we sending an update out if you give it 0 0.

23
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.580
But we are not receiving any updates on this site.

24
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.730
We are sending an update out of the loop back sending an update out of gigabit 0 1.

25
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.980
We've received an update on gigabit 00.

26
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.990
But what are we not doing.

27
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:33.100
What do you think is the problem based on the output.

28
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:41.980
I'll turn off the debug show IP protocols Rupp is enabled on right to.

29
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.000
Can you see the problem based on this output.

30
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.100
What's wrong here.

31
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.560
Well scroll down.

32
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.320
What's wrong.

33
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.910
Based on the output OK.

34
00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:00.820
Look at this passive interface when you configure and interfaces Pesah and rip it means it won't send

35
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.580
updates out of that interface.

36
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.310
It will receive them.

37
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.290
So notice it too is receiving information about the loopback.

38
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:14.600
Overall a one but Rotto one is not receiving Roths from rodded.

39
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.830
So turn the debug off on the side as well.

40
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:24.100
Notice that one has no Roths in the writing table but two does have the loop back of a one in the writing

41
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.080
table.

42
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:34.090
So it's receiving updates but it's not sending them out because of this passive command show run section

43
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:42.550
wrap those command means that Rodda to will not send updates on of kippot 0 0.

44
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.990
So brought up no passive interface kickabout 0 0

45
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:56.480
show run section wrap that should hopefully have solved the problem and it has.

46
00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.170
We are receiving updates about the loopback of Ratatouille.

47
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:11.990
So Ping to talk to the 1:58 we can ping the loop back of router to show IP route is the correct answer

48
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:17.060
is no we don't see a route to the loopback of route of 4.

49
00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.200
So it's kind of working but we haven't solved all the problems yet.

50
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:30.660
So rotten one doesn't have network fault at fault for in the running table and it doesn't have it in

51
00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.990
the database.

52
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:41.490
What about router to show IP route network for doesn't show up in the writing table and doesn't show

53
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.040
up in the database.

54
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:51.130
But we do have a Network 10 1 3 0 in the writing table and in the database.

55
00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.360
So Kemy ping 10 1 3 1.

56
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.080
Yes we can put about 10 1 3 2.

57
00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:06.890
Yes we can but we don't see quadruple four in the writing table some routers three show IP rot reform

58
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:15.720
is not shown in the running table and he's not shown in the database what about and wrote for show IP

59
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:24.200
Raat so forward for that photoed Foy's directly connected share of IP Ripp database.

60
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:30.610
What do you think is the problem the network shows up as directly connected as you can see over there

61
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:36.030
but it's not shown in the database what's the problem.

62
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.420
Show run pipe section wrap.

63
00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.030
What's the problem.

64
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.680
In this example.

65
00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:53.240
Network for he's not being advertised not entered it that way.

66
00:05:53.270 --> 00:06:04.430
Remember what it does it changes to 4.0 etc. 0.0 because this is a class a network show IP Ripp database

67
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.320
that network is now shown in the database.

68
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.200
Hopefully it's got all the way to root of one.

69
00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:19.830
It hasn't yet shown IP rot not in the database of of one yet.

70
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.700
What about router 3 still hasn't learnt about that network.

71
00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:32.450
Show IP route show IP RDP database that looks good.

72
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.040
Might just take a while.

73
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:40.440
Rip is not like other routing protocols that advertise things a lot quicker.

74
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:47.420
Well perhaps there's another problem.

75
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.910
Three can paying the loop backs of product one and brought it to kind of Pinga loop back of route for

76
00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:55.930
On know.

77
00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:07.420
So let's do some more trouble shooting debug IP wrap on rockfall de-bug IP rap on rotas 3.

78
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:13.340
Let's see if we see any problems in the de-bunk show IP protocols.

79
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:27.120
Represent abled on both interfaces and the loopback of rotas 3 show IP protocols on route a full.

80
00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.930
Can you see a problem.

81
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:42.120
If we look in the debug notice rotisseries is ignoring a rep version one packet from 10 1 3 2 so on

82
00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:52.740
all show IP protocols once again shows us that the same version on gigabit 00 on rotatory is version

83
00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:57.500
1 on the side show IP protocols.

84
00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:05.970
The Senate version is to and received version is to wrote for will accept both version one and version

85
00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:15.630
two on the gigabit interface but rather three will only receive version 2 and 4 is sending version 1.

86
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:25.920
So show run interface gigabit to 0 0 no configuration shown there show run pipe section wrap no configuration

87
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.330
on that.

88
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:34.460
So let's go into the gigabit interface and type IP up sand version 1 and 2.

89
00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.600
So I'll change it to send both versions.

90
00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:44.940
You could nail it down which would be better as only version 2 to be consistent but just to show you

91
00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:45.600
the option.

92
00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.630
Notice we are sending and receiving version 1 and 2.

93
00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:51.840
And on this side we are sending and receiving version 2.

94
00:08:52.040 --> 00:09:01.290
So show IP Ropp Now we should start learning about the loopback of Rotto for let's confirm this de-bug

95
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.130
IP RBP

96
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:15.330
show IP database the network 4 is advertised by repatched shown up in the database.

97
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:25.770
We did receive an update about network for no using up version 2 the version 1 update was ignored.

98
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.680
But the version to update was accepted.

99
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.970
So show IP route.

100
00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:41.680
We now see network fall in the writing table and we can paying the loopback of a full Saltoun of debugging.

101
00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:49.420
Just proved again we can ping the loopback or for show IP rot on Route 1.

102
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:51.820
We see the loop back over.

103
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:54.890
And we can ping the Lubeck of a waterfall.

104
00:09:55.190 --> 00:10:00.440
So that was an example of how to troubleshoot up in this example there were multiple problems in the

105
00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.450
network.

106
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:08.360
We had inconsistent versions of rip where passive interfaces and we weren't advertising a network correctly

107
00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:09.400
using the network.

108
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:12.580
C'mon Okay enjoyed this video.

109
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:17.720
If it was of benefit to you please like a piece of scribe to my YouTube channel.

110
00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.220
I wish you all the very best.
