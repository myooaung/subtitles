Another question asked is is open flow secure is software defined networking secure.

2
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:13.300
Well I'm pretty sure most of you have heard of the NSA or National Security Agency of the USA.

3
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.510
Here's a presentation on YouTube explaining how open flow is used in the NSA.

4
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.150
The NSA have the same I.T. challenges as other organizations.

5
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:33.150
They need bigger faster better networks but they need it on a smaller budget they decided that centralization

6
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.830
via open flow is key to their deployment.

7
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.710
The reason for the NSA to implement open flow is control.

8
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.710
They require predictability and efficiency to make the network more secure but also need to support

9
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.980
mission critical workloads that run over the network.

10
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.900
So in this presentation it's mentioned that the NSA are all in too open flow and using open flow with

11
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:05.520
a centralized controller is the only viable way that the NSA could technically implement their requirements.

12
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:14.250
They needed to simplify the network but have more control and centralized control using open flow was

13
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.680
the solution.

14
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.240
This presentation further goes into how it makes sense to have centralized control.

15
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.280
As an example in a corporate network you know where your DHB servers are.

16
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.000
So it makes sense to only allow DHS GOP requests to go to those servers there should be no need for

17
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.160
dynamic learning as the network is predictable and deterministic.

18
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:46.190
The NSA is deploying open flow in their data centers campus and branch offices this video contains information

19
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.930
from the NSA data bank.

20
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.500
Samsung sd s and Credit Suisse.

21
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:58.730
It's well worth watching this video as well because it very quickly gives you a sense of some of the

22
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:06.020
challenges that enterprises face and some of the solutions that centralized control using open flow

23
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.650
provide.
