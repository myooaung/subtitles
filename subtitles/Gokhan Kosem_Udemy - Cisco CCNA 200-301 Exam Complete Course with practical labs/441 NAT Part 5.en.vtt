1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.930
So these are the private IP addresses.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:12.430
Ten is a classic example 172 16 to 170 31 is a Class B and the 1 2 1 6 8 range is Class C.

3
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.600
Now don't forget there are public IP addresses in those ranges.

4
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.480
So 1 2 9 and 11 to 126 are public class addresses.

5
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:34.650
These are examples of class B public addresses 128 to one 17:15 and then 170 32 to 1 on 1 255 255 255

6
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:43.060
and then class-C is 1 2 2 1 9 2 1 6 7 and 1 2 1 6 9 2 2 3 3 255.

7
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:50.640
So based on RAFC 19:18 some B and some class-C addresses were allocated for private addresses.

8
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.170
Now public addresses used to be managed by the Internet.

9
00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.420
But they have been succeeded by the honor or intonate assigned to numbers authority the managers and

10
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:07.590
the remaining supply of IP addresses to try and ensure that IP address depletion is pushed out as long

11
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.620
as possible.

12
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.280
But these days you may struggle to get IP version for public addresses as parts of the world have already

13
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.290
run out.

14
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.390
So who's in charge of IP addresses in different parts of the world.

15
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.090
Here are some examples.

16
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:28.320
So the owner allocates public IP addresses to one of these groups as an example ripe on charge of IP

17
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.540
addresses in Europe.
