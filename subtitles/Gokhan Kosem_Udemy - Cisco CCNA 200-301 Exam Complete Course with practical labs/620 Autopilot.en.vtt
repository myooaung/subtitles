00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:12.800
So a real world example of obstruction is airplanes a pilot flying an airplane from the UK to the US

2
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:19.010
is not going to fly manually the whole way they're going to use autopilot that abstracts them from having

3
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.780
to check all the sensors.

4
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:26.120
Now in the old days they had to manually fly and then check every single sensor to make sure that they

5
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.740
were flying.

6
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.750
OK so check the altitude make sure that their altitude is right.

7
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.930
They had to check that I'm not a pilot so I don't know all the values but that it should constantly

8
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.930
check all the sensors to make sure that everything was okay but with autopilot they can say OK we want

9
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:50.120
to set the direction of flight from here to there at such an altitude and then autopilot just takes

10
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.460
all that information from all the sensors on the aeroplane and just adjusts the aeroplane flight to

11
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.600
that altitude.

12
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.760
So an airplane pilot doesn't have to keep flying at this altitude to make sure that the plane is always

13
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.130
at that altitude.

14
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.860
Aeroplane pilot can concentrate on other tasks high level tasks like checking with traffic control what's

15
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.310
happening checking the weather and making sure that there's no turbulence ahead.

16
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.920
And then if they see that there's a big storm or they told that there's a big storm ahead they can just

17
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.680
adjust autopilot to change the direction without having to manually keep control of the airplane the

18
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:32.310
whole way from London to Atlanta as an example or to California to San Francisco or whether they fly.

19
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:39.650
So the idea is the pilots do high level tasks rather than very low level tasks that makes flying a lot

20
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:40.000
easier

21
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.360
Tesla autopilot is a good example of abstraction where rather than a string low level tasks.

22
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:58.030
We give a computer the low level tasks and we can take care of high level tasks.

23
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.210
Now I mean this has been going on for years.

24
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.210
In the old days we used to drive and we used to have to check our speed the whole time.

25
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.570
So if the speed limit let's say in the UK 70 miles an hour and I'm driving on the motorway freeway freeway

26
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.060
highway whatever you want to call it I'm driving on the motorway in the UK I've got to make sure that

27
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:23.670
I keep my car at the speed of 70 miles as a maximum so I can drive slower but I can't drive over that.

28
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.000
That's a manual task.

29
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.520
I mean if I drive for three hours I've got to make sure that I am staying below that speed limit the

30
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.170
entire way.

31
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.070
But autopilot and technology has made that a lot easier.

32
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.980
So now I'm a lot of cause I can just set the car at that maximum speed and the car will maintain that

33
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:42.640
speed.

34
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.670
I mean Tesla's autopilot has taken us to the next level where I can say OK I want to go from London

35
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.300
to Birmingham as an example.

36
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.180
Well if you don't know where that is let's say London to Scotland.

37
00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.500
So I want to drive up through through that to the north of England and then to Scotland to Edinburgh

38
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.950
as an example long drive for the U.K. that is not too.

39
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:11.890
Probably not long for people in the US but the idea is I can put the destination into the satnav as

40
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.740
we would call it in the UK and it will then work out the best path to get there will the best route

41
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:18.300
to get there.

42
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.560
So I mean that's a ready machines doing a lot of the high level or should I say low level work for me

43
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.090
rather than me having a map and trying to work out the best path.

44
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.470
I mean that's what we do with the CLIA we are manually configuring stuff at a very low level rather

45
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.200
than doing that let's abstract ourselves from doing low level configuration and do clever stuff and

46
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.500
let a machine do the low level tasks.

47
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:47.080
So Tesla autopilot will set the speed will set the direction can change lanes it can keep me within

48
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.240
the lane it can do all the kind of stuff that we as humans used to have to concentrate on doing for

49
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.150
three hours or six hours or seven hours what high however long we driving.

50
00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:02.050
I mean think about it you're driving long distance you've got to constantly be awake you've got to constantly

51
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.180
judge the distance to the car in front of you you've got to constantly judge which way you on the lanes

52
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.010
make sure that you were in lane you've got to constantly make sure that if the road turns that you turn

53
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.650
properly within your lane judging all the other cars on the motorway or freeway with you there's so

54
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.740
many little things that you've got to take care of but rather than doing that why not let the machine

55
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.560
do all of that then you can relax and be there when something goes wrong.

56
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:34.510
So the idea with automation and program ability is let's get the machines to do the low level stuff

57
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:40.870
and then we get involved when we need to not constantly keeping track of are we in the right lane or

58
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.100
we're going the right speed all that kind of stuff.

59
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:51.330
Or rather let a machine do low level boring manual tasks that we have to do over and over again.

60
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.070
So if it's a menial task that can be automated let us automate that task.

61
00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.760
Machines are really good at doing repetitive stuff so that's the word I was looking for.

62
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.020
If it's a repetitive basic task let a machine do that.

63
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:11.620
Like if we have to configure a villain on a thousand switches to use a crazy example let the machine

64
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:17.630
do that rather than me telling leading to every machine and a V A SWITCH sorry and configuring the villain.

65
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:23.320
Let me credit python script and then just let the machine do that but if it's more intelligence stuff

66
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:29.710
like deciding should we had that villain or deciding who should talk to who we as humans would make

67
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:37.690
that decision we would apply the policy and then let the policy apply our intent on the networks I intent

68
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.130
would be.

69
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.200
OK finance department and sales department can't talk to each other.

70
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.910
There could be constant traffic from this villain or group to this group.

71
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.090
We have to stop using the term villain because villains are not necessarily used in all implementations

72
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.740
but say this group to this group they can't talk to each other but I'm not going to go into the network

73
00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:02.410
and manually type that into all the devices I'm going to tell the controller This is what I want and

74
00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.820
that's the intent that's then applied onto the network as a configuration.

75
00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.530
I don't have to manually go into the devices and do the configuration.

76
00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.090
My intent is this group can talk to this group.

77
00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:19.120
Now we apply this policy on the controller that then pushes it out to the devices as a configuration

78
00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.170
so we abstracted from manually configuring things.

79
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.620
Just think of where the world is going.

80
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:30.460
We are doing automation more and more with cars self-driving cars aeroplanes have been doing it for

81
00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:31.140
years.

82
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.760
So we've got auto pilot on airplanes.

83
00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:39.200
Pilots don't constantly check the gauge to make sure that they are at the right altitude.

84
00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.750
They let autopilot put them at the right altitude.

85
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.840
So they will set it in autopilot.

86
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.130
This is where we need to fly.

87
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:51.680
This is the altitude that we need to maintain autopilot will do that for them so that they can concentrate

88
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.260
on high level tasks.

89
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.610
That's where we're going with network automation.

90
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.350
You could accept it.

91
00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:58.110
This is the way it's going to go.

92
00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.960
You manually configuring stuff is not the future.

93
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.440
If you want to work on your future then spend time learning the stuff.

94
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.140
Now autopilot won't take care of every situation.

95
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:12.050
Just like network automation won't take care of every situation.

96
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:19.250
There are times when a human has to get involved a pilot if a plane is coming towards him shouldn't

97
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.890
be trying to configure the airplane using autopilot.

98
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:28.880
You should grab the controls of the plane and move the plane out of the way.

99
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.590
If there's a fire in your network fire.

100
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.720
If there's something going wrong in the network you as an engineer need to jump in and fix it.

101
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:42.870
If auto pilot on a Tesla is doing something wrong we need to grab the steering wheel and correct autopilot.

102
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:46.910
So Tesla's as an example want you to keep holding the steering wheel to make sure that you're alert

103
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:48.510
and that you haven't fallen asleep.

104
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.740
So I mean you see there's all these kinds of crazy youtube videos where guys are overriding that.

105
00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:54.170
It's obviously not recommended.

106
00:07:54.170 --> 00:08:01.880
The idea is let auto pilot do the mundane repetitive boring tasks but you might get an alert when you

107
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.670
have to jump in and fix something or correct something something has changed something has gone wrong.

108
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:07.930
You have to get involved.

109
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:12.680
So you still need to understand networking to resolve issues when they do happen.

110
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:18.530
Networking skills are not going to go away we still need networking skills for enterprises for the data

111
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:24.170
center for the cloud networking skills are still required just the way we do things are going to be

112
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.100
different.

113
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:31.520
I mean I'm quite old so I remember the days where I used to have to drive with a map.

114
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:36.070
So in the UK we had a to z maps or ATC for my American friends.

115
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:41.800
So we had this map these books that you would go and buy in the shops and then you would plan your journey.

116
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.260
And I remember going into London and it was a nightmare.

117
00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:51.100
London is not like South Africa or like the US where the roads are neat blocks.

118
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:56.410
So because of history the roads are like windy and small.

119
00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:02.740
And it's it's not easy to navigate as it is say in the US or in South Africa.

120
00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:08.090
So it was a nightmare with an 80s at trying to look in a book trying to drive.

121
00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:12.710
I mean that's illegal so someone would have to help me so they would have to try and give me directions

122
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:16.730
and my wife would want to kill me because we would drive past the street and say we just composed the

123
00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:20.220
street and she would try and find it in the book and it was a nightmare.

124
00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.140
So much easier to use satnav.

125
00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:29.270
So I put in my destination and I'm told way to go and if I miss a street it automatically recalculate

126
00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:33.860
and says OK you're supposed to turn right there but you've missed that in go another two streets and

127
00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:37.150
then turn left or turn right and you'll get back onto track.

128
00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:43.820
So let the machines do that kind of stuff so that we can concentrate on high level tasks.

129
00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:51.320
I mean the amount of stress trying to drive in London with a book map rather than satnav was crazy.

130
00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:57.250
I mean pilots in the old days trying to draw a fly should I say for hours and hours manually now they

131
00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:58.300
don't have to do that.

132
00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:06.190
Today we still drive a lot of us with cars that don't have Tesla autopilot but you can imagine where

133
00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:11.670
this is going to go in 5 10 20 years where more and more cars would have autopilot.

134
00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:17.790
So we can rest while we're driving rather than the whole time trying to monitor everything.

135
00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:23.500
I mean we are today monitoring networks manually in many cases and then we having to fix things Let

136
00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:29.590
the machines do that let the machines do the mundane boring repetitive stuff so that we can concentrate

137
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:30.460
on the high level stuff.
