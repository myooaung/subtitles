00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:07.410
Now with static Nat there's a permanent mapping between the internal IP address and a specified public

2
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:15.270
IP address while in dynamic not individual private addresses are mapped to individual public addresses

3
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.210
in a pool of addresses.

4
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.830
So as an example if you had 10 IP addresses in your pool the first host that sends traffic will get

5
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.600
to use the first IP address in the pool.

6
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:34.220
The second host would use the second IP address and so forth and so one you're not explicitly mapping

7
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.940
a public IP address to a internal server IP address.

8
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.110
So when you set up a dynamic that you're going to set up a pool of addresses you also configure it inside

9
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.890
and outside interfaces but you don't create a static map to a single IP address.

10
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.850
You create a pool of addresses that can be used by hosts internally.
