00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.220
Send this example let's assume A is sending a frame to D.

2
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.260
So the source address that led to will be a.

3
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.370
And the destination address will be D.

4
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:27.010
I will send the frame to switch one which one will then copy that frame to all ports based once again

5
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.380
on the switch architecture.

6
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:34.480
The central async will check the destination in the camp table and let's assume for the moment that

7
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.990
does not answer which ones can table or MAC Address table.

8
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:44.050
So the frame will attempt to go out of this port to 0 2 but because the internal tagged color is red

9
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.880
for that frame.

10
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.590
And this is a Greenport.

11
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.280
The frame is not permitted out of 0 2.

12
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.040
However on this port because it's a trunk link.

13
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.400
And let's assume for the moment that all the lands are allowed across this trunk that frame will be

14
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:04.220
sent out of port 0 3 to switch to however just before the frame is sent out.

15
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.760
It needs to be tagged with the villain number.

16
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.080
So in this case the villain identifier would be red.

17
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.750
Now as mentioned in switches villans identified by numbers but to keep these examples simple we are

18
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.310
going to use colors.

19
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:24.470
So this would in actual fact be a number from 0 to 4000 and 96 bedframe is then sent across the trunk

20
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:32.120
to switch to who then receives the frame once again the frame is processed internally.

21
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.430
Now this switch reads the villain identify an edited or one Q header and sees that it belongs to the

22
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:44.540
red Villon that is tagged internally within the switch the frame is sent to Allport 0 2 as well as 0

23
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.160
1.

24
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.630
And let's assume once again that the MAC address table is switched to does not contain the MAC address

25
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.570
of D.

26
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:58.040
So when the frame is attempting to go to port 0 1 it is denied because the color of the frame is red

27
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.760
and this interface is in the green Villon.

28
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.710
So the frame is dropped.

29
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:08.840
However out of this interface the frame is permitted because the port is in the red villain and the

30
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.920
frame is tagged with the red villaine all tagging is stripped out of this port.

31
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.340
So it's same as a normal Ethernet frame to PCD.

32
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.080
Once again the PCs are oblivious to the fact that they have been put into villains.

33
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.660
They just see stented Ethernet.

34
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.420
So a standard frame where the source address of a destination address a D is transmitted out of port

35
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:40.450
0 to and processed by the PC edited in one key trunked have a spatial villain known as the native villaine

36
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.270
native villans are untagged when a port on the switch is set up as a trunk.

37
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:53.800
For instance this interface on switch one and switch to that interface can receive and transmit tagged

38
00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:01.450
frames frames belonging to the native villaine do not carry violent tags when sent over this trunk by

39
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.480
the same token if an untagged frame were received on the trunk port that frame would automatically be

40
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.030
associated with the native land for the sport.

41
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.030
Now specific management traffic will go across the native land.

42
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:22.090
So for instance spanning tree BPT use will use the native Villon and so will dynamic trunking critical

43
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.450
dynamic trunking protocol is a way that switches negotiate to set up a trunk between themselves automatically

44
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.010
and I'll show you an example of that in a moment.

45
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:38.370
Certain management traffic always uses villaine one if you have left the line one as the native LAN

46
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:45.480
traffic like CPV DP AGP and you DL D will be transmitted across the native land.

47
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:52.650
Untagged if I ever The native land is changed to something other than land one these protocols will

48
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:59.280
then be tagged in that specific villaine CTP was explained in the ICD 1 portion of this course.

49
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.190
It allows us to view directly connected devices and trunking protocol we are going to discuss in the

50
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.550
next few slides.

51
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:13.350
It is a way to dynamically update other switches with changes made on a single switch in a VTB domain

52
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:21.330
AGP or port aggregation protocol is a protocol used for the automatic creation of ether channels and

53
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:28.380
you DLT or you need directional linked detection is used to monitor the physical configuration of cables

54
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.120
between devices and detect unique directional links.

55
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.330
This allows us to detect incorrectly cabled links.

56
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.380
The important thing to take note of here is that trunk links there is a special villain known as the

57
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:46.770
native land where traffic is sent untagged if left at the default of Villa and one a lot of management

58
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.880
traffic will be sent across that native land.

59
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:56.460
Its important that the native land on both sides of the trunk be the same if they not set the same.

60
00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.620
The searchers will notify you by telling you that theres a native villaine mismatch.

61
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.990
The issue that arises if the native lands are not the same is that traffic from one villain on the switch

62
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.750
will automatically be associated and end up in a different than on another switch.

63
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.400
And obviously the whole concept of feline's is to separate traffic into a specific Thielen.

64
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:23.100
In other words a separate broadcast domain or separate subnet traffic from one VLAN should not end up

65
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.320
in another villaine because of a native villaine misconfiguration.

66
00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.360
Now this is something you probably not see in networks today.

67
00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:38.510
In theory with a native villaine a switch like switch one could say tagged frame's to switch to and

68
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.680
untagged frames to this MacBook.

69
00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:47.030
So by using the native Villon this MacBook or a PC would still be able to communicate with the network

70
00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:53.360
even though it doesn't understand tagged frames edited or one keyframes or tagged frames are used for

71
00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.040
communicating via information between networking devices like switches.

72
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.410
This device wouldn't necessarily understand edited or one keyframes but could still communicate with

73
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.840
the network by using the native villaine.

74
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.800
However that's not common today.

75
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:16.130
What is more typical Today is a scenario like this where you have a PC connected to an IP phone connected

76
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.770
to a Cisco switch.

77
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:25.010
Now Cisco IP phone has a built in three way switch one port is connected back to the network infrastructure.

78
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:32.030
So a Cisco switch a second port allows the PC to connect to the infrastructure through the phone and

79
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:38.600
a third port allows for voice traffic from the handset to be prioritized over data when sent to the

80
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.000
network infrastructure.

81
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:46.970
So the phone has a built in three way switch always proud rising voice over data.

82
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:52.510
The thing to take note of here though is that the phone can be configured in a separate Villon to the

83
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:53.380
PC.

84
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.900
So the phone could be in the red violin and the PC could be in the green line.

85
00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.610
There are a lot of advantages to doing it this way.

86
00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:07.270
So usually from a security point of view this PC will not be able to sniff voice traffic and therefore

87
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.760
listening on the voice conversation.

88
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:14.600
Now there are a lot of caveats relating to Cisco phones and different models are set up different ways

89
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:21.160
but in theory the concept is that the phone is in a separate violent to the PC and therefore the PC

90
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.090
is not able to see the voice traffic.

91
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:29.740
There are applications like Cain and Abel which is a very powerful hacking tool that allow you to sniff

92
00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:36.820
the network capture the voice traffic and then replay that traffic as a file on your local PC so you

93
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.000
can replay the voice conversation.

94
00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:44.950
But if the phone is in a separate Villon security is enhanced because the PC is not able to see the

95
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:47.920
voice traffic from a quality of service point of view.

96
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:53.130
This is also a lot better because its easier to prioritize the voice traffic over the data traffic.

97
00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:59.530
If its in a separate VM setting up your network this way also has the advantages of easier IP address

98
00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:03.680
management because you can assign a separate subnet to your phones.

99
00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:07.380
This is your PCs and thus scale your IP addressing.

100
00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:13.030
So what happens is the switch is configured with what's called a voice Freelon and a native villaine

101
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:19.780
the voice feel is tagged so tagged frames get sent to the phone and the phone with its boltin threeway

102
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:26.650
switch is able to read the edited or one keyframes untagged frames are saved on what's called the native

103
00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.960
illum or data line.

104
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:34.730
That information is sent to the phone and the phone just switches that to the PC.

105
00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:41.440
So the PC receives the untagged on native land frames and the phone receives that tagged or voice file

106
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:46.040
and frames no configuration and the phone is necessary to enable this.

107
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:51.280
You literally typed a few commands on the switch telling the switch what the voice the land is and what

108
00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.550
the DTV Bil'in is.

109
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:59.020
And this happens automatically because when the phone's boot up they query the switch through CGP to

110
00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.010
find out which feel they belong to.

111
00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:06.530
So the switch up dates the phone's configuration through the use of CTP.

112
00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:11.580
So this is a very common implementation of native lands in the real world today.

113
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:18.410
So just to sum up how ports are assigned to villans seriously they can be statically assigned by an

114
00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:19.490
administrator.

115
00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:25.460
So to use an administrator go into an interface and steadily put that port into a villain.

116
00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:30.980
The second option is to create what are called Dynamic villains using a villain membership policy server

117
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:39.170
dynamic villans allow for a ports deal and to be done emic updated based on the Mac address of the device

118
00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:40.600
attached to that port.

119
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:46.400
So in a boardroom for example when a director plugs in a laptop based on the Mac address of that laptop

120
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:52.640
that port is dynamically assigned to the directors the plan when a manager plugs his laptop into that

121
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:59.020
same port the next day for example that Villon is automatically updated to the managers Villon.

122
00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:04.400
So based on the source Mac address of frame's received in the port the port is automatically assigned

123
00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:12.400
to different lands and last year we have voice villans which are used specifically for IP phones BTP

124
00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:19.720
or villaine trunking protocol is a Cisco proprietary layer to protocol which allows for the Propagation

125
00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:25.980
of the information from one switch to another rather than telnetting to multiple switches.

126
00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:32.710
You can Karaite delete or rename the lands on one switch and have that information automatically propagated

127
00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.610
to other switches across trunk links.

128
00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.750
Notice the name villaine trunking protocol.

129
00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:42.820
This information can only be propagated across trunk links.

130
00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:48.820
Now ETP can save you a lot of time that has a lot of Sisk engineers will tell the BTP can cause you

131
00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:50.190
a lot of headaches.

132
00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:55.960
Switches can have the entire villaine configuration wiped out if a new switch is added to the network

133
00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.320
without following a proper procedure.

134
00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:04.540
So a lot of Cisco engineers will not enable VCP in modern environments because of the inherent risks

135
00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:06.340
associated with this protocol.

136
00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:13.650
GTP messages are sent to the following Mac address which is a well-known multicast address for flooding

137
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:16.950
of the CTP and DTP protocols.

138
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.400
There are three types of messages in DTP.

139
00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:25.950
You have some free advertisement subset advertisements and advertisement requests and I'll explain each

140
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.790
of these in more detail in the upcoming slides.

141
00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:35.380
But please be aware that there are three message typed when setting up DP devices will by default belong

142
00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:38.560
to the null domain VDB to work.

143
00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:45.490
You need to configure and put the devices into a specific VTB domain only devices within the same DTP

144
00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:49.460
domain will be updated with the line information.

145
00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:56.920
A switch can only be configured in a single VTB domain at any given time by default Cisco switches are

146
00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:04.450
in the nold domain or no management domain until they receive an advertisement for a domain over trunked

147
00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:04.980
link.

148
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:08.350
Or until you manually configure a management domain.

149
00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:14.830
So in this example let's assume that these devices have been put into the VTB domain with the name of

150
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:15.750
Cecka.

151
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:22.300
Remember these VCP is a layer to protocol and requires trunked links for communication.

152
00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:29.860
So VDB will not traverse Harada an important concept to understand NVP is the concept of a revision

153
00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:30.490
number.

154
00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:38.260
Every time it changes made to the villain database the revision number in BTP will increment by 1.

155
00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:45.410
So let's assume that all devices in this apology have a revision number of 1 yours in a ministry to

156
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:51.720
a villain let's say we three to the switch it's revision number will then increment from a vision number

157
00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:59.320
1 to revision number 2 that information will then be advertised to all other switches in the VTB domain

158
00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:05.410
so that they can synchronize their databases to the latest revision number which is revision number

159
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:06.440
2.

160
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:11.680
So the switch at the top will send what is called a GTP summary advertisement to all of the switches

161
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:14.860
informing them that a change has been made.

162
00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:17.610
Remember this is sent using a multicast address.

163
00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:21.070
So all of these devices will see that message.

164
00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:26.440
They will then request the latest information using an advertisement request and the switch at the top

165
00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:31.800
will send them detailed information about the change using a subset advertisement.

166
00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:37.150
The net result is that the revision numbers and all of these switches will increment to the same revision

167
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:40.740
number as a switch where the change was made.

168
00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:46.210
So Viola and three will appear in all the databases of the switches and the revision number will be

169
00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:48.100
set to revision number two.

170
00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:54.430
The whole concept with VTB is that you can make changes on an individual device as those changes are

171
00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:55.190
made.

172
00:13:55.300 --> 00:14:00.700
All other switches are informed of the change and they will synchronize their databases to the latest

173
00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:06.130
revision number so that they end up having the same B plans and maybe Lenn databases.

174
00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:11.680
That means that you as the administrator only to make changes on one switch rather than five switches

175
00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:18.300
in the apology please note ports are put into individual villans by for example an administrator.

176
00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:25.300
The DP does not put ports into individual villans it just updates the database so that the switches

177
00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:31.770
know which villains exist use an administrator still need to put those ports into the relevant villans.

178
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:38.230
So this is just a villain database update mechanism so that switches know the villains that exist in

179
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:40.810
the typology.

180
00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:43.500
So let's look at the VDB messages in more detail.

181
00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.760
The first stop of VDB message is a summary advertisement.

182
00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:51.620
This is sent every five minutes or whenever there's a change.

183
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:58.340
So whenever an administrator makes a change on a switch by for instance adding a Villon a summary advertisement

184
00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:03.590
will be sent out on the well-known multicast address to all of the switches in the domain.

185
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:10.190
So this is used to inform other switches of the current VCP domain and the current configuration revision

186
00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:10.910
number.

187
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:17.510
So as an example on switch one the administrator adds another villain let's say villain for the revision

188
00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:19.150
number will be incremented.

189
00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:23.160
So if the revision number was three it would not be incremented to 4.

190
00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:29.660
This switch will say in a summary advertisement to all neighboring switches informing them of the current

191
00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:36.740
VTB domain and the new configuration revision number switches that receive that summary advertisement

192
00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:43.310
will then send back a summary request asking for detailed information of the changes that have been

193
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:44.160
made.

194
00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:50.240
There are three situations when some requests are used Firstly when a switch has been reset or when

195
00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:57.250
the VTB domain name is being changed or when the switch has received a VTB summary advertisement with

196
00:15:57.250 --> 00:16:00.500
a higher configuration revision number than its own.

197
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:07.370
So because switch to received the summary advertisement from one indicating a high revision number.

198
00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:12.170
In other words the revision number and which one is revision before and the revision number on switch

199
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:20.090
2 is revision number 3 switch 2 will now request information from switch 1 so that it can update its

200
00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:26.750
database with the latest the information that detailed information is sent from which one to switch

201
00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:28.520
to using what's called a subset.

202
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:29.780
Advertisement.

203
00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:36.890
This contains a list of the information and if they are several villans more than one subset advertisement

204
00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:42.280
may be required to update and synchronize the databases of other switches.

205
00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:47.370
So essentially what this is is detailed information of the changes that have been made.

206
00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:52.910
The summary advertisement just informs the switch in summary format of the latest revision number and

207
00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:54.290
BTP domain.

208
00:16:54.500 --> 00:17:00.860
If the local switch sees that it's out of date it will request detailed information so that it can synchronize

209
00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:06.500
its database and that information will be provided using a subset advertisement.

210
00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:12.290
The switch is now able to synchronize the local databases to the database of the switch with the latest

211
00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:13.140
information.

212
00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:16.910
Now there are three modes in BTP.

213
00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:25.500
The default mode is server a VTB switch in server mode can create villans modify villains and delete

214
00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:26.370
villans.

215
00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:29.650
It also sends and forwards advertisements.

216
00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:34.040
So if it received an advertisement from another switch it would forward that on.

217
00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:39.070
If you made changes on the local switch it would send some real advertisements.

218
00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:43.340
It would also synchronize its local database to the latest revision number.

219
00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:47.460
And it also saves the villain configuration information locally.

220
00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:52.500
So this is the device where you're going to make your changes multiple switches can be configured as

221
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:56.530
VTB servers but you need to be really careful with this.

222
00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:03.780
The second mode is VTB client a VTB client can not create change or delete villans.

223
00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:10.050
It is also able to send forward advertisements so it can say in any violence currently listed in its

224
00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:17.310
database to other VTB switches it can also forward advertisement receive from other switches.

225
00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:23.760
Thirdly it would also synchronize its database to the latest configuration revision number this is a

226
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:29.970
major potential issue with GTP and has burned to many Cisco engineers in the past.

227
00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:33.670
A lot of Cisco engineers will not use VTB because of this issue.

228
00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:36.020
So he has a sample typology.

229
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:41.850
Now we have a VTB server and it's a scene that all of the switches at the top are configured as VTB

230
00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:48.600
clients the host machines are in the raid Villano green Bil'in and currently the revision number for

231
00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.320
the domain is the revision number.

232
00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:57.200
So the latest configuration revision number is to the VTB domain.

233
00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:03.580
Is Cisco and the villains that have been configured on the switches are villains red and green.

234
00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:06.880
Please note once again that the switches have a villain database.

235
00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:13.030
That is what VTB updates the individual ports and the switches need to manually be put in the correct

236
00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:14.460
the.

237
00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:21.000
Now someone plugs a nother switch into the topology from for instance a lab environment.

238
00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:27.270
The reason why this is dangerous is that in a lab environment the lens may have been added and removed

239
00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:32.200
and thus the revision number may be a lot higher than the production network.

240
00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:38.020
So let's assume for the moment that the revision number is 50 this switch only has the blue villaine

241
00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.430
configured on it.

242
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:44.140
So the green and red villans do not exist in the villain database.

243
00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:49.750
A lot of people make the mistake of assuming that as long as the switches configured as a VTB client

244
00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:53.290
it will not cause any problems on the network.

245
00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:58.210
So an administrator plugged in the switch and configures this port as a trunk.

246
00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:02.610
Please note once again that ETP advertisement only sent across trunk ports.

247
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:08.880
So let's assume that throughout the network all of these links are configured as trunk's as soon as

248
00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.380
this client is added to the VCP domain.

249
00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:17.980
And what's really scary is that this client can be automatically updated with the VCP information.

250
00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:23.130
In other words if it's configured with a nold domain it can automatically join the current VCP domain

251
00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:23.920
of Cisco.

252
00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:29.490
And as soon as that happens the devices will synchronize their databases to the latest configuration

253
00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:35.160
revision number which in this case is 50 sun all switches in the live domain.

254
00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:41.730
The revision number is changed to 50 because all of the switches including the VTB server will synchronize

255
00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:49.080
automatically to the VTB client the current villans red and green are automatically removed from the

256
00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:55.230
violent database and the only villain that will now be available in the violent databases of all of

257
00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:58.800
these switches is violently.

258
00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:05.960
Now all of the ports on all the switches that have manually been put into the green or red Villon or

259
00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:07.650
heire disabled.

260
00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:14.810
The issue here is that a port belongs to the red Villon but the red Villon does not exist in the database.

261
00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:17.510
So the port is automatically disabled.

262
00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:23.500
That means that no traffic can be sent or received on the sport and the same thing happens on all other

263
00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.720
switches.

264
00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:30.030
Essentially what happens is that the entire network is brought down by the introduction of the single

265
00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:31.200
switch.

266
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:37.350
That's extremely worrying to say the least that the introduction of a single switch can bring down an

267
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:39.690
entire enterprise network.

268
00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:46.830
The only way to fix this is to physically connect to the VTB server and then manually add the villans

269
00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.200
that have been deleted.
