00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:08.000
In this example I've got three Cisco Ioway the routers that have just booted up one is going to act

2
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.770
as our client.

3
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:19.500
One's going to act as a DHP version 6 relay agent and one's going to act as our DHP version 6 server.

4
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:29.250
So let's start with the relay agent call us road a relay and then on gigabit 00 all know shut to the

5
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:36.860
interface and actually before configure IP version 6 addresses or lets configure IP version 6 unicast

6
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:49.080
routing and now on gigabit 0 0 I'll configure an IP version 6 address of 2001 face colon code on one

7
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:59.780
and then on gigabit zero one now shut the interface IPV V-6 address 2001 call on one two three four

8
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:11.420
colon colon one slash 64 so show I.P interface brief will show us no IP addresses because no IP version

9
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.440
for is configured on this router.

10
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:22.780
Sure RPV CICS interface brief however shows us the IP version 6 global unicast address on gigabit to

11
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.240
0 0 as well as the address on gigabit 0 1.

12
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:40.210
So show IPV 6 interface gigabit to 0 0 there is the link local address global unicast address and subnet

13
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.780
address on key give it to 0 1.

14
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.220
We've got something similar.

15
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.720
Link local address and global unicast address.

16
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.930
Now one thing we need to configure on the relay agent is on the interface that's going to receive the

17
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.060
DHP request.

18
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:11.760
We need to configure IPV 6 DHP relay and point it to the DHB server which in this case is going to have

19
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.460
an IP address of 2001.

20
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:27.030
Two four on Kahlon to so to configure the relay agent we configure an IP address on gigabit to 00 and

21
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.040
we configure the relay destination.

22
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.090
So that's the configuration of the relay agent.

23
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:41.760
I'm going to enable IPV six DHP debugging so that we can see DHP messages received from the client.
