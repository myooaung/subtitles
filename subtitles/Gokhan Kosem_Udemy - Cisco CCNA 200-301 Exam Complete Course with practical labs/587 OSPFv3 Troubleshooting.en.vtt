00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.200
At the moment this network is working correctly as an example rather for keeping the loop back a broader

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:17.420
one and it can campaign gigabit 0 0 on brought a one to one can paying the loop back of router 4 and

3
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.260
can ping

4
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.560
the gigabit 00 interface on route of 4.

5
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:33.960
But in the same way as you have with OSB Version 2 you can enable passive interfaces.

6
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:41.880
So if we use the command passive interface default that will make all interfaces passive.

7
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:49.370
In other words the Rada wrote a three will not form neighbor relationships on these interfaces or sent

8
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.960
updates out of those interfaces so you can see both neighbor relationships have come down show

9
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:07.570
IP vs 6 or SPF neighbor they are no neighbor relationships right one is no longer able to ping router

10
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.970
for

11
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.710
on right at 2 we can see that the neighbor relationship has gone down show IP vs 6 over SPF neighbor

12
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.620
we only have one neighbor relationship.

13
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.660
So from a troubleshooting point of view if you can ping through an OS and network check that the neighbor

14
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.330
relationships are established.

15
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:37.480
If the neighbor relationships aren't established check that SPF is enabled on all the relevant interfaces

16
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:45.010
in the right areas so make sure that your areas are configured correctly on the relevant interfaces

17
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.030
so Rider 3 doesn't have a neighbor relationship.

18
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:58.000
Make sure that A is P.F. is enabled on the relevant interfaces if it is enabled on the interfaces check

19
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.290
your configuration and make sure that you haven't got passive interfaces so as an example here we can

20
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.950
see that all interfaces have gone passive or we could use the command show IP vs 6 or SPF interface

21
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.080
and notice we have this output no hellos.

22
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:28.510
Passive interface and we can see that on gigabyte 0 1 and we can see that on gigabit 0 0.

23
00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.870
So check that passive hasn't been configured on the rudder.

24
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:40.740
So in this example what I'll do is disable the passive interface on gigabit 00

25
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.350
so no passive interface interface gigabit.

26
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.160
Zero zero.

27
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.070
And what we should see is that a neighbor relationship is formed and there you go so do show IP vs 6

28
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.610
of SPF neighbor.

29
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:04.350
We can see a neighbor relationship has been established on gigabit 00 and we could do something similar

30
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.160
on gigabit.

31
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.620
0 1 and notice the neighbor relationship has come up.

32
00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.960
So be careful with passive interface.

33
00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.220
You can setup a one passive interface like gigabit 0 1.

34
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:30.250
Or you can enable passive interfaces globally and then disable them to do show run pipe or SPF

35
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.080
notice this configuration.

36
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:42.100
We've enabled default passive interfaces so all interfaces will be passive but then we have overridden

37
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:49.660
the passive option on this interface and this interface typically you only enable passive interfaces

38
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:58.240
on links to external networks or to user facing v lands as an example where you don't want your users

39
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:07.040
to learn or SPF Roth's another issue may be that 0 SPF wasn't enabled on an interface so do show run

40
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.000
interface gigabit.

41
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:22.150
0 1 if this command wasn't configured the relationship would not form on that interface so do show IP

42
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:31.320
vs 6 SPF neighbor shows us that no neighbor relationship exists on gigabit 0 1.

43
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.490
And that's where this command to show IP vs 6 0 SPF interface brief is very useful.

44
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:46.970
We can see very quickly that OSP was not enabled on this interface.

45
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:57.920
Now what happens if the wrong area was used to show IP vs 6 or SPF neighbor no neighbor relationship

46
00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.060
is established.

47
00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:05.080
But note we are getting a warning message about an area mismatch.

48
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:15.910
We received an update with the incorrect area so our local area is 3 but the remote area is 2.

49
00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.840
So we all warn by the Rada about that problem.

50
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:26.180
So we need to configure the right area and as soon as we do that our neighbor relationship is established

51
00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.180
so be aware that the same troubleshooting options exist in OSP.

52
00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:39.020
Version 3 as you haven't always P.F. Version 2 the show commands a very similar output is very similar.

53
00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:45.620
The logic is very similar but you're using IP version 6 addresses and protocols rather than IP version

54
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:46.040
4.
