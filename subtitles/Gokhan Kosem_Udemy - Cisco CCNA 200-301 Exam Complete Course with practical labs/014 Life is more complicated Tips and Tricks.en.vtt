1
00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.050
We want standardization.

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:10.560
The reason why I can take a copper ethernet cable such as this which has a RJ 45 connector.

3
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.040
Now we won't get into the details it's actually got a different name but most of us refer to this as

4
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.390
an RJ 45 connector.

5
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:25.060
I want to be able to take this and plug it into an HP laptop plug it into it to Shiba laptop plug it

6
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.740
into an ISIS laptop.

7
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.840
We won't worry about pronunciation for now but the moral of the story is I can take this cable and plug

8
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.770
it into different laptops because of this interface has been standardized and different vendors have

9
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.980
agreed to create the equipment to the specification or to the standard that makes life a lot easier.

10
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.900
In the old old days vendors just did what they wanted to.

11
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.490
They developed their own protocols and their own specifications which wasn't good for customers.

12
00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.440
It was great for the vendor because if he bought the equipment you were locked into that vendor.

13
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.810
We don't want that as a customer as a customer.

14
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.660
We want to be able to buy equipment from different vendors and they should all be able to work together.

15
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:17.850
So because of standardization and because of the industry agreeing on specific models this cable can

16
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.080
plug into different vendor devices without any problems.

17
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.800
We take that for granted today but it was not always the case.

18
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.820
Now the first thing I want you to realize is and you probably know this already.

19
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.620
Nothing in life is as simple as it seems.

20
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.400
And people often have different viewpoints and debate often very heatedly about what is right and what

21
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.240
is wrong.

22
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.860
Don't get stuck in those debates for the CCMA exam.

23
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.870
Just know that there are different models different viewpoints.

24
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.820
But there's one model that you need to know for the exam for the real world.

25
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.670
Have your opinion and go with your opinion.

26
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.230
There were different competing groups that were clashing about what was important and which protocols

27
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.430
should win the so-called protocol wars.

28
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.400
So we had the ISI Group with their protocols we had the TTP IP group with their protocols TTP IP is

29
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.450
one basically.

30
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:24.440
So for a long time we used the so-called over side model to discuss TTP IP protocols.

31
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.740
But the TTP IP protocols is what we use in the real world.

32
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.100
We use IP version 4.

33
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:37.250
We use TTP we use UDP we use IP version 6 TTP UDP once again we use IP protocols in the real world.

34
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:44.090
So there's this disconnect if you like between the OS side model and the protocols that are actually

35
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.750
used in the real world.

36
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:52.410
So now in the new version of the CCMA we have what these called if you like a hybrid model can combined

37
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.640
model of os sy and TTP IP model so don't get confused.

38
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.270
There was originally a four layer TTP IP model.

39
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:08.390
We have a seven layer OS model but now we've ended up in summary with a five layer TPP IP model.

40
00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:16.140
Five layers but we refer to the top layer as a layer 7 because it originated from the same model.

41
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.500
So I'm going to talk about some of the details now but in summary make sure that when you study for

42
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.160
the exam you understand that there's a TCB IP model.

43
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.320
But today we talk about five layers instead of the original four layers that were discussed in the original

44
00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:36.950
or if C or request for comments requests for comments or a way that people discuss new protocols and

45
00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.990
agree on what a protocol should be.

46
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.710
A protocol is basically a way to communicate.

47
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.640
So if I'm communicating with you in English we've agreed a certain way to communicate.

48
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.610
If I suddenly switch to another language and say two hundred funda you won't necessarily understand

49
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:59.180
what I'm saying because that language uses a different communication stack if you like or a different

50
00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.400
way to communicate versus English.

51
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.780
We have to agree on the protocol or language that we're going to discuss.

52
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.810
So RF sees allow us to agree on what protocol will be implemented by different vendors so that it's

53
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.860
kind of standardized in the old old days we didn't have standardized protocols.

54
00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.840
Every vendor did what they wanted but that was a total mess because she had different networks that

55
00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.600
couldn't communicate with each other.

56
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:27.740
These days we want to have one network such as the internet that allows us all to communicate with one

57
00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:34.100
another and that works because we've agreed on standards in the industry so different vendors Cisco

58
00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:40.550
HP Juniper etc. will create equipment that can talk to each other based on the standard.

59
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:47.950
So in summary you need to know TCB IP model which today consists of five models for this currency CCMA

60
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.670
reflects the real world more than say previous models.

61
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:59.450
We have the OEM model which consists of seven layers don't get hung up on the individual layers and

62
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.090
I'm going to show you this practically using Packet Tracer.

63
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:08.420
Understand how the layers work you may get questions saying Okay so at which lay of the oversized model

64
00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.850
do you find HDP which is a protocol used for surfing the Internet.

65
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.680
If you go to Web sites such as Facebook dot com you'll be using HDP.

66
00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.780
Actually today it's a s which is encrypted HDP it's more secure.

67
00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:29.210
That is an example of what we would call a layer 7 protocol but you also need to understand in networking

68
00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:35.870
that we'll discuss devices such as hubs and we'll say hubs or layer 1 devices hubs aren't really used

69
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:41.030
today but I'm going to discuss them just to give you an understanding because when you use a wireless

70
00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:46.060
network things kind of change with Wi-Fi sex or the latest release of Wi-Fi.

71
00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.270
But previously everything acted as a pure hub in the air.

72
00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:54.260
In other words only one person could communicate at a time.

73
00:05:54.410 --> 00:06:00.800
Wi-Fi still like a hub because it's a shared medium that is shared so you need to understand the principles

74
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.270
of hubs.

75
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:08.120
Even though we don't use them physically today as in connecting cables to a hub but the air in wireless

76
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.020
networks is kind of like a hub.

77
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.040
We have switches which are called Layer 2 devices.

78
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.910
Actually some people would debate where the switches are a thing but we won't get into that.

79
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.040
We have bridges which are layer to devices.

80
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:26.320
We have routers which are layer three devices and we have what are called Layer 3 switches.

81
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:31.710
So notice I'm using terms here a one device layer two device Layer 3 device.

82
00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:38.790
We have a layer 4 protocol which could be DCP or UDP and then we have Layer 7 applications such as HDP

83
00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.180
FCP TFT P telnet SS H etc..

84
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.650
Don't get hung up on those you need to know those protocols.

85
00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:54.750
You need to know where they fit in the so-called TTP IP model or side model it'll come to you as we

86
00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:59.440
do a whole bunch of laps and I'm gonna show you the protocols practically in Packet Tracer.

87
00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:05.400
You'll see where those different protocols reside or set if you like in the model.
