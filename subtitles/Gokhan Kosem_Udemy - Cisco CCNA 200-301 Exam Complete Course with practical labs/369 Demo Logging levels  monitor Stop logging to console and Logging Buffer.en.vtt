00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.260
So I change the logging level so logging.

2
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:19.810
And once again monitor and I'll set this two error messages or errors so show logging Consul is set

3
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.420
to teach debugging.

4
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:32.500
Monitor is set to errors show debug adjacency debugging is enabled him to face if zero is less than

5
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.680
zero.

6
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.090
Shut the interface.

7
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.030
We have terminal monitor enabled on our telnet line.

8
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.650
No shut.

9
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:51.680
Once again we see debugging on the console but we see nothing on the Viti one lines and that's because

10
00:00:52.400 --> 00:01:01.220
the logging on the console is debugging or Level 7 but the logging on the monitor lines these errors

11
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.020
are Level 3.

12
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.460
It's worth knowing both the name and the number.

13
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:17.230
With regards to this log messages now it it's possible to stop all logging to the local cons. If you

14
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.900
like and all you would do is type no logging con..

15
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.870
You could do something similar for other options such as the monitor lines.

16
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.520
So notice were not typed and nothing happened.

17
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.400
Control the control said nothing happened.

18
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.330
Show debug.

19
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.380
Always be if debugging is enabled.

20
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.620
Show logging Consul is disabled.

21
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.110
In this case monitoring on the monitor is set to errors.

22
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:58.470
I'll change that to level 7.

23
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.770
I've disabled logging on the console.

24
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:12.550
Notice I don't see output here but I see output on the Viti y line so just to show you that again.

25
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:24.320
Hit enter a few times via control Z controls it notices see the output on the Viti y line.

26
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:31.610
But I don't see the output on the console because I've disabled logging on the console all shut the

27
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.650
interface down on the router and then shut it.

28
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:42.920
I see the debugging on the Viti line but I see nothing on the console of the Rodda

29
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:55.650
So lets enable that again logging console debugging logging monitor debugging show log show logging

30
00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.910
consul to set back to debugging and the monitor set to debugging.

31
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.010
However in this example the buffer is disabled.

32
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:15.280
So let's look at enabling logging on the buffer now in this example on Rotto one show logging shows

33
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:22.390
me that I have logging on the console and logging on the Viti one line but I don't have logging enabled

34
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.590
on the buffer.

35
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.270
Now it's very unlikely that you are going to connect to the console of all your Ratisbon switches and

36
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.610
to view logging messages in real time.

37
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:39.340
You may do that while troubleshooting an issue but you probably don't want to spend your whole day looking

38
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.380
at console messages.

39
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.820
You would rather have that buffered somewhere.

40
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:51.370
Even better stored in a central place which you can view off line or view at a later date.

41
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:57.980
So let's look at Buffer logging first and then we'll look at so SLOC.

42
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:07.440
So I'll set logging on the console to a low level three areas.

43
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.400
I'll leave it at seven on the VQ Y so that we can see the output.

44
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:24.900
And I must say logging Bufford and in this case I'll set it to seven or debugging so show log Konsole

45
00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:33.940
is level 3 errors monitor lines in other words in our example of Vitti why you set to debugging and

46
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:45.380
buffer is set to debugging if on top show log again I see a message in the buffer to see the size of

47
00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:57.700
the buffer so I can change that size by typing logging buffet and I can set the buffer level to a number.

48
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:07.040
I'll set it to this so show log can see the buffer sizes changed.

49
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:15.660
Now that will depend on the amount of space that you have available on your router or switch.

50
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.400
So let's do the test again.

51
00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:23.490
Shut the interface and run it to shut it.

52
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.150
I don't see any log messages on the console.

53
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:36.020
I am seeing them on the Viti y but if I type should log now and scroll down.

54
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.320
Notice I see my OSPF messages in the log.

55
00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.960
These were not they.

56
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:50.090
Previously I could as an example do some filtering so using plute.

57
00:05:50.440 --> 00:06:01.090
And let's look for the word BBR and that'll show me all my log messages in the buffer that include the

58
00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:08.110
key word B-D or it's a lot better and a lot easier to search for specific messages using the buffer

59
00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:14.870
than it would be using the console or a monitor interface such as this.

60
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.780
The problem with buffers is they are limited in size.

61
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.030
You don't have gigs of buffer space available on your routers.

62
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:28.110
And the problem is if you have 100 routers you're going to end up with a hundred buffers.

63
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:35.510
It makes a lot more sense to have a centralized syslog server where you collect all the log messages

64
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:39.260
and stored in a single place that allows for a lot better searching.

65
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:44.090
You can use tools in Windows or Mac as an example to search for log messages.

66
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:45.540
It can be archived.

67
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.860
It's just a lot better to store your log messages on a log server.

68
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:57.280
So let's look at installing the solar wind syslog server and capturing the log messages.
