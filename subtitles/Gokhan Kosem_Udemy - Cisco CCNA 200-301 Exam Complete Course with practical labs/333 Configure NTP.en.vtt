00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:10.050
Before setting up A.P. servers the first thing you want to do is set out time closer to the real time

2
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.440
so that anti-peace synchronizes quicker at the moment.

3
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:25.580
Ratatouille as an example still believes that it's in the year 2030 Rohtak to isn't the year 2016 and

4
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.590
Rodders three is in the year 2002 before setting time.

5
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:41.010
However we want to set a time zone and set some time because that will affect the time on the devices.

6
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.310
Someone a time clock and specify a time zone.

7
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.790
This can be any name I'm going to specify GMT in this example.

8
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.470
There is no hours or minutes offset from UTC.

9
00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:02.250
Fortunately it's a lot simpler in the UK because Greenwich is based in the UK and other times zones

10
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.740
are derived from GMT or Greenwich meridian time.

11
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.760
If you are living in the US as an example and let's say you are on the east coast you might specify

12
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:27.930
East T and the offset would be minus 5 hours east is 5 hours behind UTC or universal coordinated time.

13
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:35.530
So I'm going to set to GMT as my time zone but what I need to do now is specify summer time.

14
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.640
It's summer at the moment in the UK.

15
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.060
I'm going to specify a name which I'll just specify as British summer.

16
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:52.210
You can specify when summertime starts and stops by using either a date which is an absolute date or

17
00:01:52.210 --> 00:02:02.800
you can specify a recurring Valley so I'm going to specify re-occurring being the last Sunday in March.

18
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:18.400
And summit time will start at 1 a.m. and will end on the last Sunday in October at 1 a.m..

19
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.890
So what you'll notice is the time is updated because it's summer time.

20
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.140
So what I've done is

21
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:37.430
specify the time zone and specify the summer time.

22
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:44.270
Now what's interesting is these two commands are done in global config on a rota but the clock is set

23
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:56.080
in privileged mode so the correct time at the moment proximately is 23:19 on the 16th of August 2016.

24
00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:10.030
So show clock shows me that date and time now to simplify things aren't going to copy and paste the

25
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.420
clock time zone and some time into the other rodders

26
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:30.320
So both rodef T and router 3 are now configured with Summit time and a time zone.

27
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.080
So there we go right to history

28
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.050
and wrote a want to configure it

29
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.370
what I do need to do on both router to and rotatory specify the time

30
00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:02.190
set it to 21 16th of August 2016.

31
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.250
And I'll do that Arata 3 as well.

32
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:16.590
So there's the clock in rodded 3 is the clock on rodded 2 and there's the clock on Rotto 1.

33
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.990
Now the clocks are slightly out but that's close enough for what we are going to do.

34
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:26.340
What I want to do is set up rodders 3 now as a A.P.M..

35
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:33.030
So we would do that by using the command A.P.M. and specifying a straight home level.

36
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:40.110
I'm just going to specify straught them level of 10 and in this example I'm going to specify the loopback

37
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:48.060
as the source of time loop packs are good because once again loop back interfaces don't go down.

38
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:49.990
So show the interface brief.

39
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:59.940
Shows me that the router has a loopback configured of control 3 and I've specified that a.p use that

40
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:11.430
as the source of time so show A.P. associations at the moment the local Rodda is associated with itself.

41
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:20.730
This is just a loopback address on the local Rodda as we can see it's configfs and at the moment it's

42
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.220
synchronised with the monster.

43
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.210
In other words Self show a.p status

44
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:38.440
we can see that the clock is synchronized with a stratum 10 device which is the local device show a.p

45
00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:43.570
status on Rodda t shows us that a.p is not enabled.

46
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:51.930
So we could use that come on ATP server and point it to the router three.

47
00:05:52.070 --> 00:06:00.750
And now we can use the command show a.p status at the moment the clock is unsynchronized the local start

48
00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.000
to miss 16.

49
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:11.910
It has no reference clock show a.p associations it has now associated with quadruple three.

50
00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.650
You can see that it is synchronized.

51
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.270
So let's look at status again.

52
00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.240
There you go the clock is synchronized.

53
00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:25.840
The local Rodda has a strong team of 11 because we configured

54
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.300
router 3 with a strong team of 10.

55
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.520
The reference device is quadruple three.

56
00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:42.030
We can see what the time is and we can see that we using British Summer Time on Broadway one shows the

57
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:47.430
A.P. status is not configured.

58
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:55.800
What I'll do here however is tell this Friday to get its time from rodded to Dr. Ahtisaari serratus

59
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.350
who's got a strong team of ten.

60
00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:02.990
This will have Astronomie v 11 and this will have a stratum of 12 Rotto one is getting time from about

61
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.170
a two and router two is getting time from street.

62
00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:13.680
So anti-peace of server to do or to to to to to show a.p status

63
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:26.720
clock is still unsynchronized let's look at associations at the moment it's configured but it's not

64
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:34.310
synchronized but there you go it's now synchronized with the master device.

65
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:40.030
So if we look at the status we can see that the clock has synchronized straught him is now 12.

66
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:52.420
As expected the reference device is routed to says show clock show clock we can see that the time is

67
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:57.110
very close between these devices.

68
00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:00.920
Just depends on how quickly I can type.

69
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:09.530
But we can see that the time is good on the devices the time is very close.

70
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:15.740
So notice 11:25 11:25 11:25 which is great.

71
00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:22.510
Seconds are a little bit odd because I'm typing a bit slow but you can see that they're very close to

72
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:23.490
one another.

73
00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:30.880
So that's an example of how to set up an entire server and ATP clients that received time from an A.P.

74
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.020
server right.

75
00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:36.190
Two is acting as an A.P. client and an A.P. server.
