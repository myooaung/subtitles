In this video we're going to discuss IP version 6 access control lists or IPTV 6 ACL is on the same

2
00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:14.710
way as with IP version for IP vs six access control lists allow you to permit or deny traffic in your

3
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:21.060
network and are a component of a layered security model in the real world.

4
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.120
You don't necessarily just want to use access control lists for your security.

5
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:34.150
You want to implement firewalls and other mechanisms such as protocol analyses such as intrusion prevention

6
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:41.710
systems or IP S's but access lists are typically a first line of defense in security implementations

7
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.670
HPV 6 access lists share many of the same characteristics of IP version 4.

8
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:53.470
So the knowledge that you've gained when working with IP version 4 access lists can also be applied

9
00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:00.430
to IP vs 6 access lists so they're very similar but there are differences between the two that you need

10
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:07.670
to be aware of both of them as an example photo and IP addresses of IP packets and player protocols.

11
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:15.030
So as an example you can filter on an IP vision for address using an IP version for access list IP vs

12
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:23.750
6 access lists can also filter on a source IP vs 6 IP address or IP vs 6 destination address but IP

13
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:31.300
vs 6 access list can also filter on ICMP or DCP or UDP.

14
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:38.770
You could also use IP vs 6 access lists to implement quality of service policies in your network or

15
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.480
to filter writing advertisements.

16
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:50.860
However the CCMA course focuses on the use of IP vs 6 to filter IP vs 6 packets arriving or being received

17
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.880
or being transmitted from Rada interfaces.
