00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.200
Here's another router.

2
00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:09.730
And on this third Rodda using the come on show up shows us the OP table.

3
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:17.020
I could ping another router in the network as follows.

4
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:24.020
Now when I use the C'mon show up there's the resolution between IP version 4 address and MAC address

5
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:30.130
of the remote's router show IP route shows us the writing table.

6
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:39.970
And as you can see this router has a default gateway or gateway of last resort of 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 2:49.

7
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.350
So there's the static default gateway.

8
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:51.510
So this Rodda as an example we'll be able to ping through Google dot com after doing a DNS request to

9
00:00:51.540 --> 00:01:00.080
the DNS server so that IP address wasn't previously in the OP cache over here.

10
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:09.120
But show up now shows us the resolution between IP version for address and MAC address of the local

11
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.470
DNS server.

12
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:18.390
The Rotto was able to ping Google dot com because it sent traffic to Google via its default gateway

13
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.630
or gateway of last resort.

14
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.730
1 9 2 1 6 8 1 2 4 9.

15
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.320
So the router has both in cash as well as a routing table.

16
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:37.310
We can see details of interfaces on the Shradha by using the command show IP interface brief and we

17
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.170
can see more detail by looking at an individual interface.

18
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.500
So this first Ethan interface is configured with this hardware MAC address which is the same as the

19
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:55.210
burnt in MAC address set by Cisco on the scene to face the speed and Duplaix of the interfaces 100 megabits

20
00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:03.340
per second and it's using full duplex ARP entries with time out after 4 hours by default on the router.

21
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.610
Notice we can see the input queue for the interface as well as the output queue.

22
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:17.640
So packets may need to be buffered as an example on a gross out of the first Ethan interface.

23
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:25.530
If there's high congestion we can see the packets in and packets output on this interface but interfaces

24
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.920
on routers have buffers if packets need to be buffered before they sent or buffered when they received

25
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.730
and before they can be processed by the central CPQ of the router.

26
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.760
Show version on this router

27
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:48.340
will show us that the memory on the shroud is a lot lower than the other routers.

28
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.720
1 1 5 7 1 2 plus 1 5 3 6

29
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:07.020
divided by 1024 shows us that those Shradha only has 128 mega ram whereas the other routers had 256

30
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:13.400
meg of ram show flash shows us the files stored in flash on the router.

31
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:23.960
Notice they are two versions of the operating system on the router and commands such as the boot command

32
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:31.310
allow us to specify which operating system is going to be booted or loaded by the router.

33
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.350
By default the first operating system in Flash is loaded.

34
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:43.410
But in this case the boot to system flash command specifies that this operating system instead of this

35
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.760
operating system should be loaded by the router.

36
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.400
Now in this case they the same notice the name is slightly different underscore too but you could have

37
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.970
different operating systems in Flash or different versions of an operating system and then decide which

38
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.820
one gets booted.

39
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.870
So if you upgrading the router you may load an additional operating system into flash and then tell

40
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.360
the router to boot off fat but if it fails then boot off an alternate operating system.
