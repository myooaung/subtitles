00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:06.960
Wired Ethernet networks don't have any authentication by default to access the network.

2
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.920
All you need to do is plug your ethernet cable into a switch and you'll gain access to the network with

3
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:22.170
no authentication no authorization and no accounting properly or authentication authorization and accounting

4
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:31.290
is a way to centralize policies that are applied to network devices as an example you could centralize

5
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:40.080
the authentication of users by using a triple A server such as Cisco secure AC authentication means

6
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:48.150
that you are authenticating a user name and password before a user can access the network or a device

7
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.740
on the network.

8
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:57.270
Authorization determines what you are allowed to do once you've been authenticated So are you as an

9
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.950
example allowed to go to privilege mode or enable mode on a router.

10
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.520
Are you allowed to access a server on the network.

11
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.100
Accounting is a log of what happened on the network.

12
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:17.250
So as an example you could log users attempts to access a network device via telnet or SSA each.

13
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:25.600
In a moment I'll demonstrate Triple A using a genius 3 network where I have a Cisco AC server connected

14
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:34.800
the server is running within VM where it is connected via a genius 3 switch to multiple network devices.

15
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.900
I'll configure the network to use local authentication and then we'll centralize the authentication

16
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:48.820
so that Loggins or authorized from a central AC a server rather than having a local username and password

17
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.660
database on each network device not to stop anyone just accessing your network.

18
00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:02.770
You can implement identity based authentication or identity based networks by using a protocol called

19
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:10.510
Ada to load one ex the actual edited or one X standard allows you to implement identity based networking

20
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.320
where a client machine has to present a user name and password before they can gain access to the network

21
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.120
in Ada to the 1x.

22
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.880
You have three components or three roles.

23
00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:31.510
The client also known as the supplicant is a P.C. such as a Windows P.C. running Ada to at 1 x compliant

24
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:39.130
client software and authenticator doesn't authenticate the client that sends authentication information

25
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.520
through to an authentication server.

26
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:48.350
The authenticator would be something like an internet switch which is controlling access to the network.

27
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.790
The client PCI is connected to a port on the switch acting as the authenticator and no frames from the

28
00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:01.090
client are permitted except Ada stood at 1 x frames before authentication takes place.

29
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.480
So when the client sends traffic to the switch acting as the authenticator it will send an ADA to that

30
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:14.380
one X challenge to the client asking for authentication information a user name and password is sent

31
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:22.300
to the switch but the switch doesn't read that information but passes it on to the authentication server

32
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:30.400
which could be a radius or tax server radius and tack X or the protocols are used between the authenticator

33
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.890
and the authentication server.

34
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.270
The authentication server validates the credentials of the client.

35
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.730
In other words it makes sure that the client username and password are correct and that the client is

36
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.070
allowed to access the network.

37
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.440
If the username and password are correct the authentication service sends a message to the authenticator

38
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.950
or switch which then permits the client to access to the network the authenticator sends a successful

39
00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.300
authentication message to the client.

40
00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:07.280
And now when the client forwards traffic such as HDP or telnet traffic that is permitted onto the network.

41
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:14.680
The important thing with editor at 1 x is that the client cannot access the network until authentication

42
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:21.460
has succeeded based on the information stored in the authentication server and authentication server

43
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:28.360
could use a local database or it could use a centralized directory such as active directory for the

44
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.310
storing of usernames and passwords.
