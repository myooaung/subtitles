00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Some points to remember with regards to speed and duplex negotiation and mismatches.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Duplex and speed mismatches occur when auto negotiation fails

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
or where manual configurations are mismatched.

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So for example one side is configured to use full duplex

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and the other side is configured to use half duplex.

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Auto negotiation may fail because of physical problems in the network

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
such as cabling problems or a hub somewhere in the network.

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Duplex mismatch is do cause performance problems, your pings may succeed

9
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
but the movement of large files may be negatively affected

10
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and UDP may especially have problem with recovering from duplex mismatch issues.

11
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So a quick bit of history, originally Ethernet was half duplex

12
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
because devices were connected to hubs, so a decision was made that when you can’t

13
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
negotiate with the other side, you would revert back to 10 Meg half duplex

14
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
all the devices weren't designed to auto negotiate

15
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
so the auto negotiating device would revert back to half duplex mode

16
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
if it wasn’t able to negotiate with the other side because it assumed that

17
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
that device must only support half duplex.

18
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Autonegotiation of speed and duplex didn’t work well in the old days

19
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and often caused problems with the speed and duplex mismatch.

20
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
If 1 side is using half duplex and the other side is using full duplex.

21
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
The full duplex side thinks that it can transmit it

22
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
any time even when it's receiving traffic, the half duplex side however because it uses

23
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Carrier Sense Multiple Access Collision Detection or CSMA/SD

24
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
will want the line to be clear before transmitting

25
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and when it does transmit and the packet is transmitted

26
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
by the other side running a full duplex a collision occurs

27
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
so the half duplex side will back off because of the collision

28
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and then try to transmit again when the line is clear

29
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and we'll have this constant issue of a late collisions

30
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000
where the full duplex side is transmitting data and can starve the half duplex side

31
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
In other words it can use up all the bandwidth causing a lot of collisions

32
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and retransmissions on a half duplex side.

33
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
This would cause the frames on a half duplex side to queue up and eventually be drop.

34
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
When looking for problems have a look at the errors which I'll demonstrate

35
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
in the moment, on the full duplex side you will see errors such as your CRC errors

36
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
on half duplex side you typically see late collisions

37
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and perhaps buffer over loading.

38
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Management systems from company such as SolarWinds

39
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and others allow you to see where you’ve got duplex problem on your network

40
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and help you resolve these issues more easily.
