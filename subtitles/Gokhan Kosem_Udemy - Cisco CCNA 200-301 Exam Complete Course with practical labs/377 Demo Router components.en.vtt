00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:10.430
In this example I'm connected to the console of a router when I type enable and then show version we

2
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.360
can see the version of Cisco Ioway running on the router.

3
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.630
So here's the short version.

4
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.680
C'mon Cisco IOS software that we're running is an 1841 version of software.

5
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:30.270
It's advanced enterprise software version 15 dot 1 4 and 8 release software.

6
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:38.180
See 2 What you'll notice is that a version of software is different to the software in Rome or read

7
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.410
only memory.

8
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:46.750
The system bootstrap a version here is Tove dot for the Shradha has been up for 5 hours and 40 minutes.

9
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.990
This is the version of operating system that the Rodda booted.

10
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:57.280
So the system image file is this file which is stored in Flash.

11
00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:05.850
And that was loaded into memory Spaceballs shows me more information and I'll be able to see as an example

12
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:13.230
the amount of RAM in the router as well as the amount of ENVI ram before I look at that let's use the

13
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.640
C'mon show flash.

14
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.850
Notice this is the operating system that was loaded into RAM on the router.

15
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.680
So show flesh is similar to your hard drive.

16
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.000
We have the operating system as well as another file stored in Flash.

17
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.540
This is the size of flesh in bytes.

18
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.910
And this is how much has been used.

19
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.170
Here's another router

20
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.270
show flash here.

21
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.530
Shows us that a different version of operating system is found in the flash of this Rodda and other

22
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.990
files are also stored in the flash of the Rodda.

23
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.730
So this is very similar to a hard drive way.

24
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.160
Multiple files can be stored in flash as an example I could use a command show run pipe

25
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:14.140
and then redirect the output to flash and let's create a file called Show run test dot see if G.

26
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.270
Now when I use the C'mon show flash notice that file is available in Flash.

27
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.050
I've just copied the running config from RAM onto the flash drive.

28
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:38.070
On this router you can use the more command to view that file and what you'll notice is it shows us

29
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.900
that this is the current config at a specific time.

30
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.140
And that's because this is a copy of the running config on the router.

31
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.610
So the running config of the rod is stored in RAM so the show running config or show run command for

32
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.490
short shows us the size of the current configuration.

33
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:05.340
In other words the live config that's used by the router the shows start startup config shows start

34
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.210
config shows us the saved configuration stored in nv ram.

35
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:18.540
Notice the difference show startup shows us output using so many bytes out of so many bytes whereas

36
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:27.530
the show running config shows current config being so many bytes so just know the output when you use

37
00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:33.920
show run you're going to see current config when you use the command show startup config will show start

38
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.980
you going to see so many parts out of so many pints.

39
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:47.800
Now we could use the Kamani re startup config and I was told that we are going to raise the nv ram file

40
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.880
system.

41
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.950
Do we want to continue.

42
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.790
I'm going to press enter to confirm that we want a raise the startup config.

43
00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:01.950
So now when we use the command show startup config we are told that there is no startup config present

44
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:09.060
no startup configuration is stored in the RAM but the running config is still available on the router.

45
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:17.830
To save the configuration we would use the command copy running config startup config and that copies

46
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.480
the configuration from RAM to NV RAM.

47
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:30.510
So now when the top of the command shows startup config we see that a config is stored in NV ram that

48
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.910
config is not live.

49
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:39.810
So as an example if I created a loopback interface on this router and gave it a not-P address of something

50
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:40.770
like the following

51
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.450
show IP interface brief

52
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.380
shows me that that IP address is available now on the loopback interface on the router.

53
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.430
In other words the change was immediate.

54
00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.390
Show run

55
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.580
shows us that a loopback interface.

56
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.250
In other words it happened immediately and was added to the running config.

57
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:18.340
Show startup config however doesn't show us the loopback interface changes are only written to the startup

58
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:25.510
config when you use the copy run startup config command or W-r for short.

59
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.110
So now when we look at the startup config

60
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.790
you'll notice that the loopback interface is configured as part of the startup config so the running

61
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.950
config is stored in RAM startup config is stored in NV RAM.

62
00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:50.790
You can copy the startup config to NV RAM by using the command copy running config start up config.

63
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.110
That would be an exam on sir.

64
00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.550
But for the real world you could simply use the command W-r.

65
00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.640
You can also store files in Flash.

66
00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:09.160
So as I demonstrated you could copy the running config on startup config to flash flash can store multiple

67
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:17.800
files as seen on this router but the primary file that flash is used for is the storing of the operating

68
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.260
system which is loaded into RAM when the router boots up.

69
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.310
Flash is nonvolatile.

70
00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:30.610
In other words when the Rodda reboot the file is not lost but it will be removed from RAM when the Rodda

71
00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:37.490
boots up the operating system is copied from flash to RAM so that it can be used in real time.

72
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:38.660
So let's look at the short version.

73
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:45.240
C'mon Again this shows this information once again about the uptime of the router the operating system

74
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.310
used how it was reloaded.

75
00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:51.310
So this was normal reload and scrolling down.

76
00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.200
We can see the amount of RAM available on the router.

77
00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:02.410
Now that's in kilobytes to get the total RAM on the Rodda you need to add those two together.

78
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:09.580
So 2 3 9 6 1 6 plus 2 2 5 to 8.

79
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:17.260
That gives us the amount of RAM on the Radi So we need to divide by 1024.

80
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:26.300
And that shows us the amount of RAM on the Shradha it's got 256 mega ram this router however is using

81
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:35.680
a different version of operating system as we've seen and has a different amount of RAM so 2 3 3 4 7

82
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:45.410
2 plus 2 8 6 7 2 gives us that divide by 1024

83
00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:57.000
well so gives us 256 mega RAM so you need to add these values together to work out the amount of RAM

84
00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:57.960
in the router.

85
00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:06.720
You'll notice that the nv ram value is a lot smaller than RAM only 191 kilobytes of envied RAM is available

86
00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.980
whereas we've got 256 megabytes of RAM available.

87
00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:12.960
This is the size of the compact flash.

88
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.420
On this router which is the same on this router.

89
00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:24.090
Notice this router has two fast Ethan interfaces and two serial interfaces whereas this router has two

90
00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:31.500
first Ethan interfaces one serial interface and one VPN module.

91
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:36.110
The interfaces on a router can very show IP interface brief

92
00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:46.720
on the Shradha shows us the physical interfaces and once again show IP interface brief on this Shradha

93
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:51.920
shows us the interfaces on it which are different to Rodda one.
