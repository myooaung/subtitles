00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So what happens if A now wants to ping a remote device in a separate subnet?

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So now for example, A with IP address 10.1.1.1

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Wants to ping device B with IP address 10.1.2.1

4
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
In these examples I’m discussing ICMP or ping traffic

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
but something similar would happen

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
if you were sending HTTP, FTP or other traffic.

7
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
what’s important to note here is that these devices are in separate subnets

8
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
we are using a /24 mask in this topology.

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So host A is not in the same subnet as host B.

10
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
now the first thing the PC will do is to check whether the IP address

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
it's trying to communicate with is in a separate subnet

12
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
or in the same subnet as itself.

13
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It does this by doing a logical end using the network mask.

14
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So in this case we’ve got /24 mask

15
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
the IP address of PC A is 10.1.1.1

16
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and it’s trying to ping an IP address 10.1.2.1/24

17
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
in dotted decimal notation looks like this 255.255.255.0

18
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Which means the network portion is the first 3 octets of the address.

19
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So the local PC 10.1.1.1 compares the network portion with the device that

20
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
it's trying to communicate with to check if the device is local or remote.

21
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
In this case the network portion of the address is different.

22
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So the local PC knows that the remote device is in a different subnet

23
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
to itself and it will therefore send the traffic  to its default gateway

24
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
to get to the remote subnet on which the device resides.

25
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Now in this example we are assuming that device A

26
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
has a default gateway configured.

27
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So device A has been configured with the default gateway of the router

28
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
10.1.1.100 so the PC will firstly check if it has the router's MAC address

29
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
in its local ARP cache

30
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
It does this because its need to send the traffic

31
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
to the router to get to the remote device.

32
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And because this is an Ethernet segment a layer 2

33
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Mac address is required for communication.

34
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Ethernet once again requires that MAC address is be use at

35
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
layer 2 for transmission across an Ethernet network.

36
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
So at layer 2 a Mac address is required by the PC

37
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
the PC would have been configured with the default gateway of 10.1.1.100

38
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
which is an IP address at layer 3

39
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
but the MAC address of the default gateway wouldn’t have been

40
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
configured on the PC, so there’s no entry on the local PC

41
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
for the MAC address of its default gateway

42
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and thus it will need to send out a broadcast unto the segment

43
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
asking who has IP address 10.1.1.100 in other words

44
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
this is an ARP request looking for the MAC address

45
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
associated with the IP address of the default gateway.

46
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
When the broadcast is received by the hub, it will flood it out of all ports

47
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
except the ports on which they arrived

48
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
PC C will receive the broadcast at layer 2

49
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
but when reading the layer 3 information it will see that

50
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000
this is an ARP for 10.1.1.100 which is not its IP address.

51
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
So PC C will therefore drop the ARP request.

52
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
The router however will process the ARP request.

53
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Firstly it will receive the traffic at layer 2

54
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
because this is a broadcast and when it reads the layer 3 information

55
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
it will see that this is an ARP request for its IP address.

56
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.000
So the router will reply with an ARP reply to PC A ARP request.

57
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
The ARP reply is a unicast address so source MAC address is G

58
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
the router's MAC address, destination MAC address is A

59
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
source IP address is the router's IP address

60
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
destination IP address is A IP address.

61
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
The hub will once again flood the traffic out of all ports

62
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
except the port on which it arrived.

63
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
C will drop the frame because it's not destined to itself.

64
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Notice in the frame the destination MAC address is A

65
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
but the PCs MAC address is C, so it will drop the frame.

66
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And what’s important to note is that it’s the Network Interface Card

67
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
that drops the frame and not the central CPU of the PC.

68
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
A will receive the frame and upon a receipt will process the frame

69
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
because the destination MAC address is itself.

70
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
So at layer 2 the frame is accepted by the NIC or Network Interface Card .

71
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.000
The layer 2 information is strip and forward it to high layer protocols.

72
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Because this is an ARP reply its process by high layer protocols

73
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000
and the ARP cache is updated with the MAC address of the router, so PC A

74
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000
now has a mapping saying that IP address 10.1.1.100 uses MAC address G

75
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
so this is the important, PC A knows that the IP address

76
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
10.1.1.100 is associated with MAC address G.

77
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:13.000
So the PC can send traffic to the network destined for the remote PC 10.1.2.1

78
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
with the source IP address set to 10.1.1.1 itself

79
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
but notice please that the source MAC address is the local PC

80
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and the destination MAC address is the router.

81
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000
The layer 2 frame goes to the router and hence the layer 2

82
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
information contains the local segment MAC addresses.

83
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Source MAC address the PC, destination MAC address the router.

84
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
The layer 3 information contains the destination IP address

85
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
of the remote host and the local PCs IP address.

86
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000
The hub will flood the frame to both c and G, C will drop the frame

87
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
because the destination MAC address is not itself

88
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
the router will receive the frame at layer 2

89
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
because its destined to its MAC address of G.

90
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
It will then strip the layer 2 information

91
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and read the layer 3 information in the packet.

92
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
So now let’s look at a practical example

93
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
I’m going to capture traffic in Wireshark, so I'll start the capture

94
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000
I’m gonna clear my ARP cache, so arp-a shows that no entries

95
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
are in the ARP cache at the  moment and then I’m gonna ping hp.com

96
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
notice the DNS resolution has taking place, ICMP message has timing out

97
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
because a firewall is blocking the ICMP messages to that server.

98
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
So here’s another example, lets ping Google com.

99
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Notice pings are succeeding, so I’ll stop the capture.

100
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
HP was using an IP address in the 15 range.

101
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
So let’s have a look for that ICMP traffic

102
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
so notice there’s an ICMP message to hp.com

103
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and you can see that because the address is 15.

104
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And HP own the 15 IP address range.

105
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
We didn’t get a reply from the server but the echo request was sent.

106
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
What I’d like you to see please is that at layer 2

107
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
the source MAC address is my local pc

108
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
but the destination MAC address is my local router.

109
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Notice I can see that this is a Cisco device because the MAC address

110
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
is shown as Cisco for the OUI or vendor portion of the address.

111
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
We can see that by typing arp-a

112
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
notice this MAC address is the MAC address associated with IP address

113
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
10.0.0.254 IP config shows us that

114
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
that is the IP address of the default gateway.

115
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
So the traffic is going from my local PC to hp.com

116
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
but it’s being routed by my local router.

117
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
At layer 3 we have the local PC's IP address

118
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
the destination IP address is hp but at layer 2

119
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
the source MAC address is my PC

120
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
and the destination MAC address is the local router.

121
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And once again sending the traffic to my local default gateway at layer 2.

122
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
I can filter the Wireshark capture to show only ICMP traffic again.

123
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Here’s traffic going to Google so source IP address is my local machine

124
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
destination IP address is Google but notice at layer 2

125
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
the source MAC address is my local PC

126
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
and the destination MAC address is once again the local router.
