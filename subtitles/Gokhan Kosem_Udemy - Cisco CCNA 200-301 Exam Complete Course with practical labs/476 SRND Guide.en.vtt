00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:06.570
A great resource for learning quality of service is the enterprise quality of service solution Reference

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.560
Network Design Guide or a sovereign D guide.

3
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.450
At the time of this recording the guide was lost updated in April 2014.

4
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.040
I've added the guide below the video that you can find it by doing a search in Google for example for

5
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.770
quality of service s or indeed guide.

6
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:32.060
We are told that there is an updated version if you want to buy the latest version you'd need to purchase

7
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.830
this book end to end quality of service network design that's not required for CCMA.

8
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:44.230
So for the CCMA course I would simply use this document and the videos that I'm recording.

9
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:53.180
This guide has been around for a long time so it was originally drafted in April 2005.

10
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.620
A lot of the quality of service mechanisms that we are discussing haven't changed over the years.

11
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.820
The reliance on some such as link fragmentation into leaving has been reduced as wind speeds have increased

12
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.730
but a lot of the concepts remain the same.

13
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.490
So if you want to study this in more detail have a look at this guide.

14
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.970
But I'm going to summarize the details for you.

15
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:22.180
And I'll do a demonstration to try and explain some of the options as required for the CCMA exam and

16
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:31.630
I see indeed to exam in the CCMA exam if I do a search for quality of service you are expected to know

17
00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:39.410
basic quality of service concepts including marking device trust pro translation of voice video and

18
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:45.120
data shaping policing and congestion management.

19
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.660
These are quality of service mechanisms.

20
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:57.970
The same topics are listed in the ICD two exam so the SRO and d guide starts out by looking at why is

21
00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.500
quality of service important.

22
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.640
What are the tool sets or mechanisms available to you.

23
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.160
And there's some additional information about quality of services essentially important because we need

24
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.370
to prioritize some traffic at the detriment of other traffic.

25
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:20.890
As an example if there's an emergency and an ambulance needs to take someone to hospital or reach someone

26
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:27.790
that's injured on motorways or highways we have dedicated lanes so that an ambulance can get you to

27
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.320
hospital quicker.

28
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.080
We are providing a better quality of service to an ambulance than to other vehicles on the road and

29
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.330
the same is true with quality of service.

30
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:44.380
We want to provide a higher priority or better quality of service to traffic types such as voice and

31
00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:51.100
video because of the delay requirements and other requirements that those traffic types have when compared

32
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.320
to other traffic tops such as FCP or HDP.

33
00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.090
Now the transmission quality of a network is determined by the following factors.

34
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.140
Firstly loss how many packets will be lost.

35
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:12.650
Now this is important for voice conversations voice will degrade as an example when packets are lost.

36
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:20.410
We want to have a low loss of packets in a voice conversation for FCP loss of packets isn't as important

37
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:28.180
because ATP uses TTP and will simply read transmit to the packets but you can't read transmit voice

38
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.330
packets if voice packets are lost they are lost and it will affect the voice quality.

39
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:40.780
Delay is the finite amount of time that it takes a packet to reach the receiving end point after being

40
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.330
transmitted from the sending endpoint as an example if you're using a phone.

41
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.820
It's the amount of time that it takes for me to speak till it reaches your ear.

42
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:57.130
In other words how long does it take for the voice to travel from me to you.

43
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:03.160
Now the round trip delay of a voice conversation needs to be less than 300 milliseconds.

44
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:10.330
Anything greater than that is going to affect the voice quality FCP once again can tolerate much higher

45
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:18.100
delays variable delay or so-called jitter is the difference in end to end delay between packets.

46
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:25.810
So if the delay varies between packet arrival that is known as Jetta Jetta can once again cause problems

47
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.100
in a voice conversation.
