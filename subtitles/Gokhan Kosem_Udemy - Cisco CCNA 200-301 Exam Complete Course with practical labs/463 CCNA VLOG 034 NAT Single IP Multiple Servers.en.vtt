00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:16.550
This is one of multiple videos discussing network address translation or not in a previous video I showed

2
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:25.820
you how to configure static Nat translations to allow outside hosts hosts on the Internet access to

3
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:35.060
multiple internal servers running in your local network router to in this example is nothing the three

4
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:46.010
servers on the left to public IP addresses in the 8 8 8 range making them available to the PC.

5
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:55.120
Now the issue here is that you are using an external or public IP address per internal server.

6
00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:03.230
Is it possible to use a single IP address such as an IP address at your home.

7
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:14.890
To expose multiple servers or devices to the Internet.

8
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:23.420
So in other words can you set up servers in your home network or small medium business network and allow

9
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.260
people to access those servers using the same IP address.

10
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.950
And the answer is yes.

11
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:40.660
So at the moment I've got four net commands configured what I've done is configure gigabit 0 1 as the

12
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:48.040
outside interface on this router and the other interfaces gigabit 00 two and three are configured as

13
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.530
inside Nat interfaces.

14
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:58.100
See my previous video for the configuration of static not using multiple IP addresses once again.

15
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:07.020
But here what we're going to do is use the command IP not inside source because we want to Nat these

16
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.100
servers to an individual IP address.

17
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:18.860
So when we use the common IP Nat inside source static The inside a local IP address of the server.

18
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.060
In other words it's real IP addresses tend wondered wondered one.

19
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.230
And we get to a virtual IP address of 8 8 8 8 to 1.

20
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.180
If we did that we would be using that entire IP address for that individual server.

21
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.480
So what we're going to do here rather is specify TCAP or UDP.

22
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.170
So TZP And now we are going to specify the inside IP address and the port number on that server is going

23
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.700
to be 23 and the virtual IP address of the server is going to be this.

24
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.720
And in this example I'll use port 23 extendable.

25
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:07.850
So basically what I'm saying is that when this device sends traffic to port 23 and destination IP address

26
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.690
8 8 8 8 1 the router is going to Nottage and send the traffic to that server.

27
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.420
So let's test at rather three in this example is acting as our PC.

28
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.800
So all telnet to 8 8 8 to 1.

29
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:33.890
Notice I can log in to server 1 over there and to prove it we can type show IP interface brief to see

30
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.200
the IP address of the server

31
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:45.950
OK but now how do you do this for the other service.

32
00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:54.920
So in this example I'm going to use a random port number that we femoral port number of 65000 23 and

33
00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.810
change that to tendered one to two to two.

34
00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:06.110
So in other words when traffic gets sent by the PC to the router with the destination IP address of

35
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:16.340
8 8 8 8 or 1 destination port number of 65000 and 23 the road is going to not get to us internal IP

36
00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.270
address.

37
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:30.550
And change the port number to 23 so on Rodda 3 when we use the telnet IP address question mark C'mon

38
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.660
we can now specify a port number.

39
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:42.420
So sixty five thousand twenty three connection is opened and we are now on route a full

40
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.090
show IP interface brief.

41
00:04:49.480 --> 00:05:04.600
We are on route a full but using the same IP address 8 8 8 or 1 but a different port in them which means

42
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.000
the traffic goes to a different server.

43
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.340
Let's create another one.

44
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.400
So IP not inside source.

45
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.150
Static TZP

46
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.740
Let's send it to route of five acting service free.

47
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:33.220
But in this case I'll use a port number of 65000 and 24 hour show run pipe include Nat shows us the

48
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:44.410
static Nat commands that over here in Colorado for some back on Route 3 which is acting as our PC show

49
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:50.360
at the interface brief notice this is the IP address of the PC it's on the Internet.

50
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:56.660
And what I'll do now is telnet to port sixty Falzon and 24

51
00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:05.670
now I'm on route 5 with IP address 10 at one of 3.3.

52
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:12.950
What I'll do now is use the command control shift 6 x to jump back to Route 3 and go to port number

53
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:22.400
65000 23 on write a full control shift 6 x to jump back shows sessions.

54
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:30.210
Shows me that I've got two sessions open what I'll do now is telnet to port 23.

55
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:40.340
Now I'm on route 1 controllers shift 6 x shows that I've got three sessions open show IP not on router

56
00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.650
2 shows me those connections.

57
00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:53.490
So this PC 8 8 today or four which is this PC here has initiated sessions 2 8 8 8 8 1 pt. 23 which is

58
00:06:53.490 --> 00:07:00.280
going to that host one of the old TZP sessions is still held in the NAT translation table.

59
00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:07.710
Hence we are seeing two of them but we've also got the same PC sending traffic to eight today today

60
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:14.860
day one but Port sixty five thousand twenty three that's going to a different host on port 23 and we've

61
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.750
also got this entry.

62
00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:25.960
So that's an example of how to use the same global IP address or Internet IP address for multiple internal

63
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.180
hosts or devices.

64
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:34.390
So once again if you're at home and you wanted to make your devices available on the internet but you

65
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:38.230
only had one public ip address this is how you do it.

66
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:45.940
The only thing to remember is that you can't use the same port number for multiple internal devices

67
00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:50.780
because otherwise the router can't differentiate between the that translations.

68
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:56.770
So hence we use different port numbers for the different hosts.

69
00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:02.450
Even though it's the same external IP address I hope you found this useful.

70
00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:08.650
This is out of the scope of a CCMA exam but hopefully give you some real world knowledge that you can

71
00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:09.380
apply.

72
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.350
