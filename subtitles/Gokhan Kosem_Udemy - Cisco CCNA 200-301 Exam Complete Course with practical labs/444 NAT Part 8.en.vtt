00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:09.690
Now previously when we topped show I.P not translations we only had inside local inside global one entry.

2
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:11.880
That is the static entry.

3
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.730
There's no outside local or outside global address because that's not being knotted.

4
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:25.780
It's tripe telnetting 2 8 1 1 5 Notice it says Poskitt required but none sent.

5
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.200
And the connection was terminated.

6
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:44.950
So on a one line between 0 to 5 logon password Cisco enable password Cisco on rotisserie do the telnet

7
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.090
again.

8
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:56.460
Notice I can log in to Rodda one when I now look at the net translations on rodded t you can see that

9
00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.190
there are multiple nocte translations here.

10
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:09.630
We've got two telnet sessions and that may be because the other net translation hasn't timed out when

11
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.640
actually all the translations show IP net translation shows that one entry

12
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.770
we've got our next translation back again.

13
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:29.260
So inside local This IP address has got a telnet session port 23 going to it.

14
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.260
So this router 8 1 1 2 is using an ephemeral port in the woods.

15
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:44.790
A random port number to access Rato one on port 23 router 3 however is using this IP address to access

16
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:52.200
this IP address on the outside internet which is then translated to this address internally allowing

17
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.630
rotisserie to access Router one.

18
00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.790
Now there's no better way than looking at why shock to see what's actually going on.

19
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:09.870
So I'll start with shock on router to use fast Ethan interface so I'm to start was shocked when this

20
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:10.470
interface

21
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.350
I'm going to hit enter on router 3.

22
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:32.000
I noticed that some telnet data now so some told that data from 8 1 1 2 2 8 1 1 5 and 8 1 1 5 2 8 1

23
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.730
1 2.

24
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:44.110
So in the telnet sessions what you'll notice is that the telnet to data in this case a carriage return

25
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.790
is going from 8 to 1 1 to 2 8 1 1 5 and then there's a reply back again.

26
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:58.920
So if I type enable and then put my password in what we'll see in the output here.

27
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.080
Is that data.

28
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:14.660
So let's filter for Telenet scrolling down we can see that Rodda one was telling Ratatouille about the

29
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:25.480
prompt and then wrote it to top enable and there we go carriage return Rodda one requested a password

30
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:32.420
and then wrote it to and did C.I. as CEO and there's the password and head carriage return.

31
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:42.920
And then the prompt changed Serrato one told rotatory that the new prompt is our one hash or Â£0.

32
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:53.830
The important piece to note is that all communication on this link is between 8 1 1 2 and 8 1 1 5 which

33
00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:03.110
is the inside global address of the router 10 1 1 1 I'll stop the capture.

34
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.820
And now let's do it again.

35
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.630
I'll start the capture on the inside interface.

36
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.030
So I'm going to do it on first.

37
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.730
Ethan it is 0 0 of to full to this.

38
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.300
Once again for telnet traffic and on Rodda 3.

39
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.550
Now let's type exit and telnet back again.

40
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:32.100
Put in the password top enable put in the password.

41
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:43.240
So when you look at this traffic notice it's from 8 1 1 to the rotisseries IP address going to 10 1

42
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.480
1 1 router one's IP address.

43
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.240
So all the Tolmach traffic in this output

44
00:04:54.010 --> 00:05:03.160
including the password that's being sent NCIS CO2 is from 8 1 1 2 2 10 1 1 1.

45
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:13.510
This router in the middle is translating 8 1 1 5 2 8 1 1 2 4 all traffic between Rato 1 and router three.
