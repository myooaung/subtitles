1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
In this topology, I have 2 switches which are configured to run PVST not Rapid PVST+

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
but simply PVST I'll show you that config in a moment.

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Router 1 is connected to switch 1

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and router 2 is connected to switch 2

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and the routers are simply acting as edge devices or PCs in this topology.

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I’ve also got a hub connected to switch 1 and switch 2.

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Here’s switch 1, sh run | include span

8
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
as you can see at the moment the switches configured for PVST

9
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I'll explain extended system IDs in more detail later

10
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
but essentially it means that the priority of the switches

11
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
based on the priority and VLAN number.

12
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So as an example, sh Spanning Tree

13
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
this switch has a bridge ID consisting of the priority 32769

14
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
which is the default of 32768+ the extended system ID of 1

15
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
because we're looking at VLAN 1 and MAC address of the following.

16
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
this switch is currently the root

17
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
What I want you to see is that the Spanning Tree enabled here is IEEE

18
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
so in this output, it looks like you're running 802.1D

19
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
but actually, the switch is configured for Per-VLAN Spanning Tree.

20
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Per-VLAN Spanning Tree is compatible with 802.1D switches

21
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and therefore we can see IEEE in the output here.

22
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Here switch 2 sh run | include span

23
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:55.000
switches configured to use PVST, extended system IDs are being used

24
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:03.000
on this switch, the brIDge ID consist of the priority 32769

25
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.000
which is 32768 the default + the VLAN number which is VLAN 1 in this example

26
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
this is the MAC address of the switch.

27
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So we have 2 switches, one has this MAC address

28
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000
one has this MAC address, switch 1 has become the root of the Spanning Tree

29
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
because it has a lower MAC address when compared to this switch.

30
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
So because of the lower MAC address

31
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
notice AC is lower than EA in hexadecimal

32
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
switch 1 became the root of the Spanning Tree.

33
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
What you’ll also notice is that on switch 1

34
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
all ports are forwarding in the topology

35
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
the ports that are currently connected are those ports

36
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and they're all forwarding on switch 2, however, port 1

37
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
which is gigabit 0/0 is the root port

38
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and it's forwarding has path cost of 4, gigabit 0/1 is blocking

39
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
or discarding to use the industry standard term.

40
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Port 2 is forwarding, port 3 is blocking.

41
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
So this port is also blocking.

42
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Root switches forward on all ports.

43
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Before I show you how port status were determined

44
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
let’s have a look at the BPDUs

45
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
So I'll start capture on that link

46
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and what we can see here in Wireshark is a Spanning Tree BPDU.

47
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
So it’s using 802.3 Ethernet frames

48
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
notice the destination address is the well-known MAC address for Spanning Tree

49
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
it is a multicast/broadcast address from this MAC address.

50
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Here’s switch 1

51
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:10.000
notice the MAC address of the switch 00:11:c6:ac:dd:

52
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
and we're currently looking at port 3 on the switch

53
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
so notice dd00 but this is dd03

54
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
because in Spanning Tree that’s the port that we're currently looking at.

55
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
if we went and look at port 2 as an example

56
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.000
notice the MAC address ends in 02

57
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
we’ve got port 00 01 02 and 03

58
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000
so back in Wireshark here’s our capture sent out of port 3

59
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
in Spanning Tree we can see the spanning 3 version

60
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
so this is Spanning Tree 0

61
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
because in this port its actually using 802.1D

62
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
or the original version of Spanning Tree.

63
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000
The root identifier is 32768, there’s the VLAN number

64
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000
and there’s the MAC address of the switch, which we can see clearly here

65
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000
so notice root identifier, there’s the information of 32768 VLAN 1

66
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
there is the MAC address of the switch.

67
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
The root path cost is 0 because this switch is the root

68
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
so there’s no cost to get to the root.

69
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
There’s the port identifier and here are some timers used in Spanning Tree.

70
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Now when a switch boots up all ports are put into a blocking state

71
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000
they're then moved to other states based on timers in 802.1D

72
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
When the Spanning Tree switch boots up all ports are put into the blocking state

73
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
after 20 seconds called the max age timer ports moved

74
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
to what’s called the listening state.

75
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
if a switch is already up and you connect your cable to the port

76
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
in other words, the links goes up

77
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
it starts at the listening state

78
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
ports will then move to the learning state

79
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
based on the forward delay which is 15 seconds in duration

80
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000
and after 15 seconds ports transition from the learning state to the forwarding state.

81
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
So an 802.1D or PVST it can take 50 seconds

82
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
for ports to start forwarding on switches

83
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
because they move from blocking to listening to learning to forwarding.

84
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Now in the listening state, they are sending BPDUs

85
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
but not updating their MAC address tables.

86
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
in the learning state, BPDUs are sent

87
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
and the MAC address tables of switches are updated.

88
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
So only if based on the Spanning Tree calculation

89
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
it’s determined that a port can be opened

90
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
a port is set to the forwarding state after 50 secs.

91
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
when the switch comes up or typically if the switch is already up

92
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
and you plug in a cable into that switch after 30 secs.

93
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
The port will start forwarding.

94
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
So in the BPDU we can see the max age timer

95
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
and the forwarding delay timer.

96
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
this is determined by the root bridge

97
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
so on switch 1 which is the root bridge

98
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
we can see that the hello timer

99
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
in other words, BPDU hellos are sent out every 2 seconds

100
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
the max age time is 20 seconds

101
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and the forwarding delay timer is 15 seconds

102
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
and that’s what we see in the BPDUs as captured in our topology.
