00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:07.410
In this video we're going to discuss port security which is used to provide a level of authentication

2
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.100
in an Ethernet environment in a wired ethernet environment as an example.

3
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.630
There's nothing stopping you simply plugging in your PC into any open port in the network.

4
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:27.390
So as an example there's nothing stopping a user connecting their PC to a port in a director's office

5
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.140
which then results in them having access to the director's villain.

6
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:39.060
There's also nothing stopping a user connecting a wireless access point to the network and allowing

7
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.300
multiple users to access the wired network through that wireless access point.

8
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.800
That's a major security risk.

9
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.070
What ports security does is it looks at the source MAC address of frame's received on a port and you

10
00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:00.540
can restrict the frames are allowed on a specific port to either a single MAC address that you configure

11
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.890
or to a limited number of MAC addresses that are dynamically learnt.

12
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:11.340
There are various options which we'll discuss but as an example you could say on the port that connects

13
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:18.930
to the director's office only the MAC address associated with their laptop or their PC is allowed to

14
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.490
send frame's to the switch and therefore belong to the directors villain.

15
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.750
Or you could limit the number of MAC addresses allowed in a port as an example you could limit the number

16
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.630
of MAC addresses to one which would only allow a single PC to access the network through that port.

17
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.760
Or if you have a PC connected to an IP phone you may limit the MAC addresses to three to for the IP

18
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.800
phone and one for the PC attached to the IP phone.

19
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.280
That would stop a user connecting an access point or a hub to the network and allowing multiple unauthorized

20
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.610
devices access to the ethernet network.

21
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.540
Please note this is not a user use any cation user.

22
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.200
Syndication can be implemented using a tool that one x.

23
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.920
This is a more basic authentication based on MAC addresses so only frames from specific MAC addresses

24
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:21.150
are allowed or a limited number of MAC addresses are permitted on a port on a switch that solves the

25
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.340
issue of a user connecting to a port that they're not authorized to connect to.

26
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.000
Stopping a user connecting a hub a wireless access point to the network and therefore allowing unauthorized

27
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.150
access to the network.

28
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.200
You can decide what happens when there's a violation of port security.

29
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.990
You could simply drop the frames or you could shut the port down using what's called an error a disable

30
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.960
state in the most secure implementation where you disable the port.

31
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.830
You as an administrator have to manually re-enable the port so the user would have to contact the helpdesk

32
00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.700
as an example and explain that they no longer have access to the network and then you could investigate

33
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.850
what happened and you'd be able to see if an authorized MAC address or group of MAC addresses of tried

34
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.490
to access the network through that port.
