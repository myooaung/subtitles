00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Can this router acting as a PC

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
ping the core switches in VLAN 10?

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
so on router 1, sh ip int brief

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
you can see the IP addresses 10.1.10.11 cannot ping 10.1.10.1

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
answer is yes

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
so we lost the first ping because of ARP but the ping succeeded.

7
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Can we ping switch 2?

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Yes we can, so this PC can ping the 2 core switches in VLAN 10.

9
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Can router 2 acting as a PC ping the 2 core switches?

10
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
sh ip int brief

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
IP address is 10.1.20.12 ping 10.1.20.1

12
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
that is the VLAN 20 IP address of switch 1, yes it can.

13
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
10.1.20.2 IP address of switch 2 in VLAN 20, yes it can

14
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
so these 2 PCs can ping both core switches in the relevant VLANs.

15
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Can router 1 ping other IP addresses on the core switch?

16
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So can it ping 20.1 as an example?

17
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and the answer is no

18
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
because we haven’t configured any kind of default gateway

19
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
or static route on this router.

20
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
sh ip route only shows me the directly connected interface,

21
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
you don’t need routing to ping IP addresses in the same subnet

22
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
but I would need some kind of routing ability

23
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
to be able to ping IP addresses in different subnets.

24
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
now this router is acting as a PC

25
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
so we're not going to enable a routing protocol on it at the moment

26
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
but I would need to configure a default gateway

27
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
of one of these switches to allow the PC to ping other VLANs

28
00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I’m not gonna do that at the moment

29
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
because I wanna show you how to set up HSRP

30
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
a hot standby routing protocol later in the later video

31
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
on this 2 core switches to provide redundancy

32
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
when 1 of the switches goes down.

33
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
So the last thing to do is to save our configs

34
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000
so I'll save the config on switch 1, switch 2, switch 3, and switch 4.

35
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
We have successfully configured trunks on all of these ports.

36
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Now we’ve configured this interface, this interface

37
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
this interface and this interface as an access port in the relevant VLANs.
