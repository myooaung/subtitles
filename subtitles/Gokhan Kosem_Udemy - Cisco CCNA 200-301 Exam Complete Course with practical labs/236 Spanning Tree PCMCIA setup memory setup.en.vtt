1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So this is what our topology looks like at the moment.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
On router 1, let’s have a look at Spanning Tree.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So sh spanning-tree vlan 1

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.000
we can see that were running the IEEE Compatible Spanning Tree protocol or CST

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
the priority is 8192

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
this switch is the root of the Spanning Tree port 81

7
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
for F2/0 is forwarding on VLAN 1 and so is F2/2

8
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
In other words, Spanning Tree is forwarding on these 2 ports.

9
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:48.000
What about router 2? sh spanning-tree FastEthernet 2/0 is forwarding

10
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and so is FastEthernet 2/2.

11
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Scrolling up, we can see the local switches priority

12
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and the priority of the root which is router 1.

13
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Now before I going any further you may encounter a problem with this default configurations.

14
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The RAM may be too little and you may need to configure some disk space.

15
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
As an example, on router 1 if I'll try configure VLAN 2 or VLAN 3

16
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
notice we're running out of space, if I configure VLAN 4, we're running out of space.

17
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So what I suggest you do before going any further

18
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000
shut everything down make sure that you configure enough RAM on your routers

19
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and configure some disk space for the VLAN database.

20
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.000
So I'll configure that on both routers, give it enough memory

21
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and configure some disk space for the VLAN database.

22
00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Before I start the map I'll also cable another link between the 2 routers

23
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
so that we can see Spanning Tree blocking ports.

24
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So I'll start them up

25
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:17.000
here’s router 1 now you'll notice I lost the configuration

26
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
so make sure that you change your settings before you start.

27
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
So set some disk space and set enough memory

28
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:41.000
But I'm gonna set this guy as the root and router 2 I’m gonna set as the second root.

29
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So basically what I did previously so sh spanning-tree

30
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.000
what you can see is that FastEthernet 2/0 is forwarding on VLAN 1

31
00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000
2/1 is forwarding on VLAN 1, 2/2 is forwarding on VLAN 1

32
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
and that makes sense because router 1 is the root of our topology.

33
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
What about router 2? so sh spanning-tree vlan 1

34
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:19.000
notice FastEthernet 2/0 is forwarding but FastEthernet 2/1 is blocking

35
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
FastEthernet 2/2 is forwarding

36
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Spanning Tree has blocked this link which is correct

37
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and expected because we have a loop in this topology.

38
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
So let's configure an IP address on VLAN 1

39
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000
ip address 10.1.1.254 no shut

40
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:49.000
router 2 int vlan 1 ip address 10.1.1.253

41
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.000
one of the things I’m gonna do before I go any further

42
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
is configure these 2 links as trunk ports

43
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000
so on router 1 interface f2/0 switchport mode trunk

44
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
interface 2/1 switch port mode trunk.

45
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
I’ll do the same on this switch

46
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.000
switchport mode trunk interface 2/1 switchport mode trunk.

47
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:33.000
So I’ve manually turned off DTP or Dynamic Trunk Protocol.

48
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
So now let’s have a look

49
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
sh spanning-tree vlan 1

50
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.000
FastEthernet 2/0 is forwarding 2/1 is forwarding and 2/2 is forwarding.

51
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000
You can also use commands such as show int f2/0 switchport

52
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000
and what you can see here is that it’s been made a trunk

53
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
the encapsulation is 802.1Q, the native VLAN is VLAN 1

54
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000
and all VLAN are permitted on switch 2 or router 2  we can do the same thing.

55
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
sh int 2/0 switchport

56
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:20.000
It’s been configured as a trunk, it’s operating as a trunk.

57
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Encapsulation used is 802.1Q, native VLAN is VLAN 1

58
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
and all VLANs are permitted on the router.

59
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
So we’ve configured these 2 links to use 802.1Q

60
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000
I’ve configured them to use static trunking rather than DTP

61
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
let me show you an example of VTP before I configure the PC.

62
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.000
So on router 1 show vtp status it’s configured as a server.

63
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
sh vlan

64
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
now this will show VLAN switch

65
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
sh vlan switch

66
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000
shows me the default VLAN for Ethernet and token ring and FDDI VLANs.

67
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:14.000
On router 2 show vlan-switch shows me the default VLANs

68
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000
show vtp status shows me that this is also configured as a server

69
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
so these are the defaults.

70
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:32.000
So let’s create VLAN 2 and what I’ll do is set the VTP domain to CCNA

71
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.000
and you can see something else happened on the second router

72
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
it's complaining about the VLAN database

73
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
so if you get an issue like this.

74
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
So show flash

75
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
notice we’ve got an unpartitioned flash and we told to format it.
