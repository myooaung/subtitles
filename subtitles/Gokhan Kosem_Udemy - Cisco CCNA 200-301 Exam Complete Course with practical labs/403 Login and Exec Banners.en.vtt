00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:13.240
So let's configure a log in Abana subpena luggin specify the delimiting character which in this case

2
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.970
is going to be a hash or pound and I'll say loggin banner

3
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.900
specify the delimiting character to enter the message.

4
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.930
So hash.

5
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.860
So previously when we made it to Ratatouille we saw the message of the day banner.

6
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.200
And then we were prompted for a password.

7
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:47.190
Now when we look back we see firstly message of the day and then a loggin banner and then our indication

8
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.380
information now on the console.

9
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:59.350
Notice the Banham message of the day is displayed but no log in banner is displayed.

10
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.700
So it's different to what we saw on the V-twin line.

11
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:11.300
And that's because we didn't configure any kind of a thin location on the console.

12
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:19.870
So if I now specify a password on the console and then log in we see both the message of the day banner

13
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.510
as well as the log in banner and then we prompted for a password.

14
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.010
So this is shown when they log in is configured.

15
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.200
In other words when you prompted to enter your password.

16
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:41.170
So the message of the day first then logon banner banner exec.

17
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.780
So let's say exec Bena

18
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.990
delimiting character we back to Global config mode

19
00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:04.550
tell it back to the router we see message of the day logon password prompt and we now log in we see

20
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.150
the exec banner.

21
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:15.140
So the exec is only displayed after logging on the console of router 2 we see message of the day logging

22
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.400
banner we put a password in after entering our password.

23
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.390
We see the exec Abana.

24
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:29.470
So exec Bana's only displayed after successful authentication.

25
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.230
Now generally you're not going to create lots of banners.

26
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:40.670
You may as an example just choose one of them such as the log in banner or the exec Vana or message

27
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:49.080
of the day Bena it is important however that you specify some kind of banner on your route as so as

28
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:56.340
an example if we telnet from Rodek to Toronto one in this example we need to set up a password.

29
00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:05.580
So a line Viti why zero to four logon password SASCO and telnet back again.

30
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:13.470
We are not shown any warning messages about not accessing this router so we should have some kind of

31
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:24.420
banner which may be something such as log in Bena stating that if you access this router I will find

32
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.800
you

33
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:37.160
and we can imagine what we would say then I wouldn't put that on this video but I will find you and

34
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.210
do something nasty to you.

35
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:48.380
So now when we telnet to the router notice it says if you access this router I will find you and destroy

36
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.190
you or something.

37
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:57.830
I should obviously talk to your lawyer a solicitor attorney whichever term you use you should talk to

38
00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:04.160
someone in the legal department to get the proper phrase to add to this message.

39
00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.450
So that's Banner's.

40
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:18.020
To sum up we have an exec Abana message of the day banner and loggin banner message of the days typically

41
00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:25.660
used to display some kind of message of that day such as the Rada is going to be taken off line loggin

42
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:34.370
is used before a logon prompt and exec is shown off to log in when the exec process starts.

43
00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.590
Don't forget your delimiting character shouldn't be a character used in your message so as an example

44
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:48.510
of non-space a fight and then say my Cisco router it immediately ends the message at this point.

45
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:56.030
So if I told that to the router notice my message of the day Bena has been changed to this.

46
00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:06.270
I didn't specify message of the day but do show run pipe begin Bena shows us that that's what's being

47
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.020
configured in the output on the show run.

48
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:17.900
Notice the hash Â£0 was changed to carot see to indicate the start and end of the message.

49
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.020
That's useful when you want to do a copy and paste.

50
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.220
So as an example we could copy this

51
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.320
on broad of one we could paste that message.

52
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:42.510
So now we telnet to write a one note just the luggin Bennett displays and the exec Bena displays.
