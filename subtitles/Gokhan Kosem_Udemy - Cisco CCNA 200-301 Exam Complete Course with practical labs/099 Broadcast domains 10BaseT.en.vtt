00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It’s also a single broadcast domain

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
in other words if a device like A sends a broadcast

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
everyone in the network would receive that broadcast

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and would need to process the broadcast.

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
When a device received a broadcast it will process it

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
in other words it will received it on the Network Interface Card and then

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
forward it to upper layers in the OSI model

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
so as an example the CPU or Central Processing Unit of a PC

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
would be interrupted when a PC receives a broadcast.

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So if device A starts jabbering, in other words start sending many, many broadcast

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
unto the network, those broadcast would be received by  all the devices in the network

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and every device would be interrupted and we have to process the broadcast.

13
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So the CPU's of every PC will be interrupted by every broadcast sent by A

14
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and would need to process that broadcast

15
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
if A were sending a broadcast but the traffic was only intended for B both C and D

16
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
would still have to receive that broadcast.

17
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Process it and drop it, but the problem is their CPU's will interrupted

18
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
which may cause the PC to slowdown.

19
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Thus, because of the issues with regards to maximum segment length

20
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
maximum host on a segment and cable breaks, 10base2 was replace with 10baseT.

21
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
10baseT uses unshielded twisted pair, it’s a very unlikely that you going to encounter

22
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
10base2 in today’s network. so 10baseT or twisted pair Ethernet

23
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
refers to the use of cable that contains insulated copper wires

24
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
twisted together in pairs with the maximum distance of 100 meters

25
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
the cable is a lot thinner and more flexible than coaxial cable

26
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
which was use in both  10base2 and 10base5 networks.

27
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
In 10baseT we tend to use unshielded twisted pair cables

28
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
shielded twisted pair cables maybe used in noisy environments

29
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
where there’s a shield around each pair of wires, plus an overall shield around the

30
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
cables to protect them against excessive electrical magnetic interference.

31
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
This maybe causes as an example where networks cables are close to electrical cables.

32
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
So additional protection is required.

33
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
But most networks tend to use unshielded twisted pair

34
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
where the cables are not shielded against interference in the same way.

35
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Once again 10baseT means 10Mbps, base means baseband rather than broadband,

36
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
T means twisted pair with the maximum segment size of a 100 meters.

37
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
The connectors used are RJ-45 connectors as seen here and you’ve probably

38
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
connected an RJ-45 connected to your PC many times in the past.
