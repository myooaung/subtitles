00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:09.880
Now you can copy the configuration from RAM to nv ram by using the command copy running config startup

2
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.900
config that replaces the configuration stored in nv ram.

3
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.740
You can also copy the configuration to a TFT server.

4
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.410
You can copy both the running config as well as the startup config to a TFT server.

5
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:36.280
When you copy the config from RAM to nv ram it overrides the configuration a copy from nv ram or startup

6
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.940
to ram or running config is a merge so let's demonstrate how that works.

7
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:50.200
So on my router if I type show stodge at the moment there is no startup config which we saw previously

8
00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.310
and show running config shows me my current configuration so shows start no config show running config

9
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:11.160
shows the current configuration on the device copy running config startup can fake saves the configuration

10
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:17.660
from RAM to nv ram Sarnoff on top shows start will show startup config.

11
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.990
I can see that I'm using so many bytes out of so many bytes.

12
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:33.530
If I change the name of the router to our one and then top show run the current config or running config

13
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:47.720
shows me the hostname of our one but shows startup config stold shows a hostname of router.

14
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.380
If I copy the running config to startup config again and then type show starts.

15
00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:03.100
Notice the host name has changed to our one so the running config overrides the startup config.

16
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.650
If I look at the startup config

17
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.420
and let's have a look at interface Fosset Ethan it is 0 1.

18
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.160
You can see the interface is shut down and has no IP address.

19
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:27.570
I'll go into that interface and this is making changes to the running config and I'll set an IP address

20
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.660
on the interface and I'll know shut the interface.

21
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:44.560
So if I look at the running config on this router we can see that the IP addresses configure it.

22
00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.150
If I look at the startup config

23
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.890
the interface is shut down and doesn't have an IP address.

24
00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.650
This is the same config as the running config on the device but this is different.

25
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.710
So copy start to run.

26
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.220
Let's see what happens.

27
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:16.840
Top Chef start and look at their interface the interface didn't have an IP address and was shut down

28
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.860
in the start of config not to save time searching I'm going to type the C'mon show run interface face

29
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.590
zero slash one and notice this only shows me the config for that individual interface in the running

30
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.620
can fake.

31
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.020
And in this example you can see that the running config was replaced

32
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.850
with the startup config.

33
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.440
Let's look at start again.

34
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.940
So the startup config has the interface shut down.
