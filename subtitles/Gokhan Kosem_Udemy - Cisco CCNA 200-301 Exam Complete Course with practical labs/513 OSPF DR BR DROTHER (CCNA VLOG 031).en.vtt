00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:14.690
In this video we're going to discuss Oh SPF designated rowdies or bras and backup designated Rodders

2
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.800
or BDO.

3
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.020
This is one of multiple videos and in this first video let's see if we can answer some basic questions

4
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.400
in this topology.

5
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.150
How many designated riders are there.

6
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:40.880
In other words how many dealers will be elected in this topology.

7
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.970
Second question how many backup designated routers or BDO cars are they in this topology

8
00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:03.490
and thirdly how many D or others or druthers are they in this topology.

9
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:11.650
So can you answer how many dealers how many BD hours how many days are others are there in this topology

10
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:20.350
notice that brought one rider to write a three and Rod a four or connected to a layer to switch.

11
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:27.260
There is no configuration on the switch route a force connected to ratify via serial link and route

12
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.660
of five is connected to wrote a six via an Ethernet link.

13
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.490
How many dealers how many BDO hours how many days or others.

14
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.650
So let's configure the topology and find out in this topology of only configured IP addresses.

15
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:51.180
I haven't configured always SPF so not a one show IP protocols or SPF is not configured

16
00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:02.250
Let's paste a basic o SPF configuration onto the rudder we've enabled or SPF on all interfaces on the

17
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.930
router show IP or SPF interface.

18
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:18.290
Brief SPF is enabled on gigabit 00 current state is weight that's the link here gigabit 00 is the link

19
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:19.490
to the switch

20
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:29.030
after a while the state should change but the rudder waits to see if other route are configured on the

21
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:37.420
same segment in this example the Rada has become the designated Rada that would make sense because there

22
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:48.560
are no other routers configured on the layer to switch and brought it to show IP protocols SPF is not

23
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:58.100
currently running paste the OSP SPF config in neighbor relationship has been established and the state

24
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:07.050
has gone to full show IPO SPF neighbor we can see that Rider 2 has formed a relationship with Rod a

25
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:18.490
1 rather 1 is the D.R. a full relationship exists to that broader show IPO SPF interface brief shows

26
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:28.650
us that the local Rada is a backup a designated Rada What about Rada 3 show IP protocols or SPF is not

27
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:38.160
currently enabled on the strata salt paste in the configuration the Rada has formed to neighbor relationships

28
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:50.280
one with a one one with Robert to sort of show IP 0 SPF interface brief who SPF is enabled on the local

29
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.250
gigabit 00 interface the router is a D or other.

30
00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:02.800
In other words SPF is running on this interface gigabit 00 router 3 has become a D or other or draw

31
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:11.980
the show IP who is P.F. Neighbor to Neighbor relationships exist one to right of one who's the D.R.

32
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:20.980
another 2 rod a 2 which is the BTR notice full relationship which means that rod so exchanged between

33
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:30.150
these routers so Rada 3 will synchronize its 0 SPF database with a 1 and Rod a 2.

34
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:38.310
Okay so Rod 4 show IP protocols who Piff is not enabled on this Rhonda

35
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:47.410
the output is different here because this road is running version twelve four of IAW with these other

36
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.470
riders are running fifteen point six.

37
00:04:51.490 --> 00:05:01.920
They are Iowa's v riders whereas this rider is a C 30 725 rider so IP protocol shows no writing protocols

38
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:12.900
all enable or SPF on all interfaces on this rider show IP 0 SPF interface brief this Rada is acting

39
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:20.400
as a D or other on the fast ethernet interface and it has a point to point connection on the serial

40
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:29.850
interface we can see that a relationship was formed to route a two and wrote a one so show IP SPF neighbor

41
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.640
it only forms a full relationship with Russia one and wrote it two.

42
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:44.430
In other words the D.R. and the PDR it does not form a full relationship was wrote a three on a three

43
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.380
we should see something similar previously rudder three had a full relationship with rudder one and

44
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:57.260
rudder too it still has that but it has a two way relationship or half formed relationship with Russia

45
00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:07.700
for so on this Ethernet segment we have one the D.R. will ADR and BDO are be elected on this link so

46
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:22.210
let's test that three out of five show IP protocols no protocols are running let's enable SPF show IP

47
00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:29.410
0 SPF interface brief 0 SPF is enabled on the serial interface as well as the first Ethernet interface

48
00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.140
of router 5.

49
00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:39.620
So it's running here and here currently it's set to wait on first Ethernet it's point to point on the

50
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:51.810
serial notice stall point to point on the serial show IP who SPF neighbor this Rada has a full relationship

51
00:06:52.260 --> 00:07:02.100
to root a for but we don't have an election OSP FDR and PDI elections do not take place on cereal point

52
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.950
to point links so not a fool.

53
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:14.050
Once again it's formed a full relationship to write a five but no election took place on the serial

54
00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:20.680
link on the serial interface there was no election and election did take place on the ether net link

55
00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:32.250
and therefore we have a D.R. BTR and in this example another D or other so on this part of the network

56
00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:40.800
the switch we have a designated Rada elected no designated Rada was elected on the serial link what

57
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:49.030
about on this Ethan a link between Rada five and wrote a six back on Rada five notice Rada five became

58
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:57.190
the designated Rada on this segment because there are no other rorters running Oh SPF on that segment

59
00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:12.160
so if we enable o SPF on RORT a 6 1 happens show IP 0 SPF interface brief router 6 has become a PDR

60
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:20.620
it's formed a relationship with Rod a 5 show IPO SPF neighbor we can see that right.

61
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:27.380
Five is the designated rudder full relationship between rudder six and rudder five right.

62
00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:36.360
Six is the BTR so in answer to the questions How many dealers are elected in this topology.

63
00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:42.400
Answer is to how many BDO hours are elected in this topology.

64
00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:51.380
The answer is to write a one and Root a five or designated Rodders write a two and write a six are backup

65
00:08:51.530 --> 00:09:01.680
designated route or BDO RS write a three and write a four on the segment are D or others.

66
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:10.230
So what you need to know is that a designated writer is elected on a per segment basis but only on broadcast

67
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:14.250
multi access or non broadcast multi axis links.

68
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:19.950
In other words links or interfaces where you can have more than one product connected to that single

69
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:30.140
segment or single subnet so as an example if we added another link between right of 1 and root of 4

70
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:38.610
we would end up seeing that one of these writers is the designated Rada on the segment and to show you

71
00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:50.090
that erotic can be ADR as well as a BTR or D or other what all D is no shut the link on Rada for first

72
00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:57.390
and configure rather for first so that it becomes the D.R. on that link.

73
00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:07.850
So show IP or SPF interface brief on Fost Ethan at 0 1 we are in the White state so it's waiting for

74
00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:15.420
another router might take it a while so while we're doing that too let's configure an IP address on

75
00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:26.640
router 1 but I won't no shut the interface so that interface is shut I'll configure an IP address on

76
00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:36.950
the interface but I want to know shut it yet notice a 4 has become the designated Rada on this segment

77
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:47.690
so now and write a one oh no shut the interface show IP who is P.F. interface brief relationship is

78
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:58.540
formed and when I present to know we can see that brought a 1 is a backup designated rata on gigabyte

79
00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:07.590
0 1 so we've changed the topology slightly now we have a designated Rata which is rather one over here

80
00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:16.140
at designated Rata here which is not a 4 and it designate errata here which is rather a 5 about a 6

81
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:23.820
is a backup designated rata on the segment on this layer to segment write it to is a backup designated

82
00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:33.900
rota and on this segment write a 1 is a backup designate Rata so notice on write a 1 it's a designated

83
00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:41.920
rata on one segment and a backup designated rata on another segment designated Rod as backup designated

84
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:52.680
routers are chosen on a per segment basis but only on multi axis networks or segments I hope you found

85
00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:59.670
the video useful if you enjoyed it please like it and please subscribe to my YouTube channel I wish

86
00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:00.920
