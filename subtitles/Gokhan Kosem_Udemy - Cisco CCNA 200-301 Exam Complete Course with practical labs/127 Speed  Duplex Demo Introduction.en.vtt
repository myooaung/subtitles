00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In number of years ago, I had a customer who had a connection

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
from their head office to a data center in London and they raise the tickets

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
stating that the connection to the data center was very slow.

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
They were connecting to router with the VPN to the data center

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and throughput was very poor, in other words they could ping the data center without

6
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
any problems but when they sent a large files, the connection were very, very slow.

7
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I went to site and on investigation I found that there was a duplex mismatch

8
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
between the Cisco router and the Cisco switch.

9
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Duplex mismatch is used to cause a lot of problems in the past.

10
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The negotiation of duplex often failed on 10100 links and in those days

11
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
it was recommended that your hard code speed and duplex on links

12
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
between devices such as Cisco routers and switches.

13
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Today fortunately things are lot better.

14
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Today it’s generally recommended that you allow switches

15
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and routers to use autonegotiation of duplex as well as speed.

16
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Now in some cases you may want hard code the speed and duplex

17
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
between your switches and your routers but be aware

18
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
that if you configure it incorrectly you may end up with an issue such as the following.

19
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
notice the switch is stating that there’s a duplex mismatch on F0/4

20
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
to another switch on F0/4

21
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.000
On this router we have a duplex mismatch on F0 to this switch on F0/3.

22
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
in this video I’m not using GNS3 I’m using physical switches

23
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and I’m simply using GNS3  to show you what the topology looks like.

24
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I have 2 routers each and turn connected to 2950 switches which are connected

25
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:04.000
to 3750 switches and I have a laptop connected on port F0/5 to this first 3750 switch.

26
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So let’s have a look at some of the issues you may encounter with duplex mismatches.

27
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
remember that with full duplex a device can transmit and receive at the same time

28
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
where’s with half duplex only 1 side can send, in other words a device cannot send

29
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and receive simultaneously with half duplex 1 party transmits

30
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and 1 party receives with full duplex both parties can transmit

31
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and receive at the same time, half duplex was required for connections to hubs.

32
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
These days because of the use of Ethernet switches

33
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000
we generally wanna use full duplex, which means as an example on this 100 Mbps link

34
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
the switch can send traffic to the core switch at 100 Mbps

35
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and at the same time the core switch can send traffic to the 2950 switch at 100 Mbps.

36
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
so we actually have the throughput in theory of 200 Mbps,

37
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:40.000
100 in each direction when using full duplex.

38
00:02:40.000 --> 00:03:08.000
now I've cabled this link here to show you a problem with duplex between 2 2950's

39
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and I'll also demonstrate autonegotiation of speed and duplex between 3750's and 2950's

40
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
as well as a PC and the switch but before we do that let's have a look

41
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
at some of the problems you should may encounter

42
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
when you have a duplex mismatch as mentioned your throughput maybe a problem.
