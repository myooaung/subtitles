00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:09.090
Now what is in a V in a V or network functions virtualization is the idea that you virtualize and network

2
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.410
devices and network functions.

3
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.730
Here's a document explaining in a V.

4
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.620
And it's very good if you're interested in getting into the details.

5
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:25.500
This is from the SD and an open floor World Congress in 2012.

6
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.190
But you don't need to spend a lot of time going through this document.

7
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.290
That's only of interest.

8
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:40.150
I'll explain briefly what NFC is for the CCMA exam servers have been virtualize for years so as an example

9
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.720
here I'm running a Cisco call manager

10
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:53.780
as a virtual machine in yes exciting and I can connect to that server as an example using a web browser

11
00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:01.280
and then configure the server servers are now virtualizing in the cloud and I can spin up instances

12
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:12.140
of servers very very quickly using Amazon easy to or Microsoft Azure or the Google cloud networking

13
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.670
however has generally in the past sold physical boxes for functions.

14
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.440
So in other words if you wanted a firewall you would buy a physical piece of hardware that provides

15
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.650
a function or a set of functions to you.

16
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:35.120
In this case firewall ing if you wanted a VPN device in the past you would buy a VPN concentrator or

17
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.760
a device dedicated to creating VPN connections in the past.

18
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.570
If you wanted a load balancer you would buy a physical load balancer or a session border controller

19
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:55.170
you would buy a physical device for that function rudders such as a p rather of physical devices.

20
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.150
If you want a router you would buy a physical rudder.

21
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:06.480
Now the idea with network virtualization is we virtualize network devices in the same way that we virtualize

22
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.870
servers.

23
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:15.840
So we take these physical devices and we run them as virtual appliances on physical servers.

24
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.750
And here's an example once again of doing that.

25
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:28.290
I've got a single physical server running iOS 6 I bet here I've got multiple Cisco CSR routers running

26
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:40.240
as virtual machines in iOS 6 I use the Come on show IPO SPF neighbor notice I see multiple neighbor

27
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.010
relationships.

28
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.920
So this device 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 2 or 3 is a physical router.

29
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.150
So what I'll do is Telnet to that physical Rada and I'll log in.

30
00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:01.560
Notice this is in 1841 so show version shows me that this is in 1841 physical Rada showed dialogue as

31
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:11.000
an example shows me the physical components in that Rada but back on the E6 I rather show version shows

32
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.080
me that this is a all Rada showed Di eg

33
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.530
doesn't show the same information

34
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:35.170
because this is a virtual router not a physical Rada you can see as an example that it's a CSR 1000

35
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:42.510
V so show IPO SPF neighbour once again shows me different neighbour relationships and I could Telnet

36
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.430
to a another Roorda

37
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.460
this Rada is a 1941.

38
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.930
So this is another physical rather.

39
00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:02.880
So what's the point rather than running physical Rodders.

40
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:12.630
Why not run multiple virtual routers in the same way that you run the virtual service the concept of

41
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:20.540
having a physical device for every function doesn't make sense in today's world as I demonstrated.

42
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:27.920
It only takes a few minutes to spin up a virtual machine on Amazon it's been easy in the past to spin

43
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:34.130
up virtual servers and allocate a virtual disk space or storage but one of the big problems in the past

44
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:42.720
has been that networking required physical devices so just like years ago server administrators no longer

45
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:49.770
have a physical server per application such as e-mail or Web services.

46
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:59.730
We know in networking don't have a physical device for a physical function we can run virtual routers

47
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:08.980
and virtual firewalls as virtual machines alongside our virtual servers one of the advantages of doing

48
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:16.150
that as an example is you could run a virtual firewall in front of every virtual server if you needed

49
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.930
to.

50
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:23.980
You can implement what's called micro segmentation where you segmented your network down into tiny subnets

51
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:31.420
or tiny segments to reduce broadcasts to implement better security and other benefits.

52
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:37.730
It doesn't make sense today to have a physical network device for every function.

53
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:44.110
If you have the requirement for a firewall it doesn't make sense to buy a physical firewall for your

54
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.270
virtual servers.

55
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:52.570
In some cases it makes sense to buy a virtual firewall that you run on the same hypervisor as your virtual

56
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.120
service.

57
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.110
So this is the idea of network function virtualization.

58
00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:04.450
We firstly virtualize an appliance such as a rider or a firewall or a load balancer but then taking

59
00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:05.840
it a step further.

60
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.810
We can also load balance functions.

61
00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:14.950
So if all you need is to implement something such as VR or LP or H.S. or P It doesn't make sense to

62
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.850
run a full operating system in the server world.

63
00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:26.290
We have the concept of Docker and the same kind of ideas now starting to happen in networking where

64
00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.550
we just run functions rather than entire operating systems.

65
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.250
I've added some videos about Docker to the course.

66
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:38.060
They are only of interest and are not part of the CCMA exam.

67
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.820
So if you're interested in learning some real world stuff about Docker and newer technologies have a

68
00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:43.810
look at those videos.
