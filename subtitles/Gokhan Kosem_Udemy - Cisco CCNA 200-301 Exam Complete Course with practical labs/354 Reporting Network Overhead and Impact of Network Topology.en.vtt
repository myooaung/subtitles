00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:07.720
Another key area of network management planning he's knowing how to build and leverage REPORTS.

2
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.730
Now the NPM report writer makes it quite easy to create various types of reports but it's worthwhile

3
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:21.150
having a look at seeing which reports are available for you and how you can customize those for different

4
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.180
business requirements.

5
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.420
Now baselines are important when you're doing capacity planning or doing service level agreement SLA

6
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.160
management.

7
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.840
You also want to think about things such as availability which means how much a network is up during

8
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.550
that period of measurement.

9
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.530
You also want to think about performance and capacity planning as an example with availability.

10
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:56.110
You need to understand the term five nines or four nines what five nine simply means is that Gerring

11
00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:03.610
the period of a year as an example the network is up ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of the

12
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:04.560
time.

13
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:11.040
In other words they are five nines in that number that equates to about five minutes of downtime per

14
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.740
year.

15
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.780
When you deploy a network management system it's typically going to add an overhead to your network.

16
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.960
This is especially true if you are using a query based system that's polling the network using a very

17
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.600
short interval.

18
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.670
So you should determine the scope and impact on the network that the network management system will

19
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.670
have as mentioned.

20
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.140
One of the things you need to think about is polling frequency.

21
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.320
This means how often you're going to poll devices to collect data.

22
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.750
The more often that you poll devices the more granular and the more detailed your statistics are going

23
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:51.310
to be.

24
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.700
However on the flip side that means that it's going to have a larger impact on your network because

25
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.100
there's more traffic being transmitted on the network the network management system is pulling the network

26
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.650
on a more frequent basis which puts more traffic on the network.

27
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.340
And in addition there's a higher load on your network devices because they have to reply back to the

28
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.090
network management station with information that you trying to gather from that network device.

29
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:27.890
So more polling equates to more detail and cricket detection of issues but it puts a higher load on

30
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.880
both the network and the devices in your network.

31
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.660
Now once again the advantage of more polling is that you have more detail and it's quicker to detect

32
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.680
issues.

33
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.200
However on the flip side it can create extra traffic on the network.

34
00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:52.450
Now most modern network management systems and a lot of modern network devices can handle a larger amount

35
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.380
of network management traffic than was possible in the past the processing power of your network devices

36
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.250
and the speed of interfaces are a lot greater today than they were a few years ago.

37
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.590
So it's not as much of a problem as it may have once been.

38
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.460
This is another reason that you want to leverage both event based and network management protocols as

39
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:21.020
well as queery based nitpicked management protocols event based protocols once again of a real time

40
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.070
unsolicited feedback from your network devices.

41
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.830
A route is Goni and form the network management station when an interface goes down with polling based

42
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.750
or query based protocols.

43
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.720
There's a query and response.

44
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:43.200
In other words the message is queering a device for information and it's responding on Tsering back

45
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.270
to that query.

46
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:54.790
Now less polling equates to less bandwidth utilization but in addition equates to smaller storage requirements

47
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.460
which is another important thing to think about.

48
00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.660
If you're collecting a large amount of data you need to think about your disk requirements for your

49
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:12.030
sequel's server which is way NPM stores data large amounts of data equate to biggest databases which

50
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.380
in turn means that you need more disk space.

51
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:22.600
Another important topic to discuss is the impact of the network topology on your network monitoring.

52
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:29.540
If an interface goes down does it impact the ability of the en mass to collect data from your network

53
00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.160
devices.

54
00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:38.150
So as an example if you viewed the network topology in something as simple as Vizio or within one of

55
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:45.170
your management tools how would an outage affect the ability of your network management system to collect

56
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.340
data from devices in your network.

57
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.880
If you had devices at a remote site and you wanted to collect statistics from those devices how will

58
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.500
a link down affect your ability to get to those statistics.

59
00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:05.810
If there was only a single link to the remote site and you had a central network management system and

60
00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:11.900
the link went down the end a mess would no longer be able to access those devices to collect data.

61
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:20.080
So you may need to deploy a network management collector on the remote site to collect data remotely

62
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.280
rather than trying to collect everything from a central site.

63
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:29.470
So this would mean as an example that you deploy a distributed network management architecture rather

64
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.380
than having a single centralized network management system.

65
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.110
This is especially true where you have multiple data centers.

66
00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:44.970
In that case you might want to deploy multiple copies of NPM one in each data center that then forward

67
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:49.560
data to an enterprise operation consul yosi.

68
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.550
So remember if you can't get to it you can't monitor it.

69
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.230
So it's important that you keep track of your network topology because you need to ensure that you have

70
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.010
reachability status when the topology changes.
