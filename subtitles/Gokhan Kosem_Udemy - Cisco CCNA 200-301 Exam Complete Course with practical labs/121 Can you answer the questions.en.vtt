00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:28.740
This is one of a multiple CCN a quiz based with videos these quizzes are practical and use a packet

2
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:36.160
tracer to help you test and verify your knowledge of Assisi and eight topics.

3
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:43.630
So download to the attached a packet trace a file and see if you can practically answer the questions

4
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.020
in this quiz.

5
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:55.020
So don't just answer the questions prove it by using the package to trace a simulation mode so assume

6
00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.590
that for these questions that all devices have just rebooted you can simulate to this by clicking the

7
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.920
power cycle devices button and Packet Tracer.

8
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:12.440
In other words you can click this button here to power cycle of the devices.

9
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.930
Again don't just answer these questions prove it.

10
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:24.100
The first question is when P.S. 1 Ping's P.S. 4 in network 1.

11
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.770
What type of packet is sent to the Hub initially.

12
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:28.680
Can you prove it.

13
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.670
Who received the packet.

14
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.980
Who received the return traffic from P.S. fort.

15
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:45.090
P.S. 1 and when paying traffic is sent from P.S. 1 to P.S. 4 who receives that traffic for question

16
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.530
5 to 8.

17
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.140
Assume that the switches and MAC address table is empty so assume that or thus allow you to switch in

18
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.450
network 2 has just a rebooted and that its MAC address table is empty.

19
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.600
When P.S. 5 pings P.S. 8.

20
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.330
In other words this P.S. Here pings of the IP address of PCH what type of packet is sent initially to

21
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.350
the switch.

22
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.110
And can you prove it.

23
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:19.500
And then again who receives the initial packet and who receives the return traffic from P.S. 8 to P.S.

24
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:29.930
5 and then when ICMP traffic or ping traffic is sent from P.S. 5 2 P.S. 8 who received the traffic Question

25
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.270
9 10 and 11 ask about broadcast and collision domains.

26
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.460
How many broadcast domains are there network one and can you prove it.

27
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.390
How many broadcast domains are they in network 2 and can you prove it.

28
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.570
How many collision domains are there in network 1 and network 2.

29
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:58.610
And again can you prove that you don't have to answer these questions from Question 1 to question eleven.

30
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.240
You may want to answer questions 9 10 and 11 first and then answer the other questions.

31
00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:13.460
But by the time you finished you should be able to answer these 11 questions and be able to prove the

32
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.230
answers practically.

33
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:21.980
So download the attached packet trace a file and see if you can answer the questions yourself.

34
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.930
But I'm now going to go through the answers to these questions.

35
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.840
I'm going to answer the questions practically now.

36
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.930
So either pause the video or continue watching.
