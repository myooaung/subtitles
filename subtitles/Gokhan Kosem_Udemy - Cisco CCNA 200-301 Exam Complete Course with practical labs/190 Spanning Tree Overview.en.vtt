00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In this video, we're going to discuss Spanning Tree

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Spanning Tree was developed to stop a layer 2 loops occurring in switch environments.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
In transparent switching or transparent bridging which is what Ethernet uses

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
redundant links introduce loops and Spanning Tree is used to stop those loops.

5
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Spanning Tree has been around for many years

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and there been multiple developments and enhancements.

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So this is one of the challenges that you’re going to face.

8
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
There are different implementations and version of Spanning Tree

9
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and you'll need to know some of those differences.

10
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Spanning Tree are very important protocol in traditional networks

11
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and once again its primary purpose is to stop loops in the switch environment

12
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and not necessarily to stop them as quickly as we would like.

13
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Spanning Tree was developed many years ago

14
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
originally being developed for bridges rather than switches

15
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and thus at times a very slow to converge.

16
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
In other words, it takes a long time for traffic to be re-routed

17
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
if there’s a change in the network topology.

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Spanning Tree was once again originally developed for bridges

19
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and bridges do their calculations in software rather than in hardware

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
which is what switches do today.

21
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So in the past, slower convergence was fine

22
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
but that’s a major problem in today’s environments, where we run Voice over IP

23
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
or other protocols that require very quick convergence.

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Thus the original standard Spanning Tree or 802.1D Spanning Tree

25
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
has been superseded by newer versions

26
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
such as Rapid Spanning Tree and Multiple Spanning Tree.

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
because Spanning Tree is of great importance for the CCNA certification

28
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
as well as for real deployments

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I’m going to start off with original version of Spanning Tree

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
802.1D and then we'll build on those concepts looking at more and more

31
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
complex topologies and other versions of Spanning Tree.
