00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now on links to devices that don’t support DTP

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
the port will remain an access port

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
so on this link between switch 2 and router 2

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the default mode is being used which is dynamic auto.

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
so DTP is enabled but it's using dynamic auto.

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I’ll configure it to use desirable.

7
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
sh int g0/2 switchport

8
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
notice the administrative mode is dynamic desirable

9
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
but the operational mode is static access.

10
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So it’s not trunking it's remained as an access port in the default VLAN of 1.

11
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and that’s because router 2 isn’t configured to use DTP

12
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
this interfaces are routed interface

13
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
so the switch port interface

14
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
at the moment that interfaces is down, so let’s enable it

15
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and see if it makes any difference.

16
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:16.000
But notice if we type the command sh switchport it’s not gonna work

17
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:25.000
sh int f0/0 this is a routed port not a switchport interface.

18
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
So it’s acting as a PC or traditional router on switch 2

19
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
sh int g0/2 switchport

20
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
notice the mode has remained a static access

21
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
even though it’s configured as desirable

22
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
that will be true for both dynamic auto and dynamic desirable.

23
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Unless both sides can negotiate to use DTP

24
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
it will just remain an access port in the default VLAN which is VLAN 1.

25
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Now let’s look at some negotiation

26
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
so let’s do some Wireshark captures

27
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000
so I start capturing traffic on the hub, in this case on port 2

28
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:20.000
the switches are using gigabit 0/3, so sh int g0/3 switchport

29
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
at the moment its configured to use dynamic auto

30
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
in other words DTP but auto mode.

31
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
The same is true on switch 2, notice dynamic auto.

32
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
In the Wireshark captures we see Spanning Tree BPDUs

33
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
we see some CDP messages and notice here we see dynamic trunk protocol.

34
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:52.000
We can see a message from switch with MAC address ending in cc:03

35
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
configured for auto access mode

36
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
sh int g0/3

37
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:09.000
notice this is the Mac address of switch 2 ending in cc:03

38
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
so in the output, we can see the trunk status

39
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
values configured for auto access

40
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:26.000
it’s using ISL and the sender ID is switch 2.

41
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
We can also see a message from switch 1

42
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.000
notice MAC address ff0/3 sh int g0/3

43
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
so there’s the command, notice the MAC address ends in ff0/3.

44
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:53.000
This switch is also using DTP auto access mode  scrolling down

45
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
we can see it wants to negotiate to use ISL

46
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and there’s the MAC address of the switch.

47
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
So at the moment, neither side is initiating trunking.

48
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
So if we type sh int trunk

49
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
you’ll notice gigabit 0/3 is not in the list of trunk ports.

50
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:23.000
on either side sh int g0/3 switchport

51
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
at the moment it’s operating as an access port.

52
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:42.000
We can see that on both sides but if we change 1 side so int g0/3

53
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:53.000
switchport mode dynamic desirable sh int trunk

54
00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Notice that gigabit 0/3 is configured to use trunking

55
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
with ISL encapsulation because this side is configured as desirable

56
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000
sh int trunk  this side is configured as auto

57
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
so they’ve negotiated to set up a trunk.

58
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
In the Wireshark capture, I scroll down.

59
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Here we have a message from switch 2

60
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
notice the mode is trunk desirable.

61
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:38.000
So the switch is initiating the trunking using ISL with switch 1.

62
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Switch 1 is still using trunk auto

63
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000
but switch 2 is using dynamic desirable trunking

64
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
so it’s initiating the trunking.

65
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
What happens if we change the encapsulation?

66
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
so int g0/3

67
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q

68
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
sh int trunk on the left-hand side

69
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
notice the trunking is changed to dot1q

70
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
previously it did negotiate to use ISL.

71
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:23.000
in the Wireshark capture, scrolling up, we should see some messages.

72
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Here’s switch 2 trunk desirable.

73
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Wanting to use 802.1q rather than ISL.

74
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.000
so notice the trunk operating type is 802.1q

75
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
switch 2 is negotiating switch 1

76
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
which is still using dynamic auto to set up a trunk

77
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
and that’s whats happened.

78
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Switch 1 is using auto mode

79
00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:01.000
but is currently using trunking using 802.1q with switch 2

80
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000
because switch 2 is configured with desirable mode

81
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
and is initiating the trunk.

82
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
So there some examples of using dynamic trunking protocol

83
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
to dynamically configure a trunk between 2 switches.

84
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.000
The recommendation once again is don’t use DTP

85
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
so turn off DTP and manually configure your trunk

86
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
and your encapsulation between both switches.
