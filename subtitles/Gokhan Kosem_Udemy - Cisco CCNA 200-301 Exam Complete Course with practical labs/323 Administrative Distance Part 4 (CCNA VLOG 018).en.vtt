00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:04.770
You know

2
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.580
in this blog we are going to continue our discussion about administering distances.

3
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.710
So let's start with some questions.

4
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.590
When Radu one pings the loop back.

5
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.810
So $4.4 4.4 which way will the traffic go.

6
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.040
Show i.p.

7
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.580
Shows us the writing table.

8
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.960
So you answer the question Which way will traffic go when sent from a one to 4.

9
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.810
Will it go viral too.

10
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.390
Or will it go by a router 3.

11
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.350
Which way will it go and why.

12
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.710
So let's do a trace to triple four.

13
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.700
So the traffic is going via router too.

14
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:06.170
So the next top is tendered one to one to two and then it goes to tender one two or three day or two.

15
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.830
Why.

16
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.750
So he has the writing table we've got these entries for network $4.4 4.4.

17
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.470
Both a GOP and OSPF ront are shown on the writing table.

18
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:28.120
Notice the Edmon distance of your GOP and OSPF your GOP has a lower administrative distance than OSPF

19
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.750
does.

20
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.500
So typically your job is more believable than OSPF.

21
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.460
See my other videos for examples demonstrating that.

22
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.790
However and this is the important piece.

23
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:49.750
Notice the mosque used on the GOP route compared to the mosque used on the OSPF route from Iran his

24
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:50.320
point of view.

25
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.950
These are two separate networks.

26
00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:00.970
We've got a $4.4 4.0 network and we've got a Ford Ford at 4.4 slash 32 network.

27
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.040
So slushed 24 and slash 32 network.

28
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.580
They are separate networks.

29
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.110
The Rodda will choose the route with the best match.

30
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:16.390
In other words the longest match 32 bits is a longer match or better match than 24 bits.

31
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:25.740
So this route takes precedence over this route for traffic sent to the loop back of rota for the administer

32
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.860
of distances are only used when we are talking about the same route.

33
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.330
In other words the mosques are the same here because they are different mosques.

34
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:44.760
Longest match is used as an example if I removed from the router and then use the command show IP route.

35
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.750
Notice the GOP route is the route in the writing table and if we traced to quadruple for it would go

36
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.390
via router three.

37
00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:06.660
So lets add back who is P.F. and I'll just enable OSPF on all interfaces and areas zero show IP ROFFT

38
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:16.400
SPF loading school has to be done but once that's done I noticed the rapture is available in the writing

39
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.890
table and we are going via.

40
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:28.670
In this example Serrato one is learning about this network from ratatouille through SPF wrote of one

41
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.190
is learning about this network through your job.

42
00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:33.660
From Rodda 3.

43
00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:43.550
But because of the longest match the traffic is sent via Rodda to.

44
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.860
So let's see why the summary ROFFT was adage so show running to face gigabit.

45
00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.000
0 1 I added this summary route to route of 4.

46
00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:02.720
To summarize the network advertised through your GOP Let's go to that interface and remove it.

47
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:16.390
Now show IP brought on Rato one what you'll notice is the OSPF rot has been removed.

48
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.940
The new route has only been available in the writing table for 5 seconds.

49
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:28.570
Previously we had this rumped in the writing table for about forty nine seconds.

50
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:36.200
So a new route has been added to through the GOP because it's the same route as the ROFFT advertised

51
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.590
by OSPF.

52
00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:43.850
In other words this is the same as this exact match.

53
00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:49.730
The GOP rot takes precedence because it has a lower administer of distance.

54
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.110
So now when we trace to that loopback it's going via rodded three.

55
00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:02.420
So be careful with Edmon distances in the ministry of distance is only used as a tiebreaker when multiple

56
00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.400
routing protocols are trying to put the same route into the writing table.

57
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.940
If they are different Roths in other words they different mosques both routes will end up in the running

58
00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:11.590
table.

59
00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:18.020
