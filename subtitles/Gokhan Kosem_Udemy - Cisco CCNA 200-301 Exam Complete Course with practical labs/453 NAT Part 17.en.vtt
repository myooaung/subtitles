As you can see here the net entries coming out so show I.P net translations shows me that that net entry

2
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.140
has been removed from the table.

3
00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:18.730
Now one of the problems with this way of doing network address translation is there is a one to one

4
00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:27.040
mapping between the inside and outside IP addresses in our pool.

5
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.710
We only it a few addresses.

6
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.620
So show run piping clued in that we can see that we've got addresses eight dot wandered 1.5 up to 10.

7
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.010
So they are only six addresses in the pool.

8
00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.330
What happens if we have 100 hosts that need to be netted onto the Internet.

9
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.790
That's not going to work well with dynamic net or static net.

10
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.490
And that's where overloading comes in in the next demonstration I'll show you how to set up not overloading.
