00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:09.590
Now in this topology I'm not using genus 3 genus 3 and Sysco viral do not currently support spam.

2
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:17.370
So what I'm using are physical Cisco routers which are connected to twenty 950 physical Cisco switches

3
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.550
which in turn are connected to 30 750 Cisco switches.

4
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:30.140
I've got a PCI connected to the 30 750 switch and it's running wire shock and we'll use it to capture

5
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.230
traffic from the network.

6
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.600
Now I'm going to demonstrate in a moment that when traffic is sent from Rod a 1 2 rod a 2.

7
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.960
In other words unique cost.

8
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.560
Traffic such as pings or telnet or sent from router 1 to Rod add to the traffic will be sent to the

9
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:53.290
first 29 50 which in turn will be sent to the first 30 750 which in turn will be sent to the thirty

10
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.450
seven fifty two switch and that will continue until the traffic arrives at about a.

11
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:07.250
Thus capturing P.S. will not have visibility of unit cost traffic because when the MAC address table

12
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:14.110
of switch one is populated it's simply going to switch the traffic from this interface to for example

13
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:20.180
this interface to forward the traffic directive to traffic is only going to be sent out of this interface

14
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.850
if it's sent to unknown unique cost addresses multicast addresses or broadcast addresses or specifically

15
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.960
sent to this capturing device.

16
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.310
So the capturing device will have no visibility of traffic sent from router 1 to write it 2 unless we

17
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.720
enable span or port of monitoring on the 30 750 switch.

18
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.680
Sol firstly demonstrate that traffic sent from Rado want to write it to is not received by the capturing

19
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:56.370
P.C. and then will configure span on the switch so that the P.C. is able to capture the traffic using

20
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.120
Y shock.
