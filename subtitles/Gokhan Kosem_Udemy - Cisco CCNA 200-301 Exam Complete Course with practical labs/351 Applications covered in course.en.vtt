00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:06.120
In this course I'm going to demonstrate multiple solar wins applications including network performance

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:14.890
monitor or NPM Kuei slug's server copy cat tools and others that may be of interest to you.

3
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.680
Please give feedback if there's any tools that you'd like to add to the course.

4
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.370
But before we get into the demonstrations it's important that you understand the protocols that these

5
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.610
applications rely on to manage the network.

6
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:40.080
So you need a knowledge of protocols such as ICMP SMP or simple network management protocol S&amp;P traps

7
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.560
syslog and WMI.

8
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:52.140
These protocols enable applications such as NPM to access devices ingenius three or in a production

9
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.350
topology and to extract information from those devices.

10
00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:04.700
So it's important that you as a network engineer or network manager have an understanding of these protocols.

11
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.780
If you already know what SMP is or what a slug is.

12
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.300
Feel free to skip ahead.

13
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.900
But in this video I'm going to discuss some of these protocols in addition to those protocols.

14
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:24.480
You should know what a map is or a management information base and what an ID is or object identifier.

15
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.020
You should also know what a performance counters.

16
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:34.410
Now they are two main types of network management protocols that you should be aware of when studying

17
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.860
network management protocols and how to manage your network.

18
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.870
Always think about how the protocols work and the advantages and disadvantages of the two main types

19
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.930
of network management protocols the two types.

20
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:57.840
Querrey based which means that the network management station or in a mess asks a question from a device

21
00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.880
and then waits for a response.

22
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:08.150
And then you have event based protocols where the network management station simply listens for announcements

23
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.340
or events from the network.

24
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.680
So with query based the network management station is sending a query to a Rodda to extract information

25
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:24.970
from that Rodda where as with event based protocols a router switch would inform the network management

26
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.630
station of an issue or something taking place as an example an interface goes down.

27
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.570
That's an event and a message is sent to the network management station to inform the network management

28
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.360
station of that event taking place.

29
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:47.450
There are several advantages and disadvantages to why you'd want to use a query based network management

30
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:54.970
protocol Firstly query based protocols are reliable because it's queery based.

31
00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:02.810
The network management station is queering or asking for information from a network device.

32
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.860
If the enemy doesn't receive a response from the device that indicates a problem.

33
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.170
The fact that the enemies made inquiry and didn't get back a response indicates that there's a problem

34
00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.340
on the network so no response equates to a problem.

35
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:27.140
Query based also called polling based network management protocols can be scheduled and you can set

36
00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.530
how frequently that's done.

37
00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:36.440
So you could poll the network on a very frequent basis or polled the network less frequently to reduce

38
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.800
the impact of the queries on the network.

39
00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:46.400
As an example you may not necessarily want to query a network device every five seconds because of the

40
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.980
overhead that you putting on the network.

41
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:57.010
Now in Arayan network performance monitor or Ryan NPM will of food in this course too as solar winds

42
00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:05.250
NPM the default setting is two minutes for queery based poles for status information and nine minutes

43
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.850
for query based polling for statistics.

44
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.400
Arayan NPM uses boost query and event based protocols.
