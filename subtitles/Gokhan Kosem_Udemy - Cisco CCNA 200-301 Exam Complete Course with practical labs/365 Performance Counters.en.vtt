Now Windows performance counters are commonly used when tracking data on a Windows system.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:13.880
Arayan doesn't natively use this but you can use a module to leverage WMI to retrieve perf mon count

3
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:24.560
as there are many perf mon values available including processor memory logical disk and others as an

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.610
example for ICMP.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.180
You'll be able to see messages received transmitted errors and so forth.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:42.830
The key thing to remember about WMI is that it's very different to SMP allowing WMI through the network

and then specifically making sure that you have permissions set correctly are usually the issues that

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.840
slow people down when using the WMI protocol.
