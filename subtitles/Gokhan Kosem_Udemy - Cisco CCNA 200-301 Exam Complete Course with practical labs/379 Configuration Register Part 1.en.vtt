00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.140
The configuration register contains different options.

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:12.150
And one of them determines how Rodda boots when we use the show version command and we press spacebar

3
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.340
to scroll down.

4
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.310
We can see what the configuration register of the router is configured as at the moment it's using the

5
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.480
default of 0 x 2 1 0 2.

6
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.840
Whenever you see 0 X you need to know that the numbers that follow on hexadecimal So in other words

7
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.600
we have four hexadecimal values here.

8
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:51.020
So 0 x 2 1 0 2 equates in binary to 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 followed by four zeros followed by 0 0 1 0.

9
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.530
This last hexadecimal Valley determines how a route boots.

10
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:06.880
So as an example on this second router show version it's also set to the default Valley.

11
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.110
But what I'll do now is change the configuration register

12
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:21.910
to a value of 0 x 2 1 0 0 and I won't save the config.

13
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:29.250
I mean use the come on short version so notice at the moment that is the configuration register value

14
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.400
that this is what it's going to be at next reload.

15
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.530
I'm not going to save the config.

16
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.990
But what I'm going to do is I'm going to power off that router some to say immediate off in my APC power

17
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.150
management system

18
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.260
soft power to.

19
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.640
A one.

20
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:57.630
So now when I press Enter I'm getting no response on the router what I'll do now is powered on.

21
00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.640
So you can see the road is booting up.

22
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.920
But notice it booted immediately into run monitor mode.

23
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:12.700
Run or read only memory contains monitor mode and the router has not booted into this mode because we

24
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:22.870
set to the configuration register to 0 x 2 1 0 0 the last hexadecimal Valley is called the boot field

25
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:30.850
and that determines how the rod booted it booted in this example directly into run monitor mode because

26
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.210
we configured the config register as follows.

27
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.760
We didn't have to save it.

28
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.640
It saved immediately.

29
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.840
And when the rod is booted it booted straight into Ramananda mode.

30
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.870
Now Ramona mode doesn't have the same commands as you get in the Cisco Wes.

31
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.420
So notice the output is very different to what we see in typical Cisco Iowas commands.

32
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.780
The rage command allows you to specify the configuration register.

33
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:11.450
So in this example I'm going to set it back to 2 1 0 2 and we told that we need to reset or power cycle

34
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.310
the router to take effect.

35
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:20.550
So we can use the reset command or we can simply power cycle the Rodda send this example or use the

36
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:21.840
reset command.

37
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.780
And what you'll notice is it doesn't boot directly into Rumana mode.

38
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.730
It is loading the Cisco operating system so Ramon is initialized

39
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:43.280
but notice the Cisco Iowa image is decompressed and is being loaded by the router.

40
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.990
Because we changed the configuration register to use normal boot.

41
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:57.660
It's going to boot the operating system and start up the router as normal.

42
00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:03.470
Notice here is the Cisco iris image that the router is booting.

43
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.540
And there we go the rod is not booted up.

44
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.230
Interfaces are coming up.

45
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.880
Always be neighbor relationships are being formed in this example.

46
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:23.390
Show flesh confirms the operating system stored in Flash and show version shows us which operating system

47
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.570
was booted from flash.

48
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.640
Notice the configuration register is back to 0 x 2 1 0 2.
