00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:09.010
Okay so let's have a look at why shock now before getting into the nitty gritty.

2
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:15.840
I want to show you a really nice option in why a shock notice here we have messages discover offer request

3
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.490
and acknowledgement in why shock.

4
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:28.020
You can go to the statistics menu and click flow graph and you can see messages being sent on the network.

5
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.750
I'm going to limit this to the photo which at the moment is DHEA P.

6
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.700
And notice what you can see in the output here.

7
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.830
Make this a bit smaller so I can zoom in.

8
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:51.090
Notice we've got DHEA P discover with this transaction I.D. ending in c 3.

9
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.360
Here's an offer.

10
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.380
He has a request and he has an acknowledgement.

11
00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.540
This shows graphically the process of how the client.

12
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:08.320
Notice there is no IP address here sends a broadcast message to 5 5 2 4 5 2 4 5 2 4 5 trying to discover

13
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.540
the ATP servers on the network.

14
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.160
So it's saying who's out there.

15
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.350
I need an IP address the DHB server offers an IP address to the client.

16
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:23.620
There may be multiple the ATP serves on the network so the DHB service that receive these discover messages

17
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.210
will offer IP addresses to the client.

18
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.680
The client will then request one of those IP addresses.

19
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.880
In this example is only one DHB server so it's only going to request the IP address from that DHB server

20
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.640
but if there were multiple DHB servers in the network it would request an IP address from one of them.

21
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:50.260
Typically the first one to offer an IP address and then the DHB server will acknowledge that request.

22
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:57.160
This is a great option and while shock you can graphically see discover offer request and acknowledgement

23
00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.090
again discover try and discover DHB servers on the network.

24
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.300
The HP server will offer an IP address to the client.

25
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.960
The client will then accept that offer and request the IP address from that DHB server and the DHB server

26
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.150
will acknowledge that request now notice in the why shock capture.

27
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:26.000
I've got a DHB discover DHB offer DHB request and DHB acknowledgement notice the IP address on the HP

28
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.400
Discover there is no IP address.

29
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:38.820
It's sending a message to a broadcast address so the C is trying to discover a DHB server on the Internet.

30
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:49.050
Notice the MAC address ends in 80 b 0 going back to my P C notice MAC address ends in 8 0 b 0.

31
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:56.800
So this message is being sent from that Windows P C we can also see that by looking at the client identifier.

32
00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:06.050
Notice MAC address their message type is DHB discover the piece is trying to discover a DHB server.

33
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.450
And as mentioned notice it's requesting to use this IP address.

34
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:16.750
The reason for that is because once again the P.C. use that IP address previously and is trying to get

35
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.450
the same IP address.

36
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.530
If a new device boots up it won't do that and I'll show you that in a moment.

37
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.640
But because this M.S. age when 10.

38
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:33.130
P.S. previously was allocated this IP address it's simply requesting the same IP address again.

39
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.620
Notice you can see under whose name the name of this window's P.C. once again.

40
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.710
There it is on the windows host.

41
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:51.260
So in windows and in wire shock so first step is Discover piece he is trying to discover the DTP server.

42
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.760
Now this IP address once again 10 1 1 2 5 4 is the DHB server.

43
00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:03.290
In our example this is the router Rod is configured with this IP address so the router replies back

44
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.680
to a broadcast address because the client doesn't have an IP address yet it can send a message to an

45
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:17.100
IP address because the client doesn't have an IP address so broadcasts saying your IP address is this

46
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:23.420
so your client IP addresses this your client MAC address remember ending an 8 0 0 0.

47
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.130
That is the MAC address of this windows.

48
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.920
P.S. so that MAC address will get this IP address.

49
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.110
Option 53.

50
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:40.300
This is an offer from this DHB server I'll just jump back for a moment.

51
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:48.140
Notice the protocol used here is UDP from source port 68 to destination port 67.

52
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.910
But here we we're using DHL P which uses UDP.

53
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.950
In this example source port is 67 going to destination port 68.

54
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:07.380
And again the server with this identifier is allocating an IP address to the client with a lease time

55
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.680
of one day.

56
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.550
It needs to renew after 12 days.

57
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:18.920
As I said previously typically after half the lease period clients will be told to renew notice subnet

58
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.810
mask default gateway.

59
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:28.460
Option 3 here default gateway or broader DNS server option 6 and option 15 is domain name.

60
00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.570
So that's the offer from the DHB server to the client.

61
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:39.800
The client then requests that IP address the reason why is we could have multiple servers offering IP

62
00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.870
addresses to the client and it needs to request one of them.

63
00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:48.520
So you could have two DHB servers offering IP addresses to the client it needs to choose one typically

64
00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.120
chooses the one that replied first.

65
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:58.890
So going up notice it UDP source port 68 going to 67 mac addresses the client.

66
00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.720
It's a request.

67
00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:09.600
So we're requesting that this MAC address use this IP address the IP address that was offered by the

68
00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:17.170
server so back again notice the server offered that IP address to the client and that's the IP address

69
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:23.490
that the client is requesting to use the requested IP addresses this from this DHB server.

70
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:31.110
This is my who's name because this is Windows that asks for net by us old protocol ask for other information

71
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.960
such as private classless static right et cetera.

72
00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:37.870
And then lastly the server acknowledges that request.

73
00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.460
So UDP source port 67 to port 68.

74
00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.570
The service saying I acknowledge this as your IP address.

75
00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.460
This is your mac address.

76
00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:53.780
It's an acknowledgement and then similar kind of information is displayed once again.

77
00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.860
So notice we have four messages here.

78
00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:01.110
Discover offer request and acknowledgement.

79
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:01.430
Okay.

80
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:07.960
So that was why Ashok let's have a look on the road Roda.

81
00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:11.950
So again this is the MAC address of our client.

82
00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:21.690
This is the IP address that it got from the DHB server on the road and now show IP DHB bindings.

83
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:33.570
Notice this MAC address was allocated this IP address automatically show IPD HP server statistics.

84
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.200
We can see as an example that we have one address pull.

85
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.400
There's been five discovered messages were received.

86
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:47.860
There's been told for DHB requests and three offers and five acknowledgements a bunch of stuff has been

87
00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.890
going on in the background here.

88
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:56.910
Most important command here is typically binding so that you can see which client received which IP

89
00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:58.280
address.

90
00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.930
Okay so I have got a linux host here.

91
00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:10.290
I'll start this linux host up go back into why a shock and what you'll see is we've got a bunch of DTP

92
00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:11.460
messages now.

93
00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:18.600
What I can do very nicely in why shock is do a filter so that I only see one host.

94
00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:28.260
Notice this MAC address here ends in C 955 that is the MAC address of the Linux client

95
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.820
we can see as an example that this Linux client has obtained this IP address.

96
00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:42.900
I have Conficker because this is Linux shows me IP address shows me the MAC address ending and c 955

97
00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:46.880
in y shock I could actually add this as a filter.

98
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.240
So add this as and selected.

99
00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:59.380
So this changes the Y shock filter to only show me that P C rather than the windows.

100
00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:04.260
P.S. Some only seeing the messages from that Linux client.

101
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.040
So notice she has a Discover message sent out a broadcast.

102
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.220
This is the offer from the DSP server.

103
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.290
He has a request and he has an acknowledgement.

104
00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:18.680
So if we look at the Discover message notice it doesn't have an IP address.

105
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:26.700
It's sending out a broadcast with its Mac address trying to discover DHB server it wants various parameters

106
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:38.050
including A.P. the DHB server replies back with an offer offering this IP address 10 1 1 1 2 this client

107
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:44.010
DHB servers this again lease time renewal time.

108
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:52.020
Other information is displayed so on the client I can see that it got given this IP address by the DHB

109
00:09:52.020 --> 00:10:01.080
server it requested that IP address so request of this IP address and the DHB server acknowledged that

110
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.310
IP address.

111
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:05.040
Okay so that was quite a detailed video.

112
00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:10.690
I hope after this video you really understand how DHB works.
