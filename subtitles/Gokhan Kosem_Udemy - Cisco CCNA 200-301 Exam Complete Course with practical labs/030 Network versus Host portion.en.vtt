1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So an IP Address consists of 2 main portions

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
we have the Network Address Portion also known as the Network ID

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
this identifies a specific network, routers maintain routing

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
tables that contain Network Addresses it's important to realize

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
that routers build their routing tables based on the Network

6
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Address and not on the host address, so they do not route
packets

7
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
from 1 interface to another interface based on IP Addresses

8
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
they do their routing based on Network Addresses, so they will

9
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
look at the destination IP Address in a packet and match that

10
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
to a Network Address in their routing table to determine how

11
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
traffic is routed. So an IP Address consist of the Network

12
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
portion as well as the host portion which is also called

13
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
the Host ID, this identifies specific end point on a Network

14
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
such as a server, a printer, a PC, an iPhone, an iPad or some

15
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
other type of device including IP Phones, these are essentially

16
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
devices that need to communicate with each other, so PC may be

17
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
communicating with the server, you may be using your iPad to
read

18
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
the news, so you'll be surfing to cnn.com or usatoday.com

19
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
or the BBC, so your iPad is sending traffic to that server and

20
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
the server is returning traffic to your iPad, so the iPad and

21
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
the server will have a TCP session established at Layer 4 but
for

22
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
the iPad to communicate with the server, routers need to route

23
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
traffic to the server and back again

24
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
So here's an analogy to explain Network and host

25
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
in cities throughout the world you have streets, so as an

26
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
example we have Oxford St., on the street we have multiple
houses

27
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
or multiple offices but in my example let's assume we have
houses

28
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
on the street, each house has an individual house number

29
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
so we have in this example 1 Oxford St. 2 Oxford St.

30
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
3 Oxford St., 4 Oxford St., 5 Oxford St. and so forth and so on

31
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
each house number uniquely identifies that specific house on

32
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
this street, now you wouldn't have 2 houses with the same number

33
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
on the same street, that would be very confusing because perhaps

34
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
you want to meet your friends, the Joneses at #1 Oxford St.

35
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
but you may end up spending your day with the totally

36
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
different group of people if you have 2 houses with the same

37
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
number, in this example we have 2 #1 Oxford St. houses

38
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Which house is the correct house?

39
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Now that's not desirable, when you go to 1 Oxford St. you want

40
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
to make sure that you are going to the right house to meet

41
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
your friends, rather than going to some other house and hence

42
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
house numbers need to be unique on a street

43
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
in a City, in the World. Now continuing with our analogy

44
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
when working out how to get to remote destination

45
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
in the physical world, let's say you want to go to Oxford St.

46
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
in London, in the UK and you've never been before

47
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
you may use a mapping technologies such as Google Maps to find

48
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
out how to get to that specific street, now when you're doing

49
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
this you don't look at individual house numbers but rather look

50
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
at street names to determine your way to get to that destination

51
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
So if you're in different part of London, you may use the street

52
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
name to work out how to get from you current street to Oxford
St.

53
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and when you get to the destination street then you're able to

54
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
look at house numbers to determine which house number to go to

55
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
technologies such as Google Maps are obviously really
intelligent

56
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and know the house numbers and will guide you to the right

57
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
part of the street, but for this analogy thinks of how routers

58
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
route, they will route traffic to a destination Network and when

59
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
traffic gets to that destination Network then house number are

60
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
used or IP Addresses are used to determine which host

61
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000
to forward the traffic to

62
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Now in a similar way, the Network address in this case 10.1.1.0

63
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
identifies a specific network somewhere in the World

64
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Host Addresses such as 1 in this example identify individual

65
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
devices on that network, so 1 identifies this PC

66
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
on Network 10.1.1.0, each device

67
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
on this network has a unique number, so in this example we have

68
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
5 unique devices in the same way that in our previous analogy

69
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
we had 5 houses on Oxford St. now in the same way

70
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
you wouldn't configure multiple PCs or multiple devices with

71
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
the same IP Address as that would cause confusion and conflicts

72
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
So as an example, if another device wants to communicate with

73
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
10.1.1.1 which PC would it send the traffic to?

74
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000
If PC 5 wants to communicate with this host 10.1.1.1

75
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
there are 2 hosts with the same IP Address which device should

76
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
PC 5 communicates with? So devices on a Network or subnet

77
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
which we'll talk more about in a moment have a unique IP Address

78
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
in the same way that a house has a unique house number

79
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
on a specific street, so in the same way

80
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
that we use street names when going from A to B

81
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
routers look at Network Addresses to determine how to get

82
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
to a remote destination, other protocols such as

83
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Address Resolution Protocol or ARP are used to find

84
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
the house number or host number for a host on a specific street

85
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
or network, so in this analogy we're going from Queen Anne St.

86
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
to Oxford St. and we would use street names for our directions

87
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
as per this example, but once we get to this street in this case

88
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Oxford St. we would look for the specific house by looking at

89
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
house numbers in the physical world or in the Network world

90
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
we would use a protocol such as ARP to find the specific host

91
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
on that Network, routers do not make routing decisions

92
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
based on IP Addresses and make it based on Network Addresses

93
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
A routers routing table is not populated with IP Addresses

94
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
it's populated with Network Addresses, the destination

95
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
IP Address in a packet is then matched to the routing table

96
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
populated with Network Addresses and then a determination

97
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
is made to decide out of which port or interface on

98
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
the router the packet should be forwarded
