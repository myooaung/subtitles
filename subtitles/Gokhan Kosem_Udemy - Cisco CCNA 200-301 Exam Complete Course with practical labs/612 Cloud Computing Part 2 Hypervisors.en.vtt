It's very seldom today that companies run individual servers on individual hardware.

2
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:17.460
What tends to happen is that virtualization software such as VM where or VM is used to virtualize hardware

3
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.970
for multiple servers.

4
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:29.990
In other words you can run multiple servers on a single bare metal P.C. or bare metal server for example.

5
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:39.250
I'm running Mac OS here but I'm also running Linux in a VM.

6
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:46.700
In this example I'm running the general three VM on my mac the genus three VM runs on Linux.

7
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:56.740
I've also got a Windows P.C. that I could boot up and run with in a VM way on my mac in the same way

8
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:57.410
on the windows.

9
00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:04.730
P.S. I could boot up the genus 3 VM which runs on Linux

10
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:14.880
I could also boot up other virtual machines running in the virtual box as an example this is a Linux

11
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:24.690
based operating system running within virtual box within a Windows P.C. so I could run a multiple hypervisor

12
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:34.510
is on windows so I could as an example like I'm doing here run multiple hyper visors on windows and

13
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.130
run multiple operating systems within Windows.

14
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:45.010
Typically you don't want to do that typically you run one hypervisor at a time on your windows operating

15
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.090
system or on your Mac operating system.

16
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:57.190
The advantage of doing it this way is that you can run applications that require different operating

17
00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:06.020
systems on the same server or the same P.C. so as an example Jenny's free as an application to provide

18
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:13.910
better functionality requires that I run Linux within a virtual machine to support certain types of

19
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:25.910
devices in a genius 3 topology so as an example if I want to run my with V devices such as an I w v

20
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.690
player to switch or an IRS v router that needs to run within the genus 3 VM.
