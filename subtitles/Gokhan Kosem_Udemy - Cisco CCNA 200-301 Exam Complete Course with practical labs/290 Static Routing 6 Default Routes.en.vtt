00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now think of your router at home that gives you Internet connectivity

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
in my example, I have a little British Telecom router

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
that's connected to the Internet, this router doesn’t know about all the routes

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
in the Internet because that is just too much for the router to handle

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
so routers such as this have default gateways or default routes

6
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
giving them access to the Internet, in the same way here

7
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I have the brand new Cisco router which I've connected to my Local Area Network.

8
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
At the moment show ip route

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
shows me no routes in the routing table

10
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
because I haven’t configured any IP addresses on this router.

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
show ip interface brief

12
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
shows me that there are no IP address is configured

13
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
on any interfaces on this router.

14
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So on F0/0 I’m going to configure

15
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.000
an address of 192.168.1.128 as an example with /24 mask.

16
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
That’s an IP address in the subnet used by my Internet gateway router

17
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I’m going to no shut the interface

18
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and then I’m going to test whether I can ping my VT router

19
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
which gives me Internet access, as you can see the ping succeeds

20
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
however, in the routing table, I only have that network

21
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I don’t have any other networks and I don’t have a gateway of a last resort set.

22
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
So if I try and ping a website such as google.com

23
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
it doesn’t work

24
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
now that’s partly because I need to enable IP domain lookup

25
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and I need to tell it the DNS server that I’m going to be

26
00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
using in this case, I'll use Google, so when I try ping google.com

27
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
it's trying to resolve that domain name with Google DNS servers

28
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
but it’s going to timeout

29
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
because this router doesn’t have any route in its routing table

30
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
apart from the directly connected network 192.168.1.0

31
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
so notice that times out, do show ip route again

32
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
we only have that single route in the routing table

33
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
so to solve this I can use the command IP route.

34
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
now in this case rather than specifying the individual network

35
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I’m going to specify 4 0's 0.0.0.0 which is a default route

36
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
subnet mask is going to be 4 0's as well

37
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I need to then specify my next hop router

38
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000
in this case, it’s my local BT internet router which is 192.168.1.254

39
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
so show ip route

40
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
my Cisco router only has this static route

41
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and a directly connected route in the routing table.

42
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
show that again, there the 2 entries but notice the change

43
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
gateway of last resort is 192.168.1.254

44
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
in other words, to get to the default route my router can send traffic

45
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.000
to this router, notice the little * which means candidate default route.

46
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
so I’ve got static candidate default route

47
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.000
because we've configured 0.0.0.0/0 via this IP address

48
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
so can I now ping google.com? The answer is yes, I can.

49
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
because this local router knows that to get to any network

50
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
it needs to forward the traffic via this IP address.

51
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
What about yahoo.com, that works, what about gmail.com, that works

52
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
what about cisco.com that works

53
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000
so by using a single static route I can access networks on the Internet.

54
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
now some websites as an example will deny ICMP messages

55
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
so cnn.com is not allowing me to ping their website

56
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000
but I could telnet as an example to cnn.com on port 80

57
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
and notice I’ve connected, it says it open, press enter

58
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
how much is happening I'll press CTRL-C

59
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
and notice I see a bunch of HTML text

60
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
it's quite a bit information on the website

61
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:50.000
but notice HML, so I managed to connect to cnn.com via HTTP

62
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000
because I have a static default route in the routers routing table

63
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
forwarding traffic to a gateway of last resort.
