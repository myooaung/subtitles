00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.580
In this video I'm going to show you how to set up and not overloading or port address translation or

2
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:14.100
pat these two internal devices Route 1 and of for a going to be enacted to the IP address of router

3
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.460
to the router to configure it on the first East and a 0 1 interface with the IP address.

4
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.100
8. wondered wondered one but rather than allocating additional addresses for Nat I'm going to Knecht

5
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.930
both these devices to that single IP address by using port address translational Pat router 3 in this

6
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.970
example is acting as an Internet server on the outside at the moment.

7
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:49.610
Radu one is not able to ping router three out of four on the inside over here is also not able to ping

8
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.230
rotisserie.

9
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:53.620
The pings are failing

10
00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.180
and that's because there is no routing enabled on Rodda 3.

11
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.130
It only has a directly connected network.

12
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.200
It doesn't know how to send traffic back to those devices.

13
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:18.800
We can see that by running debug debug IP ICMP debug IP packet I'll do a ping from a one to router three

14
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.870
again.

15
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.030
We can see messages here unrideable unrideable.

16
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.370
So the traffic is getting from the internal hosts to the outside device.

17
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:37.170
Robert 3 but rotisserie doesn't know how to route it back again because the ping is being received from

18
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.070
10 1 1 1 so the local router is trying to send an echo reply back to that address but doesn't know how

19
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.620
to get to that address because there is no rot in the writing table.

20
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:58.150
To get router three to 10 one one one so neither Route 1 or rod of four are able to ping Rodda three.

21
00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.200
So let's enable that on rockety.

22
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.000
So interface if 0 1 IP not outside.

23
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:15.100
Now in this example we need to make an important distinction to the previous net examples in this example

24
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:24.720
I am netting multiple devices to the same IP address on router 2 and that IP address is configured on.

25
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:32.330
Ethan it is 0 1 so we are not allocating a missional IP addresses to Nat.

26
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.090
This is probably the most common way of doing NAT in the real world.

27
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.800
So Notice I'm using the term Nat and that's what most engineers will call it.

28
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.830
But in actual fact it's Pat or port address translation or Knecht overloading because we taking multiple

29
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:57.230
devices and overloading a single IP address to allow those devices to use that single IP address for

30
00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.420
access to the Internet.

31
00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.420
So what I've done thus far is enable Nat on the outside here and enable that on the inside of car.

32
00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:13.850
That's all I've done and I'm going to type IP Nat and I'm netting the inside devices.

33
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:20.000
And in this case they source addresses based on an access list which I'll create in a moment access

34
00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.620
list one and I'm going to enact them to a physical interface first.

35
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.440
Ethan it is 0 1 rather than allocating a separate IP address.

36
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:39.230
And this is the important piece I'm going to overload this next entry to allow multiple devices to access

37
00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.410
the internet using that single address.

38
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:51.320
I have to create to the access list one as referenced in my command access list one permit and who's

39
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.630
going to be allowed to be nattered

40
00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.140
made a mistake.

41
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.910
In this case it should be anyone in the 10 1 1 0 network.

42
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:10.760
So anyone in this network will be nattered so show i.p that translation.

43
00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.310
No not translations at the moment.

44
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:20.310
I'm going to enable Telenet on rotisserie

45
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.210
and a of one I'll do a telnet to router three.

46
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:36.530
But before I do that let's enable not debugging on router too so we can see the net debugging in real

47
00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.070
time.

48
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:49.670
Telnet eight hundred one to two hit enter notice we can see the net translations taking place the source

49
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:59.570
IP address 10 one on 1 is being netted 2 8 1 1 1 the IP address for traffic S. 2 8 1 1 2 the reply comes

50
00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:00.290
back.

51
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.250
So Source 8 1 1 2 sending traffic 2 8 2 1 1 1.

52
00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:13.690
That is not to add 2 10 1 1 1 so I put my post-wedding of Cisco.

53
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:19.140
We can see the translations taking place type a single character.

54
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:25.140
There's the net translations show IP net translations.

55
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:30.960
There's the dynamic net translation notice inside a local address 10 1 1 1.

56
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.350
Using this ephemeral or random port number is being translated to 8 1 1 1 using the same port number

57
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.940
going to 8 1 1 2 on port 23.

58
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:50.390
So notice rotisseries not being translated but the entries for that address are shown in the table.

59
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.510
Let's do a nother telnet so from Rotto 4 to 8 1 1 2

60
00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:09.360
and log in we can see 10 1 1 for this is not a full IP address is translated to 8 1 1 1 router TOS IP

61
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:19.140
address for traffic going to 8 1 1 2 roaded 3s IP address show IP net translations we can see two dynamic

62
00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:25.680
and net translations one for 10 1 1 4 and 1 for 10 1 1 1.

63
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:33.510
And this is how rodded to knows that the traffic is destined to win both Rodda 104 telnetting throughout

64
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:38.360
history rotatory since traffic back to rodder too.

65
00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:47.810
But based on different port numbers and on router 3 Alceste type one character in noticed we could see

66
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.100
sequence numbers here.

67
00:06:50.370 --> 00:07:00.270
Try type another character notice 2 8 8 3 2 2 8 8 3 3 3 4 3 5.

68
00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.620
And then for the return traffic we can see the sequence numbers as well.

69
00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:10.380
Show IP net translations there are translations once again what's important to remember is that when

70
00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:20.820
traffic is returned from rotatory to rodded to it's coming from the address 8 1 1 to port 23 going to

71
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.840
this address 8 1 1 1.

72
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:30.570
But using a port number so so rodded too is able to differentiate between the two sessions based on

73
00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:31.760
the port number.

74
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:40.320
Hence the term port address translation when traffic arrives from rotisserie at rodded to with a destination

75
00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.600
port number of the US going to eight triple one.

76
00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.540
The traffic is going to be forwarded to Route 1.

77
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.400
But when it arrives going to the same IP address.

78
00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:56.340
But this port number the traffic is forwarded to router for router to ensures that these port numbers

79
00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:58.780
are unique in the next table.
