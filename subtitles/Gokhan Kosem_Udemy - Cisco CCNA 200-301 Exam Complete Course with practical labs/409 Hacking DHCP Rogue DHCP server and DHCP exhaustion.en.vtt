00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.750
If you don't configure your network properly it's very easy for someone using Kelly LA Nix or another

2
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.800
type of hacking tool to exhaust the IP addresses in a DHB pool set up a rogue DHB server and then allocate

3
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.720
IP addresses to clients in a incorrect subnet.

4
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.370
And what I'm going to show you in this video is how to do that but also show you how to setup the Kelly

5
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:31.020
linux host as the default gateway so that traffic from pieces is sent via Kelly Linux to the Internet

6
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.270
or to other devices in the network so that we can implement a man in the middle attack

7
00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:57.160
DCP or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is a fundamental building block in networks today and administrator

8
00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.520
which could be you will configure a pool or scope which is a range of IP addresses that are allocated

9
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.030
to hosts in a specific subnet.

10
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:12.700
Hosts will send a broadcast typically to request an IP address from a DTP server and the DHB server

11
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.060
will allocate the IP address to the client.

12
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.580
Have a look at this video which I've linked to and below.

13
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.640
If you want to learn more about the fundamentals of DHEA P in that video.

14
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.650
Show you how DHEA is configured how IP addresses are allocated to clients.

15
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.560
I show you through why shock captures how messages are sent from a client to a server and from a server

16
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.730
to a client.

17
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.710
Now a quick summary of what we're going to do in this video we're going to hack DTP.

18
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.110
We're going to exhaust ADHD people or DHB scope so that's the first attack we're going to setup a rogue

19
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.940
DHB server to allocate IP addresses from a fake subnet.

20
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.870
Second attack third attack.

21
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.150
We're going to set the default gateway of clients to Kelly Linux so when they get an IP address from

22
00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.850
the rogue subnet they're going to see their default gateway as the Kelly linux host and that allows

23
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.030
us to implement a man in the middle attack.

24
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.320
So for tax right there then we'll use Y shock to sniff passwords on the network.

25
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.660
You need to be careful when you configure your network using protocol such as DCP.

26
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.680
Make sure that you configure your network securely and properly.

27
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.710
Otherwise it's very easy to hack networks that run DHEA P.

28
00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.590
Now this is one of multiple videos where I'm showing you how to hack networks using Kelly Linux.

29
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.940
I don't just want to show you how to break networks I want to show you how to protect networks and I'll

30
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.480
show you how to do that in subsequent videos in the series.

31
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.570
In previous videos in the series I showed you how to hack a physical Cisco switch but I'm travelling

32
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.290
at the moment so I don't want to carry a whole bunch of equipment around with me.

33
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.370
So what I've done is taken that switch all logically taken that switch and put it into the cloud.

34
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.020
In this example I'm using even G and I've got a Cisco switch as well as a Cisco router.

35
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.320
I've got a Windows 10 computer and I've got Kelly Linux.

36
00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.300
These devices are connected to the Internet.

37
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:07.710
This network is running in the cloud but you could simulate this network on your laptop using Janus

38
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.750
3 or even G or Cisco viral.

39
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.480
In this example the switch is running a Cisco viral IOW image.

40
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.760
The road is running a Cisco viral image as well.

41
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.580
Have a look at my even videos or my genius 3 videos.

42
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.370
If you want to learn more about how to virtualize networks on your laptop or how to virtualize them

43
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.990
in the cloud.

44
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.450
So let's start with the switch.

45
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.280
Here's my console to the switch.

46
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.500
Now in this example I'm currently in South Africa so my connection may be a bit slow to the northern

47
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.030
hemisphere.

48
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:46.120
Hopefully it won't affect this lab but notice I've connected to a switch show version shows me that

49
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:55.300
this is a Cisco V I was late to switch running version 15 to now don't worry too much about the details

50
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.410
of the switch.

51
00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.270
This is a Cisco switch but any switch could be used in this topology.

52
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:07.780
I'm also using a Cisco broader but again you could use any routing here if you wanted to.

53
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:18.610
So the Cisco router top show version is a Cisco IOW v router running version 15 dot 6 1 T.

54
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:27.350
The reason I'm using a rowdy here is I want to set up this rather as a DHB server so if I type should

55
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:34.200
run that shows me the running configuration of this device and what I want to point out here is I've

56
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:42.030
configured a DHB pool a DHB pool in Cisco terminologies very similar to a scope so it's a range of IP

57
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.630
addresses that we're going to allocate to clients in our network.

58
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:53.260
The subnet that's gonna be allocated is 10 1 1 0 slash 24 so slash 24 mosque is being used.

59
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.130
This is the default gateway.

60
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.900
That is the IP address of the router.

61
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.510
I've said to the DNS server to Google scrolling down.

62
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.020
Notice this is the IP address of the Cisco router at the moment.

63
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.750
This device has its interface shut down.

64
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:16.220
So what I'll do is no shut that that basically enables that.

65
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.790
I'll also enable the connection to the internet.

66
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:27.400
Going back to my topology at this interface on the router connects me to my internal network.

67
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:34.020
This interface connects me to the Internet so I'll type India show IP interface brief

68
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:42.270
this is the IP address on the internal interface interfaces up up.

69
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.310
That means that it's working.

70
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.420
This interface is connected to the Internet.

71
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:54.420
It's using DHEA p So this writer should be able to as an example paying Google dot com which it can

72
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.380
and I'll save the configuration of the router.

73
00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.600
Now again you don't have to use a Cisco switch or a Cisco wrote it.

74
00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:08.760
The reason I want to use a Cisco switch here is Cisco switches support something called DHB snooping

75
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.800
which allows me to stop these kind of attacks in a network.

76
00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:18.330
I haven't configured anything on the switch at the moment but in subsequent videos I'll show you how

77
00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:19.570
to stop this attack.

78
00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:26.080
But I firstly want to show you what's possible using Kelly Linux so I'll open up a console to Kelly.

79
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:31.850
I'm not gonna get into the debate about the correct way to pronounce Kelly different people pronounce

80
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.730
it differently but for the moment that's the way I'm gonna pronounce it okay.

81
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.560
He has my Kelly linux host.

82
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.260
Let's check if it got an IP address.

83
00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.980
It may not have got an IP address because the road is interface was shut down.

84
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.810
I'll use more here rather than simply showing all the output and what you'll notice is this device has

85
00:06:52.870 --> 00:07:04.610
this IP address 10 1 1 3 show IP DHB bindings on the Cisco router we can see that this IP address has

86
00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.780
been allocated to this MAC address.

87
00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:13.700
This command show IP DHB binding basically shows us which IP addresses have been allocated to which

88
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.040
MAC addresses.

89
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:24.680
So this is the MAC address that Kelly is supposedly using five thousand 1 0 0 0 2 4 zeros and back in

90
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:30.320
Kelly we can see that is the MAC address of this Ethernet interface.

91
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:36.980
Okay so what I'm going to do now is start your senior using a graphical user interface in a previous

92
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.050
video which I've linked here.

93
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.960
I showed you how to install this on Kelly Linux.

94
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:45.570
I also showed you how to implement or use Layer 2 attacks using your senior.

95
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:50.160
But in this example I'm going to show you how to use this for P. attacks.

96
00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.160
We're told that this is an alpha version.

97
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:57.030
That's a case I'm going to click okay and I'm gonna go to DHEA P.

98
00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:05.180
We can see some options here but what I want to do is launch a DHB attack so click the launch attack

99
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:12.620
and we going to send discover packets using denial of service.

100
00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:24.270
Now before I do that on the road show IP DTP binding we only have one IP address allocated to a client.

101
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:29.720
Now the reason why the windows host hasn't got an IP address yet is it's currently off.

102
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.630
I haven't started the windows host at this point.

103
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:42.370
So again show IP DHB binding on the Cisco rider only one IP address has been allocated.

104
00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:50.360
So Kelly I'm going to click Okay to start a Discover denial of service attack and what you'll see is

105
00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:55.580
a whole bunch of DHB messages are being sent into the network.

106
00:08:55.580 --> 00:09:03.860
You can see this packet count is going up on the Cisco router show IP DSP binding

107
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:11.680
what you'll notice is a whole bunch of IP addresses have now been allocated.

108
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:16.620
So 10 1 1 1 10 1 1 2 3 4.

109
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.940
And it just carries on.

110
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:26.390
Basically Kelly Linux has exhausted the DHB pool on the Cisco roster.

111
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:33.560
And as I keep scrolling what you'll notice is all addresses have been taken from this pool.

112
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:44.020
There are no IP addresses left in this pool show IP DHEA HP question mark pool let's press Enter here

113
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:48.610
253 addresses have been allocated from the pool.

114
00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:57.250
The reason why 253 is the roader is using IP address 10 1 1 2 5 4.

115
00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:01.750
So this IP address shouldn't be allocated to clients because that's the IP address that the right is

116
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:03.970
using.

117
00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:11.620
So again show IP DHB pool shows us that at this point we've successfully exhausted the DHB pool on the

118
00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:19.360
DHB server no IP addresses are gonna be available for Windows 10 client when we started up I'll stop

119
00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:24.970
that up and I'll open up a console to the Windows device.

120
00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:30.490
It'll take a while for this device to boot up but once it's booted up fully we'll see that it won't

121
00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:36.080
get an IP address because we've exhausted the IP addresses in the DHB pool.

122
00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:43.630
Now warning I will give you is a lot of packets are being sent into the network that can cause all kinds

123
00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:44.100
of issues.

124
00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:47.510
So don't run this in a production network.

125
00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:50.830
Be careful where you're going to run these attacks.

126
00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:57.220
Notice the number of the HP Discover messages being sent into the network okay from a Windows P.C. is

127
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:58.340
booted up.

128
00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:04.400
I'm going to open up a command prompt and what I'll do is make this bigger so the font isn't so small

129
00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:11.900
it's running really slowly here and that's probably because of the number of broadcasts being sent into

130
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:13.560
the network.

131
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:20.310
If I type IP config notice no IP address has been allocated to the windows.

132
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:29.100
P.S. It's using the default 169 254 IP address range IP config slash renew

133
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:39.910
this device is not going to get an IP address because we've exhausted the DHB pool on the DHB server

134
00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.560
but what we can do now is launch our second attack.

135
00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:52.360
So going to click launch attack and let's set up a d HP rogue server

136
00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:01.480
IP address is gonna be 10 1 1 3 that's the IP address of our Kelly linux server.

137
00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:10.180
I'm gonna allocate IP addresses in the range 10 1 1 1 100 to 10 1 1 1 50.

138
00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.950
I'll set the least time to 3600 seconds.

139
00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:21.460
Same for renew subnet mask will be this the default router is now gonna be Kelly.

140
00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:32.250
It's not going to be the actual router in the network DNS server will set as Google and the domain name.

141
00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:39.100
You probably don't want to use something like hacked dot com let's just specify home dot com and click

142
00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:40.320
Okay.

143
00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:44.500
Okay back on the windows host type IP config.

144
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:48.620
Notice we've been given this IP address 10 1 1 100.

145
00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:54.180
And notice this default gateway is 10 1 1 3.

146
00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:55.660
That's really important.

147
00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:59.850
The actual default gateway is 10 1 1 2 5 4.

148
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:12.640
Kelly Linux is using IP address 10 1 1 3 so I have config more shows us that this is the IP address

149
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:14.710
of the Kelly linux host.

150
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.810
So the Windows computer is using Kelly as its default gateway.

151
00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:25.300
That's important because when the windows host sends traffic to the Internet that traffic is gonna go

152
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:29.820
via Kelly to this writer onto the Internet.

153
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:37.260
So as an example the broader has this loop back interface configured on it of one dot wandered wandered

154
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:43.500
one that's essentially a loop back or imaginary interface on the broader that allows us to add a subnet

155
00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:51.300
to the right of the P.S. at the moment won't be able to ping that loop back address because the traffic

156
00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:57.630
is going through the network to Kelly but Kelly is not forwarding that traffic to the router we need

157
00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:02.640
to type a command on the Kelly linux host to forward the traffic.

158
00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.720
So again notice the pings are failing.

159
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.600
So in Kelly we're going to type sis CTO

160
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:22.530
dash w net dot IP V for IP underscore school forward equals one.

161
00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:27.940
Basically we're going to allow the Linux host to forward traffic that's sent to it.

162
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:36.390
So on the windows P.C. ping wandered wandered wandered one now works that traffic is going off via the

163
00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:49.310
Kelly linux server and we can see that by going to applications snuffing and spoofing why shock so why

164
00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:53.600
shock will allow us to see the traffic being sent on the network.

165
00:14:53.600 --> 00:15:03.030
I'm going to capture traffic on Ethernet zero and I'll filter this for ICMP traffic so back on the windows.

166
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:13.620
P.S. If I ping wandered wandered wondered one we can see that traffic from the PRC to the router we

167
00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:20.350
see a bunch of ICMP redirects but essentially the traffic is being sent through Kelly to the.

168
00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:27.430
We only see half the conversation but we can see the pings and this is the important piece.

169
00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:35.570
Let's assume the administrator of the router did something very stupid and allowed telnet connections.

170
00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:36.740
So on the windows.

171
00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:41.630
P.S. I'm going to tell it to the broader to administer the router.

172
00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:48.420
We should actually be using SSL each so before I click Okay.

173
00:15:49.540 --> 00:16:01.240
Let's filter for telnet in y shock and I'll click open in Patty now that font is very small but all

174
00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.150
into the password and log in

175
00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.380
so I've changed the font.

176
00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:19.980
Now basically the write up prompted for a password which I entered and I'm now in what's called user

177
00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:24.900
mode typing able into my password and I'm in privilege mode.

178
00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:31.480
But notice and Kelly now I can see telnet information including the password.

179
00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:38.640
Here's the password C I S C O Cisco.

180
00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.370
Now that's not such an easy way to view it.

181
00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:45.080
So I'm gonna right click on a packet and click follow TCB stream.

182
00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:51.930
And what you'll notice there there's the first password I type to enable.

183
00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.510
There's the second password which is Cisco.

184
00:16:54.690 --> 00:17:00.810
So I was able to see the password that was transmitted from the windows host to the router because the

185
00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:04.630
traffic is being sent through the Kelly linux host to the right.

186
00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:17.400
So that is an example of a man in the middle attack now on the P.C. I'll open up a web browser and what

187
00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:23.210
I'll do and Kelly is specify HDP.

188
00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.010
So let's look at HP traffic.

189
00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:28.480
You should be using HP yes.

190
00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:37.290
Most websites use HDP s but again if I connect to the router and put in my username and my password

191
00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:47.250
using HDP and sign in I can log into the broader and I'll be able to view information on the writer

192
00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:56.020
such as monitor the broader by using commands on the broader so I could type show IP interface brief

193
00:17:56.140 --> 00:18:02.310
as an example and execute that command on the rider using a GDP.

194
00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:10.510
But back in Cali you'll notice I'll be able to see all the HDP traffic from the P.C. to the router

195
00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:21.340
and one of the things I want to point out here is notice authorization there of the credentials username

196
00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:25.870
and password used to log into the Cisco broader.

197
00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:31.000
Again that's a man in the middle attack the PRC is sending the traffic to its default gateway which

198
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.810
is the Kelly linux host which is sending it to the border.

199
00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.810
But we could connect to the Internet.

200
00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:37.880
So on the windows.

201
00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.600
P.S. I'll open up another tab.

202
00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:44.380
Most websites are now using encryption.

203
00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:45.890
One of them that's not.

204
00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:46.870
Which is really bad.

205
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:50.580
Is OXFORD UNIVERSITY Oh X AC UK.

206
00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:55.120
That website is using GDP not GDP.

207
00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:57.550
Notice it says not secure in the output.

208
00:18:58.210 --> 00:18:58.960
Very bad

209
00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.910
your connection to the site is not secure.

210
00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:09.590
We've been told so back in Kelly we can see traffic sent from the windows.

211
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:19.270
P.S. 10 1 1 100 to 120 967 to 40 to 154 which is the Oxford University website.

212
00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:30.940
Now at least here on their website when you try and log in so go to Oxford students as an example.

213
00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:36.120
They are now using encryption so only part of their website is in clear text.

214
00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:44.460
We should be using HDP yesterday but the point is I can see part of their website through Kelly Linux

215
00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:48.400
by using this man in the middle attack.

216
00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:56.240
You should always make sure that your traffic is encrypted and that you using a valid cert.

217
00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:02.430
So it's really important that you verify that the certificate is a good certificate that it's been issued

218
00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:10.230
correctly that it's not a rogue cert so make sure that your traffic is encrypted especially if you're

219
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:13.330
using wireless hotspots or open networks.

220
00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:19.410
Make sure that the certificate is valid because the traffic could be going through a device such as

221
00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:22.700
Kelly Linux don't just connect to any network.

222
00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:25.460
Make sure that networks that you connect to are good.

223
00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:31.380
Make sure that you use a VPN or some kind of encryption mechanism so that your traffic is not sent in

224
00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:32.100
clear text.
