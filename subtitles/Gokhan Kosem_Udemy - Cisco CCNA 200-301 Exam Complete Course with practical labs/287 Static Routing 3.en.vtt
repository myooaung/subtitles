1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
To enable connectivity in this network

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
we can configure static routes

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
so on router 1, as an example, conf t ip route

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and notice we have various options, destination prefix, profile, static and VRF

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
it’s important that you know the options for static route.

6
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
so as an example, the destination prefix

7
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
or destination network that I want to configure is 10.1.2.0

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and the reason that I want to use 10.1.2.0

9
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
is because this is a /24 network.

10
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Now you can implement summarization of your static routes

11
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
but for now use the exact mask, question mark is destination prefix mask.

12
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.000
so 255.255.255.0 because this is a /24 question mark

13
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I can now specify the next hop router or an outgoing interface

14
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
when setting up routing look at it from routers point of view.

15
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
From router's 1 point of view, what is the next hop IP address

16
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
that he uses to get to this network?

17
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
In other words, when router 1 sends traffic out of this interface

18
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
what’s the next IP address that it's going to hit?

19
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
it's going be this IP address 10.1.1.2

20
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
So if router 1 was trying to get to a network somewhere on the right here

21
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
the next hop would still be 10.1.1.2

22
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
because that’s the next hop IP address that the router is forwarding traffic to.

23
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
So just think what’s the next IP address that going to be hit

24
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
when the router forwards the traffic out of an interface

25
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
that’s your next hop IP address.

26
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So, in this case, it's 10.1.1.2 we can specify various options here

27
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
such as an administrative distance make the route permanent

28
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and other options but for now that’s all I’m going to specify.

29
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Notice we’ve got the option carriage return

30
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and that’s what we’ve used now

31
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
in other words, routes has been added to the routing table.

32
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Let’s confirm that so sh ip route

33
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
shows us that this network 10.1.2.0

34
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
has been added to the routing table as a static route.

35
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:31.000
S means static, route is available via 10.1.1.2

36
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
in other words, this IP address.

37
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So can we ping 10.1.2.2? Ping 10.1.2.2 pings failed

38
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
but we are getting output on router 3

39
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
so on router 3, it’s sending an echo reply back

40
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000
from 10.1.2.2 to destination 10.1.1.1

41
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
so in other words, the traffic is getting from router 1 to router 3

42
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
but it’s not getting back again.

43
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And the reason for that is router 3 doesn’t have a route back to router 1.

44
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
We can see that by using the command sh ip route

45
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:29.000
back to 10.1.1.0. as an example, if I try and ping 10.1.1.1

46
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
the IP address of this router, router 1

47
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
in network 10.1.1.0/24 pings failed

48
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and we can use the command debug ip packet

49
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:48.000
to show us that the router doesn’t know how to get to that network.

50
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
The traffic is unroutable.

51
00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:00.000
So how do we fix this? Well, we need to create a static route back again.

52
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
So IP route 10.1.1.0 with the mask /24

53
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and in this case we're going to use the next hop IP address 10.1.2.1

54
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
now you can use the local outgoing interface

55
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
but that’s not recommended on Ethernet interfaces

56
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.000
only do that on point to point links such as serial interfaces on Ethernet

57
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
use a next hop IP address not the local outgoing interface

58
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
so does the ping work now?

59
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Yes it does and you can see a lot of output

60
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
so let’s turn off debugging

61
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
un all or undebug all turns off debugging

62
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
I’ll only enable ICMP

63
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
so debug ip icmp

64
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000
we can see the echo replies are sent and the pings succeed

65
00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
in other words, the traffic got from router 1 to router 3 and arrive back again.
