00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:07.770
Neighbor discovery protocol NDP has a number of functions with regards to IP version 6.

2
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.410
The first one is slack which again is stateless address order configuration.

3
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:22.140
A host can discover which subnet or Prefect's it belongs to a host or PC as an example could use its

4
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.740
MAC address for the host portion of an IP version 6 address but it needs to know which subnet it belongs

5
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.510
to which Prefect's it belongs to.

6
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.880
And the length of that Prefect's a router can dynamically allocate the network portion of the address

7
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.210
to a host using slack.

8
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:48.480
And I'm going to demonstrate that in a moment rodded discovery is how IP version 6 hosts discover routers

9
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:56.330
serrata discovery would be used by a host to determine the subnet that it belongs to the host again

10
00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.890
needs to determine the network portion of an address and it can use Rotto discovery messages to do that

11
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:09.510
a duplicate address translation or dad is used by a host to determine that no other host is using the

12
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.380
same IP address.

13
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.740
We don't want to have duplicate addresses.

14
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.670
If by some reason they are two hosts on the same subnet using the same MAC address duplicated trace

15
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:28.980
detection can be used to determine if there are duplicate addresses and IP version 6 PC will first check

16
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:36.150
whether another host is using the same IP version 6 or unicast address as itself before it tries to

17
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.430
use that address.

18
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.100
In addition neighbor discovery protocol is used for neighbor Mokka discovery.

19
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.810
Is no ARP messages in IP version 6 ARP uses broadcasts.

20
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.840
Broadcasts are not supported in IP version 6.

21
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.580
So a different mechanism is required.

22
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:04.320
And again maybe discovery protocol is used to discover neighboring MAC addresses.

23
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.340
If a PC needs to ping another device on the same subnet it needs to know what to the MAC address is

24
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:19.010
of that neighboring device so determines the MAC address through neighbor Mac discovery NDP replaces

25
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.860
IP version 4 up.

26
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:32.260
So how do I pay version 6 hosts discover routers ICMP version 6 replaces IP version 4 ICMP.

27
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:39.520
Again there's a lot of similarity between the protocols IP version 6 ICMP supports echo requests and

28
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.840
Echo replies.

29
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.010
So you can use pings in the same way as you did an IP version 4.
