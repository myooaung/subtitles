00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:07.270
Now as I've been explaining typically static Nat is used when you have servers so where one is a serve

2
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:12.770
as an example that needs to be accessible from the outside or internet it's not just to make sure that

3
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.660
we cover the topics in the CCN.

4
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:22.550
I want to show you that Rato one is able to ping router three when static net has been configured on

5
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:23.630
Ratatouille.

6
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.730
So show run piping clewed that we can see the static NAT translation here.

7
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:37.010
So we are translating 10 1 1 1 2 8 1 1 5 show IP net to translations.

8
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:44.210
Notice there is our static NAT translation we are not netting the outside local and outside global in

9
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.980
the static Nat let's do a debug.

10
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.280
So debug IP Nat and what I'll do now is our telnet to 8:1 want to

11
00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.360
the telnet connection is disconnected because I need a password on the site.

12
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:09.940
But what I'd like to see is the source IP address 10:11 was not 2 8 1 1 5.

13
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.340
That's the inside global address.

14
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.510
The destination of the traffic is 8 1 1 2.

15
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:29.110
We had a reply back from 8 1 1 to 2 destination 8 1 1 5 which is then translated to 10 1 1 1 so traffic

16
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:36.670
from a 1 2 3 is having the source address translated and then the return traffic has the destination

17
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.180
address translated.

18
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:46.310
We are doing source address translation of this IP address all enable telnet on the site.

19
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.040
So they enable the lines on this router

20
00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:05.990
and enable a enable password so we still running a debug show debug shows me my that debugging is enabled

21
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.750
and I'll telnet from a 1 to rotisserie again.

22
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:19.360
You can see the net translations taking place again source to destination.

23
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.150
I'll log in

24
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.890
and let's into one character.

25
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.070
E.

26
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:36.390
You can see for the character e the source was translated from 10 1 1 1 2 8 1 1 5 going to a destination

27
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.260
of 8 1 1 2 reply came back and some of the traffic was returned.

28
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:54.860
So an acknowledgement to rotisserie type an we get to the same kind of translation hit enter same kind

29
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.960
of translation is taking place.

30
00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:04.310
So for every character that I enter in the tunnel its session next translations are taking place with

31
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:12.290
10:11 being translated to 8 1 1 5 for traffic going from inside to outside and then 8 1 1 5 is being

32
00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.110
translated back to 10 1 1 1 4 traffic from the outside to the inside.
