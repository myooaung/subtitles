00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:16.160
This is one of multiple videos that demonstrate troubleshooting scenarios in campus environments.

2
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:23.340
In this topology I have full switches configured switch one and switch to a course switches switch three

3
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.010
and switch for access switches.

4
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:34.050
Now to keep the topology simple I haven't got cross connects configured here or additional access switches

5
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:42.300
in my CCN a course I show you a larger topology but for this troubleshooting video we'll keep it simple.

6
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:50.100
We've been told that P.S. 1 in this network is not able to ping P.C. to in this topology I'm using routers

7
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.380
to simulate pieces.

8
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.530
So let's test that can write a 1 or P.S. 1 ping 10 1 3 2

9
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.940
so it looks like the pings of failing P.S. 1 is in VLAN 2.

10
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:20.160
And P.S. 2 isn't v land 3 show IP round writing is disabled on this rider but it does have a default

11
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:29.770
gateway of tendered 1 to 2 2 5 4 so we should be able to ping this default gateway so ping tendered

12
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.410
1 2 2 5 4.

13
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:33.550
Yes we can.

14
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.720
Can we ping v land 3 on the default gateway yes we can.

15
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.710
So P.S. One can get to the default gateway.

16
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:52.210
What about P.C. to see he has resorted to acting as P.C. to show IP interface brief we have tendered

17
00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.950
one to treat or two configured show IP rot.

18
00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:04.380
Default gateway is tendered wandered 3 2 2 5 4 so can we ping that default gateway.

19
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.140
Looks like we can't.

20
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:14.150
So there seems to be a problem somewhere between P.S. 2 and switch 1.

21
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:26.580
Let's check on switch for connected to P.S. to so this is switch for show IP interface brief.

22
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:35.120
It's got an IP address of 10 1 1 4 paying 10 dot 1 that 1 or 2 5 4 that works.

23
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:42.500
That is the default gateway of the switch so we switch components default gateway cannot ping tendered

24
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.400
wandered 3 2 2 5 4.

25
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.910
Yes it can.

26
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:53.770
So we've established that this basic connectivity between the switch and the default gateway.

27
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.290
Let's have a look at our trunks.

28
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.520
Show interface.

29
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.160
Trunk

30
00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.170
cranking is enabled on gigabit 0 0.

31
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:12.020
That's the interface between switch for and switch to show CTP neighbors.

32
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.980
We have a relationship to switch to but we've already proven that that works by being able to ping the

33
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:28.920
default gateway v lines are allowed across the trunk now can you spot a problem already in this topology.

34
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.250
What's the problem.

35
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:40.060
Based on that single command something's wrong notice gigabit 00 is a trunk but it's only allowing v

36
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.140
lands one to 2 and four.

37
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.340
But the pieces in VLAN 3.

38
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.220
So let's have a look at the configuration of this gigabit interface.

39
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.260
This interface is configured for chunking and we're not restricting any v lines but we're only permitting

40
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.220
villains 1 to 2 and 4 cross the trunk.

41
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.000
Show interface gigabit 0 1 switch port

42
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.820
what's wrong here.

43
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:19.330
Can you spot the problem we're looking at the output of this interface on the switch what's wrong the

44
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:26.380
port has enabled it set as static access it's configured to use access veal and 3.

45
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.440
But notice this keyword something's wrong.

46
00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.730
Show run interface gigabit.

47
00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.180
0 1.

48
00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:42.780
So the port is correctly configured to be in veal and 3 but show veal and brief will show us that there

49
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.210
is a problem.

50
00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.630
Can you see the issue.

51
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.050
Where is the veal and three so be careful.

52
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:58.520
You can have a port configured in a V land and not have that villain in the veal and database.

53
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.270
If that's true the port is essentially error disabled.

54
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.100
It won't work.

55
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:09.060
No traffic is gonna be sent through that port because it belongs to a rogue villain.

56
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.380
This is often the case when VTB is used.

57
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:18.580
If you delete a villain on another switch that update is propagated to other switches in the topology

58
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:25.310
VTB removes the villain from the villain database but doesn't take port out of the villain.

59
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:32.230
This port is manually configured to be part of villain 3 but villain 3 doesn't exist in the villain

60
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:41.440
database and hence the switch port command is showing us that that's an inactive villain on the port.

61
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.090
That's a problem.

62
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:54.460
So show VTB status it's configured as a server the switch so let's create villain 3 show villain brief

63
00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.970
suddenly now we see Port gigabyte 0 1 configured in villain 3.

64
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:06.120
And when we look at the switch port we see that it's in V land 3.

65
00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:07.340
That looks good.

66
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:12.070
So can write it to ping its default gateway.

67
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:18.260
We may have to wait a while for things to update but notice there the pings started succeeding.

68
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.820
Ken wrote a one now paying writer to acting as P.S. 2.

69
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:25.610
Yes it can.

70
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.570
So we've successfully result of the issue in this topology.

71
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.880
Be careful.

72
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:38.840
A port is statically configured in a VLAN but that requires the V Line in the V land database when using

73
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.110
standard v lands.

74
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:48.050
If the VLAN is not in the V land database the port is essentially in a rogue villain and is not used.

75
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:53.780
Traffic will not be sent through that port so I hope you found this video useful.
