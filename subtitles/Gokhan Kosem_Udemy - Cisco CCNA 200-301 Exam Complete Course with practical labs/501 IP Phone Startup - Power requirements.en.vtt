00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.590
Welcome back in this section I'd like to show you the Cisco IP phone start up process and by doing that

2
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:23.390
explained the infrastructure requirements for Cisco IP phones to function we need to talk about power.

3
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:31.980
The land's IP addressing configurations firmware and so forth which are all required for Cisco IP phones

4
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.000
to function before getting dhal turn on a Cisco IP phone.

5
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.090
A sequence of events has to take place and infrastructure needs to be provided for the phone to function.

6
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.030
In this section I'd like to explain phone startup in more detail.

7
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.790
I'd also like to give you more detail on skinny Cloud Control Protocol or a CCP commonly known as skinny

8
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.990
and session Initiation Protocol or SAP.

9
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.130
So this section assumes that you've been through the introductory sections and you understand what a

10
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.250
codec is.

11
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:11.420
You have an understanding of the history of voice technologies and a basic foundation to voice.

12
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:18.350
Now this is an important overview of the phone startup process and I would remember these steps before

13
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.360
troubleshooting in the real world and for study purposes.

14
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.120
I'm going to mention the process in brief now and then in the following slides we're going to dive into

15
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.080
each of these topics in a lot of detail.

16
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.630
The first thing the phone requires is power.

17
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.240
So the phone will obtain power from the switch or from will power or by using misspend power.

18
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.440
So the phone will obtain power from a switch.

19
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:49.330
For example the phone once it has obtained power will load it to a locally stored image.

20
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.210
This can cause a lot of confusion.

21
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:59.830
The phone will boot up with the image files stored locally and the configuration that it had previously.

22
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:06.100
So if a phone has a configuration already it will use that configuration when it boots up.

23
00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:13.360
The switch will then provide any information to the phone using either CTP or LDP.

24
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.890
Once again I'll discuss those in more detail in the upcoming slides.

25
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.220
Once the phone has its Villon it will require an IP address and Wolf for instance get an IP address

26
00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.220
from a DHP server.

27
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.490
DHP uses a very special option.

28
00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.020
Option one fifty two point the phone to a TFT B server.

29
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.420
The phone will then download its firmware and configuration from a TFT server.

30
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:47.470
If the locally stored image file or firmware is a different version to the version that it's meant to

31
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.630
use when connecting to a C UCM for example the phone will upgrade its firmware.

32
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.210
It will also download its configuration from the TFT server.

33
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:07.270
It will then register using either skinny or set to the C UCM and then in Skinny's case it will download

34
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.150
its offkey template.

35
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:16.000
See UCM essentially sends the soft template to the phone using skinny messages.

36
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.690
So that's an overview of the phone start a process.

37
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.550
Let's dive into the details.

38
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.320
Now once again what does a phone require to function.

39
00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.420
And the first thing is power.

40
00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.740
There are multiple ways to provide power to an IP phone.

41
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.900
The first method is to use a power cube.

42
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.920
We are local power adapter is used to provide power to the phone.

43
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.770
This would typically be used where power of the ethernet or Peary's not available I've just put the

44
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.780
pod code for one of the adapters here.

45
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.920
Please check the specifications of the individual handset so that the right power cube is ordered for

46
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.440
a specific handset.

47
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:06.630
Typically a phone is connected directly to a switch and a PC is connected to the back of the phone the

48
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.410
phone requires power to operate.

49
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.860
And this is the first method to provide power to the phone.

50
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.890
And one of the most simple methods.

51
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:22.350
However it does have multiple disadvantages if power is lost to the bolding phones will no longer be

52
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.720
able to make and receive calls.

53
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.270
So U.P.S. would be required on each individual power kid.

54
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.230
That doesn't scale well.

55
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.500
So these days this is one of the least used methods.

56
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.960
A second option would be to use a power injector where misspend power is provided to the phone.

57
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.940
This would be typically used where a switch does not support power of the Senate.

58
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:52.230
So the switch is physically connected to a power injector and the power injectors physically connected

59
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.650
to the phone with the power injector providing power to the handset.

60
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.850
So notice here on the back of the power injector there are two ports one to connect back to the switch

61
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:09.450
and one to connect to the phone the power injector would be physically powered from a wall socket.

62
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:15.000
The advantage of this method is that you do not have to upgrade switches and the power injector would

63
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.810
typically reside in a wiring closet where there may be U.P.S. power in the real world.

64
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:28.530
This is typically used when you have a single or a small number of phones connected to a switch and

65
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:34.570
it's less costly to purchase power injectors than it is to replace the entire switch.

66
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:41.440
The preferred and recommended way to provide power to the phones and other devices is to use power over

67
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:42.750
Ethernet.

68
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:51.190
Historically power everything that was used for two main applications IP telephony and $82 11 wireless

69
00:05:51.190 --> 00:06:00.950
networking IP phones like stented PBX phones require 48 volts of power switches and other devices providing

70
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:09.220
power unknown power source equipment or PC devices and the phones are known as powered devices.

71
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.130
Of Ethan is provided on 10s of 1 2 3 and 6.

72
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:20.060
So the same pins used to transmit data that is different to the mid spent power that we discussed previously

73
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.790
which uses pins 4 5 7 and 8.

74
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.950
There are three main types of power of Ethernet.

75
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:33.660
The first one is the original power over ethernet or POPC developed by Cisco many years ago.

76
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:41.330
This provided 6.3 watts of power to the phones older models of phones that you may encounter like the

77
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:48.330
79 60 and 70 940 you Ciscos P.O.D. and requies 6.3 watts of power.

78
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:55.640
The Industry Standard a two to three A-F was ratified to provide interoperability between multiple vendors

79
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.290
phones and network equipment.

80
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:06.260
So you can connect a Nortel phone to a Cisco switch or a Cisco phone to an HP switch.

81
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:13.580
They are different classes of devices and Ada 2.3 A-F IP phones fall into what is called Class 3 which

82
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.790
provides power at fifteen point four watts.

83
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.870
Since the completion and ratification of the Triple E 8 or 2.3 AEF stented the required power consumption

84
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:29.480
for these devices has begun to extend beyond the level specified in the standard.

85
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:37.310
Specifically with the introduction of triple E Ada 2.0 11 in wireless technology there is now a requirement

86
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:45.100
to provide power above the maximum of fifteen point four what's available in a row to two or three standard.

87
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:52.730
Cisco also has an extension to Ada 2.3 AAF providing up to 20 watts of power known as Perovic Ethan

88
00:07:52.730 --> 00:08:00.220
at plus three plus was developed because Cisco did not want to wait for the ratification of a two or

89
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:08.420
three eighty here plus allowed for the immediate implementation of technologies requiring power greater

90
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.290
than fifteen point four watts.

91
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:16.940
The introduction of network devices that require more than fifteen point four watts has forced the Tripoli

92
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:23.390
to develop a new P.O.D. standard that can deliver even more power than what was defined in the triple

93
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.550
E attitude or 3am standard.

94
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:34.460
The new standard ADA 2.3 A-T also known as P.O.D. Pless is designed to deliver up to 50 watts of power

95
00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:42.550
per port the two that we can concentrate on in this course our power over the net or P.O.D. an edited

96
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:51.220
or three AEF which also goes by the name we just note the names P.O.D. is often used to refer to or

97
00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:58.780
2.3 AEF that an older documentation it refers to Cisco's proprietary implementation of power of Ethernet.

98
00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:03.640
So just read carefully between the lines to know which power is actually being referenced.

99
00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:11.380
Another advantage of power of the net is that the switch can dynamically and automatically discover

100
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:18.850
whether an IP phone is plugged into a port or whether a PC or other device is plugged into that port.

101
00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:28.000
In Cisco's original implementation a fast link pulse or if old P was sent down the wire to detect whether

102
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.430
a phone was connected or not.

103
00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:37.480
So the switch would send an LP down the wire and in its unpowered state the phone would a loop back

104
00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:44.100
if LP to the switch if LPs are normally used for speed and duplex negotiation.

105
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:50.020
So the switch wouldn't normally expect to see its own if LP return to it.

106
00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:52.880
But in this case the phone does.

107
00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:59.260
And the switch therefore knows that an IP phone is connected to it and can provide power down to the

108
00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.250
handset.

109
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:06.770
The Industry Standard editor for three AAF uses a different method to detect the presence of an IP phone

110
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:15.930
ineptitude or three if the power sourcing equipment or switch in this case applies a small current limited

111
00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:17.640
voltage to the cable.

112
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:21.140
So a DC voltage is applied to the cable.

113
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:27.360
We obviously want to make sure that no damage is possible to the equipment that may be present in an

114
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.590
Ethernet system.

115
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:35.360
So the switches are going to look for a device that complies with the ADA 2.3 specification and thus

116
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:43.650
applies a DC voltage between the transmit and receive payes on the Senate cable and then measures the

117
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:54.600
received current in amps or voltage received the switch expects to receive a 25 K ohm resistance between

118
00:10:54.600 --> 00:11:00.630
the pays for the device attached to be considered a valid powered device.

119
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:07.320
In other words the switch is looking for this resistance from the phone or other type of device to ensure

120
00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.900
that it's a valid powered device.

121
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:16.930
If the switch or PC does not detect a valid resistance power is not applied to the port.

122
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:24.810
But if a power device is discovered power is applied and optionally a power device specification can

123
00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:25.760
be done.

124
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:34.200
The PC can then detect what a cold a two or three AEF Klaus's by default Siska switches the phones or

125
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.980
other power devices to close to zero.

126
00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:46.270
Not edited or 3:8 we have Klaas's 0 1 2 and 3 Clauss 0 has a maximum power of fifteen point four watts

127
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:50.520
which is the default clause allocated to a powered device.

128
00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:54.730
The switch in the phone can negotiate the amount of power required.

129
00:11:55.030 --> 00:12:05.810
So for example a 79 41 with 79 61 phone is deemed to be a class 2 device and through CD can negotiate

130
00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:15.260
down to 6.3 watts of power a 79 65 for example is deemed to be a Class 3 device that's using 15 point

131
00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.380
four watts of maximum power.

132
00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:26.280
But through CTP can negotiate down to only use 12 watts of power a 79 71 also a class 3 device will

133
00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:30.110
negotiate down to fourteen point nine watts of power.

134
00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:35.360
Now the amount of power required by different phone varies firstly on the phone model as you can see

135
00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.420
in this example.

136
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:43.400
And also the state of the phone as an example is seventy nine seventy one phone in the idle state only

137
00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:50.200
requires nine point one seven watts of power and the maximum power consumption of twelve point to eight

138
00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:57.580
watts phone model and features and use of preferences can increase the power consumption on a phone.

139
00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:05.050
For instance if it's a color screen versus grayscale the gigabit ethernet line speed the ring and speakerphone

140
00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:12.110
volume and the illuminated keys such as message waiting light and line buttons for this course you don't

141
00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:16.850
need to know the amount of detail but I just want you to be away in the real world.

142
00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:23.690
Different phones require different amounts of power and they need to be careful when specifying your

143
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:25.980
switches in a real world environment.

144
00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:35.290
Now certain phones in the 80 900 series and ninety nine hundred series are deemed to be close for a

145
00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.630
two or three if devices.

146
00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:44.800
In other words they're 8:0 to 380 devices in certain cases that require more power especially with the

147
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.560
use of external add on devices like a video camera.

148
00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:54.520
Now the power requirements for individual handsets very we're not going to go through a comprehensive

149
00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.250
list.

150
00:13:55.270 --> 00:14:01.420
I've mentioned some examples already please refer to the data sheets and other information for details

151
00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:08.530
of the power requirements what individual phones and individual power over ethernet devices such as

152
00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:09.630
access points.

153
00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:15.790
However Glassford for devices may require more than fifteen point four watts of power.

154
00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.400
For example a.

155
00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:26.730
Aaron it trol 50 series access point requires eighteen point five watts of power thus exceeding the

156
00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.670
