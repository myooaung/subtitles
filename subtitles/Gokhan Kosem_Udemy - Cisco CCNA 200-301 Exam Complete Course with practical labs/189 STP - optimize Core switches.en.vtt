1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So once again on switch 1, sh spanning-tree VLAN 1

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
shows us that these ports are blocking

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
1, 2 and 3 are blocking for VLAN 1

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
same for VLAN 10, 1, 2 and 3 are blocking.

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So what we will do now is go to global config mode

6
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and type spanning-tree

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
because this is per-VLAN Spanning Tree I can do this on a per-VLAN basis.

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So I’m gonna specify VLAN 10

9
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and I’m gonna change the priority of the switch to 0.

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So previously notice in the bridge ID

11
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
the switch priority was 32778

12
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
in other words the default priority + the VLAN number of 10.

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
do sh spanning-tree VLAN 10

14
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
now shows me that the priority of the switch is 10

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
in other words priority 0 + VLAN number gives me a priority of 10

16
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and this switch is now the root of VLAN 10.

17
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The ports are going through different states at the moment

18
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
so we're at learning state and now the ports are forwarding

19
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
now we need to do a lot of Spanning Tree optimization here

20
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
the first thing we’ve done is made this switch the root for VLAN 10

21
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
but we also want to change the port type to allow Rapid Spanning Tree

22
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
to converge a lot quicker than it's converging at the moment.

23
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
We want to make this point-to-point links in Spanning Tree

24
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and we'll get to that in a moment

25
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
but for now, what we’ve done is made this switch the root for VLAN 10

26
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and let’s do the same for VLAN 1

27
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
so sh spanning-tree vlan 1

28
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
we can see that these ports are currently blocking

29
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
but after a period of time, they should go to learning and there you go

30
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
so they go to blocking, listening and then learning

31
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and now they go to forwarding

32
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
so the ports are now forwarding on the switch

33
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
so this is better than what we had previously.

34
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000
The switch priority is 1 because we set the priority to 0 + the VLAN number of 1

35
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
this switch is the root switch.

36
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
So we’ve made this switch the root for VLAN 1 and VLAN 10

37
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
we want to make the switch 2 the root now for VLAN 20.

38
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:39.000
So on switch 2, conf t spanning-tree vlan 20 priority 0

39
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
sh spanning-tree vlan 20

40
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
switch priority is now 20 in other words 0 + the VLAN number

41
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
switch is the root, the switch is forwarding in all ports

42
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
the switch was the root previously for VLAN 20

43
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
so hence the port stayed as forwarding

44
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
because the switch was the root but notice now for VLAN 1

45
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:12.000
the switch is forwarding on all ports but blocking on gigabit 0/1.

46
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Back on switch 1, let’s look at the Spanning Tree for VLAN 20

47
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.000
this is still not good because the switch is still blocking port 3, 2 and 1.

48
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
so to optimize this

49
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
we want to make this switch the backup root switch for VLAN 20

50
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
and to do that we're going to type spanning-tree vlan 20 priority

51
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and I can't enter a priority of 1 because it must be in multiple of 4096

52
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
so the next lowest priority that I can use is 4096.

53
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000
So do sh spanning-tree vlan 20 now

54
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
shows me that this ports 2 and 3 are designated ports

55
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
where’s previously they were alternate ports.

56
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
After period of time, we should see the ports go forwarding

57
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
so they're currently learning, still learning while we waiting for that

58
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
notice gigabit 0/1 is still an alternate port

59
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
and is blocking because we have 2 ports to the same root switch.

60
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
But now notice 0/0 is forwarding its root port

61
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
these 2 ports are forwarding, so 2 and 3 are forwarding

62
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
as they are now designated ports.

63
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
This is better than what we had before.

64
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
so sh run | include span

65
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
this command were enabled by default

66
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000
but what we’ve done now is make the switch the root bridge for VLANs 1 and 10

67
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and the backup root for VLAN 20

68
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:58.000
on switch 2 we need to make this switch the backup root bridge for VLAN 10

69
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and VLAN 1, so set the priority for VLAN 10 to 4096

70
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
and do the same for VLAN 1

71
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
sh run | include spanning-tree

72
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
so this 2 once again with default commands

73
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000
we’ve made switch 2 the backup root switch for VLANs 1 and 110

74
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and the root for VLAN 20.

75
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
So in our topology, this switch is the root for VLANs 1 and 10

76
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and this switch is the root for VLAN 20

77
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
they are both back up roots for each other

78
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.000
in other words, these ports are forwarding on both the switches.

79
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
The only port that’s blocking is this port on both the core switches

80
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and we're going to improve that in a moment by running EtherChannel

81
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
but once again sh spanning-tree vlan 10

82
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
for VLAN 10 all ports are forwarding

83
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
for VLAN 20 all ports are forwarding

84
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
except for this link between the 2 core switches.

85
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And for VLAN 1 all ports are forwarding because this is the root bridge.

86
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Something similar can be seen on switch 2

87
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
sh spanning-tree vlan 10

88
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
alternate port is this one here

89
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
0/1 same can be seen for VLAN 1

90
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
this port is the alternate port.

91
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
But for VLAN 20, all ports are forwarding.

92
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
So we’ve improved the Spanning Tree

93
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
by making this switch the root for some VLANs

94
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
and this switch the root for other VLANs

95
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Let’s have a look at the access switches.

96
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:47.000
On access switch 3, show run | include span

97
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
the default Spanning Tree configuration has been done

98
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
we haven't done anything additionally here.

99
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
So let’s have look at VLAN 10

100
00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
the root port for VLAN 10 is this port gigabit 0/0

101
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
the alternate port which is blocking is 0/1

102
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
but for VLAN 20 notice that’s been flip around

103
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
this is the root port for VLAN 20

104
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
and this is the alternate port for VLAN 20

105
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
so blocking for VLAN 20, this port is blocking for VLAN 10.

106
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
So if you have IP phones and PCs connected this switch

107
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
the result is that VLAN 10 traffic

108
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
let’s assume that your PCs will use this uplink

109
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
and VLAN 20 which is your phones would use this uplink

110
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
the same is going to be true for this switch.

111
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
VLAN 20 traffic is going to use this uplink

112
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
and VLAN 10 traffic is going to use this uplink.

113
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:53.000
So switch 4 sh spanning-tree vlan 10

114
00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:03.000
root port is gigabit 0/1, 20, root port is gigabit 0/0

115
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
so we have once again been able to implement load sharing of traffic

116
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
in the uplinks on this switch as well as this switch.

117
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
So Spanning Tree is a lot better now than what it was previously.

118
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
So what’s the recommendation?

119
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.000
make sure that you configure your core switches as the root switches

120
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:32.000
now we can use a command such as sh spanning-tree root on switch 1

121
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
to see which ports are root ports.

122
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
now there are no root ports on the switch for VLANs 1 and 10

123
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
because the switch is the root switch

124
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
but notice for VLAN 20 the root port is gigabit 0/0

125
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
and the cost to get to the root is 4, this gigabit link has a cost of 4.

126
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000
On switch 2 sh spanning-tree root

127
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:05.000
notice for VLAN 1 and 10 its root port is 0/0 with the cost of 4

128
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
there is no root port for VLAN 20

129
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
the root cost is 0 because the switch is the root switch.

130
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
something similar could be seen on our access switches

131
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
so sh spanning-tree root on switch 3

132
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:27.000
the switch over here has gigabit 0/0 as the root port for VLAN 1 and VLAN 10

133
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
gigabit 0/1, this port is the root port for VLAN 20

134
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
and lastly, on switch 4 something similar can be seen sh span root

135
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.000
root ports for 1 and 10 are gigabit 0/1 over here

136
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
root port for VLAN 20 is this port.

137
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000
We’ve optimized Spanning Tree now a lot better that it was a moment to go.

138
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
However, we still have a blocking port here

139
00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
so we want to optimize that by creating a link aggregation of these 2 ports

140
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
and will do that in the next video.
