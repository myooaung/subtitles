00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.390
The reason why we see up traffic rather than I see impede traffic.

2
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.120
He's on Ethernet before two devices can communicate.

3
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.070
They need to use up to discover one another's MAC addresses.

4
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:20.410
So before ICMP traffic can even be sent right to acting as PC needs to send an op to discover Rodda

5
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:21.990
force MAC address.

6
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.380
But it never discovers that because the traffic never reaches route before so it never receives an opera

7
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:37.730
apply and therefore cannot send ICMP traffic switch to interface range.

8
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:53.100
Kickabout 0 2 2 3 switch port trunk and kept solution topped one key switch port mode trunk switch port

9
00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:02.850
No negotiate at the moment interface gigabit 0 to on switch to is shut down.

10
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:10.290
I'll just do the same here to prove the point we are forcing the traffic basically to go via the hub

11
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.880
so that we can do a wide shot capture and see traffic on the network.

12
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.530
So now let's start another one shot capture

13
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:29.460
Ken wrote to ping Rato for now noticed the pings succeeds.

14
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.600
If we look at our traffic we can see the OP topless we shall capture for the moment.

15
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.810
That's the broadcast asking for MAC address associated with IP address 10 1 to 4.

16
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.240
As you can see it's a broadcast sent from router to.

17
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.080
It's an edit to the one cue frame.

18
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.490
So in the Added to that one key portion once again we can see that the villain is too.

19
00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:03.110
There is the OP's request looking for the MAC address associated with IP address 10 1 to 4.

20
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.870
Here's the reply.

21
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:13.930
What you'll also notice is the villain ID he's too so it's coming back as a tagged frame from 10 1 to

22
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.990
4 to 10 1 to 2.

23
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.980
So there's the OP reply.

24
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.580
It's not a broadcast because it knows the MAC address of router to a ready so it goes directly to the

25
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:33.770
MAC address of router 2 and then if we scroll down a bit further we can see the ICMP echo messages.

26
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.840
So he has an echo from 10 1 to 2 to 10 1 to 4.

27
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.470
Once again notice the villain ideas too.

28
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.500
He has the reply from 10 1 to 4 so it's an echo reply to 10 1 to 2.

29
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:57.560
A villain ID is 2 so those frames are being tagged between the two devices.

30
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.240
Let's stop that capture and started again in jenius 3.

31
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:11.160
Now what about traffic from Rotto 1 2 rodders 3 that's using the land one which is the untagged villaine

32
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.930
Serrato one.

33
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:20.000
Pinging router 3 pings succeeds router to pinging wrote a four ping succeeds.

34
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.970
I'll just full for ICMP.

35
00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.860
So there's the ICMP message from Rodda one to three.

36
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.130
Notice it's a standard Ethernet frame.

37
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.320
The ether type is IP version 4.

38
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:37.330
There is no editor one Q tagging on the echo or the Ecca reply.

39
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.130
It's stented Ethan at frame's because that's the native land scrolling down.

40
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.140
However his route to pinging Rotto for.

41
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.660
And notice once again there is the tag.

42
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:57.860
So let's put router 1 and router 3 into Vilain 10 and see how that affects the tagging of traffic.

43
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:06.140
Switch one violent 10 interface gigabit 00 switch port access.

44
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:19.170
If we land 10 do something similar on switch to the land 10 interface kickabout 0 0 switch port access

45
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.390
the land 10.

46
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.410
So now when rodded one pings Rajshree what happens.

47
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.980
Now it might take a while because spending needs to converge

48
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.720
so can switch one shows spending tree

49
00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.390
for violent 10 ports no forwarding.

50
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.830
So let's do the ping again.

51
00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.870
Notice the ping now succeeds and you know was shock capture.

52
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:51.980
Scroll right down.

53
00:04:52.130 --> 00:05:00.740
What we should see now is the villaine number as an example is a violent 10.

54
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:10.130
So IDs 10 can see the hexadecimal there's the decimal set it to in the Ethernet frame noticed that type

55
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:18.070
is a sort of one key in edit to the one cue the type is IP version 4 indicating that provision for is

56
00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.960
used at least three is the ping.

57
00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:22.620
Here's the reply.

58
00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.450
But notice once again the villain number is the last 10.

59
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:38.060
If I change this violent to villaine 11 as an example with the pings succeed so Villani 11 rather interface

60
00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:45.860
Keiga but zero zero switch port access the line 11 made the mistake of putting interface Villani 11.

61
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.500
I should have said simply Villani Levan to create the villain.

62
00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.910
But in this case the switch to create the villain for me need to be careful with that because some switches

63
00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.920
won't do that for you but you can see Villani Levan has been created.

64
00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.860
Gigabit 0 is in Villani 11.

65
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:09.860
So this part is in Villani 11 as portals and violent 10 can write a one ping rodder three and you can

66
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:17.720
see at the moment it can't you know why shock capture Rodda one still has a cached MAC address for rodder

67
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.640
3.

68
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.680
So it's sending ICMP traffic.

69
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:29.390
But notice it's tagged with Villani 11 and no reply is received back because the traffic never gets

70
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.420
to rodders 3.

71
00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:36.190
This port has in Villon 10 this port is in Villani 11.

72
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.040
So the traffic never reaches the port.

73
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.010
You can see that once again by doing a capture

74
00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.120
helping wrote is free from Route One.

75
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:56.080
And what you'll notice in the output here is there is no up and no ICMP traffic received on this port

76
00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:56.910
at all.

77
00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:05.870
Even though we're not a one is pinging router three on the capture between the switches we can see the

78
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:14.890
ICMP traffic with the line 11 but the switch when it receives traffic on line 11 he's not going to force

79
00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.750
it out of this port or this port.

80
00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:20.050
So essentially goes nowhere.

81
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:25.000
It's going to be dropped by the switch because there are no access ports in Villani Lavonne.

82
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:33.590
So the traffic never hits rodded three but on switch to if we created Villani Leben and then went on

83
00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:42.100
to the port and put it into the line 11 what we see now is that the pings do succeed.

84
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.640
Once again it may take a while.

85
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:51.930
Spending three to converge can see the pings arriving noticed nine one three is the sequence number

86
00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:56.220
pings are arriving at switch to

87
00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.260
but we may need to just wait a while for spending three to converge.

88
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:04.220
And there you go.

89
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:13.200
She just converged so we can see the ping from Route One to rotas 3 using Villani 11.

90
00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:21.740
And there's a reply on Villani 11 so physically this typology looks as follows.

91
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:24.050
Just ignore the hub for the moment.

92
00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:26.180
So pretend that the hub is not there.

93
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:32.300
Physically We've got two PCs connected to switch one and two PCs connected to switch two.

94
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:39.020
But logically rather one acting as PC one and router three acting as PCs three are connected to each

95
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.000
other and two and four connected to each other.

96
00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:49.280
They are totally separated from each other and won't be able to ping each other unless we enable interval

97
00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:57.310
and routing on one of the switches and configure default gateways on the PCs to talk to each other via

98
00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:58.510
their default gateway.
