00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:08.490
So what I'm going to try and do here is try and remove some of the hype and turns causing confusion

2
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:15.780
and kind of group visions of software defined networking into different compartments.

3
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.720
So the first vision and the original vision will define as open SDM.

4
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.940
This is based on the original work at Stanford and uses the open flow protocol.

5
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.570
The organization that's driving this today is the open networking Foundation.

6
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:38.600
It defines software defined networking as the separation of the control plane and data plane and later

7
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:45.870
in this presentation I'll explain what that actually means implementations of software defined networking

8
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:53.520
controllers include open daylight or audio on us NOx pox floodlight and others including commercial

9
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.840
controllers from the likes of HP and others.

10
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:04.680
I'm creating multiple courses to explain each of these visions or examples of software defined networking.

11
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:12.900
So have a look on the genius 3 Web site for more courses where I do deep dives into the details and

12
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:21.000
nitty gritty of each of these visions of SDM in the next vision is software defined networking via overlays.

13
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.640
And the most famous example of this is probably NSX from VM way.

14
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:33.910
As you can see in this video Martin Casado works at VM way his company knows Sera was purchased by VM

15
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:41.100
way a few years ago for over a billion dollars and VM we're now advocates a virtual network overlaid

16
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.670
a cross a physical network.

17
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.040
We have the concept of a underlay network which are the physical network devices and we have a virtual

18
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.920
network that can automatically be deployed across the physical network.

19
00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.210
This uses protocols like V X LAN and envy jury.

20
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:07.260
Another example of this is New Age networks which have a product for very high scale multi datacenter

21
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:15.120
multi hypervisor Virtual Networks a third vision or definition of software defined networking is what's

22
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.030
called Bright boxes or white boxes.

23
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:26.820
So white box SDM examples of companies that are involved here include picker 8 and Cumulus networks.

24
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:33.240
Why run proprietary operating systems tied to proprietary hardware.

25
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.400
Why not run an operating system that can be installed on multiple vendor devices.

26
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.600
So in this example you could have a physical switch and today as an example you may want to run one

27
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.550
operating system but next week you may want to replace it with a different operating system.

28
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.220
And that's what these vendors allow you to do.

29
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.940
Don't buy proprietary hardware proprietary operating systems and proprietary features rather by switches

30
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.910
that are not tied to a specific vendor.

31
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.340
Another example that kind of fits in this is the facebook open compute switches such as Six Pack and

32
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.850
wedge.
