00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.150
Here's a quick summary of the different types of spending tree and the advantages and disadvantages

2
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.220
of each.

3
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.760
So the original version of spending trees the triple e ed. that one D spending tree.

4
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:19.840
This is the legacy stented on spending tree that was used when bridges were around.

5
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:25.040
So it's very old but it's the basis of other versions of spanning tree.

6
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.950
You'll also see the term cease tea or common spanning tree.

7
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.530
This assumes that there is one spending tree instance for the entire bridged network regardless of the

8
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.840
number of lines.

9
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.750
We don't use that today in Cisco environments.

10
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:48.610
We use a version of Poovey line spending tree or previous t originally Peavey's t only supported SL

11
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.720
previously plus supports ISO and added to that one.

12
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.890
Q But today we often referred to previous D-plus as previous t.

13
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.880
So this is a Cisco enhancement a spending tree that provides a separate Ada to that one D spending tree

14
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.220
instance for every plan.

15
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:13.810
If you had a 100 villans you would end up having a hundred instances of spanning tree each spanning

16
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:20.920
tree would have its own route and would do its own calculations in Cisco environments each spending

17
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.300
tree would seem its own PPD use or bridge protocol data units.

18
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:33.460
So if you had a hundred villans every two seconds a hundred BPT use or sent multiple spending tree tries

19
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:40.630
to optimize previous t by mapping multiple villans to the same spending tree instance.

20
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.920
So to that one s or multiple spending tree allows you for example to have two spending tree instances

21
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.240
and then split your villans between those instances.

22
00:01:52.360 --> 00:02:00.630
Villines one to one hundred could be associated with instance one villans one or one to two hundred

23
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:08.350
could be associated with instance to but provides a lot of advantages in that you have two instances

24
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:16.240
of spending tree rather than two hundred which you would have if you used Peavey's t multiple spreading

25
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.000
tree also has rapid spending tree built into it.

26
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:27.250
So it converges very quickly rapid spending three or eight to get one w improves convergence over the

27
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:34.740
1998 version of spanning tree by adding Rolf's to ports and enhancing BPT exchanges.

28
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:42.550
It To provide for much quicker convergence when compared to traditional spending tree Rapide spending

29
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.480
tree however only supports a single instance of spanning tree.

30
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:55.210
So all the lands are mapped to that single instance and this is why we have a rapid previous t plus

31
00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:02.560
on Siska switches that allows us to have a 1 spending tree instance pervy LAN but have Reppert convergence

32
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.830
now multiple spending tree has the advantage that you can map multiple villains to a single instance

33
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.210
of spanning tree.

34
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.350
That however only becomes important when you have many villans.

35
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.580
If for example you only have 10 villans in your enterprise Reppert previous t plus works really well

36
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.310
and hence it's the default spending tree on Cisco switches.

37
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:33.740
You would only necessarily need to use multiple spanning tree if you had hundreds or thousands of lines.

38
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:41.410
So the default today on most Cisco switches is rapid PVC plus provides rapid convergence and allows

39
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:48.660
you to configure one spending tree instance pavilion to optimize performance in the videos and this

40
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:56.530
course I'll show you a campus network where we optimize spending tree by splitting the load tween different

41
00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:57.780
switches.

42
00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.250
In other words one switch will be the spending tree root for some villans and another switch will be

43
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.530
the spanning tree route for other villains.
