00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:09.060
Now on a rod or a switch you can match traffic by matching a DCP Valley so you could match E F as an

2
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.570
example and then do something with the traffic.

3
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:22.000
See here's my genius three Radha and I can go to global configuration mode and use the command class

4
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.080
map and I can either do a match all or a match any match all means all the statements have to be true

5
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:36.580
when matching match any means any one of them need to be true and as per this example we could match

6
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:43.990
VoIP or whatever name we decide and then we can say match and notice you can match on many values but

7
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:54.250
as an example we could match IP DCP DSP values are in the range 0 to 63 there are eight binary bets

8
00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.470
so two to the power of eight is 64 in the range 0 to 63.

9
00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.670
Here are the well known values.

10
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:10.750
Notice a f in eleven so a f one one or a few eleven a if one.

11
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:17.480
So notice a f one two here's a 41.

12
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.130
So a f for one.

13
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:29.510
Here are the class selected values so as an example CLOs select to three notice those binary buts equate

14
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.770
to three.

15
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:40.740
And here we have expedited forwarding notice what the binary is set to so if we set that to F and then

16
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:50.870
do a show run notice it shows up as that in the running config but we could also use the command match

17
00:01:50.960 --> 00:02:01.380
IP DCP 46 because 46 is the same as E F Is it a tomorrow or is it a tomato.

18
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.880
It's the same thing.
