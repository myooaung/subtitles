00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.940
When a violation occurs at the moment we've configured the ports to shut down.

2
00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:15.000
So Shope port security shows us that the security action when there's a violation is to shut the port

3
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.650
down.

4
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:25.890
So as an example if we change the MAC address of the first router to some other valley it's safe for

5
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.910
an error or disable message is displayed.

6
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.300
And the port is put into a disabled state and that was caused by the MAC address being the lint on the

7
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.000
port.

8
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.000
So now shoyu interface status shows us

9
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.850
that the porters are disabled.

10
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:58.780
The problem here is that you would have to manually re-enable that port which causes a large administrative

11
00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.860
overhead.

12
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.290
So rather than doing that you can go into a global configuration mode on the switch and use the error

13
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:13.080
disable recovery command to specify a cause and a recovery value.

14
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.840
So there are multiple causes here but the one that we're looking for is the one port security violation

15
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:29.330
and then we could say would disable recovery interval and specify an interval for recovery.

16
00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:42.100
So I'll go into gigabit 00 shut the port down and then no shut it will send some traffic from this to

17
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.620
on port one to the other Rodda.

18
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.050
And what we should see is that an error disable message takes place.

19
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.830
When a security violation occurs

20
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.280
let's confirm or can fake

21
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.520
the moment.

22
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.280
Traffic is failing and now we get a disable violation taking place.

23
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.580
Support has gone down.

24
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:21.230
But what I'll do know is configure the MAC address to what it should be and then I'll do a continuous

25
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.310
ping and hopefully off for a while.

26
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.710
That should start succeeding.

27
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.910
So notice the porters not come up again after 30 seconds.

28
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:41.540
Pings are still failing but have to wait for spinning tree and other protocols to converge.

29
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.160
And again I'm impatient to speed up the video see that you don't have to wait for the entire process

30
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.050
to take place.

31
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:53.990
But there you go.

32
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.020
Notice the pings started succeeding scrolling up.

33
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:05.620
We had an error disable message because there was a port security violation caused by this MAC address

34
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.720
port went down.

35
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.780
But then there was an error recovery where the switch attempted to recover from the port security violation

36
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.070
error disable on gigabit 00 and the port came up.

37
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:28.380
So it succeeded but if I changed the MAC address again

38
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.260
era cauce port violation

39
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.560
set it back to what it should be.

40
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:48.090
While we waiting for it to recover show port security at the moment a security violation has occurred

41
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.710
on gigabit 00

42
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.500
we can see the last MAC address learnt because of the security violation.

43
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:05.040
The port is shut down at the moment but now the port was shut down.

44
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.680
When I showed the output but now it's recovering.

45
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.610
So if I do the command again I can see it as an example that the port has gone up.

46
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.230
So do the command again.

47
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.060
We can see the port has come up again.

48
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.150
There's no security violation on this port

49
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.440
so that's a nice way to recover from a shutdown through port security.

50
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:40.510
You sticky in this example to configure MAC addresses and we can do an automatic recovery by using the

51
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:47.620
disable global configuration Command saying recovery causes port security violation and it's going to

52
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.620
take 30 seconds before it tries to recover.

53
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:57.340
You could obviously set that to a larger number but as an example if a use by mistake connected the

54
00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:03.860
wrong device to the port the traffic would be blocked and a log message would be generated.

55
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.980
But if they then connected the right device to the port you wouldn't have to telnet to the switch as

56
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.750
an example and re-enabled port it would automatically be enabled.
