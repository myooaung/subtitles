00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.720
OK so let's see if we can practically answer these questions.

2
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:31.420
To do that I'm going to use simulation mode in packet tracer and I'm going to change the filters to

3
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.160
only show up and ICMP messages.

4
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:44.170
I don't want to see all the other traffic types in the network so let's see what happens when P.S. pings.

5
00:00:44.170 --> 00:01:02.420
P.S. For P.S. One has an IP address of 10 1 1 1 P.S. For has an IP address of 10 1 1 4 so we're going

6
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.700
to send ICMP traffic.

7
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.960
In other words pink traffic

8
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:16.150
from P.S. 1 2 P.S. For and then we're going to observe what happens now in this example.

9
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.890
I'll only send two packets.

10
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:28.410
In other words two pings notice what happens in the network there's ICMP traffic but there is also an

11
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.520
op frame that's generated.

12
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.110
P.S. One needs to learn and the MAC address of P.S. 4.

13
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:47.820
So it sends out an op which is a broadcast requesting of the target MAC address of P.C. for So in answer

14
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.320
to our first question what type of packet is sent.

15
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:58.250
Initially the answer is A OPP packet which is a broadcast packet.

16
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.280
We've proven that by running simulation mode in Packet Tracer.

17
00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:16.510
Now this is a broadcast and in this network the devices are connected to a hub so the traffic should

18
00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:25.670
be flooded to all the devices in the network except the device that sent the packet.

19
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.500
So who receives the packet.

20
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.510
P.S. to dance.

21
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:41.380
P.S. 3 does and so does P.S. For P.S. 2 and P.S. 3 will drop the packets because the packet is not for

22
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:52.830
the IP address P.S. 2 as an example is configured with IP address 10 1 1 2 SPC 2 is going to drop the

23
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:53.660
packet.

24
00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:04.010
The OP request is for IP address 10 1 1 4 so both P2 and P3.

25
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:14.360
Drop the packet but P.S. 4 will accept the packet and what it should do now is send back an OP a reply.

26
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:27.400
So if we look at this packet notice the inbound packet to the hub is an op reply packet with the MAC

27
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.020
address of P.S. 4 this is P.C. false IP address.

28
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.090
This is its MAC address.

29
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:46.170
We can verify that by using the IP config command and I should say IP config slash all notice the MAC

30
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:55.650
address which is the source MAC address of the frame and that's the source MAC address we see over here.

31
00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.120
So the next question is who receives the return traffic.

32
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:11.180
So if I click capture forward notice P.S. 1 P.S. 3 and P.S. to receive the return traffic so it BPC

33
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.300
1 P.S. to NPC 3.

34
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:23.740
P.S. 2 and P.S. 3 will drop the OP reply because it's not destined to them when we look at that packet

35
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:33.320
we can see that the destination MAC address is P.S. 1 and we can confirm that by looking at the config

36
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:44.420
of P.S. 1 Notice the MAC address is thus so P.C. 2 and P.S. 3 will drop the OP.

37
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:53.840
Reply We then asked when ping traffic is sent from P.S. 1 TPC for who receives the traffic.

38
00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.280
Now it's a hub so the traffic will be flooded.

39
00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:10.320
So here's the ICMP message we can see that it's an Ethernet to frame using IP for at least three and

40
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:16.440
we can see it's an ICMP packet and when we click capture forward notice.

41
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:29.850
P.S. to P3 and P4 receive the traffic but again P.S. To and P.S. 3 will drop out of the packet because

42
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:40.670
it's not destined to them when we look at the inbound PD Yoo or protocol data unit on PCI for we can

43
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:47.880
see that the destination IP address is PCI 4 and the destination MAC address is.

44
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:58.270
P.S. 4 we can verify that once again by using the IP config slash all command and we can see the MAC

45
00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.170
address of.

46
00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:02.950
P.S. For so that's going to continue now.

47
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:03.980
When.

48
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.320
P.S. For replies TPC won.

49
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:15.660
The traffic is flooded and this is the problem with the hub even though the conversation is between

50
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:23.480
P.S. 1 and P.S. for everyone in the network receives the traffic.
