00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.080
In this video we're going to look at the Cisco layaways software.

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:11.150
It doesn't help to just talk about the Cisco IOS you need to know how you connect to a Cisco router.

3
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.160
So how do you physically cable your connection to the Cisco router.

4
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.080
Boot the router up and then look at various options.

5
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.920
The Cisco Iowas software is the operating system that you'll find on a lot of Cisco routers and switches.

6
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.840
Cisco does have other operating systems such as the nexus operating system.

7
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.210
You'll learn about Nexus and other operating systems used on Cisco firewalls in other courses.

8
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:45.600
The CCMA rotting and switching course focuses on the Cisco IOS which is a feature rich network operating

9
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.700
system just like a PC.

10
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:54.300
Cisco switches on rodders required operating systems and the Cisco Iowas software provides the network

11
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.870
intelligence to meet two days demanding network requirements.

12
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.610
So we'll talk about the Cisco Aiwass in this set of videos and we'll look at some of the basic Ioway

13
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:12.300
command line interface functions and operations all Seelye functions and operations.

14
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.590
We'll also look at how to navigate to the Cisco Iowas CLIA configuration modes such as user mode privilege

15
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.540
mode global configuration mode interface mode and others.

16
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:32.460
It is a fundamental skill of a Siska network engineer to know the modes because only certain commands

17
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.760
are excepted and valid in specific Iowa modes as an example.

18
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:47.220
You can only use the host name command in global configuration mode and not in user mode.

19
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.840
One of the stumbling blocks for new network engineers is that they type a valid command but they type

20
00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.770
it in the wrong mode and hence the Cisco Rato switch rejects the command which causes confusion.

21
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.100
Make sure you're configuring a valid command in the correct mode.

22
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.460
We'll look at how to use the embedded help options as a type.

23
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.880
Question mark is your friend.

24
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.300
When in doubt use.

25
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.560
Question mark.

26
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.130
The Cisco IOS also supports command completion.

27
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.880
So use tab to complete commands when necessary to save you making typing mistakes and to check that

28
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.490
your commands are valid.

29
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.530
We'll also look at how to manage configurations and how to use additional Iowas features that will help

30
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.100
improve the user experience in the Seelye as an example.

31
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.060
Logging synchronous is a good command to enable on your Cisco devices.

32
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:52.160
It can save you a lot of frustration the Cisco Aiwa software is the most common metric operating system

33
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.490
in the real world.

34
00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:00.800
Cisco are the market leaders in networking and this Cisco Ioway is the software that powers most Cisco

35
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.960
Raud isn't switches that you'll find in the field today.

36
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.550
So like a computer a switch or router cannot function without some type of operating system.

37
00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:19.310
As mentioned Cisco have multiple operating systems such as the nexus OS and others but the one that

38
00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.070
we are going to concentrate on in this course is the Cisco IOS.

39
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:29.000
Without an operating system a router or switch cannot function when the rot or switch boots up it needs

40
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.780
to boot up the operating system and I'll demonstrate a router booting up and loading the Cisco operating

41
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.020
system in a moment.

42
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:43.430
So the Cisco Iowas software is the system operating system that you'll find in a lot of routers and

43
00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.030
switches and it's the most common type that you probably going to find in most environments.

44
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:56.080
It's important to realize that it powers both small and large devices as well as switches and routers.

45
00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:02.860
So in other words if you know the Cisco Aiwass and all you've configured is a small router.

46
00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:10.190
It's not that difficult to move to larger devices or larger rods or different types of devices like

47
00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.710
large switches.

48
00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:19.000
The Cisco Iowa software exists across multiple products of varying sizes in the really old days.

49
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:25.250
Some Cisco switches support a catus or catalyst operating system and that was confusing because you

50
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.230
had to know both the Cisco IOS and the catalyst operating system.

51
00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.760
That's fortunately not true today today you would need to learn the Cisco Ioway.

52
00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:41.270
And you may encounter a different operating system such as the nexus OS or operating system running

53
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.340
on firewalls.

54
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.660
But the principles are the same.

55
00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.760
It's not that difficult to move from one Cisco device to another because the interfaces will be familiar

56
00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:51.490
to you.

57
00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:59.180
Once you learn the Cisco IOS before it's worth your time and effort to learn how the Cisco Iowas works.

58
00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.470
Other vendors like HP have similar command line interfaces to the Cisco IOS.

59
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:12.300
So learning the Cisco IOS may even be beneficial if you come across devices from other vendors.

60
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.520
So the Cisco IOS is used for routers.

61
00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.420
It's used for local area network switches.

62
00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:24.200
It's even used on wireless access points and very large routers and switches so you'll find it on many

63
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.400
devices.

64
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.830
Now obviously they're going to be differences between interfaces on a router versus interfaces on a

65
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:31.490
switch.

66
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:35.540
A router may have a serial interface and a switch may not.

67
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:41.510
But the general principles of the same cross of different device families and different product lines

68
00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:48.120
you configure services such as writing and switching using the C ally or command line interface.

69
00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:54.380
Typically you connect to a device using a console connection when you initially configure the device

70
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.950
or you may configure it remotely using telnet or S-sh.

71
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:05.820
It doesn't matter how you connect to the device when you access the Cisco Iowas see a lie.

72
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.430
It's generally referred to as an exec session.

73
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:15.890
And the good thing is the look and feel of the command line interface is similar across various device

74
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.860
types although features may be different.

75
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:24.280
So on a switch you may not be able to configure BGP but you may be able to configure it on a router

76
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:32.420
but the moral of the story is it's worth your time learning the CLIA because you'll encounter it very

77
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.550
often in your networking career.
