1
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:12.640
So he has brought a 1

2
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:23.760
show IP interface brief shows us the IP addresses configured on the router he has the loop back interface

3
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.140
has the IP address on gigabit zero slash zero slash a zero.

4
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:39.990
So the first thing we need to do is configure an exclusion range so IP DCP excluded address 10 1 1 1

5
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.000
2 10 1 1 100.

6
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:54.890
The next thing we need to do is configure a DHB pool called P.C. the network to use a 10 1 1 0 with

7
00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:06.110
a subnet mask of slash 24 with any to configure a default rota or default gateway of tender 1 1 2 2

8
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:17.960
5 4 because that's the IP address of write a 1 so the default Rodda will be that DNS server will be

9
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.960
the router and that looks good.

10
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:31.890
So show run these exclusion range and there's our DHB pool show IP DHB binding our client has already

11
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:44.550
been allocated an IP address 10 1 1 1 2 1 so let's confirm that by opening up a command prompt IP config

12
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:56.570
there's the IP address of the P.C. there's the subnet mask there's the default gateway can the peacekeeping

13
00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.020
role of 1 yes it can kind of ping the loop back of raw to 1.

14
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:14.760
Yes it can and to confirm that show IP interface brief there's the loop back of right 1 and the piece

15
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:22.410
he can ping the loop back over to 1 one can the right it ping the P.C. yes it can.

16
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:32.020
So we've successfully configured DHEA p on road 1 and tested that the P.C. he gets an IP address via

17
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:42.270
DCP and that the he can ping the loop back of right a 1 that was a very basic DHEA P lab in the next

18
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.130
labs it gets more complicated.
