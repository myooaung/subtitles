00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So let’s look at Rapid Spanning Tree  protocol or 802.1W

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
this is an evolution of the IEEE 802.1D standard

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
however, Rapid Spanning Tree provides rapid failover and convergence times.

4
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The big difference that you need to remember here

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
is that Rapid Spanning Tree is not based on timers like 802.1D

6
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
so it offers an improvement over the 30 seconds interval or longer

7
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
that 802.1D takes to move a port to the forwarding state

8
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
What Rapid Spanning Tree  does is it uses a bridge to bridge handset mechanism

9
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
which allows ports to move directly to forwarding

10
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
rather than waiting for the port to move from listening to learning to forwarding.

11
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It is backward compatible with 802.1D

12
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
is transparent to end users and is standard based

13
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
but it does introduce some enhancements

14
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
including new port role assignments and ports states

15
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
a new BPDU format and BPDU processing, a bridge to bridge handshake mechanism

16
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and different topology change notifications and processing procedures.

17
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So what are port states and port roles in 802.1D and Rapid Spanning Tree?

18
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
There are only 3 ports states in Rapid Spanning Tree

19
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
learning, forwarding, and discarding

20
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
in 802.1D we have disabled, blocking and listening

21
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and this has been merged into the discarding state.

22
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So when you administratively disable a port

23
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
that’s called disabled in 802.1D

24
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
but it's called discarding in 802.1W or Rapid Spanning Tree.

25
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
A blocking port that does not forward user data frames

26
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and ignores incoming data frames is called discarding in 802.1W

27
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
A listening port is not used in 802.1W

28
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
a learning port is known as a learning port

29
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and a forwarding port is known as forwarding port in 802.1W

30
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So we have learning, forwarding and discarding

31
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
disabled, blocking and listening

32
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
have been merged into the discarding state in 802.1W

33
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Cisco still uses the term blocking for discarding

34
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
so just see those terms as interchangeable terms

35
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
blocking is discarding and discarding is blocking.

36
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
So what about Port Roles?

37
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
The role is now a variable assigned to a given port.

38
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Previously we had root ports and designated ports and those remain

39
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
but blocking ports are now split

40
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
into what are called back up and alternate port roles.

41
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Spanning tree will determine the role of the port

42
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
by looking at the BPDUs received

43
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and deciding which one is more useful than another.

44
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
A more useful BPDU is a BPDU that has a lower path cost

45
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
or a better path to get to the root bridge.

46
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:17.000
So let’s start with a root port with the Spanning Tree Protocol

47
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
the Spanning Tree algorithm elects a single root bridge

48
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
for the entire bridged network

49
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
now with PVST that stands on a per-VLAN basis

50
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
but in 802.1D or Rapid Spanning Tree

51
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
there’s only 1 root bridge or root switch for the entire layer 2 topology.

52
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
The root bridge send BPDUs that are more useful

53
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
than the one sent by any other bridge.

54
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
The port receiving the best BPDU on a bridge or switch is known as the root port.

55
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
In other words, this is the port

56
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
that is closest to the root bridge in terms of path cost.

57
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
So in this topology, this switch is the root switch.

58
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
This port would be the root port of switch A

59
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
and this would be the root port of switch B.

60
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
the root bridge doesn’t have a root port.

61
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
All other bridges have at least one root port.

62
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
What is a designated port?

63
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
This is the best port on a segment to use to get to the root bridge.

64
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
So all bridges connected to a given segment

65
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
listen to each other’s BPDUs and agree on the bridge

66
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
sending  the best BPDU as the designated bridge for the segment.

67
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
So in this topology, this switches the root

68
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
so for this segment, this is the designated port

69
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
or best port to use to get to the root bridge.

70
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
On this segment, this is the best port to use to get to the root bridge

71
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
so this is the designated port.

72
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Once again, just imagine that you’ve got a PC

73
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
connected to the middle of this cable

74
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
which is the best way to get to the root bridge?

75
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
This way or this way?

76
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and as we can see, this is the best path or best way to get to the root bridge

77
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
so this is the root port it's much quicker to go this way

78
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
than it is to go this way. so this is the designated port.

79
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
on this segment, let’s assume that we’ve got a hub connected here

80
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
this port has been chosen as the designated port

81
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and that maybe because the switch here has a lower bridge ID in switch A

82
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
and this is port 1 which is lower than port 2

83
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
so this is the designated port on that segment.

84
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Now what about alternate and backup port roles?

85
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
This corresponds to the blocking state in 802.1D

86
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
A blocked port is defined as any port that is not a designated or root port.

87
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
A port remains blocked as long as it receives more useful

88
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
in other words better BPDUs than the one it would send out on the segment.

89
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Therefore port must receive BPDUs in order to stay blocked

90
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
if it doesn’t receive BPDUs it will transition to the forwarding state.

91
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
So in Rapid Spanning Tree there are 2 types of blocked ports

92
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
an alternate port is a port that is blocked

93
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000
because it's receiving more useful BPDUs from another bridge on the segment.

94
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
So in this example, this port is the designated port

95
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
on let say switch B, on switch A

96
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
this port is an alternate port because more useful or better.

97
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.000
BPDUs are being received on this segment from switch B then from switch A

98
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and that maybe because the priority of switch B is lower than the priority of switch A.

99
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
a backup port is a port that is blocked

100
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000
because it's receiving more useful BPDUs from the same bridge that it's on.

101
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
so in this example were assuming that this port, this port

102
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
and this port are connected to  a hub

103
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
this port a becomes the backup port its connected to the same switch

104
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
as this designated ports but it may be a higher port number

105
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
therefore it becomes a backup port.
