00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.380
I think all of us have experienced congestion management in our lives.

2
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.740
You get to the airport and you want to check in.

3
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.070
There's a queue or a line so you have to wait before your bags can be processed.

4
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:19.670
You get two security at the airport and you have to wait in a queue or a line you're driving on the

5
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.720
highway or motorway and lanes have been closed.

6
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:30.230
It results in congestion which results in a queuing mechanism being used to filter the traffic.

7
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:38.330
So queuing mechanisms manage congestion different queuing mechanisms can be used in the US as an example.

8
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.070
You have TSA pre check so that helps you get through security quicker.

9
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.650
If you've got a first class airplane ticket you're going to be processed quicker or better at check

10
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.930
in than if you've got an economy class ticket.

11
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.070
An ambulance will take priority on a motorway or a highway when there's congestion versus a standard

12
00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.940
car.

13
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:06.170
So different queuing mechanisms can be used to determine how traffic is processed with round robin queuing

14
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.820
mechanisms.

15
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.050
All traffic is treated the same way.

16
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:15.910
That means that everyone is treated the same way that results in delay for real time traffic.

17
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.980
You could also implement a strict queuing mechanism where high priority traffic is always processed

18
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.120
first.

19
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.790
The advantage of that is voice packets will be transmitted first but if there is a lot of voice traffic

20
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:35.180
or high priority traffic it could result in starvation of less important traffic.

21
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.760
If you're constantly sending a lot of voice and video your FTE traffic may never be transmitted because

22
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.670
you are always transmitting video and voice first in a strict priority queuing mechanism.

23
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.670
So with congestion management we have queuing or buffering which determines the ordering of packets

24
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.420
in the output buffers.

25
00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:01.100
In other words it determines how traffic leaves a road interface or leaves a switch interface.

26
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.950
You do have ingress queues but for now we'll just concentrate on egress queuing mechanisms queuing is

27
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.350
only required when there's congestion.

28
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.840
If you're driving on the highway or motorway late at night and there are six lanes and there are only

29
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.660
a few cars there's no need to have a queuing mechanism so queuing is used when there's congestion.

30
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:28.490
Hence the term congestion management when queues fill up packets are reordered so that high priority

31
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.130
packets are sent out of a rather interface first rather than lower priority packets.

32
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.350
So again when this congestion.

33
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:42.110
You may have high priority packets and low priority packets arriving a queuing mechanism is used to

34
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.060
determine which packets should be processed first and then they are scheduled for transmission out of

35
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.470
the interface of a rider.

36
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:55.190
So when packets arrive they're put into classes and will be processed on how important they are or based

37
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.700
on the queuing algorithm used.

38
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.120
More important packets will be transmitted first before less important traffic.

39
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.360
As an example so they will be scheduled for sending out of the interface of the router before less important

40
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:16.400
packets so queuing is the logic of ordering packets and output buffers scheduling is a process of deciding

41
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.790
which package should be sent out next.

42
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:25.130
Scheduling occurs regardless of whether there is congestion on the link queuing is only activated when

43
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:32.210
congestion occurs when queues fill up packets are reordered so that higher priority packets can be sent

44
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.910
out before lower priority packets.
