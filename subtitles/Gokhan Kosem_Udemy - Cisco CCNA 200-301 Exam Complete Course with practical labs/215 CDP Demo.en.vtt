00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So let’s do a capture on this link between router 1 and router 2

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:15.000
we can see some loop messages which are used to ensure that the interface is up

3
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and we may have to wait a while for CDP message to be sent.

4
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We can see that by typing sh cdp and pressing enter.

5
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
CDP only sends packets every 60 seconds

6
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
so we may have to wait a while as you can see in the output here

7
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
CDP packets are sent every 60 seconds

8
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and an entry in the table is held for 180 seconds

9
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I’ll show you more about that later but scrolling down

10
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
here’s a CDP message

11
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
we can see that it's using 802.3 Ethernet

12
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and is using a  specific Cisco address which I'll talk about in more detail later.

13
00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.000
It's using logical link control with the organizational or unit of Cisco

14
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
in other words, the protocol used at a high layer is CDP

15
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and here’s the CDP information version 2

16
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
we can see that it's router 2 advertising itself

17
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
with it's platform, port number and other  details

18
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
what’s interesting is you can get a lot of detail through a CDP message

19
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
which is great for discovering the network

20
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
but is bad from a security point of view

21
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
you can see version of software, you can see platform

22
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.000
you can see IP addresses configured, so IP address port number

23
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
you can see its capabilities and so forth

24
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000
here's router 1, so you can see the device ID is router 1, as an example

25
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So the important thing to remember is the CDP does not rely

26
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
on higher layer protocols, messages are sent every 60 seconds by default.

27
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
You can use CDP to map an entire network

28
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
so as an example, if you were connected to router 1

29
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and you use the command sh cdp neighbors

30
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
you could discover which device you directly connected to

31
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and then you could use details

32
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
so show CDP neighbor details

33
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
to see detailed information about that neighbor including its IP address

34
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and then if telnet is enabled on your network

35
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
you could telnet from router 1 to router 2

36
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and then use the command CDP neighbors

37
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
to discover what devices are connected to that router.

38
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
So as an example, here’s a core 3750 router

39
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
let’s see what's connected to that switch.

40
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
So I could use this command sh cdp entry

41
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and the name of the device, to just see the output for the specific device

42
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
here’s its IP address, so I'll telnet to that IP address

43
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I can log in assuming that I know the username and password

44
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and once again I could use the command

45
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
sh cdp neighbors

46
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
to discover what's connected to that device.

47
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And here as an example, we can see some other devices

48
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
which we weren't seeing previously, such as the Cisco 1841 router.

49
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:34.000
So you could map out the entire network by simply using CDP on 1 device

50
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
and telnetting to the next device using CDP

51
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
to discover what’s connected to that and then telnetting to the next device

52
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and discovering what’s connected to that device.

53
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Now the Cisco APIC-EM SDN software does a lot of this for you

54
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
and so does othersSCNMP or Simple Network Management Protocol

55
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
management software such as software from Solarwinds

56
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
you could do this manually but there is software out there

57
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
that can help you automate this process.

58
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
You could also use a combination of protocols.

59
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
So as an example, here’s router 2

60
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
sh cdp neighbors

61
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
shows me that I have this core 3750 switch

62
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
I could then discover the IP address of that switch

63
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
which in this example is this and then I could simply telnet to that switch

64
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:37.000
and then use a protocol such as LLDP to discover devices connected to that switch.

65
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:45.000
In this example, you can see the 2 Cisco IP phones, and an Ubuntu hypervisor

66
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
I could look at details.

67
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
So sh lldp neighbors detail

68
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
and here I can see the IP address

69
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000
and model of phone as well as the firmware  being used by that phone

70
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
and other information about it.

71
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Scrolling down, lot of detail notice firmware revision

72
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
serial number and quite a bit of other information

73
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
such as the layer 2 quality of service and layer 3 quality of service

74
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
set on that phone, we'll talk more about quality of service later.

75
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Here's the Cisco DX650, so we can see its system name

76
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:39.000
we can see an IP address we can see a firmware version

77
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
we can see quality of service information

78
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
we can see once again that it's a Cisco phone

79
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
we can see how much power is being used a lot of detail

80
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.000
here’s Linux so we can see Ubuntu server running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

81
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.000
you can see the name of the server and it's IP address.

82
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:11.000
So once again CDP and LLDP allows you to discover devices in your network

83
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
and also allow you to see how the devices

84
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
are connected to each other in your network.
