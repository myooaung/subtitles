00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.190
In this video I'm going to show you how to download and install Cisco Packet Tracer on a laptop

2
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.210
in this example I've got a Windows 10 laptop which I'm controlling from my Mac.

3
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.380
That just makes it easier to do the recordings but I'm going to show you how to download and install

4
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.900
Cisco Packet Tracer on this laptop.

5
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.780
Now why would you want to use Cisco Packet Tracer Cisco Packet Tracer is firstly free you can download

6
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.070
it by simply registering for a course on Cisco's website.

7
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.130
You don't have to pay for the course you don't actually have to take the course.

8
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.510
You simply need to register on Cisco's website and then you'll be able to download Cisco Packet Tracer

9
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:48.220
for free.

10
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.770
So it's free software that you can run on your laptop it allows you to simulate quite complex Cisco

11
00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.590
typologies these days so you can run cisco rotors and switches you can run servers you can run pieces

12
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:07.940
you can create fairly complex typologies if you studying for your CCMA as an example Cisco Packet Tracer

13
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.030
is enough to pass the CCMA.

14
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.740
It's not perfect.

15
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.700
It's a simulator rather than an emulator so it doesn't fully simulate the Cisco IAW but it has enough

16
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:26.290
in it to give you a good foundation in networking and a good understanding of the topics for the CCMA

17
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.440
exam.

18
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.060
So if you're new to networking if you're new to Cisco I'd recommend that you start with Cisco packet

19
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:39.440
tracer and then later on you can look at technologies or applications such as Gen S3 Cisco viral and

20
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.630
even G.

21
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:41.050
Okay.

22
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.230
Without further ado let me show you how to build a packet tracer lab.

23
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.980
So the first thing I'm going to do is simply search for Cisco packet tracer and Google first it is the

24
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.940
Cisco Networking Academy.

25
00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.570
Now they've recently changed the logging process on the Cisco network Academy Web site.

26
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.530
In the past you had a dedicated email address for this Web site.

27
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:11.020
Now which users you have Cisco dot com log in and we're told that here to log in if you have an existing

28
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.410
Cisco dot com account use that email and password to log in if not to use your network card email and

29
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.010
password to log in.

30
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:26.650
Now if you don't have an account scroll down and click enrol to download packet tracer.

31
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.260
This course is an introduction to Cisco Packet Tracer.

32
00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.380
It's a good course but you don't have to go through it.

33
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.420
It's 10 hours in length.

34
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.100
It is free.

35
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.630
But again you don't have to go through it if you don't want to go to sign up today and select English

36
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:47.230
as your language and then put in your details such as your first name your last name and your email

37
00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.990
address.

38
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.270
This email address has to be valid because they will email you a link which you have to click on to

39
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.780
complete the enrollment process.

40
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.390
So we told that we need to check our e-mail and click on the Get Started link to access your account.

41
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.630
Okay.

42
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:11.140
So here's my email from the Cisco Networking Academy I'm going to click activate account you now need

43
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.910
to fill in your details.

44
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:19.390
Now one of the pieces of advice that I'll give you is if you don't work for a company set the company

45
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.180
name to self as in self-employed.

46
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:29.800
So specify your country specify your password decide whether you want to get email notifications or

47
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:38.880
not put the capture information in and then click register.

48
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:45.500
Now you can sign in with your email address specify your password and click sign in.

49
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.220
Now we're told that they were excited to have us join them.

50
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.540
But we need to fill in some more details.

51
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:58.840
So as an example specify your agenda specify your state specify how many years of experience you have

52
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:07.430
in I.T. or networking specify if you have a disability specify your birth date so they ask for quite

53
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.480
a bit of information here specify your race if you want to.

54
00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:18.600
I'm going to choose not to disclose that specify whether you've served in the military and click Create

55
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.540
Account.

56
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:25.390
OK so now that you've done that you can launch the course if you want to.

57
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.940
I'm not going to do that.

58
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:34.980
I'm going to go to resources download packet tracer and what I'm going to do is download the 64 bit

59
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.780
version of packet tracer.

60
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.260
This is version 7 dot to dot too.

61
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:46.250
They also have a linux version and a Mac OS version but I'm gonna download the 64 bit Windows version.

62
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:56.510
As you can see here it's downloading Okay so the file is downloaded here it is Packet Tracer 7 2 2 164

63
00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.550
setup to install it.

64
00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:06.890
So fairly simple process I'm going to double click on the application click install any way click yes

65
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:14.670
to allow this app to make changes to my device you need to accept the license agreement so read through

66
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.360
the license agreement and accept it if you want install the software and click.

67
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.920
Next I'm going to mainly stay with a default share to keep it simple as possible so I'm going to use

68
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.620
the default installation directory click Next I'm going to leave for the start menu folder after the

69
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:39.360
default click Next I'm going to allow the software to create a desktop shortcut and click next and then

70
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.770
I'm going to click install.

71
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.310
So fairly basic installation.

72
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:49.230
Similar to lots of other applications that you would install on a Windows computer.

73
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:57.480
The software is installed and I'm now told that for Packet Tracer skills based assessment to use this

74
00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.830
version of Packet Tracer.

75
00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:08.140
Please close all web browsers or start your computer when I click Okay shut my web browser and click

76
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.490
finish.

77
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:16.410
I'm told that I'm running Packet Tracer for the first time so files will be saved here.

78
00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.850
I can change that later but I'm going to click Okay.

79
00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:28.060
Packet traces now started and now I can log in with the same credentials that I use on Cisco's Web site

80
00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:38.330
or on the net a cad Web site so I'll specify my username I'll specify my password and click sign in.

81
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:46.840
Now the firewall is blocking some features so I'm when to click allow access for private networks and

82
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.320
there you go packet tracer has now installed on my Windows computer.

83
00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:57.160
I downloaded it and installed it but now let's bolt some typologies Packet Tracer supports many devices

84
00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.020
such as rudders switches hubs wireless devices and others.

85
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:07.660
He has a router so I'll click on the rotor and then click on the workspace area.

86
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.590
I'll select another router added to the topology.

87
00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:13.260
Select a switch.

88
00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:23.290
Let's take a modern switch such as a 36 50 and drop that into the topology I'll select connections there

89
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:30.650
various types of connections such as straight through cables crossover cables fiber cables and so forth.

90
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:38.730
But I'm going to select straight through select the first Ethernet connection on my router selected

91
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:47.740
the first Ethernet connection on my switch I'll select straight through cable again select to the second

92
00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:53.920
interface on the switch select to the first gigabit interface on the rider and I'll zoom in here to

93
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.200
make it easier to see what's going on.

94
00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:02.650
There are a lot of options available and packet traces are under options preferences I can select this

95
00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:10.380
option always show port labels in a logical workspace so I can now see the interface labels in my topology

96
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:16.560
what I also want to change is the font because this is probably going to be too small for me so I'm

97
00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:28.190
going to set the C Alai font to 18 and click apply and then close the stone you can move devices around

98
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:36.460
in your topology you could rename them Sol rename this as root a one I'll rename this as root it too

99
00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:45.360
I'll rename this switch one if you don't like the way these interface labels are set up simply go to

100
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:45.840
options.

101
00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:53.880
Preferences once again and then uncheck this option and then you can manually add your interface labels.

102
00:08:53.880 --> 00:09:01.920
You can also hide the rudder type by going to options preferences and on selecting this option show

103
00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:04.150
device model labels.

104
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:10.200
But I want to keep device name labels so that I know the device names in my topology.

105
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:15.000
I'll go back and display port labels for the moment.

106
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.990
You can remove those and then manually add interface labels so you may prefer doing it this way where

107
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:31.450
you can control where the interface labels go so I'll do that just to make the topology nicer so something

108
00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:32.200
like that

109
00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:40.940
they're basically a lot of options here that you can use depending on your preferences.

110
00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:48.310
So there you go there's my topology but I'm going to do on Route 1.

111
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:58.600
He's going to see a fly now I've set the font quite big but notice Rodda has booted and I can now access

112
00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.230
a router.

113
00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:06.460
If you're not used to Cisco This is known as user prompt or user mode.

114
00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:13.000
When I use question mark here various commands are displayed in Able is how I get to privilege mode

115
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:17.960
or enable mode I can type a few characters and then press tab.

116
00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:22.760
Question mark shows me other options but I'm simply going to type enable here.

117
00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:27.020
This gives me other commands that I can use in this mode.

118
00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:36.330
I'm going to type conf T which is basically configure terminal for short I use tab there to order complete

119
00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:40.950
commands I can change the name of the rider and actually this is right too.

120
00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:44.980
I'll set the hostname to rider to back in my topology.

121
00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:51.010
This interface is connected to the switch but to make it more logical let's start with the rider one

122
00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:55.720
so rider 1 CLIA make that bigger.

123
00:10:55.820 --> 00:11:00.650
I don't want to enter the initial configuration dialog so I'm going to say no and press Enter to get

124
00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:14.300
started type E N tab enter that takes me to privilege mode C O N F as in configure tab t tab enter takes

125
00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:18.980
me to global config mode on the rider I can now set a hostname.

126
00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:20.860
So this is a true s.t..

127
00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:26.560
Tab are 1 change the hostname while the rider other commands exist in this mode.

128
00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:30.150
So question mark will show me the commands available to me.

129
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:38.630
Now this rider has this interface which connects it to the switch so on rider 1 I can go on to interface

130
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:45.120
gigabit and I'm pressing tab here to order complete 0 0 0.

131
00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:51.270
No shutdown enables the interface by default rider interfaces are shut down.

132
00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:59.000
IP address allows me to configure an IP address on the rider and I'll configure it with this IP address

133
00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:07.510
so I've configured the rider with an IP address of 10 1 1 1 subnet mask 2 5 5 2 4 5 2 4 5 0 and takes

134
00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:14.200
me back to privilege mode or enable mode and I should be able to ping myself on that interface.

135
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:23.710
At the moment it's not working because notice these interfaces are down the switch by default is powered

136
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:32.490
off so in this case I need to take a power module and add it to the switch to essentially power on the

137
00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:38.200
switch and here you can see the switches now booting up.

138
00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:43.670
So once the switch is fully booted the interfaces will go green.

139
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:48.580
You can see this is green on this side orange over here.

140
00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:55.050
This side is still red because I haven't no shut the interface on right to switch interfaces by default

141
00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:59.100
come up right interfaces by default are shut down so you have to enable them.

142
00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:03.590
So on the router CLIA on right of one I can see the interface came up.

143
00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:08.580
So the rudder can now ping itself but let's go to Rod too.

144
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:15.210
And I know this is not going to look great but I'm going to make this smaller so that you can see what

145
00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:19.010
happens when I know shut the interface on the rudder.

146
00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:25.020
So on rudder to make that a bit bigger interface.

147
00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.100
So I a..

148
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:27.240
Tab G.

149
00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.290
Tab so gigabyte 0 0 0.

150
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:34.970
Notice please what happens when I type in no shut down.

151
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:36.730
Interface went green.

152
00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:41.530
So I've enabled that interface ip address that I'll configure.

153
00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:49.580
He has 10 1 1 to mosque 2 5 5 2 4 5 2 4 5 0 hopefully right at 2.

154
00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:55.480
We'll be able to ping rider 1 once the interfaces have all gone green which they have.

155
00:13:55.620 --> 00:14:00.030
The reason why these interfaces were orange is because of spanning tree spanning trees a way to stop

156
00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:03.310
loops in a ethernet network.

157
00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:07.620
And in this case it took a while for spanning tree to converge.

158
00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:10.190
In other words make sure that everything was good.

159
00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:16.170
So I've successfully bolted topology using packet tracer

160
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:26.920
and I've successfully sent traffic from one router to another router through a switch in packet tracer.

161
00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:34.860
Last thing to do is save the configuration and you can do that by typing copy running conflict startup

162
00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:41.300
config and saving it or you can use an old command w r which is right.

163
00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:44.330
So basically writing the configuration.

164
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:51.510
So I've now bolted topology and packet trace so when I closed packet tracer I'm told that my changes

165
00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:52.290
will be lost.

166
00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:53.990
Do I want to save them.

167
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.510
And the answer is yes.

168
00:14:55.620 --> 00:15:03.950
So I'm going to save this as my first packet tracer lab and click safe.

169
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:05.940
And there you go.

170
00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:17.130
Start packing trays up once again go to file open recent files select my packet tracer lab and I've

171
00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:25.850
been able to restore my packet tracer lab that I saved previously if I look at the CLIA of Route One

172
00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:35.860
we should notice that it has an IP address as previously configured show run allows me to see the running

173
00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:44.080
config of the rider and what you'll notice is that IP address is configured on gigabit 0 0 0 and now

174
00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:50.950
that the links have gone green I should be able to ping rider to which I'm able to do this first ping

175
00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:57.970
times out because the rider has to opt for the Mac address of the other rider so that's normal behavior.

176
00:15:57.970 --> 00:15:58.840
Okay so there you go.

177
00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:05.700
I've shown you how to download install and use Cisco packet tracer great software it's free helps your

178
00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:09.760
lot with labs especially if you're studying for your CCMA exam.
