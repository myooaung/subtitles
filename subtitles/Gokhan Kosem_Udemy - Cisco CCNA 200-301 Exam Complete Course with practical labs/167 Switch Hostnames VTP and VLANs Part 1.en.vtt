00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The first thing I’m going to do is configure the switches

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
with their names and configure the interfaces as trunks or access ports.

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
That means we need to configure the VLANs on the switches

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
as well as configure the VTP mode.

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This is the console for switch 1

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
so, in other words, IOSvL2-1 as you can see here in this console.

7
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I’m gonna type enable to go to privilege mode

8
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
type conf t to go to global configuration mode

9
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and then type hostname and I can specify the name of the switch

10
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I’m gonna configured as S1

11
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
do allows me to see show commands in global config mode as an example

12
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
so I’m gonna use the command do sh ip int brief

13
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
to view interfaces on the switch.

14
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So I can see various interfaces such as gigabit 0/0 gigabit 0/1

15
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and so forth which have a status of up, up at the moment.

16
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
In this topology, I’m only using gigabit 0/0

17
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
to gigabit 0/3 as well as gigabit 1/0.

18
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So these are the interfaces that I'm using, as a best practice

19
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I’m going to shut down any other interfaces on the switch.

20
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So I’m gonna shutdown gigabit 1/1 - 3

21
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
my interface have gone down so do sh ip int brief

22
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
shows me that those interfaces are currently down.

23
00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I should also shutdown g2/0 - 3 as well as 3/0 - 3.

24
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
so do sh ip int brief

25
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
shows me that those interfaces are shut down

26
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
now you probably wanna script this kind of configuration

27
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
so on the other switches, I’ll do most of the configuration through notepad

28
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and then simply paste it into the switch consoles to speed things up

29
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
but what we’ve done at this point is shut down unused interfaces

30
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and we've name the switch.

31
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
The range command is really useful

32
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
when doing configurations on multiple interfaces

33
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.000
By defaults we have VLAN 1 configured as well as legacy VLANs

34
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
such as 1002, 1003, 1004 and 1005

35
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
which were used in the past for FDDI and token ring.

36
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
VLAN 1 is the only VLAN used in an Ethernet environment.

37
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
In this topology however

38
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I need to configure VLAN 10 as well as VLAN 20.

39
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
before to configure the VLANs

40
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I’m gonna change the VTP mode to transparent.

41
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
So that every switch uses its own local database of VLANs.

42
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
By default the VTP mode is set to server

43
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and we can see that by using the command show vtp status.

44
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Servers allow you to create VLANs

45
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and they're also synchronized with other switches in the topology

46
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I do wanna do that

47
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
so I’m gonna type VTP mode transparent

48
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
so that my switch does not try

49
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
synchronize with other switches in the topology.

50
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
In a small environment like this

51
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
we don’t really need VTP and VTP can cause a lot of problems in networks.

52
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So for safety reasons, I’m gonna disable VTP

53
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and the command sh vtp status

54
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
allows me to see that the mode is now changed to transparent.

55
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
The number of existing VLANs is 5

56
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
the maximum number of VLANs supported on the switches 1005

57
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.000
we can see the current VLANs by typing sh vlans once again

58
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and as you can see we have VLAN 1, 1002, 1003,1004, and 1005

59
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
as the 5 VLANs currently configured.

60
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
sh vtp status

61
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
shows me that this switch supports VTP modes 1 to 3

62
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
the current version running is VTP 1.

63
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
The switch is not part of a VTP domain.

64
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
We can also see that VTP pruning

65
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
and VTP trap generations are disabled.

66
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
So sh vlan brief

67
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
shows me that I have VLAN 1 configured

68
00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
and all of this ports are in VLAN 1

69
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
VLAN 1 is the default Ethernet VLAN once again

70
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
and all interfaces are by default in VLAN 1.

71
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:14.000
So conf t vlan 10 vlan 20 and sh vlan brief

72
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
now you can see that VLAN 10 and VLAN 20 have been created

73
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
and added to the list of VLANs currently available on the switch.

74
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
for port to be put into a VLAN

75
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
the VLAN needs to be added to the VLAN database

76
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000
so when if I was gonna put this NPM server into VLAN 30 as an example

77
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000
I would need to configure VLAN 30 and then add that port to VLAN 30.

78
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
In this example, I want to configure VLAN 10 and VLAN 20

79
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
because I’m gonna create layer 3 interfaces on this switch for those VLANs.

80
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
So I need to have configured the VLANs in the VLAN database first.
