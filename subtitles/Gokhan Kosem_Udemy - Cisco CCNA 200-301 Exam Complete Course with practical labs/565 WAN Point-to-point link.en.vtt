00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:07.650
In a later video I'll show you a why shock capture showing you what the traffic or frames looked like

2
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.130
when sent between two sites.

3
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.220
But for the moment the high level picture is as follows a P.S. In one local area network is sending

4
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.210
traffic to a P.C. and another local area network.

5
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.180
When the traffic is sent across the land and in this case we're using ethernet the IP packet is encapsulated

6
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:34.080
in an Ethernet frame so add a layer to the encapsulation used is Ethernet so as an example it could

7
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:41.310
be Ethernet to when the frame arrives at the rudder the rudder will strip the layer two headers and

8
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.140
then send the frame across the when using for example HDL.

9
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.790
So if this point to point connection is configured with a layer to encapsulation of each deal see the

10
00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:02.220
Ethernet headers are removed and the original IP packet that was sent by P.S. 1 is encapsulated in HDL

11
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:10.800
C and is forwarded across the serial link to a to When rather to receives the HDL C frame it strips

12
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:19.260
the HDL C headers and forwards the original IP packet sent by P.S. 1 onto the local area network using

13
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:26.070
an Ethernet header so the packet is encapsulated in Ethernet and an Ethan at frame is sent from router

14
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:35.850
2 to P.S. to using ethernet so we have Ethernet on the local area network on the left the when encapsulation

15
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.150
used is used between right one and rudder two.

16
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.620
In this example it's HDL C and then on land too and Ethernet encapsulation is used once again the two

17
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:52.380
layers that we going to concentrate on in the oversized model for when technologies is the physical

18
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.350
layer and the data link layer at the physical layer.

19
00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.400
The physical presentation changes from what you've seen in an Ethan and environment.

20
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:10.620
So rather than using RJ 45 connectors and for instance catch six cabling X 21 or V 35 cables would be

21
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.550
used.

22
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.000
So the physical characteristics of the when interface are different to the physical characteristics

23
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.750
of Ethernet at least two rather than using an Ethan encapsulation you would encounter encapsulation

24
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.510
such as frame relay BP HDL C A.T.M. and NPL less.

25
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:37.930
You may however to day also encounter Ethernet when connections which are becoming more and more popular.

26
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.710
But for the CCMA when discussing it point to point when connection we are going to be concentrating

27
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.670
on a BPP and HDL C encapsulation.

28
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.680
So what kind of when devices would you typically see for point to point connections.

29
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:58.530
Well you'll typically find rudders rather than switches connecting remote sites together.

30
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:07.020
You'd also encounter a CSU DSP or channel service unit data service unit which allows you to connect

31
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.630
to a list line connection using for example an X 21 or V 35 cable.

32
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.880
This converts the signals to the required format for when transmission.
