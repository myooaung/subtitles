00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
There are other routing protocols that are not included in this list.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Internal BGP as an example has an administrative distance of 200

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
whereas external BGP has an adminitrative distance of 20

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
ISIS has an administrative distance of 115

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
but we wonâ€™t get into those protocols in this course

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
just be aware that the lower the administrative distance

7
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
the more reliable or more believable a routing protocol is.
