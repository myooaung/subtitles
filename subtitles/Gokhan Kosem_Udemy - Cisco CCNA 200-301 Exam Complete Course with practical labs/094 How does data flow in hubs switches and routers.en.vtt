00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In this video, I’m gonna show you how data flows through devices in a network.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So how does data flow for example, through a hub or a switch or router?

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Is the flooded out of all ports or is it only send out of an individual port?

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And when I talk about data, I’m implying that on a switch a frame is forwarded out

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
of a port and on a router I’m talking about a packet is forwarded out of a port.

6
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So in networking, it’s important to understand those terms and it’s also very

7
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
important to understand how traffic flows through devices in the network.

8
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
If you have a router where does the traffic go?

9
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
If you have switch, out of which port does the traffic go?

10
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So let’s look at how data flows in a network.

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We firstly gonna start off with an introduction to the different types

12
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
of communication that takes place in the data network.

13
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
We gonna look at unicast traffic vs. multicast traffic vs. broadcast traffic.

14
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I’m then gonna explain the term CSMA/CD which means

15
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Carrier Sense Multiple Access Collision Detection

16
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I’m then gonna spend quite a bit of time

17
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
looking at the differences between hubs bridges, switches and routers.

18
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And I’m gonna show you how packet flows through those different devices.

19
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I’ll be referring to the OSI model throughout this video.

20
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I’m assuming at this point that you understand what the OSI model is

21
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and the different layers of the OSI model.

22
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
If you’re unsure review the OSI video that’s part of this course.

23
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
So in this video I’m not gonna give you the details of where a device

24
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
in the OSI model resides, I’m gonna refer to terms

25
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
such as a router is a layer 3 device, a switch is a layer 2 device.

26
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
If you aren't sure about what that means please review the OSI video.

27
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So let’s start off with the basic types of communication

28
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
that you'll encounter in the data network.

29
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
This is one of those fundamental building blocks that you need to understand.

30
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So the first type of communication is unicast.

31
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Unicast is essentially where one device speaks to one other device.

32
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000
It's one to one communication, in other words, device A is communicating with device B

33
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
the second type of communication is a broadcast, a broadcast is where one device

34
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
sends traffic to all devices in the same subnet or in the entire network.

35
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
There are different types of broadcast and we'll talk about some of them later.

36
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
But as an example a broadcast to the local subnet means that all devices

37
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
in the same subnet have the broadcasting device receive the broadcast.

38
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
A broadcast to all hosts or networks means that the broadcast

39
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
goes everywhere in the entire network.

40
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
However in a lot of real world implementation, broadcast are limited

41
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and blocked by layer 3 devices such as switches and routers.

42
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
So a broadcast would typically not go everyway in a network.

43
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Broadcast can cause a lot of problems and are therefore contained or limited

44
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
in data networks, but essentially the idea of a broadcast is that all devices

45
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:16.000
on the local segment or local subnet will receive the broadcast sent by single device.

46
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Now broadcast can be useful as an example if 2 windows machines

47
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000
are configured with the same name, you'll receive a warning about that because

48
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
a broadcast is sent by those devices on the local network.

49
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
That’s how the devices learned about each other and realized that multiple

50
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
devices have the same name. So broadcast do have the uses but do cause a lot of

51
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.000
problems in IPv4 networks and therefore in IPv6 broadcast support has been removed.

52
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000
In an IPv6 network broadcast are not supported. Now, what about multicast?

53
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Multicast have some of the advantages of broadcast, in that a single device

54
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
can speak to many devices but it gets rid of some of the issue related to broadcast.

55
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Broadcast send traffic to people that don’t necessarily want the traffic

56
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.000
where as with the multicast only devices that subscribe to the multicast receive it.

57
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
So devices have to explicitly ask for multicast traffic before they receive it.

58
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
So they won’t receive the multicast if they for example

59
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
unsubscribe from that multicast.

60
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.000
So to use some analogies, a broadcast is like a spammer were sending mail or email

61
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
or traffic to everyone even to people who don’t want it.

62
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
A multicast on the other hand is kind of a like an opt in or subscription service

63
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.000
to a mailing list, so you may subscribe to an email mailing system giving information

64
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000
about Cisco CCNA, you can always opt out of that mailing list which means

65
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
you no longer receive the emails, well in theory at least.

66
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
So the idea with the broadcast is you will receive the traffic

67
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
even though you don’t want it.

68
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
The idea with the multicast is you can optionally receive the traffic or

69
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
optionally opt out of receiving the traffic.

70
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Now another analogy which is useful in a classroom base environment is

71
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
if I were standing at the front of the class as an instructor I would be talking

72
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
and everyone in the class would be listening to what I’m saying, that’s a broadcast.

73
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
So typically that happens in the morning when the class first starts.

74
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000
I’m speaking everyone in the room is listening, however typically especially

75
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
after lunch an example, the classroom turns into a multicast where some people

76
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
have unsubscribe from what I’m saying and that maybe happening right now

77
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
which is unfortunate but hopefully not.

78
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Hopefully you're still listening, so I might be speaking in front of a class of 10

79
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
people but only 5 of those people are listening to what I’m saying

80
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
The other 5 people have unsubscribed from what I’m saying

81
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
and are no longer listening to me. That’s an example of a multicast.

82
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
so I’m hoping that this video won’t turn into

83
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
multicast where you unsubscribe from what I’m saying.
