00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So let’s pull the topology I bring some VPCS devices into that topology.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I’ve discussed this previously.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.000
What I’ll do now is connect router 1 on F2/0

4
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that’s the EtherSwitch module to the first port on EtherSwitch module on router 2.

5
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Let’s show labels so we can see our interfaces.

6
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Also zooming here so we can see better.

7
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I’ll also connect the PC to port 2

8
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and this PC to port 2 on the EtherSwitch module.

9
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The reason why is I’m going to connect another cable

10
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
between these 2 routers in a moment.

11
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
But for now, let’s start up the devices

12
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and let’s open a console connection.

13
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Ok! So here’s router 1, I'm gonna give the router a hostname.

14
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So host router 1 and now we can use commands such as

15
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.000
spanning-tree vlan 1 root primary

16
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So I'll make router 1 acting as our switch here

17
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
the root for vlan 1 on router 2, set a hostname of router 2

18
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
spanning-tree vlan 1 root secondary.

19
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So this allows you to configure the routers in the same way

20
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
that you would configure a switch.

21
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Just be aware that some commands are different

22
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
so when you type sh vlan we have options such as

23
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
show vlans, show vlan-range and show-vlan switch.

24
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And what we want to show vlan-switch.

25
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Remember this is still a router with an EtherSwitch module in it

26
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
so router command is still valid on this router.

27
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
so sh vlans is not gonna show you what you want

28
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
sh vlan-switch is gonna show you output

29
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
similar to what you would have on a physical switch

30
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
so at the moment, you can see that this ports F2/0 up to F2/15 are in VLAN 1.
