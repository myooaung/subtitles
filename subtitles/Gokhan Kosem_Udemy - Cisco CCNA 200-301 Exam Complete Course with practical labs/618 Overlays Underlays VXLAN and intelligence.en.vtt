1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.380
But hopefully this makes sense.

2
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.010
Let's talk about overlay underlay and fabrics.

3
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:14.400
So overlay networks go back a long way in time.

4
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:20.800
So the example I use when I spoke about the exam and I like that example is in the old days we had a

5
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.650
traditional telephone network.

6
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:30.610
The intelligence was in the telephone network so the public switched telephone network that AT&amp;T would

7
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.410
have built or British Telecom would have built here in the U.K. The phones were done.

8
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.680
They didn't even have dial tone without the network giving dial tone to the phone.

9
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.790
So the phones were essentially stupid but then that God revolutionized with voice over IP.

10
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.050
Then suddenly we were using the Internet as a dumb call.

11
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.480
And I shouldn't say it's totally dumb.

12
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.550
But from a telephone switching point of view it was done.

13
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.880
We were basically setting up calls across the Internet and the devices in the core Internet didn't understand

14
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.200
what the calls were doing.

15
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.950
They were just routing IP packets.

16
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.300
So I phoned you using Skype or WhatsApp today.

17
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.540
I phone you.

18
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.230
The Internet doesn't understand what we're doing.

19
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:21.030
I mean WhatsApp calls are encrypted so we setting up a tunnel across the damn central Internet.

20
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.370
So the intelligence is now in the endpoints rather than in the core network.

21
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:33.390
So notice the difference in the old days intelligence was in the network in devices were done that switch

22
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.720
round now core network is just high speed forwarding that's what the Internet should be doing.

23
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.710
High speed switching routing of traffic intelligence is in the edge not in the core.

24
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:52.800
So that was a whole industry that got revolutionized the PSTN public switch telephone network was intelligent

25
00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.690
endpoints were dumb intelligence was moved to the edge to the endpoints core became done all it was

26
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.450
doing is high speed forwarding of traffic from a to b.

27
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.960
So I made a call from the UK to the US the core Internet routers are just trying to move the traffic

28
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.190
as quickly as possible from the UK to the US.

29
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.550
They don't understand the call setup process.

30
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.580
I mean WhatsApp again is setting up encrypted calls the telephone system in WhatsApp or in Skype is

31
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.490
out of the control of the core Internet.

32
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.730
OK.

33
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.320
So that's great.

34
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.580
But in networking for many years enterprise networking it didn't work that way.

35
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.470
We would have say Cisco IP phones on a network and they would mark their traffic as important but then

36
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.200
the network had the intelligence of saying okay this traffic is more important that traffic and then

37
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.770
we try to implement all kinds of clever stuff on the network.

38
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.260
So the applications were still done but the network was intelligent.

39
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.740
Notice where I'm going with us.

40
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.150
Network was intelligent.

41
00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:02.340
Applications were done from the point of view that a P.C. just sent traffic to its default gateway and

42
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.370
then the network took care of things.

43
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:11.400
Intelligence and the network endpoints were done a VM where and others changed this entirely.

44
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:19.410
So VM where purchased a company called the sera sera almost got bought by Cisco but in a datacenter

45
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:27.960
when we using ASX sign as an example from VM where they said OK we don't need an intelligent network

46
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:34.200
we will put the intelligence in the ASX ie servers in the service because the servers have visibility

47
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.850
of the applications running on them.

48
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:43.840
The server ASX AI server has visibility of the victims and the applications running on the server.

49
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.340
The network can't see the victims like the ASX ie server can.

50
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.950
So rather than having an intelligent network we make the network dumb just like the Internet.

51
00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:03.060
It doesn't have visibility of the applications and the VMs on the ASX ie server and what we do is we

52
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:10.690
set up tunnels across the core network so you could have and it doesn't matter could be Cisco writers

53
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.450
could be HP switches.

54
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.630
It doesn't matter your core network is simply there to rot as quickly as possible from one ASX ie server

55
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.490
to another E6 I server and we build what they call here an overlay network.

56
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:31.290
So we have our IP network traditional say IP version 4 and then we build a whole new network on top

57
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.420
of that called an overlay network.

58
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:39.420
This underlying network the physical network doesn't understand what's going on because all it sees

59
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:40.590
is tunnels.

60
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.010
Think of WhatsApp.

61
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:49.440
Think of IP SEC tunnels that you use across the Internet you can have the Internet and you build encrypted

62
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.640
tunnels across the Internet that connect to various sites.

63
00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:00.330
Two of your company so your company may have sites in the US and the UK in Canada in Japan whatever

64
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:06.420
you set up these VPN ends across the internet you would be very upset if the Internet writers could

65
00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.790
actually see inside your IP SAC tunnel.

66
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:16.960
The whole idea of encryption is to hide the internal network information from the core Internet network.

67
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.900
Same principle here.

68
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.700
Now we're not using typically encryption in a data datacenter they use rather than IP SEC tunnels or

69
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.130
geo re tunnels they use Vieques or land tunnels.

70
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:33.810
The whole idea of a vehicle land is think of a restriction in traditional switching we have a two to

71
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:41.730
one Q it's restricted to just over 4000 villains you can only have 4000 villains in a network now if

72
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:48.900
you running big ASX AI servers and you have lots of customers and then you have lots of departments

73
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:54.900
for lots of customers and they want a whole bunch of villains you run out of 4000 villains very very

74
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.600
quickly so vehicles land supports 16 million villains.

75
00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.910
And I say villains because that concept no longer exists.

76
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:10.040
Sixteen million subnets rather than 4000 subnets in order to have one key.

77
00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:15.320
So in a traditional switching network we would create up to 4000 villains.

78
00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:21.480
That's how we would implement security let's say by restricting who can talk to who based on villains

79
00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:28.030
or subnets but in a traditional switched environment we kind of limited that doesn't scale to a data

80
00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.480
center.

81
00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.870
So in a data center they want to use this whole concept and let me go over it again just to make sure

82
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:39.360
that it's clear we have a core network could be Cisco routers Cisco switches.

83
00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:44.360
Notice the politics here because VMware and the Sierra basically changed the game.

84
00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:49.780
The core network now doesn't have to be fancy because it's going to be like the internet.

85
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:57.270
I just need the core routers to route traffic from one year six I service a one VM with server to another

86
00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:01.890
VM with server and just assume we got a whole bunch of them with servers these VM where servers will

87
00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:08.720
set up tunnels to each other automatically they're not encrypted but it's the same concept.

88
00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:14.400
They will set up a tunnel from one year six ice over to another year six ice server and they will use

89
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:20.310
a totally different subnet totally different network just like you if you setting up a VPN across the

90
00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:25.090
Internet we'll use a different subnet different IP addressing to the core Internet.

91
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.050
You can rot or if C 1918 addresses across the Internet.

92
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.170
Agreed.

93
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:37.410
If you use a tunnel so the outside IP address would be a public IP address when you're riding from one

94
00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:40.050
rider to another using an IP cell tunnel across the Internet.

95
00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:46.200
But the inside IP addresses could be already 1918 addresses the core Internet doesn't see that data

96
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:53.490
because it's encrypted so the whole idea in a data center is the core network could be very simple basic

97
00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.590
subletting.

98
00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:56.050
We don't need villains.

99
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:58.410
We can run routing everywhere.

100
00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:04.860
So this solved another problem because let's say we want to have a VM on one ASX ice server and another

101
00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:10.650
VM on another year yes expensive but we want them in the same villain same deal and same broadcast domain.

102
00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:17.300
They must be layer 2 connection between these two VMs that own different servers.

103
00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:18.850
Now you might say why would you want to do that now.

104
00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:26.070
Think about V motion the V motion is something that allows you to move a VM automatically if you want

105
00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:30.540
from one physical ASX AI server to another ASX AI server.

106
00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:35.980
So when the load on the server gets too high it can automatically migrate to the VM to another 6 ISO

107
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.490
over to use resources on this ASX AI server.

108
00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:44.130
But the problem is you've now moved the VM from one server to another server but you want to keep them

109
00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:51.000
in the same VLAN so what happens if I move it to that server over there using the motion across a network.

110
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:57.810
Now traditionally we would have to run Layer 2 across this because that VM and this VM on the same subnet.

111
00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:04.620
So we need to have a layer 2 connection across but with this overlay network and this concept of doing

112
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:09.690
away with a clever core the core network can run writing protocols so we don't need spanning tree we

113
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:11.400
just run away SPF everywhere.

114
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.450
As an example.

115
00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:14.060
So it's a layer 3 network.

116
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:20.490
But this VM running on this year's x5 server and this VM running on this year's X ie server can be in

117
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:25.560
the same subnet because they are connected across a tunnel.

118
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.300
So this piece could have an IP address of 10 1 1 2 this piece.

119
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:36.420
You could have an IP address of 10 1 1 1 24 let's say when a broadcast is sent by this P.C. it goes

120
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:40.650
into the tunnel centre across the tunnel to that P.C. on the other side.

121
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:45.720
It gets complicated with broadcasts and multicast but just think of the concept that these two devices

122
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:52.420
on the same VLAN when in actual fact they're not same villain because this infrastructure is routed.

123
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:59.680
So we are basically pulling a cable logically from that VM on that E6 I server to this VM on this is

124
00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:04.800
X I said so logically you to Ethan a cable from one side to the other but it's just a tunnel created

125
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.340
using Vieques land.

126
00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:07.600
I went into a lot of detail here.

127
00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:13.250
Let me just summarize overlay network is a network that's both on top of an underlying network under

128
00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:17.060
a network of physical devices which could be Cisco rather than switches.

129
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:22.320
Yes it's high from the hardware will bold and it's actually NSX.

130
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:29.850
It's not yes excites NSX is the product that does this NSX will build a whole new network and overlay

131
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:36.180
network across the underlying network this underlying network doesn't understand what's going on with

132
00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:37.620
an overlay network.

133
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:44.610
As an analogy again think of this underlay as the Internet and the overlay network as your VPN tunnels

134
00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:46.310
going across the Internet.

135
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:51.960
The core routers don't have visibility of the traffic that you encrypting through your IP SEC tunnels

136
00:10:52.590 --> 00:11:00.780
that call Cisco routers and switches in a data center don't have visibility of the VM traffic going

137
00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.700
through a vehicle and tunnel.

138
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:04.880
All they see is this.

139
00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:10.050
Yes excised server wants to talk to this iOS 6 AI server or this is X I server wants to talk to that

140
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:18.030
yes X I said they don't understand that it's actually a VM running within this year's X I server that's

141
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:21.210
talking to VM within that iOS 6 AI server.

142
00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.570
So we basically tunneling traffic across.

143
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:33.230
Now I'm gonna add some videos from my NSX and overlays course there are other vendors that also do this.

144
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:34.380
Again it's optional.

145
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:38.760
So if you want to watch that stuff then feel free to see the small practically.

146
00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:43.890
I've been dealing with this stuff for a long time but it's now great to see that it's coming to the

147
00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:44.640
CCN CCMA.
