00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.760
Now the terms used to in network address translation can be very confusing.

2
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:10.820
This is probably one of the hardest things to understand with Nat so use these terms inside a local

3
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:18.110
address inside global address outside local address an outside global address to try and help you remember

4
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.130
these terms.

5
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.350
Think of the following analogy.

6
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:27.380
The PC in this typology PC one is an insider in your organization.

7
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:34.700
Insiders in your organization are people who work for your company or who have access to the Insight

8
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.970
Network or local area network.

9
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.290
So this PC is an inside host or insider.

10
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.450
The server on the other hand is an outsider.

11
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.150
It doesn't belong to your organization.

12
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.550
It's on the global Internet.

13
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:57.610
It is an out site host the network that the PC is connected to is the local area network.

14
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.660
This is a local LAN or local network.

15
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:08.390
If you run wireshark on the network and captured packets they would be deemed to be local addresses

16
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.740
because they are on the local LAN.

17
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.560
The Internet on the other hand once again is global.

18
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:22.900
Think of traces in the Internet as global addresses because they are on the global Internet.

19
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.430
So in other words think of addresses as follows.

20
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:34.460
Inside a local is the IP address of this inside host on the local LAN inside.

21
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:43.570
Global is the IP address of the local PC PC one as seen on the global Internet.

22
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:52.880
If he sniffed traffic on a local LAN you would see the inside local address of the PC if you sniffed

23
00:01:52.910 --> 00:02:01.790
traffic using Y shack on the internet you would see the inside global address of the PC outside a local

24
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.910
is the IP address of the outside server.

25
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:14.860
When seen on the local area network outside global is the IP address of the server on the global Internet.

26
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.780
So in summary this is an insight host.

27
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.320
So we have an inside local address an inside global address the inside hosts IP address on the local

28
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.890
area network is an inside local address.

29
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:36.380
Thus inside hosts IP address when seen on the global Internet is the inside global address inside host

30
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.650
on local network inside host on global Internet.

31
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.510
This outside PCs IP address when seen on the global Internet uses the outside global address but when

32
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.140
seen on the local area network is the outside a local address.

33
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.770
I hope that helps you remember the terms.
