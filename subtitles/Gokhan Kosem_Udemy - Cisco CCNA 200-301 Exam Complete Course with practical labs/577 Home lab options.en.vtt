Now for whom lab you can actually build a point to point serial link without A C issue D issue.

2
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:16.340
So in the real world you would connect the DTC side of the cable to the router and the DCs side of the

3
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:23.900
cable to a C issue D issue but for home labs you can actually use a back to back serial cable.

4
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:31.970
So in the real world you would connect the DTV side of the cable to the router and the DC side to this

5
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:40.790
issue the issue but a back to back cable has a DC side and DTV side and has connectors that allow you

6
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.220
to directly attach to routers to each other.

7
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:52.310
So this provides a back to back cable the cable side determines whether you have the DTV or DC side

8
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:53.990
connected to the router.

9
00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:00.920
So internally the cable is crossing the connection in a similar way to a crossover cable anything at

10
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:08.870
the command show controllers serial and your serial interface number will allow you to determine whether

11
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.940
you have the DC side or DTC side of the cable.

12
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.500
And I'll demonstrate that in a moment.

13
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.150
So for the real world they are different types of cables.

14
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.900
You have what are called thirty five cables.

15
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:27.080
Here's an example of a 35 DTV cable which is the male side of the connector.

16
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:34.190
You could connect a cable to a cable to create to the back to back connection but it's easier these

17
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.720
days just to buy pre-built tabac cables.

18
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:45.370
Here's an example of a 21 female DC cable and DTG male connector.

19
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.140
What you'll notice is that the male side is the key and the female side is the DC.

20
00:01:52.430 --> 00:02:04.060
Here's an example of an EIA TR 83 to cable both DC and DTV as well as EIA T.I. a 4 4 9 DC and DTV.

21
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:11.090
Once again in a lab you probably just want to connect the devices using a pre-built back to back cable

22
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.730
and you can buy these from E-bay as an example.
