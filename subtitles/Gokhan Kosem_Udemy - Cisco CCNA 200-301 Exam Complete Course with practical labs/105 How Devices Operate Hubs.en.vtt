00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Now that we’ve look briefly at cabling

2
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I’d like to explain how network devices operate.

3
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And the first device that we're going to look at is hub

4
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
a hub is a layer 1 device in the OSI model and you would use a Cat5

5
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
unshielded twisted pair cable with an RJ-45 connector

6
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
to connect your laptop as an example to a port on a hub.

7
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
hubs aren't very popular today and have been superseded by

8
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
switches and I'll explain in a few minutes why.

9
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
But for now lets assume that you are connecting your PC to a hub.

10
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
It’s important that you understand how a hub operate

11
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
however because wireless operates in the same way, like a physical hub would.

12
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So when your connected to a wireless network you’ll often encounter

13
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
the same issues that you would encounter when connecting to a physical hub.

14
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So for now lets assume that you are connecting your PC physically to a hub

15
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
hubs have multiple ports and thus multiple devices

16
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
can be connected to a hub at the same time.

17
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The number of ports available depends on the hub model

18
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
but as you can see in both of this examples

19
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
a hub has various ports that you can connect devices to.

20
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
So in this topology let’s assume that you have 4 devices connected to a hub

21
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
on ports 1 to 4, it's important to realize that a hub is a physical layer device.

22
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
It’s not intelligent and does not understand the frames going through it.

23
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
It's basically a multi port repeater and it will amplify

24
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
or repeat the frames that it receives on 1 port out of all other ports.

25
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So it's once again simply a multi port repeater with no intelligence.

26
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
The physical topology of a hub is a star topology.

27
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
In a star topology you have a central device

28
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
which in this case is a hub and devices hanging off that central device

29
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
as spokes which resemble the spokes in the bicycle wheel.

30
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Each spoke devices connected to the central device with its own cable and all

31
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
transmission or communications between devices are through the central device.

32
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
In other words if A wants to communicate with C the traffic will flow

33
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
through the hub and will not flow directly between the 2 devices.

34
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
There were some major advantages to using hubs and UTP rather than 10base2.

35
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
The first advantage is a cable break, if a cable broke in this topology

36
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
it would only affect device A and it would not affect the rest of the network.

37
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
In a 10base2 if a cable broke it would affect all devices in that network.

38
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Here however, other devices such as C and B can still communicate

39
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
even though the cable is broken to device A.

40
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Another advantages that you can extend distances easily.

41
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
A bus topology is limited in size in a 10baseT environment

42
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
such as this, the distance between a device such as A and the hub

43
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
needs to be 100 meters but you can extend the distance by adding another hub.

44
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.000
In other words you add another multiple repeater and repeat or regenerate

45
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
the signal to extend the distance of the network to distances greater than 100 meters.

46
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
So in this example, E could be 100 meters away from its hub

47
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and the 2 hubs could be 50 meters apart.

48
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
So in this example we've extended the network

49
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
further than the restriction of a 100 meters.

50
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
So device E could be 100 meters from its hub

51
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
it could be a cable length a 50 meters between the 2 hubs

52
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and A could be a 100 meters away from its hub.

53
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
A network now has a length of 250 meters

54
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
which is well over the limitation of a 100 meters.

55
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Now their are restriction on the number of hubs

56
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
that you can daisy chain together, but the point is, it's possible

57
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:17.000
to extend the topology by adding more hubs and more devices to the network.

58
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
These were therefore great reasons to move away from 10base2

59
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000
and 10base5 and implement UTP or untwisted pair networks using hubs.

60
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Another advantage is that UTP cabling is cheaper and easier to manage

61
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and therefore it became common to use

62
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
hubs and 10baseT rather than 10base2 or 10base5 in the past.
