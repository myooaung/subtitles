00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:10.400
Now unlike FedEx or DHL we're not sending physical packages between network devices we're sending packets.

2
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.860
So how does a phone indicate to a switch that its traffic is of great importance.

3
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.040
And how does one switch indicate to another switch that some packets are more important than others.

4
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:31.020
So this is called classification and marking a phone would classify its own traffic as being important

5
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.470
but the traffic from a P.C. would be classified as not being important.

6
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.080
A switch can be configured with access lists or it could use other technologies such as Anbar or network

7
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:51.660
based application recognition to recognize certain applications such as HDP or voice traffic or video

8
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.320
traffic and then pro tries that traffic accordingly.

9
00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:03.570
So essentially a phone sees its own traffic as important but not the traffic of a P.C. a switch or a

10
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.600
router has many options that you can use to put traffic into classes.

11
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.200
Again you could use an access list or network based application recognition but once you've put your

12
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.660
traffic into a class so as an example the phone says its traffic is important.

13
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.110
It's voice traffic.

14
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.850
It needs to mark the traffic and send it to the first switch.

15
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.040
So all packets are sent from the phone to the switch need to be marked as important.

16
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:39.210
Now that can be done at a layer to using editor at 1 Q So on Ethernet we would require attitude at one

17
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.650
Q links and in the editor to one Q header we can change what's called the Cost field or plus of service

18
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:54.810
field to indicate the importance of the traffic that is known as 82 two to one P or edited to 1 priority

19
00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:02.310
but we could also use MPEG less experimental bits to indicate that the traffic is important at least

20
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:10.470
three in the IP header we've got IP precedents and differentiated services code points or DCP IP explicit

21
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.210
congestion notification or ECM can also be used but that's not covered in the CCN a course the layer

22
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.660
two and layer three parameters are the ones that you should concentrate on for the CCMA exam so layer

23
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.780
two we have added to the one Q or editor the one PE class of service but there are three bits in the

24
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.490
header which equate it to eight classes of service in the range 0 to 7.

25
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.730
So let's look at that practically.

26
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.590
I'm gonna capture traffic on this link between the phone and the switch

27
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.890
so why shock is capturing traffic

28
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.330
now this phone icon is actually in austere not a node which is a packet generator

29
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:08.190
in the packet a generator I can specify the protein bits of an attitude at one Q header.

30
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:17.180
Notice the values of from 0 to 7 because this is a phone I'm going to set the priority to 5 click okay

31
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.400
and then I'm going to start generating packets of packets of being sent into the network.

32
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:33.060
These are UDP packets that I'm sending so here's one of the packets that have been generated and notice

33
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:39.540
that Ethernet to we have a source and destination MAC Address we are generating an attitude at one Q

34
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.500
frame and in the edit to the one Q frame.

35
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:50.250
Notice we've got a priority field so the priority field or cost field consists of three binary bits

36
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.930
in the range 0 0 0 up to 1 1 1.

37
00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:02.310
In other words in the range 0 2 7 there are eight binary values that we can configure and in this case

38
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.600
offset the value to five to indicate voice traffic.

39
00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:16.780
So back in Austin Noto I'll change the cost value to seven and what I'll do is generate more frames.

40
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.730
So scrolling down to the latest frames.

41
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:29.290
Notice the party but is three binary ones which equates to network control in this case a filter for

42
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.890
UDP in the previous frame it showed up as video.

43
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.940
In other words we require low latency and jitter.

44
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:46.420
Now that's used by Cisco phones to indicate important voice traffic the SRM D guide has some recommendations

45
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:55.000
for what you should mock traffic as so act layer to causal NPL is experimental but a course of five

46
00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:02.940
is what she used for voice video Cisco recommend using a cost value for mission critical data should

47
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.190
have a cost value of three calls signaling to set up telephone calls should have a cost value of three

48
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.020
and then it goes all the way down to best effort which has a cost value of zero.

49
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:22.770
So as an example if we were sending calls signaling something like SAP or a should 3 the car's value

50
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.820
should be set to 3.

51
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:32.340
So we should set the course value here to 3 and generate some frames.

52
00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:40.230
And it is over here that cost value is set to three binary 0 1 1 decimal is 3.

53
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:45.790
Now applications should follow the conventions but sometimes they don't.

54
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:49.040
And this is where the trust boundary is important.

55
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.440
Would you trust your users to set their quality of service correctly.

56
00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:01.080
Typically not in this case the switch can trust the markings that it receives from the phone but not

57
00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.560
necessarily the markings that it receives from this P.C..

58
00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.480
So again they are different ways to mock.

59
00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.650
We can market layer two in Ethernet frames using an editor the one Q header.

60
00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:18.370
As I've demonstrated there are eight classes in the range 0 to 7.

61
00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:27.270
We can also mark type of service which is at least three so in the type of service header.

62
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:33.900
There are eight binary bits and in the old days we used to have what is called IP precedents which marked

63
00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.650
the most significant three bits.

64
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:43.140
Today we use differentiated services code points or serve bits which is a marking of the most significant

65
00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:44.650
six bits.

66
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:51.690
I'll talk about this in more detail in a moment but just to demonstrate it what we could do is under

67
00:06:51.690 --> 00:07:03.370
the IP header we can set a type of service or DCP Valley so if we send a frame into the network notice

68
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:09.430
at least two we have the editor of one Q header set to a cost value of 3.

69
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:18.250
But at least 3 we have a differentiated services code point set in this example to expedited forwarding

70
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.040
or 46.

71
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:28.570
So we've marked one two three four five six but in the IP header explicit congestion notification the

72
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:35.740
last 2 bits here are not used and you don't need to know ECM for the CCMA exam but notice the type of

73
00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:44.200
service field in the IP for header is 8 but since size IP precedence uses the most significant three

74
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:49.510
bits differentiated services code points uses the most significant six bits.

75
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:55.410
ESPN uses the least significant two bits and that's what we can see here.

76
00:07:55.420 --> 00:08:00.300
Here's an example of DCP and ESPN.

77
00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:02.570
Notice this is just a standard IP packet.

78
00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.990
We have source address destination address.

79
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:13.660
We have the protocol being UDP but one of the fields is the tops field or type of service field which

80
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.360
consists of DCP and ECM.

81
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:16.840
Today.
