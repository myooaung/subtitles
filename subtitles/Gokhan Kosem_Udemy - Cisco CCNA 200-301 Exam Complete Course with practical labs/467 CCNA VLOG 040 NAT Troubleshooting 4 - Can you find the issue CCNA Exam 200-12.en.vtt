00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:17.320
This is one of multiple videos discussing that or network address translation in the video we are troubleshooting

2
00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.240
a next issue.

3
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:27.190
We've been told that hosts on the inside network in other words these hosts which are being represented

4
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:37.620
by one wrote a four and wrote a five I'm not able to ping 8 8 8 8 which is a Google DNS server.

5
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.410
And in this example that's being represented by router 3.

6
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.140
So we have the inside and the outside network router.

7
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:57.990
Two in this topology is on next to Rodda So lets connect to of one which is acting as Host 1 and see

8
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:05.700
if it can ping 8 8 8 8 getting an unreachable message in the output here.

9
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.900
Let's have a look at the writing table.

10
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:19.620
The Shradha has a default gateway configured as 10 datt 1 to 1 2 2 5 4 that is wrote 2 in the typology

11
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:28.820
which is on that Rodda Serrato one acting as host one is able to get to the NAT router but it doesn't

12
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.390
look like it's able to get to the Google Rodda.

13
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.130
So you can see in the output here it's reached 10 1 1 2 5 4.

14
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.490
But it doesn't look like it can get any further.

15
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.510
Now just speed things up.

16
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.460
I'm going to use the no IP domain lookup command.

17
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.900
And then let's do that trace again.

18
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.890
So you can see it gets to default gateway but can't get any further than that.

19
00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:02.290
Let's have a look at the default gateway and see what's happening with the net translations.

20
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.240
So this is rodded to show IP not translations.

21
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.570
There are no net translations at the moment.

22
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.890
Show IP not statistics.

23
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.820
So looking at the statistics we can see that they have been translations in the past.

24
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:20.840
Outside interfaces.

25
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:30.010
Gigabit is 0 1 which is this interface facing the Rodda acting as Google inside interfaces or gigabit

26
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.310
to 0 0 0 2 and 0 3.

27
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:40.350
In other words these interfaces over here a dynamic mapping has been configured for inside source address

28
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.790
translation.

29
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.750
We've got a access list pointing to a net pool called Nat Poole.

30
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.790
Can any of the other internal Rajahs ping Google.

31
00:02:51.870 --> 00:03:04.750
So this is Route for all so getting unreachable to a debug IP not on route to we see a problem here

32
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.260
saying that NAT translation failed dropping the packet.

33
00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.600
So we getting a dropped packet from 10 1 to 2

34
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:23.000
which is this router Let's have a look at Route one again.

35
00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.270
So this product couldn't trace to Google.

36
00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.090
Let's see what happens here.

37
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.120
We also are getting a NAT translation failure.

38
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:42.460
So let's have a look at the configuration gigabit 0 one is configured with this IP address and it's

39
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:49.960
configured as the outside address show run interface geek if it's 0 0 as an example.

40
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:58.160
It's configured with this IP address and it's configured as the inside not to address show run piping

41
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.150
Plude Nat.

42
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.780
So these are the statements on the interfaces telling us which interfaces are inside and outside.

43
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.930
If I do a show run pipe include access.

44
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.110
Can you see the problem.

45
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.670
OK so I notice the statement IP Nat inside source list 1 Paul Knecht.

46
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:26.940
Paul in other words we are saying that any traffic matching access list one which is permitting anything

47
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.170
will be netted according to this Nat Poole called Nat Poole.

48
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:39.950
But notice your IP Nat Poole Nat pole instead of a NAT poll is being used.

49
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:47.300
So everything else looks good except we've got a spelling mistake on the Nat Poole name.

50
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.940
So let's fix that.

51
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.430
No no.

52
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.700
Remove this command.

53
00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.530
So no IP net Poole.

54
00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.180
And then I'll edit that to make it correct.

55
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.760
So at the extra O.

56
00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:14.320
So show run piping clewed not this Nat Poole reference by the IP that statement now exists in the configuration.

57
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.100
So let's try to do that ping again.

58
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:27.800
Ping succeeds and notice we can see that 10 1 1 1 which is this Rodda was nattered 2 8 2 8 8 8 to 10

59
00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:34.850
which is the first IP address in the net pool for traffic going to 8 8 8 8 8.

60
00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:42.470
And then when the return traffic came back the address was invited back to the internal address of the

61
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.530
router show IP Nat translation.

62
00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.100
Shows us that.

63
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:53.150
So inside a local address is being netted to the inside global address the outside addresses not being

64
00:05:53.160 --> 00:06:06.020
nattered So host one can ping Google and we see the NAT translation taking place host for can also ping

65
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.150
Google but come.

66
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.290
And we've also got another host to host five if you like.

67
00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:18.410
Well Rodda five acting as our third host.

68
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:25.490
Can it ping Google yes it can.

69
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.160
So that was an example of how to troubleshoot.

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:34.670
