00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:09.100
Say him out to rodders Let's have a look at the logging levels show logging on Rodda 1.

2
00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:17.630
There's the command console logging by default is enabled the level these debugging other places where

3
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.200
you can log on the monitor.

4
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:28.850
That's typically when you telnet to a device buffer at the moment the buffer logging is disabled

5
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.820
trap logging which is used with the log server is set to the informational level.

6
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:45.380
So I noticed console these debugging level that's level 7 trap logging is set by default on this router

7
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.760
to informational which is Level 6.

8
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:58.550
So write it to show logging or show logging rather.

9
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.850
Now this Shradha hasn't been changed.

10
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.370
This is the defaults.

11
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:11.110
So consulate's level 7 monitor is level 7 buffer is disabled and trap.

12
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.780
In other words sending to a slug is set to informational.

13
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.730
So let's see what happens when we make some changes on the rods.

14
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:29.440
I'll configure an IP address on each Rodda so no shut the interface.

15
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.830
Notice what happens when not type when the interface comes up.

16
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.260
In this case the text is Rijk copied.

17
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.180
But on most routers by default it will not be recopied.

18
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.810
The reason it's done here is because I'm running the Shradha within ingenius 3 and

19
00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:01.270
and by default on this Jinnah's 3 Rodda this command logging synchronous was typed on the console.

20
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:10.650
So if I type do show run and have a look at the console of this Rodda what you'll notice is that logging

21
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:16.620
synchronous has been enabled which means when I'm typing a command I'm not interrupted and I'll just

22
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:23.660
demonstrate that again if I type interface loop back at 0 and then start tapping the IP address.

23
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.830
Notice the command is retyped.

24
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:40.660
On the console However if I go to the console of this router and type no logging synchronous and then

25
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:50.310
type interface loop back to zero and start typing noticed my text is not recopied it's stuck up there.

26
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:59.910
So I need to press tab as an example to see what I was typing so generally you're going to want to type

27
00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.730
logging synchronous on your console so that your text is recopied.

28
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.880
I'll enable OSPF on these routers.

29
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.780
Areas zero

30
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:25.390
just to make it simple all enable OSPF on all interfaces.

31
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.190
Just before I enable that.

32
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.620
On the other router I'm going to enable P.F. adjacencies.

33
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.900
And he'd enter on the right hand side Rodda

34
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.760
noticed on the left hand side Rodda I'm getting a lot of output on the interface because I've enabled

35
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.190
debugging on Rodek T.

36
00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.000
I'm not getting any output because I haven't enabled debugging

37
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.240
so it when I'm seeing a lot of information.

38
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.050
So show

39
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:19.810
IPO is OSPF neighbors an example shows me my neighbor relationship on Broadway too.

40
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:30.840
I just got a Level 5 notification saying that the neighbor relationship came up so Level 5 is a notice

41
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.690
which is normal but significant conditions.

42
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.880
So I was informed that a neighbor relationship came up but nothing else was displayed whereas on Radio

43
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:50.770
1 because I unable to always P.F. adjacency debugging I'm seeing a lot of output on the console of this

44
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.660
Rodda.

45
00:04:52.930 --> 00:05:02.240
And the reason it displays on the console is that I have a debugging level of logging on the console.

46
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:07.270
So when you enable debugging you see the output as do the test again.

47
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:13.460
So on the interface all shut fast Ethan it is 0 0 on Rodda 2.

48
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.680
So I see logging information that the adjacency went down.

49
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.760
Level 5 interface went down.

50
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.990
Level five message line protocol has gone down.

51
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.660
Level five.

52
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:31.150
Message when I know shut the interface again.

53
00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:36.210
Notice I see a lot of output on Radu one.

54
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:45.350
And once again that's because I am labeled debugging so if on top showed debug you can see that I was

55
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:54.340
adjacency debugging has been enabled and the level of logging is set at level 7.

56
00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:09.220
If I however changed logging on the console to level 3 level series error conditions as an example what

57
00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.410
would happen now.

58
00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:24.050
When I do the same test so shut to the interface on Rodda to oh no shut it on Broadway one show de-bug.

59
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.860
I'm still running the OSPF debugging.

60
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.100
But notice I'm not seeing debug messages on the console.

61
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:40.820
Show IP OSPF neighbor shows me that my neighbor relationship has come up and I can see that on rodded

62
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.830
to which she's still using

63
00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.130
Level 7 debugging on the console.

64
00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:56.840
But I don't see that on Rotto one because I've changed the debugging to level 3.

65
00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:04.970
In other words errors I could once again change that to level 7.

66
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:06.280
And let's use a word.

67
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:15.500
So debugging one last test shut the interface relationship is torn down.

68
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:16.940
Bring the interface up again.

69
00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:25.030
And notice once again I see the debugging on Rotto one because I've changed to the logging level to

70
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:25.720
level 7.
