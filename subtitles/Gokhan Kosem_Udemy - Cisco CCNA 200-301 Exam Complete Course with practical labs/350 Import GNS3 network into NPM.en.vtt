1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.160
So on network is working.

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:12.890
So we've integrated the NPM VM with our Jeana's three typology we've tested IP connectivity.

3
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.490
So now we can connect to NPM and log in.

4
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:27.600
So your role to use these local host Colan the 787 or alternatively the hostname of your PC the default

5
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.850
user name is admen the default password is no password.

6
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:41.340
In other words blank that shown here and you can change that by going to Settings Manager accounts.

7
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.130
I'm going to log in with those default values.

8
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.890
And now we can start on Network Discovery.

9
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:58.950
Some of the click start we can discover devices by using a small subnet such as slushed 24 or by specifying

10
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.020
individual IP addresses.

11
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:09.960
I'm going to add a range of addresses 10 dot one day at one hundred one to ten dot one dot 100 dots

12
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.350
three

13
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.420
and click next.

14
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.100
Well make this a bit bigger so it's easier to read

15
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.120
next week told that NPM can check all nodes.

16
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.420
Currently polling with agents for updates by selecting this option.

17
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.430
All nodes currently polling via an agent will be polled for updates.

18
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.960
The setting is helpful when using scheduled discoveries to keep agent updates current.

19
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.450
So I want to select that option and click next.

20
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:53.910
Do we want to log in to ESX sigh so we can pull a VM Ware and add Alvie Santal ESX credentials.

21
00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.600
I'm going to click next now by default SMP or simple network management protocol.

22
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.200
Will you use a public and private community value for accessing devices.

23
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.600
Now we configured all routers

24
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.770
so show run pipe.

25
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:22.130
Include SMP with a community value of NPM So we need to add a new credential here

26
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.270
the value is going to be NPM click ADD.

27
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.940
So there it is.

28
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:42.680
Next we can add Windows credentials if we want to allow solar winds NPM to collect CPQ memory and volume

29
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.590
data from Windows servers that don't support as an MP.

30
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.010
For now I'm not going to do that.

31
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.440
I'm going to click next.

32
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.970
We asked how we would like to set up what 2 monitors.

33
00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:02.100
Manually set up monitoring devices are discovered automatically Monitor based on my defined monitoring

34
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.490
settings.

35
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.640
I'm going to leave it at that the default of manual click next.

36
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.360
Now at any point you can go back through the wizard.

37
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:22.950
So at the moment Aamodt discovery settings could click back to go to monitoring settings so as an example

38
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:33.230
I might want to include devices that respond to pings alone clicked Next details of my discovery as

39
00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.490
shown here.

40
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:41.690
I'm going accept the defaults and click Next I'm asked how often I want to do the polling that could

41
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.450
be hourly daily or other options.

42
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.730
I'm going to select one only and I want to run the Discovery right now.

43
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:50.830
So click.

44
00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.610
Discover the discovery process is then started.

45
00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.270
And you can see here are three notes have been discovered.

46
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:08.620
You can see the overall progress indicator so at this point 3 broad as were discovered and one Windows

47
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.080
7 workstation was discovered.

48
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.420
Click next.

49
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.450
Now which interfaces should be monitored by default up interfaces are monitored.

50
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.950
The port.

51
00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:27.660
Mode of trunk access will unknown is going to be monitored and physical virtual and unknown interfaces

52
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.900
are going to be monitored.

53
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.510
We can see a list of interfaces as an example.

54
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.100
On Grado one first Ethan it is 0 0 is up.

55
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.980
But first Ethan at one slash is zero he's down.

56
00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:49.570
So my various interfaces including serial interfaces are shown here of the interfaces are also listed

57
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:55.500
such as node 0 as well as the loop back into faces of the devices.

58
00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:05.390
As an example show I.P interface brief on Rotto one shows a list of interfaces so you can see the first.

59
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.830
Ethan interfaces and serial interfaces.

60
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.670
So that interface information is being picked up by the solar winds.

61
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.770
NPM application.

62
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:26.670
Click next on my PC I can view ram a virtual memory fixed disk space and other options.

63
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.100
Here's the import preview so we can decide what we want to import.

64
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:36.770
I'm going import my routers as well as the Windows machine and you can see that information is now being

65
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.520
imported into the database.

66
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:49.530
The import has finished so I'm going to click Finish going to my dashboards summary.

67
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:58.480
I can see that I have three Cisco routers route a one two and three

68
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.260
and unknown device has also been picked up.

69
00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:10.200
That is the additional IP address on my local Windows PC.

70
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:15.960
I can also see that I have issues connecting to Google dot com as an example.

71
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:26.530
So let's click on one of the radhe radhe a one you can see the notice up can see the IP address machine

72
00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:37.320
type description and other information about the Rodda including as an example interface utilization.

73
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.230
That's how you get NPM integrated with a genius 3 network.

74
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:47.870
Not only is APM a very powerful application and we look at some of the features as we go through the

75
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:55.160
course but it also helps to learn practically simple network management protocol and the management

76
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.950
of network devices using a management station.
