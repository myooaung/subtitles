00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:16.910
In this video we going to discuss IP version 6 access control lists or IP v 6 AC ls on the same way

2
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:24.050
as with IP version for IP vs 6 access control lists allow you to permit or deny traffic in your network

3
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.650
and are a component of a layered security model.

4
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.600
Why security breach.

5
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:42.540
In the real world you don't necessarily just want to use access control lists for your security.

6
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:49.420
You want to implement firewalls and other mechanisms such as intrusion prevention systems or IP addresses

7
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:57.940
but access lists are typically a first line of defense in security implementations not IP 6 access lists

8
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.330
share many of the same characteristics of IP version 4.

9
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.150
So the knowledge that you've gained when working with IP version for access lists can also be applied

10
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.790
to IP vs 6 access lists.

11
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:16.690
So they are very similar but there are differences between the two that you need to be aware of in this

12
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:24.550
topology I've got three Cisco Iowa's heavy routers running in Janus 3 the rods are configured per the

13
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:33.610
topology diagram notices an example that wrought a one on the left is able to paying the loop back of

14
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:45.430
rather three so we could ping the loop back directly like that or we could specify a source address

15
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:56.710
being the loop back of a one so right a one can ping the loop back of router 3 directly using the gigabit

16
00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:04.480
00 interface or using the loop back as the source of the traffic.

17
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:15.230
So in order to confirm t IP v 6 and there's a lot of options here but we'll specify access list and

18
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:22.590
let's call this access list 1 and press enter question mark shows us that we can permit or deny traffic

19
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.940
as an example.

20
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:37.800
So I'm going to permit a source network of 2001 colon 1 colon colon slash 64 going anywhere.

21
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.470
So in other words we're going to permit all traffic on this network but that doesn't include the loop

22
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:50.160
back of Route 1 or going to gigabit 00 and type IP vs sinks.

23
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:58.350
And again we have a lot of options but in this case we're going to use a traffic filter of ACL 1 inbound

24
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:07.920
So previously we were able to ping the loop back of rudder 3 from the loop back of wrought a 1 as well

25
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:17.820
as using the gigabit 00 interface so pinging the loop back of rudder 3 works but when we specify the

26
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:26.280
loop back as the source the ping doesn't work we've got a zero success rate whereas this way we've got

27
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.710
100 percent success rate so the Axis list is definitely working.

28
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:46.530
So show HPV 6 axis list shows us how axis list we can see that they are eleven matches so ping that

29
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.520
again we don't see any matches on this line.

30
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:58.030
The implicit deny is dropping the traffic fee paying this way.

31
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:05.420
We see the additional matches because the source traffic here is coming from 2001 colon 1.

32
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:19.150
And that's what we matching in this access list show IP vs 6 interface gigabit 00 shows us information

33
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:29.300
such as the link local address global unique cost address multicast groups that have been joined.

34
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:39.910
But notice Shia inbound access list is access list one ACL one so we can see the access list bound on

35
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.760
that interface.

36
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:49.450
So there was a simple example of an IP version 6 access list permitting and denying traffic.

37
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.750
That's an example of a standard access list.

38
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.300
