00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:07.320
Before doing a demonstration a quick recap of a writing table what is a writing table a writing table

2
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:15.270
is a list of networks that the reader knows about as well as information about how to reach those networks.

3
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.710
In other words a router may have a Network 10 1 1 0 or 24 in the routing table.

4
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:28.350
That entry may also contain information such as the outgoing local interface and the next top Rodda

5
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.180
to use to get to that destination.

6
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.670
Each entry in the writing table is a destination network.

7
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.520
If you are using a unique cost or writing protocol and once again includes the local interface to use

8
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.700
to get to the neighbor or the next hop to get to that destination.

9
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.780
Now there are various types of routes that are included in a writing table including directly connected

10
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.050
networks.

11
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.940
These networks are added to the writing table automatically and is a network that is directly connected

12
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.780
to one of the interfaces on the local router.

13
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.940
If the interface goes down well in other words fails or you shut down the interface.

14
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.630
In other words it's administratively down that a network is removed from the writing table.

15
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.550
The second type is static routes.

16
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.070
Static routes are routes that you as the administrator have manually added to the configuration of the

17
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.710
router.

18
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.660
Static Grotz are very good for small simple networks that don't change often.

19
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.700
However if your networks very large static routes don't work well because of the amount of work it is

20
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:42.840
to maintain those writing entries static Roths also do not dynamically adjust to changes in the network

21
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.980
topology.

22
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:50.220
So if you're telling a rodded to go right to get to a destination and the network is down the road it

23
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.340
will still send traffic to the right rather than going to the left as an example to get to the destination.

24
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.950
The third type is a default route.

25
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.720
You can manually configure a default route.

26
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.450
It's a special type of static route or a routing protocol can dynamically add it to the writing table

27
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.380
a default route is an optional route that is used when no explicit path to a destination is found in

28
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.780
the writing table.

29
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.510
So if a specific route like 10 1 1 0 slushed 24 is not in the writing table the default wrocht can be

30
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.380
used to get to the destination.

31
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:34.030
In this typology I have three routers Router one Rodda two to three I've configured loopback on each

32
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.570
router.

33
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.230
So quadruple one and right one could ripple to route it to quadruple three and rotatory first.

34
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:46.980
Ethan it is 0 0 on Rotto 1 and Rodda 2 is in the 10 1 1 0 slash 24 network.

35
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:59.730
If there is one on Rodda 2 and if 0 0 3 are in the 10 1 2 0 slushed 24 network has wrought a one show

36
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.860
IP interface brief.

37
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.570
I can see that IP address 10.0 wandered wondered.

38
00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:16.100
One is configured on first East and it is 0 0 and 1 dog wandered 1.1 is configured on loop back to 0.

39
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:23.680
Show IP route in the output we can see that two directly connected networks have been added to the writing

40
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:32.550
table of Rato one 10 1 1 0 slushed 24 is directly connected to Fost.

41
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.520
Ethan it is 0 0.

42
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:41.070
Its important to remember that routers and layer 3 switches route based on networks and subnets and

43
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.650
not based on IP addresses show run interface Fost.

44
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:54.360
Ethan It is 00 shows me that the IP address configured on FASA Ethan it is 0 0 is 10 that wandered wondered

45
00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:00.610
1 slash 24 but the IP address is not added to the writing table.

46
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:07.480
The network is added to the writing table as a directly connected network on fust.

47
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:15.690
Ethan it is 0 0 and its shown in the writing table we're denoted in the writing table as a C which means

48
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.780
connected network.

49
00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:24.710
When you add an IP address to an interface and that interface is up the road has added to the writing

50
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:25.270
table.

51
00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:34.660
So let's prove that interface loop back one IP address actually before I put the IP address on let's

52
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.790
have a look at the writing table do show IP ront.

53
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.120
Notice we only see two metrics in the writing table.

54
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:56.040
However if I configure an additional network so $1.1 1 to slash 32 on this new loopback and now use

55
00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:02.000
the command to show IP route notice we have a third route in the writing table.

56
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:13.840
We have 1.1 1.1 slashed 32 and 1.1 one to slash 32 this network is configured to loop back zero.

57
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.160
And this network is configured on loopback back one.

58
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:25.250
The reason these display as IP addresses is because we configure it a slash 32 mosque.

59
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.670
However here we configure configured to slash 24 mosque.

60
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:39.590
So we see tenders one but 1.0 So as another example interface loop back to IP Address 10 dot one and

61
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.900
let's make this 10 one slice 24.

62
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:52.430
What does that add to our writing table do show IP route notice slash 24 network is added to the writing

63
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.420
table because we used a slash 24 mosque on the site.

64
00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.890
The address if you need to face is shut down.

65
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.210
The rod is removed from the writing table.

66
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.430
So this route is currently in the writing table.

67
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:16.570
I'll shut it down to show IP route notice the network is removed because the interface has gone down.

68
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:24.000
No shut it interface comes up do you show IP route network is now available.

69
00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:32.520
However at the moment we do not have rats in the writing table for Rodda two and three.

70
00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.460
So lets add those ranched to the writing table.
