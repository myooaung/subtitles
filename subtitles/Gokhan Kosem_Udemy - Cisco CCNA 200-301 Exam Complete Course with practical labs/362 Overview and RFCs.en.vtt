00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.580
It's very important that you understand MIB's or management information bases.

2
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:14.680
Ideas or object identifiers and performance counters with in your role as a network manager and also

3
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.570
when working with network management applications with regard to understanding network protocols.

4
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.130
There are three key terms to understand.

5
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.690
Firstly MIBs all management information bases.

6
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.470
Secondly IDs or object identifies and performance counters or perf Mon.

7
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.900
Now in a lot of conversations network engineers use the term merb and Id interchangeably.

8
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.860
However it's important to make a distinction.

9
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.580
A MEB is a larger entity than an ID and an ID is included within a mob.

10
00:00:51.990 --> 00:01:00.540
A mob is a database used for managing entities in a network using protocols such as SMP objects in the

11
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:09.030
mob are defined using abstract Semitics notational Esan and the database is structured as a whole Rockhill

12
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.310
database or tree structure.

13
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.330
Each entry in the merb is addressed through an ID.

14
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:23.610
So as an example if a network manufacturer wanted to create a merb for polling environmental statistics

15
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.480
on a router.

16
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.410
The router manufacturer would include a merb with many different types of variables and statistics which

17
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:38.760
would give you a total view of that type of statistic for the device whereas an ID would be used for

18
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.590
polling a specific interface as an example with a specific object identifier.

19
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.390
And that's where the term ID comes from is an already see discussing the management information base

20
00:01:51.630 --> 00:02:00.850
or merb for network management of TZP IP based internets this RAFC obsoletes RAFC 11:58.

21
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:09.750
And it defines the second version of the merb to for use with network management protocols in a TCAP

22
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.830
IP network.

23
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:19.470
If she explains that a lot of detail about some of the groups that are available in the lab including

24
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:26.220
as an example the system group this contains four objects which you'll often see in network management

25
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:34.050
environments s'est contact system name says location and TSAs services and this provides contacted administrative

26
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:41.100
information regarding the managed node interfaces group contains information about interfaces as an

27
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.360
example.

28
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.450
Now you know why shock capture information was being sent back from a managed device.

29
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:55.510
In this case Rodda to to the network management station and notice it includes information such as 3

30
00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:02.820
6 to 1 2 and so forth doing a search in this RAFC too.

31
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:12.520
We can see information with that Hauraki valleys wonder 3.6 1.4 as an example in the obsoleted version.

32
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:22.110
Of this RAFC said the one that this RAFC replaced we could search for information and it would include

33
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:30.240
information such as this ISO organization diod the internet management system system descriptor.

34
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:38.970
So this is appended to an instance such identify of or a value like this indicates system descriptor.

35
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:52.580
So in this example notice the Hauraki 1 3 6 1 to 1 and then it changes to other values to to.

36
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.990
That's very difficult to look for information in an R-S.C. such as this.

37
00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.160
So it's easier to look at a browser for specific merb over ID information.

38
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:09.330
So rather than trying to work this out you could use a browser to see what this actually means.
