1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So let’s do a test

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
what happens if we move one of these ports into a different VLAN?

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Now earlier when I was doing this test I had some problem in GNS3.

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So what I’m gonna do is I’m gonna shut g0/2 down and g0/3.

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So the only interfaces that are now up are 0/0 and 0/1

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.000
in this topology, just to start with a simple network to make a point.

7
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So those interfaces are up, up the other interfaces are down.

8
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
What I'll also do actually is to shutdown any other interfaces

9
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
to make sure the things converge quicker.

10
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So I'll shut down that range and this range of interfaces

11
00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:04.000
sh ip int brief also shut down gigabit 3/0 - 3

12
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So sh ip interface brief

13
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
All our interfaces are shutdown except for those 2 interfaces

14
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
so gigabit 0/0, gigabit 0/1

15
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Is router 1 able to ping router 2?

16
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Yes it is but if we put this interface gigabit 0/1 into VLAN 2

17
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
what will happen with the pings?

18
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So switchport access vlan 2

19
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
now before I present here, notice the ping succeeds I'll repeat this 100 times.

20
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And then hit enter on the switchport access VLAN command.

21
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Notice the pings are starting to time out

22
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
so as soon as I moved the port from 1 VLAN to another

23
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
the devices are not able to communicate with each other.

24
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
sh spanning tree shows that

25
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
gigabit 0/1 is still in the learning phase of Spanning Tree

26
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
so we'll wait for a while for Spanning Tree to converge and then do the test again.

27
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
But what I’d like you to see is this, 2 devices were in the same subnet

28
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and at the same VLAN and they were able to ping each other

29
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
as soon as we moved one port to different VLAN

30
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
they were no longer able to ping each other.

31
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Spanning Tree is forwarding on the VLAN 2 on port gigabit 0/1

32
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000
it’s also forwarding on gigabit 0/0 on VLAN 1.

33
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000
So if we use the sh spanning tree summary command

34
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
we can see that VLAN 1 is forwarding

35
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
VLAN 2 is forwarding, there are no blocking ports

36
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
yet router 1 is not able to ping router 2

37
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and router 2 is not able to ping router 1.

38
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Because they are in separate VLANs.

39
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Is router 2 aware that it’s in a separate VLAN?

40
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000
The answer is no because no tagging information

41
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
or no VLAN information is gonna being sent on this port it’s an access port.

42
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
So we just a standard Ethernet frames.

43
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
There is no VLAN port information transmitted

44
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
on any of the frames going out on that port.

45
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Now to prove this.

46
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Let’s add some IP addresses into switch 1

47
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
so interface vlan 1 ip address 10.1.1.

48
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Let’s make it 254 and then  interface vlan 2 ip address 10.1.2.254

49
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
for the mask, now need to no shut both of those

50
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
so go back to vlan 1 and no shut it.

51
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000
So these are layer 3 Switch Virtual Interfaces on the switch.

52
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
we are basically creating a layer 3 IP address

53
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
on the switch for the relevant VLAN

54
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000
so as an example, this switch can ping router 1 on VLAN 1

55
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
it lost the first ping because of ARP

56
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
but switch 1 can ping router 1

57
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
it can’t ping router 2 because router 2

58
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
needs to be configured  with the right IP address for VLAN 2

59
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
but before I do that notice when I do a capture on that port

60
00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:01.000
traffic from the switch to the router is untagged

61
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
it's a standard Ethernet frame IP traffic

62
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
there is no tagging at all and as a last test

63
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
what I’ll do is configure router 2

64
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
so interface f0/0 ip address 10.1.2.2

65
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
so I’ve moved it from 1 subnet to another.

66
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Ping 2.2 the switch can ping router 2 on this port.

67
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Is the traffic tagged? So do the ping again.

68
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Filter for ICMP traffic, notice there is no tagging information at all.

69
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
It’s just standard Ethernet.

70
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
So what is the summary of this test?

71
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Their PCs in the topology are unaware of VLAN traffic

72
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
these are access ports or untagged ports.

73
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000
In other words 802.1Q tagging is not used on these ports.

74
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Can router 1 ping router 2?

75
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
so cannot ping 10.1.2.2

76
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
at the moment it won’t be able to

77
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000
because the routers don’t have default routes configured.

78
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
So I’m gonna turn off IP routing

79
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
on this routers to turn them into PCs with dumb devices

80
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and type IP default gateway

81
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
and in this case the default gateway router 2

82
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
will be this IP address on router 1

83
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
no IP routing that’s a command that turns an expensive router

84
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000
into a dumb device IP default gateway 10.1.1.254

85
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.000
so router 1 has a default gateway configured.

86
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Can it ping its default gateway?

87
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Yes it can, can it ping router 2?

88
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:10.000
At the moment it can and the reason why is that

89
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:18.000
on these switches IP routing is configured by default.

90
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000
However, if I type no IP routing which is true on a lot of switches.

91
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
The pings will not succeed because the switch is not doing Inter-VLAN routing.

92
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
To enable Inter-VLAN routing on a layer 3 switch such as this

93
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
or a physical switch you need the IP routing command

94
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
to route between the VLANs.

95
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
So to prove this on router 2

96
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:55.000
I’ll do a debug ip icmp so we can see if ICMP traffic is getting to the router.

97
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Do the ping again and notice there are the echo replies

98
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:08.000
we can do something similar on router 1 and there are the echo replies.

99
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000
debug ip packet will give us low information

100
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
I repeat this only once so we'll send 1 ping

101
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
which succeeded over there

102
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000
and what you can see is the packet was routed out of the router

103
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
and sent to the destination as an IP packet.

104
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
So in other words, this end devices connected to a switch

105
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
are unaware that the switch is using VLANs.

106
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
The configuration of the switches as follows.

107
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
sh run int g0/0

108
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
that port is using default config which

109
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
which means that it’s an access port in VLAN 1

110
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
gigabit 0/2 is an access port in VLAN 2.

111
00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000
IP routing is enabled and we’ve configured layer 3 IP addresses

112
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
on the 2 VLANs to allow the switch to route between their 2 VLANs

113
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
configured which in turn allows router 1 and router 2

114
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
to communicate with each other.

115
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Now if router 1 and router 3 are put into the same VLAN

116
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
and router 2 and router 4 are put into the same VLAN.

117
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
That kind of information needs to be communicated

118
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
from 1 switch to another using 802.1Q

119
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
So this port needs to be configured as a trunk port

120
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
so let’s prove that and then configure it.
