00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:20.110
This typology if PC one sends a broadcast way will it go so what will happen if we put this PC into

2
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:27.180
a separate Villon will broadcast be forwarded out of this port and this port.

3
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.610
So which one has no configuration at the moment.

4
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:38.880
So show MAC Address table we can see that a source MAC address was lent on could give it to 0 1 and

5
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.450
this MAC address was learnt on gigabit 00.

6
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.630
In other words the switch to back to the router as well as the ostinato device sending synthetic or

7
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:58.950
generated frames show Villon brief at the moment we only have the default villans gigabit 0 1 belongs

8
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.490
to villaine one.

9
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:10.380
So create a villain to and then go on to give it to 0 1 and top switch port access a villain to to put

10
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.260
that port into villain to show interface gigabit zero or one switch port.

11
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.550
This port is now in the land too.

12
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.870
We have moved to the PC into a separate LAN.

13
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.560
So what I'll do is stop Austria Nada and then started again.

14
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.700
So we're still generating frames.

15
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.170
These are broadcast frames that are being generated.

16
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:41.810
Do we see any traffic on that interface no broadcasts to being received on the interface.

17
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.310
What about the interface.

18
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:54.510
Again no broadcasts from the PC are being received even though the PC is sending the broadcasts

19
00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:04.430
because the switch has been configured with villans broadcasts received on this interface are not forwarded

20
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.840
out of gigabit to 0 2 0 0 0 because they are in separate villans.

21
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:19.330
But if we configured gigabit 00 as a trunk so we use the command switch port trunk encapsulation daat

22
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.770
one key switch port mode trunk.

23
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.830
What would happen now would broadcast be forwarded on that port.

24
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:38.370
So show interface could give it to 00 switch port it's configured for trunking.

25
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.790
It's operating as a trunk.

26
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.560
We can see that by tapping show interface trunk.

27
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:53.990
So gigabit 00 has been manually configured as a trunk would broadcast before it across that port.

28
00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:04.380
So this is the why shock capture on could give it a 0 0 0 from the switch to give it as 0 0 on the router.

29
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:13.140
And as you can see broadcast frames are being sent they are being put in TV land too.

30
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:22.120
In other words they are tagged with added to the one Q tag too because the traffic was sent on a port

31
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.740
in the land too.

32
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.440
So this port is an Access Port Vila and to them this is a trunk port.

33
00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:34.640
So on the trunk port they are tagged with the land too but broadcasts are being forwarded to the router.

34
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.990
The router however will not forward those broadcasts on.

35
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:45.560
So even if we can figure out the router as a rod on the stick it would still not forward the frame's.

36
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:54.490
So at the moment if it is 0 0 is configured with an IP address but even if we get the following and

37
00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:00.010
topped encapsulation top 1 Q and specified violent to

38
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:11.720
broadcast would not be received by the router but the router would not forward them on even if we configured

39
00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:23.170
an IP address of let's say 10 1 20 to 5 4 on that interface because routers don't forward broadcasts

40
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.870
by default.

41
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:33.900
So I've got this IP address configured on gigabit to 0 0 2 but if we do a capture on this interface

42
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:44.110
what you'll notice is no broadcasts are being forwarded on because road block broadcasts by default

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.170
