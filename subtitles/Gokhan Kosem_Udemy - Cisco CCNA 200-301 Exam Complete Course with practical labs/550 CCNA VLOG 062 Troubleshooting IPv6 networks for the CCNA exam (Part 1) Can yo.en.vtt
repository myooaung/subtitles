00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.570
This is one of a multiple IP version 6 troubleshooting videos.

2
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.580
We've been told that Rotto one in this typology cannot ping rotas 3.

3
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.330
So let's verify that he has wrote a one.

4
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:32.320
So let's ping 2001 face colon colon three pink doesn't succeed.

5
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:42.410
We get unbreachable messages now show IP ROFFT won't help you in this typology because they are no IP

6
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.900
version 4 addresses configured on the router.

7
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.370
We can see that could give it to 00 is up and the loop back interfaces up.

8
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.440
But what we need to do is use show IP interface brief to see the IP addresses configured on the router

9
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:07.320
we can use trace route to see how far traffic gets in this example we can see that the trace gets to

10
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.730
2001.

11
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:16.380
COLGAN one colon colon too which is Rodda to and again we could use Come on such a show IP brought to

12
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:27.020
view the drawing table I wrote a one has a default route to route to Traffic is getting to router.

13
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.290
But is going no further.

14
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:44.050
So lets have a look at rodded to ping 2001 face three notice what we told no valid route to the destination.

15
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.510
So what do you think I should type now to verify what's going on.

16
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:55.780
Should I look at a one so you'd come on such a show IP interface brief to verify a one in this example

17
00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.310
the one is up up.

18
00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.810
It is.

19
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.300
The interface is up.

20
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.130
So it looks like layer one is up and layer two is up.

21
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.460
Should I use commands such as Shushi to be neighbors to verify that layer 2 is working.

22
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.780
In this example we can see that rodder 3 is connected to router 2.

23
00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:24.400
So that implies that layer two is working show IP route of one to help us because there are no IP version

24
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.260
for rats.

25
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.130
But what about show IPV six ROFFT can you see the problem in the south.

26
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.430
Put

27
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:43.060
is there romped to the loopback of rotisserie notice there's no route to rodders three in the writing

28
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:52.840
table show IPV six ROFFT include face only shows us a study grant to a one and a local connection on

29
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:53.800
gratitude.

30
00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:02.270
So gang show IPV six ROFFT there's no rot and the writing table show IPV six protocol's.

31
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.790
We don't have a writing protocol such as Ripp SPF enabled.

32
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.030
But we do have static Grotz configure it so show run pipe.

33
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:20.340
Include route we can see a static route to the loop back of Rato 1 and then there's the default route

34
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.250
to Rodda 3.

35
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.290
Notice the next top is 2001 colon to Colon colon to.

36
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.000
So can we.

37
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:35.500
Ping 2001 colon to Colon colon to notice we told that there's no ROFFT in the writing table.

38
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.230
In other words we don't have a route to a router that is directly connected to us.

39
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.840
Can we ping ourselves.

40
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:50.220
So 2001 colon to Colon colon one we told that we don't have a route to local IP address that doesn't

41
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.670
look right.

42
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.900
So show IP V-6 interface brief.

43
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.580
What's the problem in the south.

44
00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.660
Put If you need to pause the video.

45
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.750
But what's the problem notice here.

46
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:05.380
Gigabit.

47
00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:13.030
0 1 has an IP address configured of two thousand and one coal on one colon to Colon colon one when in

48
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.160
actual fact it should be 2001 to 1.

49
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.710
There's an extra one in the network.

50
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:22.610
So show run interface gigabit.

51
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.340
0 1.

52
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.270
Notice the extra one in the network address.

53
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:44.280
So let's fix that so no PV 6 address PV 6 address 2001 to Colon colon one slash 64 can be paying 2001

54
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.790
colon to Colon colon too.

55
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.750
Now we can ping Rodda 3.

56
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.590
What about the loopback of rotisserie.

57
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.810
We can ping the loopback rodded 3 so that looks promising.

58
00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.380
What about from Rotto one paying the loopback of Rodda 3.

59
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.910
So yes that looks good.

60
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:10.360
We can ping the loopback of registry and we can paying the physical interface of router 3.

61
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.310
Be careful with your IP addresses.

62
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:22.500
Look at your running tables look at the configuration of your IP addresses to verify that it's correct.

63
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.300
Previously we didn't have the static graphed in the writing table but now we do

64
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.250
so.

65
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.880
Previously the static route was missing.

66
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:39.200
We had a static route to the Lupica wrote a one but no static route to the loopback of roaded 3.

67
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.230
Now we can get to the loopback of router 3 because of this default prompt.

68
00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.520
