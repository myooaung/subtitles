00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.560
So why do we need net or network address translation.

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.140
The major reason is IP version 4 address exhaustion.

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:14.400
For years there's been a worry that IP version for addresses would run out and the heavy essentially

4
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:22.770
run out today is the drive to move to IP version 6 because of IP version for address exhaustion.

5
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.510
However it's probably more than likely that he's still using an IP version for dress and in a lot of

6
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.050
networks today engineers still need to make the move to IP version 6.

7
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:45.850
One of the reasons for that is because of RAFC 1918 RAFC 1918 was drafted in February 1996.

8
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.990
So in other words it's been around for a long time.

9
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.750
This discusses the address allocation for private internets.

10
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.390
I'm not going to bore you going through the entire document.

11
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.040
But notice in section 3 they talk about private address space.

12
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.650
The Internet assigned numbers of 30 or I honor has reserved the following three blocks of IP address

13
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:15.650
space for private internets 10.00 at zero up to 10 or 255 255 255.

14
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:25.700
In other words a 10 slash a Prefect's 172 to a 0.0 up to 1 7 2 3 1 2 5 5 2 5 5.

15
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:36.240
This is a 1 7 2 door 16 slash 12 Prefect's and then we have 1 1 2 1 6 8 0 2 0 2 1 2 1 6 8 255 255.

16
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.570
This is a 1 9 2 1 6 8 slash 16 Prefect's in my example here.

17
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.910
I'm using a 1 9 2 1 6 8 189 address internally.

18
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.560
What are you using on your PC.

19
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:59.090
More than likely if you're at home using one of these our provision for addresses in companies as mentioned

20
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.280
such as Apple or HP you may be using a public IP address.

21
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.630
So RAFC 19:18 was drafted to try and conserve IP addresses.

22
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:17.800
The idea here is that rather than allocating public IP addresses to every device in the Internet devices

23
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:25.090
within companies could be allocated these addresses and they could be enacted or translated when they

24
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.740
needed to access the Internet with port address translation or pat.

25
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:36.160
The idea is is that you overloading an IP address hence the term that Cisco uses.

26
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.110
We could have one public IP address used by 500 internal devices.

27
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.700
These are FC 19:18 addresses are non ratable on the Internet.

28
00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:55.750
In other words Internet service providers will block or drop traffic going to or coming from these address

29
00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:56.720
ranges.

30
00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.460
Well that's assuming that they've configured they Rajahs correctly but they should have access lists

31
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.500
blocking those addresses so that they non-radical on the Internet.

32
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:16.150
These are YSI 19:18 addresses are used internally within organizations and hence we have the term private

33
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:24.780
addresses used within private networks and public addresses used on the global public internet now.

34
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.720
Technically there's nothing stopping private IP addresses from being routed across the Internet.

35
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:37.520
The reason they non-radical is because ISP are blocking traffic to or from those address ranges.

36
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.530
So the issue is if private IP addresses are non-profitable how do we get on to the Internet.

37
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.920
Well that's way network address translation Knecht comes in that allows us to translate a private IP

38
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.940
address to a public IP address your Internet service provider or ISP will allocate you an IP address

39
00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.650
or a range of IP addresses a router.

40
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:07.830
Another type of device will translate to your internal private IP addresses to that globally readable

41
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.110
public IP address.

42
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:17.070
Now the terminology that uska use can be confusing and it's something that people often struggle with

43
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:25.650
Siska use the terms inside a local address inside global address outside local address and outside global

44
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.120
address.
