00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.100
Another good come on to remember you control you.

2
00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:12.500
So if I type some text control you will really raise or remove that entire command to show you again

3
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.840
control you.

4
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.220
Another one is breaking a command or canceling a command.

5
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.490
So if I press control C at this point notice I'm taken back to privilege mode and the command is not

6
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.380
run it's canceled.

7
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:34.550
So Control-C will have bought or cancel the current command and take you back to privilege mode.

8
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.990
Another good one to remember is control shift 6 x.

9
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.670
I'm going to ping a device that is not available in my local network and I'm going to send a hundred

10
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.000
pings to that device.

11
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.460
Now I don't want to wait for 100 pings to time out.

12
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.450
So going to press control shift six to break the ping.

13
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:04.250
Do that again control shift six breaks the ping once again a thousand pings.

14
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.970
I don't want to wait for a thousand pings to time out.

15
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:15.320
I press control shift six to break the ping so Control shift six allows the user to abort a Cisco Iowas

16
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.470
process such as ping or trace route.

17
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.590
So Control shift 6 breaks the paying trace route.

18
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:32.960
So in addition to using the setup utility or Seelye to load a configuration on a router you have a multiple

19
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.060
other options.

20
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.210
In this example I'm going to open a putty session to a router.

21
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:48.090
In this case I'm connecting to a terminal server that's giving me access to the console of a router.

22
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:56.030
I'll just make this bigger so that you can see more clearly.

23
00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:02.650
So when I hit Enter Notice it says Would you like to enter the initial configuration dialog.

24
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.770
I'm going to say no because I don't want to configure the router through the initial configuration dialog

25
00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.170
and I'm going to press enter to get started.

26
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.480
As you can see at the moment the routers name is router.

27
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:27.580
If our talk show version I can see that this is an 18 41 router you can see as an example that this

28
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.860
1841 has a certain amount of RAM nv ram and flesh installed.

29
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.840
I'm the type unable to go to privileged mode.

30
00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:46.050
And then I'm going to type show startup can fake notice at the moment no startup config exists.

31
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.010
This is a new router with no configuration.

32
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:56.410
If I type show run I can see that this is the current configuration on the router.

33
00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:03.160
I can see as an example that the hostname of the router is router and I can see various other default

34
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.260
config on the router.

35
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:13.140
Show IP interface brief shows me that I have an IP address on this interface which was allocated via

36
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:22.450
a DHP so the router was allocated an IP address through DHP I could top show IP route as an example

37
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.830
to see the writing table at the moment is only directly connected.

38
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.540
Network on this router.
