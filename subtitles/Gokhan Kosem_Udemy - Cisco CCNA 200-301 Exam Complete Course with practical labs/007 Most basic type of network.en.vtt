00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.080
Now networks can get really big.

2
00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.150
Biggest network that we know of today.

3
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.850
Unless you know about aliens having a bigger network somewhere out there in space is the Internet.

4
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.090
So the Internet is the biggest network that we have on Earth today.

5
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.570
But a network doesn't have to be very big.

6
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.610
A small network would simply consist of two computers.

7
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:39.160
So in this example I've got two Windows laptops previously as I mentioned I could copy a file onto this

8
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.550
USB drive.

9
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:48.600
So copy a file from this computer onto the drive and then put it into the second computer and then copy

10
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.880
the file onto this computer.

11
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:59.100
So that's how I could share information from one computer to another without a network.

12
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.550
But in its most basic form a computer network will use something like a cable.

13
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.730
This is a copper ethernet cable.

14
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.680
This is what's called UDP or unsealed twisted pair copper cable.

15
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.320
You've probably come across these types of connectors in the real world.

16
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.800
This is known as an RJ 45 connector.

17
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.250
Now it does have a different name but we won't get into that right now.

18
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.790
This is commonly referred to as an RJ 45 connector.

19
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.790
So if you talk about RJ 45 in a networking context people will know what you're talking about.

20
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.280
So I could as an example take this cable and then plug it in to this laptop.

21
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:47.260
Now this is an older laptop so it has a built in network interface card so I can take an RJ 45 connector

22
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.460
and plug it directly into this computer.

23
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:58.120
This laptop however on the right is a newer laptop and like a lot of newer laptops and Mac books it

24
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.690
doesn't have any RJ 45 network interface cards.

25
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:10.930
Now a network interface called on Nic is how we connect to the physical network or wireless network.

26
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:17.290
It's basically a card that's either inserted into a laptop or is built into a laptop that has what's

27
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:24.070
called a MAC address or Media Access Control address on Ethernet which is the technology that we generally

28
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:30.490
use today on wireless devices on known by what's called a MAC address.

29
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:37.270
So here's an example of a very old network interface called this network interface call it supports

30
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.980
older technologies such as Ten base five the first type of Ethernet that was ever developed supports

31
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.270
10 base two and it also supports an RJ 45 connector using ETP or unsheltered twisted pair.

32
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.250
This would be inserted in a computer.

33
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.530
Now that's really old.

34
00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:01.070
Today we have more modern network interface called such as this one only supports RJ 45.

35
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.700
It's a lot smaller.

36
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.640
And then this is an example of a network interface called that would go in a Raspberry Pi as an example.

37
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.580
This only supports Wi-Fi.

38
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.760
I mean you can't connect Ethernet to this.

39
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:21.610
So on a laptop like this what I could do is I could use a USP to RJ 45 network interface card.

40
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.990
So this is an adapter that converts a USP to RJ 45.

41
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:32.780
And then what I can do is plug the Ethan cable in here and what I have now is essentially a network.

42
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.060
I have a network consisting of two windows computers

43
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.060
and I'll now be able to share files from one computer to the other.

44
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.820
But it's a lot of hassle a lot of work setting this up.

45
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.040
But that's an example of an Ethernet network.

46
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.400
We have two computers connected using a physical cable.

47
00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:03.310
In this example what's called Cat 5 cabling unsheltered twisted pair RJ 45 connectors on the end.

48
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.720
That's an example of a very basic network.

49
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.330
But if I told a young person today.

50
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:17.730
So let's say a teenager to set up a network between their devices using cabling like that they'd probably

51
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.730
think I'm crazy because what we tend to use today is Wi-Fi.

52
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:29.040
Wi-Fi is an example of using the air for transmission of data from one device to the other makes life

53
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.180
a lot easier.

54
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:37.310
In many ways people today expect that it's easy to share information from one device to another.

55
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.050
In this example I've got two iPhones.

56
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.760
I mean how would I physically plug a cable into one of these phones.

57
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:52.530
They don't have RJ 45 connectors I don't have a US B two ethernet port that I can use to plug an ethernet

58
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.630
cable into the iPhone.

59
00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:00.220
I could use the lightning port but people today wouldn't be happy with that.

60
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.290
They expect it to just work and work very easily.

61
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:10.470
And the technologies that we're going to be using to share files from one phone to another are Wi-Fi

62
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.860
as well as Bluetooth.

63
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:20.450
So as an example on this phone here's a picture I'm going to share that picture using airdrop notice

64
00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:28.820
it tells me that Bluetooth is or I need Bluetooth to allow this device to share the file with other

65
00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:29.800
devices.

66
00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:36.290
Now it's picked up two devices I've got a iPhone Blue which is the phone on the right as well as my

67
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.230
MacBook which is in front of me.

68
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.650
So I'm going to select the iPhone.

69
00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.200
And what happens now is the file is shared from one phone to the other.

70
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:53.570
So by leveraging Wi-Fi and Bluetooth I can share a file from one phone to the other.

71
00:05:53.660 --> 00:06:00.170
That's an example of file sharing I'm sharing a file which in this example is a picture from one phone

72
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.430
to the other.

73
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:10.010
And the medium or media that I'm using is the air I'm sharing data from one device to another using

74
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.990
Waze through the air just like I'm speaking to you.

75
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:20.690
And what's happening is a microphone is picking up the waves that I'm making with my vocal cords.

76
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.200
Basically speaking into the air making waves.

77
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.930
That's then digitized by microphone.

78
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:34.790
Same idea here a digital file on a phone is modulated in the air sent across through airwaves from one

79
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:40.420
device to the other this device to modulate it and creates the file on the other side.

80
00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:48.230
So I'm transmitting a resource a file from one device to the other using the air.

81
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.980
In this example that's an example of a network.

82
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:58.150
I've got a network of two devices where one device is sharing a resource with another device.
