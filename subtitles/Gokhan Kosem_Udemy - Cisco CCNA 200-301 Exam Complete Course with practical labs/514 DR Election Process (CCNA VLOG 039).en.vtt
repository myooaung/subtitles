00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:15.610
This is one of multiple videos discussing the wispy FDR and video designated Rada and become the designated

2
00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:16.070
Rada.

3
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:24.850
Elections and selection criteria on Cisco we have this document that says that dealers and BDO elections

4
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:33.340
are done via the hello protocol Hello packets are exchanged via multicast packets on each segment.

5
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:39.420
The Rada with the highest priority on the segment will become the D.R. for that segment.

6
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.380
The process is repeated for the PDR in the case of a tie.

7
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:51.110
The Rada with the highest Rada idea will win the default property on an interface is one if you set

8
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.860
the primary to a zero.

9
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.440
It means the Rada will not become a ADR or a PDR.

10
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.230
Remember that the D.R. and BDO concepts are per multi access segment.

11
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:10.860
Setting the OSP of priority on an interface can be done using the IPO SPF Prodi command.

12
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:19.210
Now let's look at the segment that has rather 3 rather 2 to 1 and read a full connected to it on the

13
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:30.380
segment rudder one has neighbor relationships to rudder to rudder three and wrote a full note to the

14
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:39.710
interface gigabit zero the stop entry is for the segment on gigabit 0 1 but we are concentrating on

15
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:51.560
gigabit to 0 0 for the moment so we don't see a D.R. show IP or SPF interface brief what we do see is

16
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.120
that the local Rata a one is the designated Rata.

17
00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:03.320
Now that goes against what we've just read the runner idea of this strata is lower than the other Rod

18
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.090
is on the segment and this is where real world comes into play versus theory.

19
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:16.720
The reason why Russia won was elected as the designated Rada is that in the previous video I configured

20
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.340
Rada 1 first before I configured the other.

21
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:26.720
So Rada 1 was the only Rada on the segment it was waiting for other.

22
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.850
None appeared so it became the D.R. when the other rods were added to the segment and I added them in

23
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:40.950
the order of Robert to then Rada a three then Rada for RADA one was already the designated Rada once

24
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.290
a designated Rod is elected and a Roddick comes on to the segment with a higher priority will higher

25
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:55.530
Rod I.D. It's not going to usurp or pre-empt the designated Rada the designated Rada remains the designated

26
00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:04.560
Rada and hence the local Rada with a lower rate I.D. which we can see by using the command show IP was

27
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:05.430
interface

28
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:23.230
is elected as the D.R. on gigabit 00 because it came on line first notice it has an adjacency or neighbor

29
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.920
relationship with three routers brought it to is the backup designator Rada wrote a three and root a

30
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:41.660
four R D or others show IP SPF and neighbor Rod it to is a PDR a 3 wrote a 4 or D or others on gigabit

31
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:51.950
00 so what happens if we go on to gigabit 00 and we top IPO SPF priority 0

32
00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:10.560
show IP SPF interface what you'll notice is the a state on gigabit 00 has changed to D or other it's

33
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:19.430
now formed a full relationship to rather to show IP SPF neighbor rather one has a full relationship

34
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:23.370
to brought broader two as well as Rod four.

35
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:32.940
The reason why Rod it too became the D.R. is it was already the BTR and then out of Rod it 3 and Rod

36
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:41.810
of 4 Rod of 4 became to the BTR because it had a higher Rod I.D. So the theory is as follows.

37
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:48.660
Rod it with the highest property becomes designated rata on a segment that's not entirely true.

38
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:55.520
If one Rodda comes into the segment first before other Rod is that Radha will be the designated Rod.

39
00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:03.030
But if that all come online at the same time it's based on highest priority then highest Rod I.D. then

40
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.890
highest loop back interface ip address then highest configured physical interface address.

41
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:15.870
And in this case Rod a fool became the backup designated rider because it had the highest IP address.

42
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:23.130
So what are going to do now is reboot the switch so that you can see the full process of how the exam

43
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:35.820
explains how ideas are elected so first thing I'll do is change the protein of rod to 1 back to 1 on

44
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:47.710
Rod a 2 to let's confirm the relationships show IP SPF neighbor Rod a 1 is a D or other Rod a 3 is a

45
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:58.250
D or other Rod a 4 is a backup designated Rata and the local Rata is a designated Rata in the output

46
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:06.510
show we can see there are of 4 is the backup designated Rada wrote a 3 and Rod a 1 or D or others.

47
00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:18.980
So let's see what happens when we shut down interfaces on the switch so shut down a range of interfaces

48
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.800
gigabit 0 2 3 so shut those interfaces down.

49
00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:32.560
On router 1 show IP 0 SPF neighbor not may take it a while ingenious 3 to realize that the interfaces

50
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.060
have gone down.

51
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:41.590
So what I'm gonna do at this point is pause the video and what we should see is that these states change

52
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:48.080
so after a while the dead timer expires for the neighbor relationships.

53
00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:56.140
Previously we had these neighbor relationships and now those neighbor relationships have disappeared.

54
00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:02.830
The only neighbor relationship that to one has is to rot for using this Ethernet link

55
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.270
so to ensure that it doesn't get confusing I'll shut that link down as well.

56
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:15.380
So we have no always P.F. neighbor relationships on route one at all.

57
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:19.560
The switch has all of its interfaces shut down once again.

58
00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:20.730
So let's have a look.

59
00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:28.770
On rudder to show IPO SPF neighbor no neighbor relationships and write it to write a three show IPO

60
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:34.350
SPF neighbor no neighbor relationships a for show IPO SPF neighbor.

61
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:42.080
It only has a neighbor relationship on the surreal interface not on the Ethernet interface Serato for

62
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:50.390
has a neighbor relationship to rot a five but no other neighbor relationships so on the switch no shut

63
00:07:52.650 --> 00:08:02.940
we've enabled all the interfaces on the switch so in a one off to a period of time we should see that

64
00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.920
neighbor relationships are formed.

65
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:08.880
We can do a ping to check if the interfaces have come up

66
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:20.240
interfaces are starting to come up on the switch pings are now succeeding.

67
00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:28.850
And now we see maybe relationships three neighbor relationships have been formed on a once a show IP

68
00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:39.200
SPF neighbor brought one has a two way relationship to rot it to rot a fool has become the designated

69
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:44.550
Rada and a three has become the backup designated Rada.

70
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:52.940
The reason why Rada 4 became the designated Rada is because it has the highest IP address on any physical

71
00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.990
interface this interface has an IP address of 10 1 1 1

72
00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:05.650
this interface on brought it to its 10 1 1 2

73
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:15.740
this interface on Route 3 is 10 1 1 3 this interface and a force 10 on 1 1 4.

74
00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:21.530
But in addition it has an IP address on the serial interface of 10 1 2 1.

75
00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:24.710
So because it has the highest IP address of any physical interface

76
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:38.280
it becomes the D.R. with this IP address.

77
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:46.020
The reason why it didn't use this IP address is because this interface was added after the 0 SPF process

78
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.250
had run.

79
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:55.560
So the Rada I.D. had already been selected these two interfaces were up when OSP started this interface

80
00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:58.320
wasn't up when 0 SPF was started.

81
00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:01.980
So the Rada idea that was chosen was 10 1 to 1.

82
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:10.530
So that proves that the Rada with the highest IP address of any physical interface will become the designated

83
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:13.470
Rada on a segment when all the devices come up.

84
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:21.690
Let's see if we can change that by manipulating priorities.

85
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:25.330
