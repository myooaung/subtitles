00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In this video, we're going to discuss Binary

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'd like to explain how binary works

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I’d like to show you some tricks relating to binary and IP addresses

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So for example, how to convert a dotted decimal IP Address

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
to a binary number and back again

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Binary is a basic building block in networking and it's really important

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that you understand how binary works, you'll encounter binary

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
over and over again throughout you networking career

9
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So in this section, we'll cover the reasons why you should be learning binary

10
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and I've already mentioned a few good reasons

11
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I'd like to give you an overview of binary and explain the basics of binary

12
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and then lastly I'd like to show you how to convert an IP Address to binary

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and then translate it back again

14
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
This is very similar to translating from one language to another

15
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
so for example, translating English to French

16
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
but in this case, we're taking a dotted decimal IP address and

17
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
converting it to binary format and then converting it back again

18
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So let's get started!

19
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Binary is of great importance once again in networking

20
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
you're going to encounter binary when doing IP Subnetting

21
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
for example or when configuring Access Lists to permit or deny

22
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
certain IP addresses or certain subnets

23
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
You cannot be a good Network Engineer if you don't understand

24
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
IP addressing and subnetting and therefore a knowledge of binary is required

25
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
as you'll be using it again and again

26
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000
As an example, you may have a subnet of 10.1.1.0/24

27
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and you may need to subnet that again to 10.1.1.0/28

28
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
without a good understanding of binary, it will be very difficult

29
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
to do subnetting or to work with Access Control Lists which use inverse masks

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000
so 0.0.0.255 is the inverse of 255.255.255.0

31
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
once again without a fundamental understanding of binary

32
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
it will be very difficult to do both subnetting and Access Lists

33
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and various other tasks in networking

34
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
All computers function by using a system of switches that

35
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
can either be set on or set off

36
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
an off value is denoted as a 0 and on value is denoted as a 1

37
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So binary is actually a really simple language all you have to understand

38
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
is that you have 2 options or 2 values and those values are either 0 or 1

39
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Decimal, for instance, has values 0 to 9 but in binary it's always either 0 or

40
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
There are only those  two values that you need to understand

41
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I just wish learning a foreign language was as simple as this language

42
00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
which contains only two words or two values once again 0 or 1

43
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:13.000
As an example a 128 in decimal = 10000000 in other words 1 followed by 7 0s

44
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000
in binary and I'm going to explain in a moment how I got to that value

45
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
but notice it's either 1s or 0s

46
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
These values will be used in combinations but essentially everything

47
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
in binary boils down to either a 0 or a 1

48
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
So to help you understand how binary let's use the following analogy

49
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
imagine a cable, that cable can either have current or not have current

50
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
So when there’s current on the cable that equates to a 1

51
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
when there’s no current that equates to 0

52
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.000
So single cable can have 1 of 2 states it can either have current

53
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
or not have current.When current is applied the value would be 1

54
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and when no current is applied the value would be 0

55
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
So a single cable when there's no current = 0

56
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and when there's current = 1

57
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
This cable can be in 1 or 2 states, it can either have current

58
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
or not have current and that gives us 2 combinations or 2 options

59
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
either 0 or 1, meaning no current or meaning current
