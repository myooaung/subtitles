00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.230
This is one of multiple SPF videos.

2
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:19.380
I was asked to explain Oh SPF multiple areas and this is one of multiple videos helping explain how

3
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:28.940
SPF works when you have multiple areas configured router 5 is another area border router it exists between

4
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.480
area zero and Area 2.

5
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.630
So bypass the initial configuration dialog

6
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.070
and configure this of four out of five interface gigabit.

7
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:50.100
Zero zero and no shut IP address 10 1 4 2 slash 24 mosque

8
00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:04.450
so that was the IP address configured on gigabit 0 0 on interface gigabit 0 1 IP address 10 1 5 1 24

9
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.960
mosque and I'll create a loop back of Triple Five

10
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:22.630
so do show IP interface brief IP addresses are configured on the various interfaces I forgot to no shut

11
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.590
gigabit.

12
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.220
There 1 so there we go on this Friday we are going to configure always P.F..

13
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.480
But what we're going to do now is make sure that we configure and I'll do it slightly differently now.

14
00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:45.520
We'll configure gigabit 00 in area zero so we're saying this interface gigabit 00 which has an IP address

15
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:53.950
of 10 1 4 2 is going to be put into area zero because of the mosque used here.

16
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.110
It's an inverse mosque.

17
00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:03.760
I'll also put the loop back of the router into areas zero and then I'll configure

18
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:07.380
gigabit.

19
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:16.170
Is there a 1 in Area 2 so show run section who is P.F..

20
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.950
That's the configuration of SPF on the.

21
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.860
Show IPO SPF interface brief at the moment.

22
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.370
We only have SPF enabled on one interface.

23
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:34.940
And that's because I made some mistakes so let's read do that no network for 444

24
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.570
should be network.

25
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.180
5 5 5 5

26
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.720
show IP 0 SPF

27
00:02:49.370 --> 00:03:00.500
interface brief we've got 0 SPF running on the loop back and gigabit 00 so show IP interface brief 10

28
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.650
1 5 1 is configured on gigabit 0 1.

29
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.430
Let's see what I did wrong in 0 SPF I put this as a zero.

30
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:19.940
Rather than using the right mosque so no network 10 1 5 0.

31
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.830
This should have been done

32
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:37.140
like this so show IPO SPF interface brief that looks better or SPF is configured on three interfaces.

33
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.180
Show IP round.

34
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:52.050
We are learning intra area runs into area roots and external rots and root of 5 should be able to ping

35
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:58.090
router 1 which it can and we can see the output on wrote a 1 OK.

36
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.130
So the lower strata to configure is right 6.

37
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:09.980
This is an internal router all interfaces on this proto belong to area to sell bypass the initial configuration

38
00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:21.260
dialog and all configured the router should be right a 6 interface gigabit 00 no shut IP address 10

39
00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.700
1 5 2

40
00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:34.420
so that's the IP address on gigabit 00 interface loop back 0 IP address quadruple 6

41
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:48.560
as follows router over SPF 1 network and I'll just do it this way to keep it simple all interfaces.

42
00:04:48.620 --> 00:05:01.240
In this example belong to Area 2 so show IP SPF interface brief show IP SPF interface brief shows us

43
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:09.580
that 0 SPF is running on both gigabit 00 and the loop back show IPO SPF neighbor shows us our neighbor

44
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:15.340
relationship to write of 5 show ip route shows us our writing table.

45
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:22.900
Now here we don't see any intra area runs because this Ethan it interface and the loop back of the local

46
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:30.880
router are seen as directly connected rather than being advertised by a writing protocol.

47
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:39.640
So we see in our area ruts and quite a few of them as well as external rods wrote a six should be able

48
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:49.260
to ping wrote a one which it can and we can see the debugger and write a 1 to show IP or SPF database.

49
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:57.820
Notice that on Route 6 this command shows us only Area 2 because the rod is only configured in Area

50
00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:06.910
2 it sees that rod a 6 and write a 5 are configured in area to seize that rod of 5 is the designated

51
00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:19.060
Rado on the Ethernet segment in Area 2 it sees a range of LSD these are into area Roth's LSA types 3

52
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:28.910
it sees a type for LSA which is a summary ISP are LSA and it sees external ruts.

53
00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:39.910
So there you have an example of many LSA types that you get in 0 SPF LSA type 1 Rod LSD LSA type 2 network

54
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.160
link LSD

55
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:52.180
top 3 summary LSD type 4 EPR LSD and top 5 external LSD.

56
00:06:52.240 --> 00:07:00.640
Let's have a look at Rider 5 which has interfaces in multiple areas so show IPO SPF database you'll

57
00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:11.680
notice it displays information for area 0 as well as for Area 2 so on area 0 we have 3 routers in areas

58
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:12.520
0.

59
00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:23.790
We have 2 designated routers in area 0 So to net the link states these are summary LSD or rots coming

60
00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:26.190
from other SPF areas.

61
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:35.930
There is one autonomous system border Radha LSA then we see similar information for Area 2 and right

62
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:45.170
at the end we see the external LSD or LSA top 5 there was an example of how to configure multi area

63
00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:47.080
o SPF.
