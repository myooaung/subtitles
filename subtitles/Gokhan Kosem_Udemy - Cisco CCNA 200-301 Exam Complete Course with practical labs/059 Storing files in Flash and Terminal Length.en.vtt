00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:02.900
Falls can also be stored in Flash.

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:10.550
So if I type the C'mon show flash I can see various files in Flash including the operating system of

3
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:11.330
the router.

4
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:20.080
I can then do the command copy run and pointed to flash.

5
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.390
So let's call it run one dot see if G.

6
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:33.970
Show flash noticed that file now exists in Flash more Flash run.

7
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.360
Let's see if she will show me the file stored in Flash.

8
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:48.380
So I was able to copy the running config to flash and also to view the contents of that file in Flash.

9
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.660
So it's possible to store configuration files in Flash.

10
00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:00.740
I could also copy the startup config at the moment it's not set so save for the start of config by using

11
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:01.540
the shortcut.

12
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.840
C'mon W-r.

13
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:15.910
And then I can say copy start to flash and I'll call the start one to see if G Show flash noticed stalked

14
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:23.450
Let's see if G stored in Flash and I could view that by typing more flash start.

15
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.380
See if G and I can view the configuration.

16
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:36.180
Now another useful component is terminal length for type show run.

17
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:43.620
I'll see the running config but it's restricted to a certain number of lines the default terminal length

18
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:53.320
is set to 24 so once again when I top show run I'm told that there's more output

19
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.170
will do that again and I press enter or see one line at a time.

20
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.850
You can change the terminal length to vary the amount of output that you see.

21
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:21.830
So as an example if I set it to five and top show run I only see five lines of output every time I press

22
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.040
space ball.

23
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:32.000
Now if you have a very long configuration a nice option to remember is terminal length 0.

24
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.620
And now when I use the command show run it shows me the entire config rather than me having to press

25
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:49.100
spacebar every time I get the full config in one go which is great when you want to do a copy and paste.

26
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:57.280
So in this example I'm selecting the entire running config in one go which I could then paste into notepad

27
00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.420
as an example.

28
00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:06.370
So I've just taken the full configuration of the router and pasted it into notepad by selecting it in

29
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.150
putty putty automatically copies any selected text.

30
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.620
And when I right click it pastes it into the output.

31
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.300
Now in this example I'm seeing another problem.

32
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:25.990
When I enter the command and the rightest trying to resolve that using a DNS server and you'll notice

33
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.650
it's taking a long time to do the resolution.

34
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:37.930
So as an example if I typed Cisco dot com it's going to take it a long time to resolve that domain name

35
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.970
no DNS server has been configured in the example.

36
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:50.620
So the router is broadcasting on to the local segment to try and resolve the command or name that I've

37
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:58.050
entered that can be very frustrating if you make a typing mistake because it takes a long time to resolve.

38
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:04.420
So rather than typing configure I'm going to make a typo here and type it as follows.

39
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.660
Notice with out the T and just the word configure with the typing mistake.

40
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.290
I have to wait.

41
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.820
So if you make configuration mistakes and you're not using a DNS server it can be very frustrating waiting

42
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.580
for this to time out.

43
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:28.250
So let's look at a resolution to stop this long delay in the timeout of the DNS name.

44
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.160
So we're going to top confetti and type no IP domain

45
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.280
and hit enter.

46
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:46.540
Now if I type Cisco dot com so some command topped incorrectly notice.

47
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.130
Now times out very quickly.

48
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:56.500
Now if you're using a DNS server you could use IP domain lookup but in this example I'm not so I've

49
00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:05.200
disabled the lookup of domain names on the router to cause less stress and frustration with commotions

50
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.310
taking a long time to time out.
