00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.230
Now what about subnet masks.

2
00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.490
I've mentioned subnet masks a few times.

3
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.200
What is the subnet mask.

4
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:09.590
What does it do.

5
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:18.140
Well a subnet mask is used to determine which part of an IP address is the network portion and which

6
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.160
part of the address is the host portion.

7
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:29.240
This allows a PC for example to determine whether a device that it wants to communicate with is a remote

8
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.330
device or a local device.

9
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:39.590
So here's an example we have a PC with IP address 10 dot one that wanted that one and another PC with

10
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:46.430
an IP address of 10 to one to two to one when the PC on the left wants to forward traffic to the PC

11
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.170
on the right with the IP address tendered one to two that one.

12
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:57.570
Does the PC for the traffic onto the local segment or does it forward it to its default gateway.

13
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:05.060
If these two devices are in the same subnet they can communicate directly without the use of a default

14
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.270
gateway.

15
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:13.370
But if they are on different subnets the PCs will forward their traffic to their default gateways which

16
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.240
will do the interview LAN routing.

17
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.470
If they're on the local land or Local Area Network as an example all rocked the traffic if the traffic

18
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.350
is forwarded to a traditional router.

19
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:31.850
So at least three switch may do the routing between two villans way router my router the traffic between

20
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:32.960
these two devices.

21
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.920
If they are on different subnets but how would you determine if these two devices are on the same subnet

22
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.300
or if they're on different subnets.

23
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.690
Now I'm going to explain this in more detail in the next few minutes.

24
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:57.100
But as an example 10.0 wondered 1.1 and Tendo wonder 2.1 are in the same subnet if they are using a

25
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.270
slash 16 mosque.

26
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:07.430
However if they are using a 24 mosque that means that the devices are on different subnets.

27
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:14.690
So let me explain that in more detail in Dittrich mosque allows a device to determine once again which

28
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:21.560
portion of the address is the host portion and which portion of the address is the network portion.

29
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:29.150
This allows a local PC as an example to determine whether the device it wants to communicate with is

30
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.110
on a remote network and is thus reachable via the default gateway.

31
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:43.100
Or if the device is on the local subnet and therefore does not require the use of a default gateway

32
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:50.130
say PCa and PC be on the same subnet no default gateway is required.

33
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:57.410
But if they are on different subnets then a default gateway would typically be required to do the routing

34
00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.630
between the two PCs.

35
00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.220
So that's essentially what a network mask does.

36
00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:12.230
Now as I've explained Plus a B and C networks have default mosques which are also known as natural mosques

37
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:21.500
in a class A address the first octet is the network in a class B address the first two octets are network

38
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.830
and with a Class C address the first three octets of the network portion.

39
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.450
I'll explain more complicated subnet masks in the submitting videos.

40
00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.050
But let's first start with some simple examples.

41
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:46.760
In this example we have a class a network that hasn't been submitted across a network the default mosque

42
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.990
is to far 5.0 0.0.

43
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:57.890
So if we look at a address such as 10 dot one to 1 one and convert that into binary it's going to look

44
00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.060
as follows.

45
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:09.540
Now look at the following mosque 2 4 5 in binary equates to 8 binary ones 0 in decimal equates to 8

46
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.280
binary zeros.

47
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:20.070
So converting the mosque into binary shows us that the network portion consists of contiguous ones or

48
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.910
continuous ones starting from the left hand side.

49
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:33.680
A 1 in binary in the network mosque indicates network a zero in binary in the network mosque indicates

50
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:34.690
host.

51
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:41.340
So in this example this portion of the address is a network and this portion of the address is host.

52
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:49.420
Hence this device with IP address tendered one but one that one is on network 10.00 at 0.

53
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.180
This is the network portion and this is the host portion.

54
00:04:53.370 --> 00:05:03.150
This device with IP address 10.0 1.1 one is on network 10 so when working out the network and host portions

55
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:11.960
of an address follow these two simple rules any address bits that have a corresponding mosque that set

56
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:20.550
to one in binary represents the network in the address bits that have a corresponding mosque but set

57
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.680
to zero represents the host.

58
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:29.520
So one in binary means network 0 in binary means host.

59
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:35.870
So in this example 10 is the network because they are ones in the mosque in binary.

60
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.960
So the network ID is set to 10.

61
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.980
Notice these octets are populated by binary zeros that means host.

62
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.280
So the host ID is equal to 1 dot 1.1.

63
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.900
So in summary the network is 10.

64
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.130
The host portion of the address is 1.1 1.

65
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.490
Here's another example.

66
00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:04.870
Remember any address bits that have a corresponding mosque but set to 1 in binary represents makework

67
00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:13.380
any address bits that have a corresponding mosque but set to 0 in binary represent node ID.

68
00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.640
So here we've got a class A address.

69
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.680
One got one that wanted one.

70
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.920
But note the difference.

71
00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:30.810
The network mosque in this case is true 5 5 5.5 5.0 etc. so converting 1.1 at 1.1 to binary gives us

72
00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.220
the following.

73
00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:38.080
Taking the network mosque and converting that to binary gives us the following.

74
00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:45.660
Notice 205 equates to 8 binary ones which therefore means that those Portion of The address is a network

75
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:53.070
so the network ID is one dot one and looking at the remaining part of the address which is populated

76
00:06:53.070 --> 00:07:00.930
with binary zeros in the network mosque means that one door one is the host portion of the address.

77
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:07.410
In other words the network is one dot 1.0 to zero with a host portion of one.

78
00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:10.830
Got one on that network.

79
00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.750
The mosque is 2 5 5 5 0 0.

80
00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:22.140
In this example its easy to see the network portion of the address because we have 2 4 5 2 5 5 in the

81
00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.500
network mosque.

82
00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:29.730
Just be aware that things can get a lot more complicated than what we are seeing in these examples.

83
00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:35.910
You'll see that when we get to the submitting videos these two examples are simple because it's easy

84
00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:40.120
to recognize which portion is a network and which portion is host.

85
00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:46.440
In the submitting videos I'm going to show you much more complicated examples and in those examples

86
00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:52.740
it's more difficult to determine which portion is network and which portion is host.

87
00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:59.420
So in summary how does a device know whether another device is local remote to itself.

88
00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:06.430
So the first thing it will do is check the network portion of its local address and then compare that

89
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.710
to the address of the other host.

90
00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:15.550
If the network portion of the address is the same the local device knows that the other device is local

91
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:16.560
to itself.

92
00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:22.940
If the network portion is not the same the local device knows that the other device is remote.
