00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:07.230
In this video we're going to discuss how you can implement IPV six addresses on hostes as an example

2
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.530
you can use statelets address order configuration or slack key dynamically allocate IP addresses to

3
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.500
hosts you could use DHP to allocate IP addresses to host PCs.

4
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.700
There are a lot of very similar concepts between IP version 6 and IP version for as an example an IP

5
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.900
version 6 you have an IP address in the same way that you have an IP address and IP version 4.

6
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.760
You have a default gateway or default router you have a subnet mask or prefix Alain's and you have a

7
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:48.430
DNS servers IP version 6 in a similar way to IP version 4 needs to dynamically learn MAC addresses.

8
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:57.390
But I'd be vision for uses up and broadcasts to discover MAC addresses broadcasts on supported in IP

9
00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.330
version 6.

10
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.690
So up can't be used.

11
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.810
So a different protocol needs to be used to discover the MAC addresses of other devices on Ethernet

12
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.670
IP version 6 PCs and hosts using a discovery protocol instead of up.

13
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.870
This is used by devices on the same subnet.

14
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.830
In other words neighbors to discover and exchange information.

15
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.870
One of the big protocols that it replaces is the up protocol used in IP version 4.

16
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:35.430
So again you can allocate IP addresses to IP version 6 hosts either by configuring them statically or

17
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:42.270
using dynamic allocation process with a DHP or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.

18
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:50.340
Or you can use statelets address order configuration or slack to allocate IP addresses to PCs IP version

19
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.140
6 hosts require an IP address to communicate.

20
00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.300
They need to know what they subnet mask is they need to know what they default gateways and they need

21
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.970
to know what their DNS server is so that they can resolve names to IP addresses.
