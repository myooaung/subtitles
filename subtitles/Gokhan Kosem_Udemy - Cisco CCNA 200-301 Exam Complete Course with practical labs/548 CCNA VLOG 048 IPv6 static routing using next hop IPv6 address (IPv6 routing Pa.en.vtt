00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:18.010
This is one of multiple videos discussing IP version 6 rotting in this example of one and two are connected

2
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:26.290
via a serial interface these routers have just booted up and have no configuration apart from a default

3
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.480
Jinnah's 3 configuration.

4
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:36.910
So as an example if we use the command show IP interface brief we don't see any IP addresses configured

5
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.550
on the road as and all interfaces on the roads are shut down.

6
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:53.790
Show IP V-6 route shows no routes in the IP version 6 writing table because no IP version 6 addresses

7
00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:00.840
have been configured on the Rodda and we can see that by using the command show IP version 6 interface

8
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:09.360
brief output gives a similar information to what we would see using show IP interface brief.

9
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.180
All interfaces are shut down.

10
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:21.340
So on Rodda one I'm getting Nabl IP version 6 unicast rotting and then go into the serial interface

11
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:31.850
and shut the interface and configure an IP version 6 address of 2001 Colan one code on one slash 64.

12
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:42.110
Now when we look at the IP version 6 rotting table we see that a connected network exists as well as

13
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:51.470
a local network the local network is the IP address configured on that interface.

14
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.260
So this is the IP address thats configured on the serial zero interface which we can see as follows.

15
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:07.880
We're using a slash 64 mask so the connected network is displayed with a slash 64 mosque.

16
00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.950
But the 128 bit IP address is shown in the output as well.

17
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:19.270
Rhodos will create the IP version 6 of routes based on the unique cost IP version 6 address configured

18
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.540
on the interface.

19
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:29.590
So this command results in the network appearing in the writing table the Rato also creates the host

20
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:38.520
wrocht or local ront using 128 but prefix for the IP version 6 address configured on the interface.

21
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:47.970
If we shut that interface down and then look at the writing table again you can see that the IP address

22
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.960
has been removed from the writing table.

23
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:59.670
So in the same way as we have with IP version 4 the wrapped only appears in the running table when the

24
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:09.070
interface comes up so interface Cyrille to slash zeros is now up up so we have the subnet or connected

25
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:14.700
route and to the local route or host route added to the writing table.

26
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:22.540
If the interface goes down the route is removed from the writing table or create a loopback address

27
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:30.690
on this router with an IP version 6 address of 2001 face.

28
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.140
Column one colon colon one slash 64.

29
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:44.980
So show IPV six ROFFT should show us that that router is added Kirit is the connected network and there

30
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.610
is the local router IP address on route too.

31
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.010
We still don't have any IP addresses configured.

32
00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:00.660
So show IPV 6 ROFFT shows us no routes in the IP version 6 writing table only enable IP version 6 unicast

33
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:09.250
routing and then go into the serial interface and no shut it and configure an IP version 6 address on

34
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:17.400
the interface of 2001 Colan one colon colon to slash 64.

35
00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:26.810
While I'm here all configure the loopback address as you can see the Sybrand faces now come up on both

36
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:41.090
sides so loopback interface will be 2001 Kahlon face colon to Colon colon one so show IPV six Raat we

37
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:47.820
can see multiple Ronsin in the writing table has the connected route for the serial connected route

38
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:59.020
for the loopback local romped or Rato Robert for the serial and lookback now will rot to be able to

39
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.340
ping wrote a one on the serial interface.

40
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:09.700
Answer is yes and that's because they are directly connected to one another and they are configured

41
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.050
in the same subnet.

42
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.020
Sarada one can also ping rodded too.

43
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:23.740
We can prove that by doing a debug commands are very similar to our provision for so debug RPV 6 ICMP

44
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.890
when we do the paying.

45
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:34.090
We can see the output in a similar way to IP version full notice IP version for shows no Wrath's in

46
00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:40.620
the writing table because we haven't configured any IP version for addresses on these routers.

47
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.580
This network is running a PIA IPV CICS implementation.

48
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.050
We'll rockety be able to ping the loopback of one.

49
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.570
What do you think will.

50
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.960
To be able to ping the loopback of a one debug IP packet will show us the result.

51
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:05.080
So let's ping the loop back of a broader one ECA request is being sent.

52
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.000
And I did the wrong debug.

53
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.400
They be careful of that mistake.

54
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.740
That she's debug IPV 6 Pacak rather and see what happens now.

55
00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.240
So this is better.

56
00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.840
I can see an echo is being sent to stop the ping.

57
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:25.110
No so an echo is being sent.

58
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.040
The rhodos picked the address as the source address.

59
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:34.150
In other words the serial interface will outgoing interface is used as the source address for ICMP traffic

60
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:41.600
something very similar will happen an IP version for such TRONSON in an echo to that address.

61
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:50.610
Using this local IP address with a destination set to that and the important piece is noticed route

62
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.200
is not found again.

63
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.780
ROFFT is not found.

64
00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.630
Rock is not found.

65
00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:05.580
The Rodek cannot send traffic to that destination network because it doesn't appear in the IP version

66
00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.070
6 routing table.

67
00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.940
So what we need to do here is configure static routes.

68
00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:19.230
In this example because we are using a serial interface we can configure a route using the local outgoing

69
00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:27.780
interface so very similar to our provision for begin to use the IPV 6 rumped command and specified the

70
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:38.000
destination Raat which is two thousand and one face cold on one colon colon slash 64 and the local outgoing

71
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.370
interface is going to be Sariel to slash 0.

72
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:47.560
So now can we paying that network.

73
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.370
Yes we can.

74
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:54.120
We're getting a lot of debug information so I'll turn off the debug.

75
00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:59.920
Scrolling up you can see that the pings succeeded.

76
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:09.680
And if we do that again notice we can ping the lookback of wrote a one I wrote of one doesn't know about

77
00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:12.760
the loopback overloaded too so we need to configure that.

78
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:26.330
IPV six ront destination is 2001 Coloma face colon to cold and cold on one slash 64 aren't going to

79
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.860
face is going to be Ciril to slash is zero.

80
00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:37.060
So show RPV six route we can see that rumped added to the writing table.

81
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:44.710
And we should be able to paying two thousand and one face to code on column one.

82
00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:46.800
And that works.

83
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.730
So again just like with provision for.

84
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.000
You need to have a rot in the writing table to be able to reach a destination network.

85
00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:04.730
In this example we've added routes using static routes to the IP version 6 routing table and using the

86
00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:14.190
local outgoing interface rather then next hop address so show run piping clewed route shows us that

87
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:22.590
we are using the outgoing local interface to get to the destination network that works well you know

88
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:31.090
point to point serial connection such as this but won't work well when using Ethernet when using Ethernet.

89
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:40.580
You should use the next hop IP address these routers are using C30 725 software version 12. four of

90
00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:43.980
the IRS in a subsequent video.

91
00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:53.840
All configure steady Grotz using Next Top IP address but I'll use version 15 software and I'll use viral

92
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:56.330
images to do that.

93
00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:57.820
I hope you've enjoyed this video.
