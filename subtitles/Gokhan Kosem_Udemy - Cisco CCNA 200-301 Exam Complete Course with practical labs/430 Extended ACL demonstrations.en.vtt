00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.110
Now let's implement some examples of extended IP access lists.

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.970
In this example we are saying permit sheepy traffic from 10 1 1 1 to 10 1 to 1.

3
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:18.400
In other words this host should be permitted to talk to the server but only using a sheepy.

4
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:27.260
We need to deny all other traffic from subnet 10 1 1 0 Sless 24 going to the server.

5
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.850
In other words anyone else in the subnet should be denied access to the specific server.

6
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.450
But we want to permit all other traffic from the subnet anywhere else.

7
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.830
In other words this host for example should be able to connect to this router to be able to connect

8
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.510
to this router should be able to send traffic to this MacBook.

9
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.460
Now once again it's very important to look at the direction of the traffic so the traffic flow is from

10
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:59.810
left to right now as per best practices and extended IP access list should be placed as close to the

11
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.570
source as possible and thus we can apply the access list inbound on Fosset.

12
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.000
Ethan it's 0.

13
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.640
The advantage of doing this as well is that the router does not need to process packets unnecessarily

14
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.780
which is just going to be dropped elsewhere in the network.

15
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.770
So we will apply the access list as close to the source as we can and the closest interfaces F-Series

16
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.130
level 0.

17
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:31.540
So the first statement should permit HDP traffic from 10 1 1 1 to 10 1 to 1 on the Rodda going into

18
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.220
global configuration mode.

19
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.850
I can talk to him on this list and notice once again is a range of numbers.

20
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.820
We are going to choose one in this range 100 to 199 because we're creating an extended IP access list.

21
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:54.260
So let's pick 100 now we're going to say permit notice here we can permit multiple protocols.

22
00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.120
Now this is where it becomes important knowing what lower level protocols Hialeah protocols like HTP

23
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.930
use.

24
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:08.890
So in this example we are looking to permit HTP HGP relies on TGP at least for.

25
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:16.430
And there was a model so we are going to specify TZP and Boadicea we can specify a source.

26
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.860
So I'm going to do it this way.

27
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.220
I notice I can put in my wildcard bits.

28
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.620
So that was the source.

29
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.340
And now we need to specify a destination.

30
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:36.660
In this case the destination is 10 1 to 1 so doing it another way I'm going to specify a host 10 Dalt

31
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.170
one to 2 to one.

32
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.830
And that is if I press question mark at the end it gives me many options here including equal which

33
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:52.700
allows me to match on a specific port number or greater than which allows me to look at port numbers

34
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.930
greater than a certain number.

35
00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.700
All less then which allows me to look at port numbers less than a specific number.

36
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.970
All range which allows me to look at port numbers in a specific range.

37
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:11.140
But in this case we're looking for HTP so I'm going to topic him on equal press question mark.

38
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:20.270
I notice I can enter a specific port number if I know the number or I can use the word and notice the

39
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.580
many words here.

40
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:31.460
But notice as an example HGP use of the word GWW so I could either put in 80 or I could put in w WW.

41
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.960
Once again notice the dollar sign.

42
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.340
It's just telling me that there's more to the left.

43
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.970
So I put in the command control a They'll take me to the beginning of the line or control e takes me

44
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.100
to the end of the line that dollars just telling me that there's more takes than what can fit on the

45
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.600
specific output.

46
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.900
So it's just hidden some of the text to make it easier to read.

47
00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.810
So I can hit enter so that completes the first part of the access list.

48
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.910
Now we have to deny all of the traffic from that specific subnet to the server.

49
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:15.610
So I could to come on this list 100 and in this case specify denie.

50
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.850
Now we have to specify protocol so we can just deny everything.

51
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:30.040
In other words deny all IP the source is tendered 1. 1.0 put in the wildcard mos.

52
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:36.930
The destination is aspecific host which is 10 1 2 2 0 1 it enter.

53
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.130
So that line denies all other traffic.

54
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:52.060
So in other words all IP traffic is denied from subnet 10 1 1 0 10 1 1 0 with the relevant mosque going

55
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.540
to host 10 1 to 1 which is what we've got configured here.

56
00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.520
So we have successfully created the second part of the axis list.

57
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:09.110
The third part is saying permit all other traffic from subnet anywhere else so I could literally just

58
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:21.650
say access list 100 Myrt IP and we're going to specify that specific subnet Tendo squandered 1.0 with

59
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.880
the mosque.

60
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.790
And in this case I can say any way.

61
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.340
So any the last step is to bind the access list on the interface.

62
00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:36.140
So IP access group 100 in.

63
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:45.430
Now just to show you what we've configured show access list shows me in this case that I've got an extended

64
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:46.850
IP access list.

65
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:53.480
The first line is permitting TCAP from that host 10 1 on 1 to host 10 1 to 1.

66
00:05:53.620 --> 00:06:00.890
And notice the rod has automatically changed the port number into the name description double-D WW.

67
00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:08.050
The second line is denying traffic from that subnet to the host 10 1 to 1 and the third line is permitting

68
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.430
traffic from that subnet anyway.

69
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:21.850
Show IP interface 0 0 shows me an example that that access list is bound inbound on Fosset Ethernet

70
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.080
Cirrus flesh sirra.

71
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.410
So we have accomplished what we set out to do based on those criteria.

72
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:39.880
In this example we want to permit both HGP and TFT traffic from the submit 10 1 1 0 slash 24 to the

73
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:40.750
server.

74
00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:49.630
In other words devices on the subnet should be able to open SCDP sessions and DFT sessions to the server.

75
00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:54.330
We then want to deny all other traffic from the subnet to the server.

76
00:06:54.340 --> 00:07:01.270
In other words we only want to allow HTP and TFT the traffic to the server and no other traffic.

77
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:06.470
But we also want to permit all other traffic from the subnet anywhere else.

78
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:12.730
In other words these devices and the subnet should be able to access this server to actually TFT TFT.

79
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:17.920
They should not be able to use any other protocols to access the server but they should be able to connect

80
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.840
for instance to this MacBook using any protocol.

81
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:26.480
So the first thing we need to look at is the direction and once again the traffic is flowing from the

82
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.040
left hand side to the right hand side.

83
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:36.830
Once again as our base practices we will apply the access list inbound on FASA Ethernet 00 on our one

84
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:44.860
because this is the interface closest to the source of traffic so to do that on our road to go into

85
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:50.260
global config mode again top access list choose a number.

86
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:54.240
In this case choose 101 because its an extended access list.

87
00:07:54.240 --> 00:08:02.880
I mean the next one available choose commed and this case which is our protocol we are going to be permitting

88
00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.900
both HGP and TFT P from the subnet to the server.

89
00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:20.320
Remember HGP uses TZP Atlay for that TFT P uses UDP at Layer 4 so firstly TCAP the source network is

90
00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:28.350
10 1 1 0 the wildcard mosque 0 0 0 255.

91
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.970
So that's our source.

92
00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:38.330
And now we have to specify the destination the destination is our server 10 dot 1.2 to 1.

93
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:43.630
And now we can choose either equal or greater than less than or range and so forth.

94
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:46.420
In this case we're going to say equal to port 80.

95
00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:56.310
In other words HTP the next line would be 40 50 p before we do that let's put a remark in just to make

96
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.350
it easier to understand.

97
00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:13.240
So I'd say Remarque SMRT London site to New York City for example and they will say access this 101

98
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:15.710
Matt.

99
00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:20.500
In this case you have to specify UDP because TFT uses UDP.

100
00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.490
The source

101
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:28.320
subnet going to the destination.

102
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.220
In this case I'll just change it around just to show you that both options will work.

103
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:36.960
I can specify the server with a mosque.

104
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:40.510
And in this case the set equal and notice now please.

105
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:48.980
The protocols are different because we are using UDP as an example you won't see HTP in this list but

106
00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:58.170
you will see TFT the rod is clever enough to know which Hiler protocols use UDP or TZP.

107
00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:01.330
And in this example we specified UDP.

108
00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:03.040
So I'm just going to say 69.

109
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.800
It's also at a remark to make this more descriptive exercise 101

110
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:20.050
remark met TFT from London site to New York service for example.

111
00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:26.160
That remark is obviously just for us as humans to know what's going on and has no effect on the router.

112
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:33.750
So we have permitted HGP and TFT traffic from that subnet to the server and now we are told to deny

113
00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:37.460
all other traffic from the subnet to the server.

114
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:42.290
So access list one deny.

115
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:53.690
And because this is an IP based access let's begin to deny IP tendered wondered 1.0 0.02 0 to 255 and

116
00:10:53.690 --> 00:11:01.700
we're told only deny traffic from that subnet to the server so the destination will be host 10 one or

117
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.080
two to one.

118
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:10.450
So we've met the second criteria the last step is to permit all other traffic from the subnet anywhere

119
00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:24.810
else so we would say access list 101 commit 10 dot dot 1.0 with a mosque anywhere the last step is to

120
00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:31.590
bind it on to the interface interface if sera sera as per our best practices begin to bind it in in-bound

121
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:44.400
and this interface so IP X-ists group 101 in and that's at in this example we want to promote HTP and

122
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:53.820
TFT traffic from any way to the server 10 1 to 1 but we're going to deny all of the traffic to the server.

123
00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:55.930
So now things are a little bit different.

124
00:11:55.980 --> 00:12:00.630
We are only allowing a European TFT from anywhere to the server.

125
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:09.750
So traffic from this host as well as these hosts needs to have access to the server but only HGP and

126
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:11.900
TFT traffic.

127
00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:18.240
If we were asked to only apply a single access list we would need to apply it outbound and if Sarah

128
00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:24.990
is left for However we were given the option to apply multiple access control lists we would for instance

129
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:33.930
apply it on 0 1 on Arti as well as 0 7 0 on or 1 which would have the effect that traffic that is going

130
00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:39.870
to be dropped will be dropped sooner and quicker rather than traversing the when link and then being

131
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:46.620
dropped as when using this setup so easy to read between the lines and determine what you are being

132
00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:51.630
asked to do and what restrictions have been placed on your solutions.

133
00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:57.090
So on the route of before we go any further lets see what access lists have been configured so I can

134
00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:04.710
do the C'mon show run pipe include access list which will just show me the access list part of the configuration

135
00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:06.020
on this router.

136
00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:13.600
As you can see here we created this list three ACL four ACL five

137
00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:21.800
extended ACL 100 an extended ACL 101.

138
00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:27.350
Notice its easier to see what's going on when the remarks or descriptions have been added to the access

139
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:30.660
list to going into level configuration mode.

140
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:37.460
I can top the command access list one or two per murd TZP.

141
00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:43.050
Any host 10 not 1 or 2 to 1 or all of the

142
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:49.360
equal 80 once again be very careful.

143
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:55.220
What I've just done there that statement no access list one or two would have removed the entire access

144
00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:55.940
list.

145
00:13:56.030 --> 00:14:02.360
I'll show you in a moment how you can edit individual lines on an access list and an access list 100

146
00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:05.740
to permit UDP.

147
00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:12.350
Any host ten dollars $1.2 one equal sixty nine.

148
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:17.850
That will accomplish what we set out to do with this first statement and then we need to deny all other

149
00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:19.900
traffic on that server.

150
00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:31.520
So access list one or two deny IP any and don't forget you have to put the source and destination I

151
00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:33.340
can now that's a mistake.

152
00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:40.010
Now if I do that Kim Monge do show access list one or two.

153
00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:49.390
You'll notice these line numbers 10 20 30 later versions of the Iowas the rajah to automatically puts

154
00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:56.280
line numbers on each line created which is great because it allows us to edit individual lines if I

155
00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:04.110
tap the command no access list wanted to deny IP any any to try and remove this last line.

156
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:06.560
It will remove the entire access list.

157
00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:13.900
So rather than doing that I can do the common IP access list extended because this is an extended IP

158
00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:21.640
access list and then I put the number in and then I can type node city to remove line 30 stopping the

159
00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:30.140
come do show access list one or two will show you that that last line has been removed.

160
00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:44.750
And I could add the line back by saying city deny any host 10 1 or 2 to 1 or rather the night IP any

161
00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:53.430
host 10 1 to 1 and not doing a show come on shows me that that line has been added correctly.

162
00:15:55.580 --> 00:16:00.020
So that makes life a lot easier rather than having to delete the access list and then recreate it from

163
00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.790
scratch or editing a notepad.

164
00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:05.220
You could edit it directly on the router.

165
00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:11.440
The last step once again would be to bind it on the interface if seriously 6 zero outbound.
