00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:06.240
Telcos or service providers offer leased lines with different speeds.

2
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.530
However you as a customer conscious pick some arbitrary speed.

3
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:18.330
The speeds of leased lines follow the standards of older technology in the US it's called to the T carrier

4
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.520
system and in other parts of the world.

5
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.300
It's called the E carrier system.

6
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.770
This comes originally from Alexander Graham Bell and the way that analog voice is digitized.

7
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:38.340
So as an example when you speak it's an analog signal and you sending sound waves through the air but

8
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.180
that gets digitized using something called the Night quest theorem and your analog voice is converted

9
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:52.320
into a 64 kilobytes per second stream using a technology called time division multiple axing a single

10
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.580
voice call.

11
00:00:53.580 --> 00:01:00.510
In most parts of the world using older technology such as ISDN is a 64 kilobytes per second.

12
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.830
In the US you'll typically find 56 kilohertz per second when bonded together.

13
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:15.960
Speeds can be increased so as an example a popular one is a T1 which consists of 24 64 kilohertz per

14
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.350
second sessions plus eight kilobytes per second for overhead in a single connection or single leased

15
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.810
line which provides one point five four megabits per second.

16
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:36.090
Don't worry too much about the details but for example a D 0 or digital signal level 0 provides 64 kilohertz

17
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:44.070
per second at t1 consists of 24 64 kilohertz per second sessions plus 8 kilobytes per second overhead

18
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.590
giving you one point five four megabits per second.

19
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:55.710
So this is 24 DS zeros plus eight kilobytes overhead giving you a T1 speed of one point five four megabits

20
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.990
per second.

21
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.770
That's a standard used in the US in Europe as an example.

22
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.910
We have an E 1 rather than a T1 which gives you just over 2 megabits per second.

23
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:17.340
So two point zero for eight and that consists of 32 DSL rows or 32 64 kilobytes per second channels

24
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:30.240
a D 0 or digital signal level 0 is a 64 kilobytes per second channel a T1 consists of 24 channels each

25
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.030
providing 64 kilobytes per second.

26
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:43.770
Some other US examples at T2 is for T1 lines provide 6 megabits per second at T3 is 28 T1 lines providing

27
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:53.880
48 megabits per second at T4 consists of 168 T1 lines giving you 274 megabits per second in Europe and

28
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.030
each one is just over 2 megabits per second.

29
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:05.450
E 2 is 8 megabits per second E 3s 34 megabits per second and an E 4 is 140 megabits per second.

30
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:13.590
If you're going to remember anyone a t1 is one point five four four megabits per second and an E one

31
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.370
is two point zero for eight megabits per second.

32
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:25.530
So the easy issue dishy which is acting as the DCI e is using clocking to control when the router sends

33
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.330
data and it also is configured for the relevant speed of the connection.

34
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:39.150
So the DC controls the speed of the serial connection and the rudder is controlled by the clocking signals

35
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.540
that it receives from the DC.

36
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.230
This issue tells a writer went to send and receive bits.

37
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:52.740
The rudder will only send and receive bits when instructed to by the DCP because of the clocking that

38
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.080
the DC is providing on the cable.
