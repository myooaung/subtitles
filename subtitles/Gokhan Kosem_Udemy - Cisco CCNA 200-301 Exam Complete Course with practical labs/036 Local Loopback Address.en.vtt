00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Another special type of address is the Local Loopback Address

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
which is very useful for testing, a device can send a message

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
to itself and this helps verify or make sure that

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the TCP/IP stack is installed correctly on that machine

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
A typical Loopback IP Address is 127.0.0.1 but remember please

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that anything in the 127 range is deemed a Loopback Address

7
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This is often seen as one of the big mistakes by the designers

8
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
of IPv4, a 127 address is a Class A Address

9
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Class A Addresses have 16 million odd host addresses

10
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and by chossing this address range for the Loopback Address

11
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
we lost the use of potentially 16 million IP Addresses

12
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Host Addresses cannot be allocated as Public IP Addresses

13
00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:04.000
on the Internet thus making the IPv4 Address space smaller than

14
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
it may have been, in IPv6 a different addresses used for the

15
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
loopback ::1 and they made sure that they didn't make

16
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
the same mistake again

17
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So here's an example, I can type ipconfig on my PC

18
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and this will give me the IP Address of my machine

19
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
In this example it's 10.0.0.6 that's the Local IPv4 Address

20
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
on my PC, so I could ping 10.0.0.6

21
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and as you can see the ping succeeds

22
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I can also however ping my Loopback Address

23
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So I could ping 127.0.0.1

24
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and notice the ping also succeeds

25
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
but don't forget anything in this ranges supported

26
00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
so 127.127.127.127 is also a Loopback Address

27
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
What about 127.1.2.3?

28
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000
it also works, so anything in the range 127.x.x.x

29
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
is also a Loopback Address and anyone of those addresses

30
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
could be used to test the TCP/IP Stack

31
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Now this machine has both IPv4 and IPv6 installed

32
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So here's my PC's IPv6 Address

33
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000
So I could ping 2001:20::2 which is my Local PCs IP Address

34
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000
but I could also ping ::1 which is my IPv6 Loopback Address

35
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Now this video doesn't discuss IPv6 in any detail

36
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
But it's worth fighting out that we have both an IPv4 Loopback

37
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000
such as 127.0.0.1 as well as an IPv6 Loopback such as ::1

38
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
IPv6 Addresses are not wasted or to be more politically correct

39
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
IPv6 Addresses are optimized more than they are in IPv4

40
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Please also note that routers and switches

41
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
also have Loopback Addresses and that's not the same concept

42
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
as the Loopback Address that we're discussing here

43
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
So be aware that in the field or in the real world

44
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Engineers will often refer to a routers Loopback Address

45
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and that's not the same as what we're discussing here

46
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
You've got the Local Loopback which is the Class A Address

47
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
127.0.0.1 but routers and switches can also be configured

48
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
with valid IP Addresses on what's called a Loopback interface

49
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
So a router or switch may have a Loopback Interface such as

50
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Interface Loopback 0, configured with an IP Address

51
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.000
of 10.1.1.1/32, so in other words we have a Class A Address

52
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000
10.1.1.1 with a /32 mask configured on a Loopback Interface

53
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
but Network Engineers may refer to the router's Loopback

54
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
IP Address and they are referring to this IP Address

55
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.000
and not 127.0.0.1, I will explain as I've mentioned in a moment

56
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
what a Network mask does but what I'd like to point out here

57
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
is that routers and switches have separate Loopback Addresses

58
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
which are different to the Local Loopback Address

59
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
that we're discussing now, routers and switches do support the

60
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Loopback Address of 127.x.x.x which allows us to verify

61
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
the TCP/IP Stack but Loopback interfaces

62
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
on routers and switches are very useful for other things

63
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
and are used by routing protocols such as OSPF
