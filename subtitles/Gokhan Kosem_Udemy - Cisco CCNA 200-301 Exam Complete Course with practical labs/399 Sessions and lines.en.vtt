00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.520
You can also view the connections to the Rotto switch by using the show uses command.

2
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:15.810
So show uses shows us that we connected via cons. zero but we also connected via a telnet session from

3
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.690
this IP address.

4
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:28.930
So if I exit out of the telnet session show users now shows that we only connected via the console log

5
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.630
in vide the telnet session again show uses.

6
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:40.720
Shows us that the telnet session is now active I'll jump back to Route 1 using the keystrokes control

7
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.800
shift 6 x and open up a nut the telnet session.

8
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:57.130
Show users now shows us that David is connected to Viti y 0 as well as to why one control shift to 6

9
00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:07.020
x open up another session control shifts 6 x to another.

10
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:21.000
So we now have four Etiwanda sessions open jumped back Mother told that session show uses we now connect

11
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.730
to.

12
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.760
And what's interesting is not just the username is not case sensitive.

13
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.250
In this example but the past that is case sensitive.

14
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:36.100
So we've got one two three four five evictee why sessions for jump back to the rot.

15
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.640
Now Rodda one and try and telnet again.

16
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:53.480
Notice the session is refused because we only enabled 5 V-twin y sessions from 0 to full at the moment.

17
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.430
Five V-twin sessions are being used.

18
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.710
So it's six.

19
00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.800
One is refused or rejected.

20
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:10.610
Now here we could clear a line 98 or using the command clear line and specifying a number so it could

21
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.040
say 98.

22
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.610
Just to show you that again we could clear this line.

23
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:26.740
Well we could clear the Viti why it's a clear line 98 confirm show uses 98 has been disconnected and

24
00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.730
now on route 1 we can telnet back to router 2.

25
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.110
So we have our session on line 98.

26
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:46.660
Reason why is when you type show line you'll see that the console is teach you why the zero the exhilarate

27
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:56.290
port on the router is line 97 and the first Viti why he's line 98 that's to do with asynchronous modules

28
00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.210
that he can insert into a router which use what are called TDY lines.

29
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.460
In this case I'll telnet to a physical Rodda that I've got running locally.

30
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.650
And I'll log in.

31
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:21.600
This is a 36 40 router show line shows me that I have a console as well as a lot of TDY lines.

32
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.660
These allow me to implement reverse telnet sessions and then on exhilarate connection and then my Viti

33
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.330
why sessions on this router.

34
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.590
So show line once again.

35
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.450
First line is is the console.

36
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.710
Then we have a range of teach you wise then the exhilarate line and then Viti lines.

37
00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:50.930
Hence the number of these Viti waterlines is not one or two because you can have reverse console connections

38
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.960
on a router in the old days.

39
00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:00.410
This was used for asynchronous modems so the early old days on routers we had asynchronous modems and

40
00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:07.460
we would connect via those modems on various TDY lines so just type show line if you if you're not sure

41
00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.960
what numbers are that will vary from device to device.

42
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:22.730
So on this virtual switch show line shows me that the Sillery port is line 1 and the value line is line

43
00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:30.030
2 because it doesn't support T.T. why asynchronous modems whereas a router such as a thirty seven twenty

44
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.080
five does.

45
00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:42.530
So I could also type clear line Viti Y and specify number so 0 and the connection was closed.

46
00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.750
So tell me back

47
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:56.170
username is David not Siska show line shows me various lines show user uses.

48
00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.210
Shows me that at the moment this is the only active a y line.

49
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.100
You can also see the stall associated with V-2 on line.

50
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.470
The other stations would have timed out because of a timer.

51
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.410
So once again if I jump back.

52
00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:17.080
Control shift 6 x another telnet session show line.

53
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:24.760
You can see the console is active and so both these 51 lines show users.

54
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:33.150
Shows me that I have two connections between zero and VTR I one play a line 99.

55
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:41.250
Notice the connection was closed on this router shows sessions shows me my current sessions and then

56
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:46.470
I could do something like disconnect which will disconnect the last active session.

57
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:53.420
So show sessions shows me that 6 was closed.

58
00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.550
I could also do it this way.

59
00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:00.670
Disconnect three show sessions.

60
00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:02.140
Three is not available.

61
00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:07.990
If I want to restore session I could just simply select the connection number so one.

62
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.140
But as you can see that's being closed.

63
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:20.670
So show session two that was closed by the remote host for that was closed five that was closed.

64
00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.280
So I have no active sessions at the moment.

65
00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:36.100
And if I telnet it back to the router and logged in control shift 6 x Take me back show sessions select

66
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.740
session 1 and notice that resumes.

67
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.600
And I am now on route to.
