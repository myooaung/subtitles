00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:09.920
Span or switched port analyzer also called Port merging or port monitoring is a way to configure a switch

2
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:17.240
to make copies of Ethernet frames that are received on certain ports or certain v lines.

3
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:24.050
You could say as an example that all traffic arriving on Port gigabit to 1 0 1 gets copied out of another

4
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.910
port gigabit to 1 0 2.

5
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:33.120
Or you could say that all traffic that's received or sent on VLAN 1 is copied out of a gigabit.

6
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.900
One zero to spend becomes really important when you want to monitor traffic.

7
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.560
That's not destined to a specific device.

8
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:49.490
As an example you may have a network analyzer or intrusion detection system that needs to monitor traffic

9
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.520
that traverses your network.

10
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:59.750
You can configure a switch to either make copies of frames out of a local port or as you'll learn later

11
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:07.220
use what is called remote spam where you copy frames from a local switch to a remote switch so that

12
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.040
a remote monitoring station can receive the traffic.
