00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Even if it was running at only 10 Mbps

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
provides a full 10 Mbps to the PC connected to the port.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
In other words PC A gets a full 10 Mbps

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
rather than sharing that bandwidth with other devices.

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
That’s very different to the 0.75 Mbps we had when we were using a hub.

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
10 Mbps is dedicated on individual ports rather than being shared between devices.

7
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So if you add more devices on the switch

8
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
it doesn’t degrade the throughput that each device gets.

9
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
In addition you can increase the speed by changing the duplex.

10
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So by setting this to full duplex you actually get 20 Mbps

11
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
hubs operated by using CSMA/CD which is very similar to 10base2.

12
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
with shared bandwidth they are collisions whereas

13
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
with a switch when full duplex is enabled it means that you can send

14
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and receive traffic at the same time.

15
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Half duplex communication is like a walky talky

16
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
where only one side can send at any given time.

17
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So one party would say "Hello! How are you?" over

18
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and over is used to indicate to the other party that they can speak.

19
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
The other party would then say something and end with the word over.

20
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So that the first party could say something.

21
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
The moral of the story is that only one party can transmit at any given time

22
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
if both parties try to transmit at the same time,

23
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
there’ll be a collision that’s half duplex.

24
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Full duplex communication on the other hand is like a landline telephone

25
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
where you can speak and listen at the same time.

26
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Landline telephones use full duplex so both parties can speak

27
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and listen simultaneously whereas walkie talkies are half duplex devices

28
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
where one party can transmit and the other party needs to receive.

29
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Walkie talkies only one person can speak at a time

30
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
landline telephones both parties can speak at the same time.

31
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Walkie talkies as an analogy are half duplex, landline telephones are full duplex.

32
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Hubs once again use Carrier Sense Multiple Accesses Collision Detection

33
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
in other words half duplex where only one party can transmit at any given time.

34
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
An individual port on a switch however, you can set those ports to use full duplex

35
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
which means that both the switch and the PC

36
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
can transmit and receive at the same time.

37
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Just be aware however that when you enable full duplex,

38
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
collision detection is turned off because the devices operate on that premise

39
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
that they can send and receive at the same time.

40
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
So there’s no need to have collision detection because no collections will take place.

41
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
That will cause issues however where 1 side is set to full duplex

42
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
and the other side is set to half duplex.

43
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
It is important that full duplex be enabled on both sides

44
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
if you wanna use full duplex.

45
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
But once again in this example if full duplex is enabled

46
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.000
rather than only having 10 Mbps in theory you can increase that to 20 Mbps

47
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
because both parties can transmit and receive at the same time.

48
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
So by just replacing a hub with a switch

49
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.000
we can increase the throughput of of this network from 0.75 Mbps to 20 Mbps

50
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
all we did was replace the hub with the switch and enabled full duplex.

51
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Now full duplex is often negotiated automatically between devices.

52
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
So the switch and the PC will negotiate to use full duplex

53
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
if they both support it and will hopefully choose correctly.

54
00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
In networks it does happen that 1 side chooses full duplex

55
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and the other side chooses half duplex.

56
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And that’s gonna cause a lot of problems on that link.

57
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
So if users complaining about slow throughput

58
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000
check the duplex on both sides and check that it’s been negotiated correctly

59
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
because it may have negotiated incorrectly.

60
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Speed by the same token can also negotiated between a switch in a PC

61
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and that could also be incorrectly negotiated.

62
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
These days PCs tends to have gig ports

63
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and thus the bandwidth can increase

64
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000
from 0.75 Mbps when using a hub to 2 gigabits per second

65
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
The throughput of switches is much, much greater than hubs

66
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
and therefore switches are preferred today

67
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
over other devices like hubs or bridges.

68
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Be aware however that in wireless networks

69
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
access points tend to operate like hubs

70
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000
which have a shared infrastructure which therefore means

71
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000
shared bandwidth where as with switches devices have dedicated bandwidth.

72
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
So in summary a switches a layer 2 device in the OSI model

73
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
it operates at the data link layer.

74
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Switches have major advantages when compared with hubs

75
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and bridges and that’s to do with the throughput

76
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
and scalability of networks using switches.

77
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Switches process frames in hardware rather than in software

78
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and can therefore process frames at wire speed

79
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
as well as supporting many more ports than bridges and hubs.

80
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000
These days switches can also operated layer 3, hence the term layer 3 switches.

81
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
But for the moment we're just talking about pure layer 2 switches.

82
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
We'll know discuss routers and then we can talk about layer 3 switches.
