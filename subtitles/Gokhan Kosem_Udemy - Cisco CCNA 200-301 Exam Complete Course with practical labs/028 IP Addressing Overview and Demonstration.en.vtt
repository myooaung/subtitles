00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.820
In this video we're going to look at IP version for tracing.

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.380
I'm going to give you an overview of IP version 4 addresses and explain the basics of provision for

3
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.310
addressing.

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.630
From now on I'm going to refer to IP addresses but be a way of please that I'm discussing IP version

5
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.250
4 addresses in this video and not IP version 6 addresses.

6
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.710
We're going to look at an overview of IP addresses what they looked like and how they function.

7
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.670
I'm going to explain the various address classes that you get an IP version 4.

8
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.000
In other words plus A plus B plus C plus D and Class E.

9
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.750
We'll also talk about cyder.

10
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.030
We'll see IDR and how that changes the address classes.

11
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:53.130
But as a foundation it's important that you understand the 5 address classes A B C D and he will look

12
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:59.310
at special IP addresses including the loopback address the local broadcast address and other special

13
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.160
addresses.

14
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:07.800
And lastly I'm going to explain what network mosques do and why they important with regards to IP addressing.

15
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:15.560
So what is an IP address an IP address is a layer 3 logical address assigned by an administrator.

16
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.380
Unlike MAC addresses which are hard coded or burnt into Network Interface Cards by the manufacturer

17
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.500
an IP address is configured by an administrator.

18
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.160
The IP address may change within a subnet.

19
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:36.620
For example when using DHP or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol an IP address resides at a layer 3

20
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.250
in the overside model.

21
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.590
Please refer to the oocyte videos for more details on how the overside model works.

22
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:50.370
An IP address is used to uniquely identify a device on the network and is used by routers to determine

23
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.770
where that device is.

24
00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:01.500
So a router routes traffic to a destination IP address based on a hierarchy of network and host which

25
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.480
will talk about in a moment.

26
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:10.950
So once again the IP address uniquely identifies a device in a network in a similar way to how houses

27
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.300
are uniquely identified him Street houses in the street have a unique address.

28
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:26.160
So for example 10 Oxford Street in the same way a host in a network has a unique identifier on that

29
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.650
network being its IP address.

30
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.970
I'm going to expand on that analogy in the next few minutes.

31
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.090
Every device on Internet has a unique IP address.

32
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.630
So they are millions of IP addresses out there.

33
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.790
And no two devices can have the same IP address for communication on the Internet.

34
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:52.980
Every device needs a unique IP address and hence the move to IP version 6 these days because of IP version

35
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.780
4 address exhaustion.

36
00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:01.740
So for example you cannot have a device 10 dot 1.1 but one communicating with a another device with

37
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.920
the same IP address that's going to cause a conflict in the network.

38
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:13.440
Every device on the Internet has its own unique IP address and requires a unique IP address for communication.

39
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:22.270
Now I will be talking about RAFC 1918 addresses in a moment in that RAFC private IP address as I explained.

40
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:31.150
So tender at 1.1 that one is an example of a private IP address as specified in our FC 19:18 you know

41
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:38.010
a lot of organizations today private IP addresses are used internally and then those addresses on nattered

42
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.870
or network address translated onto the Internet.

43
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:49.410
So when a device with IP address 10 1 1 1 is connected to a public IP address such as 12 to one that

44
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:57.890
1.1 the public IP address in this case 12 the one at one time one needs to be unique on the Internet.

45
00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:04.200
For now just understand that IP address is on the internet need to be unique from each other network

46
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.050
address translation or Knecht once again is not covered in this video.

47
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.930
But I will be discussing that in the set of CCMA videos.

48
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:20.430
So be aware that in the real world multiple companies may use my IP address to send out one but one

49
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:25.280
at one but those addresses are not tied to unique IP addresses.

50
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.900
When those devices in traffic onto the Internet.

51
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.560
Now here's a quick demonstration of some IP addresses.

52
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.430
If I'm paying w w w dot yahoo dot com.

53
00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.970
Notice that the domain name is translated to an IP address.

54
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:50.540
So in this case yahoo dot com is translated by a protocol called DNS or Domain Name Service to an IP

55
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:56.370
address of 87 dot 2:48 dot 112 dot 181.

56
00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.540
DNS is used to convert easy to read names to IP addresses.

57
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:09.790
It's much easier to remember a simple name such as Yahoo dot com or Cisco dot com or BBC.

58
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:16.410
It's here to UK rather than having to remember the IP address of those domain names.

59
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:23.450
As an analogy this is similar to a phone book where we are translating human friendly computer names

60
00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.100
to IP addresses.

61
00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:32.090
But what I'd like you to notice is that the IP address of yahoo dot com was resolved and we got an IP

62
00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.490
address of 87 to 4 8 1 1 2 181.

63
00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.100
I could pick another web site such as HP dot com.

64
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:47.160
Notice the IP address is translated to 15 from 192 45 139.

65
00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.160
Now a lot of Web sites don't permit pings which uses ICMP.

66
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.860
So the request times out.

67
00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:01.540
But notice that the DNS server did resolve HP to come to a 15 address.

68
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.210
Now in a moment I'm going to explain what class A addresses are.

69
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:14.780
But for this example HP own the 15 class a public address range so anything that starts with 15 in the

70
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.370
first octet belongs to HP.

71
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:25.670
Here's another example a pink Google dot com notice in this case it resolves to 74 125 233 50.
