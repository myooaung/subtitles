00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:07.170
In the section we're going to discuss network address translation or not and port address translation

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.280
or pet.

3
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.190
We'll discuss why Knecht is required.

4
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.430
Why do we use net in networks today.

5
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:21.480
We'll also discuss the difference between fact and past and we'll discuss the Cisco term overloading

6
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:29.830
which implies that a lot of network engineers talk about net even though they actually mean packed.

7
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.100
So we need to understand the differences between those two terms.

8
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.500
And as always I'd like to demonstrate how to set up Nat using the command line interface.

9
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:46.920
We'll look at different types of not including static not dynamic Nat and Pacht or overloading as Cisco

10
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.400
call it.
