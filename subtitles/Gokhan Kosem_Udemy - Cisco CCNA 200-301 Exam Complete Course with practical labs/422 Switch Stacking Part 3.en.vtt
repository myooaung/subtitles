Noted that each stacking module has two ports with which it's used to connect it to another such as

2
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:13.080
stacking module so as an example if you've got four switches Each switch has a stacking module and four

3
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.290
cables are used to connect the four switches together the way you think of this is the switches are

4
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.920
a stack of switches in the same rack.

5
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.170
One of the reasons for doing that is that the stacking cables are very short in length so it's expected

6
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.140
that the switches are physically positioned next to each other or on top of each other.

7
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.140
As an example some of the Cisco stacking cables are only half a meter in length or one meter in length

8
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.700
or three meters in length.

9
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.300
Again you need to think of a switch stack as a logical single switch.

10
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.080
You may have four physical switches but logically that acting as one switch one of the switches in the

11
00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:02.040
stack becomes the stack master and it's used to control the rest of the switches in the stack.

12
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.980
The physical stacking cables connect the physical switches to each other and allow for communication

13
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:14.520
between the switches in the stack but the master switch is in control of the stack.

14
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.600
If as an example you have four switches in a stack and a frame arrives on switch four and needs to exit

15
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:30.300
out a switch three but switch one as the master switch switches 1 3 and 4 all need to communicate over

16
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.810
the stack links to forward the frame such as one three and four would need to communicate with each

17
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.460
other over the stack.

18
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:46.380
Links to forward the frame switch one being the master switch would match the Ethan at frame to the

19
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.850
MAC address table and would then decide out of which port to forward the frame.

20
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:59.250
Think of the master switch as the brain of the stack logically in a topology like this.

21
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:06.390
We have two physical switches but logically they are a single switch and the same would be true if we

22
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.650
had four switches.
