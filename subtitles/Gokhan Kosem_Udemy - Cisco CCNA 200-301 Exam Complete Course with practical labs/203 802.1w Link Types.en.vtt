00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So how is this rapid convergence or rapid transition to forwarding state

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
accomplish in 802.1W or Rapid Spanning Tree                .

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
This is one of the most important features introduced in Rapid Spanning Tree

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
the difference is that legacy Spanning Tree

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
in other words, the legacy Spanning Tree algorithm passively waited for the network

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
to converge before moving a port into the forwarding state.

7
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Achieving faster convergence was a matter of tuning

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
the conservative default parameters are forward delay and max_age timers.

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
so in the past, you would try and manipulate these timers to get Spanning Tree

10
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
to converge quicker but this often resulted in the sacrificing of network stability.

11
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Rapid Spanning Tree is able to actively confirm that a port can safely transition

12
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
to forwarding without relying on any timer configuration.

13
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
that’s the big difference it do went rely on timers

14
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
there is a negotiation between the switches on point-to-point links

15
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
to allow them to  converge quicker.

16
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
so there’s a feedback mechanism that operates

17
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
between Rapid Spanning Tree compliant bridges to achieve faster convergence

18
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
you need to configure edge port and links between switches

19
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
you need to become point-to-point links.

20
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Now an edge point is essentially the same as Portfast ports

21
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
they transition immediately to the forwarding state.

22
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
This is to allow end stations to skip the listening

23
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and learning stages in Spanning Tree convergence

24
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
an edge port also does not generate topology changes

25
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
when its link toggles

26
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
so in other words, when a link goes down or comes up

27
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and its configure as an edge port or a Portfast port

28
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
it doesn’t cause the network topology to recalculate.

29
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Unlike Portfast through an edge port that receives the BPDU

30
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
immediately losses it's edge port status

31
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and becomes normal Spanning Tree port

32
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
that is a built-in security mechanism to stop someone accidentally plugging in

33
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
a switch or a hub into Portfast port and causing a loop.

34
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
In Cisco's implementation, the portfast command is used for edge port configuration

35
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
thus making the transition to Rapid Spanning Tree simpler

36
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
in a separate video, I'll show you the configuration and testing of Portfast ports.

37
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I’ve already demonstrated how to set up a point-to-point link

38
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
this is automatically determined on physical switches using the duplex of a port.

39
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
A port operating in  full duplex is assumed to be point-to-point

40
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
half duplex is considered to be a shared port.

41
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
On switch 2 in this topology gigabit 0/0 is a point-to-point link

42
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
gigabit 0/1 is a shared port because it's connected to a hub.

43
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
it’s a half duplex connection.

44
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
In today’s networks, most links are operating in full duplex mode

45
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and are therefore treated as point-point links between switches in Rapid Spanning Tree
