00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:08.520
At the moment the show I.P not statistics shows me that I have one active translation and zero dynamic

2
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.160
and zero extended the outside interfaces all fast.

3
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.620
Ethan at 0 1 insight into faces is first.

4
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.240
Ethan it is 0 0.

5
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.550
I've had a certain number of hits a certain number of packets have been translated by Ceph expired translations

6
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.630
is five.

7
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.320
Now telnet back to Rotto 1

8
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:41.770
show the net translations shows me that I now have about active net translation and when I look at statistics

9
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:48.880
and notice I have two translations one being static and one being done Nemec the number of hits has

10
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.540
also increased.

11
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:59.890
I have one extended translation and extended Natu translation maps one IP address and port page to another.

12
00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.970
So I have one IP address and port number mapped to another on my Rodda all use Control shift 6 x to

13
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:14.180
jump back to router 3 and tell that back again to run a 1 looking at the statistics.

14
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:22.190
Now I see that I have three translations one being static to dynamic to extended and we can see that

15
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.300
again by using the show IP net translations command these are static entry.

16
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.060
Here the two dynamic entries that have been created from that static entry.
