1
00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:06.750
So what will do once again is remove the layer 3 information on switch 1 and make this into the land

2
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.430
routing device.

3
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.520
Once again this is not something you want to do in the real world.

4
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.900
It's just to show you what's happening in the background.

5
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:23.970
So remove the IP address from the land one from violent to and from the LAN 11

6
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:41.800
so show IP interface brief No IP addresses or could frigate's on which one Serat of one won't be able

7
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.640
to ping 10 1 to 4 right.

8
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.040
One cannot ping Rato for acting as a PC.

9
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.650
So let's have a look at Route Fife and configure it and run a five interface if zero slashes zero.

10
00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.210
No shut all that out of the interface first.

11
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.720
Ethan it is 0 0 dot 1.

12
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.670
This is creating a sub interface.

13
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:13.600
If I try and configure an IP address directly on this interface it's going to fail because it needs

14
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.890
to know the ADA 2.1.

15
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:25.140
Q tagging so encapsulation top one key villain one and this is the native line.

16
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.710
Now I'll be able to put an IP address on that interface subdues do show run

17
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.130
no IP addresses configured on the physical interface and IP addresses configured on this subject to

18
00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.850
face some interface one.

19
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.570
Let's create one foot two.

20
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.240
So encapsulation got one key too.

21
00:01:48.340 --> 00:02:00.680
In other words we to IP Address tend to 1 to 2 to 5 4 with the mosque interface Fosset Ethernet 0 0

22
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:11.920
11 and kept isolation not one key villaine number is 11 IP address tendered one to 11 to 4 for

23
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.890
show run.

24
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.200
So once again no IP address configured on the physical interface something to face one is in villaine

25
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.450
one.

26
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.910
It's a native land interface to these violent to it using Ed..

27
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.090
Q So having to face 11 years in Villani 11 using Ed..

28
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.810
Q These numbers don't have to match up.

29
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.940
It just makes more sense to do that to keep things consistent.

30
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:52.550
Now let's see if Rato one can ping Rotto for.

31
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.520
Let's check if the traffic actually hits a Rodda 5 de-bug IP.

32
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.640
I see MP Mike should can ping its default gateway

33
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:08.970
check some obvious stuff.

34
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.300
So show I've been face brief interfaces up so that's good.

35
00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.870
And the router thing itself so paying 10 to 1 1 2 2 4 4

36
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:30.330
be lent to keeping itself Villani 11 can ping itself.

37
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:37.500
Ken wrote it to ping the default gateway so who's paying for camping wrote for.

38
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.700
So traffic is going from here to here.

39
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.920
Let's see if we can ping its default gateway

40
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.770
Camping's.

41
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.650
Let's do a y shall capture.

42
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.830
See what's going on.

43
00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.080
So no traffic arriving on this port and that's probably an issue with this hub.

44
00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.480
So what I'll do now is save the conflicts on the devices.

45
00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:15.440
This looks like a genius three problem and that's why sometimes you might want to use physical switches.

46
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:24.950
So save all the configfs and then I will reboot all stop Jeana's 3 and started again.

47
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.480
And then we can try again and see if it solves our problem.

48
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.970
So I'm going to reboot everything.

49
00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.360
And in the next video we'll continue to see if it solved the problem.

50
00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:46.980
OK so after a reboot of one as an example is able to ping Rhonda too.

51
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.440
So that's the device pinging this device.

52
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.750
If we do a capture on that the link to run a five

53
00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.300
and do the ping again

54
00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:14.610
3:56 ICMP what you'll notice is the pings received from Rodda one on Villani Levan and the reply goes

55
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.720
back as we learn to.

56
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:28.440
So once again has Villani Levan and to the reply is going back as we learned to be Lenni 11 reply being

57
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:36.000
violent to now I had some problems ingenius 3 setting this up so you may run into similar problems.

58
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.840
But the moral of the story is that traffic from the species untagged here it goes across as tagged hits

59
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:50.320
this router it does into the land routing and changes it to the and to codes is tagged here.

60
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.470
Back to the switch and untagged to PC to.

61
00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.280
Typically once again you wouldn't want to do any of this.

62
00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:07.350
You would simply enable in TV land routing on switch one or switch to a separate video I'm going to

63
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:14.820
show you a more realistic real world of topology and show you how to set up in TV land rotting as well

64
00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.880
as HAARP and spending tree optimization.
