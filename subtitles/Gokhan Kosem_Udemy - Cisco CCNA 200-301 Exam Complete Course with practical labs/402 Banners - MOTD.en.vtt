00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:06.930
A message of the day Banham may be used to display a temporary message such as a router may be taken

2
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:17.140
off line for maintenance at a specific time a logon banner is shown before a user logs in SEE may display

3
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:24.280
a message such as unauthorized access is prohibited and exec Abana displays off to Logan.

4
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:31.720
You could use this to display information that only internal staff should know such as the physical

5
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.790
location of the device.

6
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:41.630
So the information is not shown before logging only after your theni case it is the information displayed.

7
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.900
Now you don't have to use those messages in that way.

8
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.640
This is actually being configured on the router as a message of the day.

9
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.860
So on those a run pyper begin banner

10
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:05.960
he has the show command and notice the command used here is Bena message of the day which display some

11
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.510
ASCII text and then a warning message and then ends.

12
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.540
Notice the delimiting character used see indicated by carot see.

13
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.580
So that's the beginning of the message and end of the message.

14
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:29.670
So when you use the command Bena question mark you've got the option line which says See benoît text.

15
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.380
See we see is a delimiting character.

16
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.220
Now you don't typically want to use the letter C as an example.

17
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:48.160
If I say Benas see and then type something like my cisco router notice I'm taken back to global configuration

18
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.810
mode.

19
00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:01.070
But if we telnet back to routed to you notice the message of the Day message displayed is my C in this

20
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.260
example is the delimiting character.

21
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:12.840
So the message was cut off or ended at the letter C hence only my space was displayed.

22
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:20.270
What you probably want to use is something like a hash or dollar sign or some other character that you're

23
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:31.620
not going to put in your message or create a basic message such as this so that when we log in we can

24
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.560
see which banners are displayed.

25
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:41.230
I could enter another line such as the following and then continue to into multiple lines.

26
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:49.530
Hash or pounde indicates in this example that I've finished my message and notice I'm taken back to

27
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.300
global configuration mode.

28
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:59.390
So now we're not telnet to rodded to the message is displayed and I can log in.

29
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:07.610
So the message was displayed before the password prompt on the telnet line.

30
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:14.540
Whereas previously before the message was created nothing was displayed at this point.

31
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.290
Now a benoît message of the day is also displayed on the console.

32
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.800
So it doesn't just apply to telnet lines.

33
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.730
It applies to all lines on the router including what are called TDY lines.

34
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:37.390
So as an example on this very 640 physical router show line shows me that it has a console line.

35
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.770
It has Teotihuacan lines which are in this example used for reverse Telenet lines and it has Viti wan

36
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.380
lines which are used for telnet.

37
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:59.100
So he has a line 97 when you telnet to a reverse line or T.T. y line you telnet to port number two thousand.

38
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.620
And that line number.

39
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.910
So notice here it's displayed the Bena message of the day.

40
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:16.040
And I'm actually connected to the console of a 37 50 switch show line on the 36 40 shows us that line

41
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:27.210
97 is in use and that's the reverse telnet connection used on the router to access the core 37 50 switch.

42
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:37.400
So in other words a better message of the day is displayed on all lines including the console exhilarate

43
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:46.070
Vittie white lines and 21 lines once again on Route 1.

44
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:51.750
I'll tell it to router to notice the Banham message of the day is displayed.
