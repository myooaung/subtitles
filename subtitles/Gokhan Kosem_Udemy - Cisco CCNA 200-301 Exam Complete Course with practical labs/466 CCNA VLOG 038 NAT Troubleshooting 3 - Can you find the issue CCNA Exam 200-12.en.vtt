00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.840
This is one of multiple network address translation or not videos.

2
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.350
This is a troubleshooting video.

3
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:24.000
In this scenario you've been told that some hosts in the internal network are not able to connect to

4
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.890
the Internet.

5
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:33.160
In this genus 3 typology I've got four rods broader two and rather three are acting as PCs they have

6
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.230
IP routing disabled.

7
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:42.040
They have the default gateways configured as Router one root of one is going to act as our network address

8
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.460
translation router and wrote a Foy's going to act as Google.

9
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:56.620
So let's test the network can write a one ping the DNS server Subrata for pretending to be the Google

10
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.720
DNS server.

11
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.600
Yes it can.

12
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.490
What about router 3.

13
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.940
Doesn't look like it's able to ping.

14
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.040
Let's investigate.

15
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.880
So show IP wrought we can see that IP routing is disabled on those router but it's default gateways

16
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.970
configured is 10 more than one.

17
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:26.270
What about on Route 2 rather 2 has the same configuration wrote it too.

18
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:37.980
Can ping 10 1 1 1 and can ping Google Rodda 3 can paying 10 1 1 1.

19
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.250
We could trace to Google.

20
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:52.010
It gets to its default gateway 10 1 1 1 but then nothing happens.

21
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:59.360
So we have a timeout on brought a 1 so brought a one let's confirm the IP address.

22
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:10.370
Firstly if it's zero slash one has an IP address of 10 1 1 1 that's the inside of the network.

23
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.330
If 0 0 has an IP address of 8 8 8 2 5 4.

24
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.270
So let's do it debug on this router.

25
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:29.770
Debug IP NAT router was able to pinged Google before and still can and we can see the NAT translation

26
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:30.970
taking place.

27
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.280
When Rotto three pings Google dot com we don't see any net translations.

28
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.860
Sure.

29
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.640
IP not translations.

30
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.760
So we see a net translation for Rodda too.

31
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.780
That's the IP address of router 2.

32
00:02:50.790 --> 00:03:00.570
So show IP face brief will show us that so we can see the translation for router.

33
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.830
But we don't see a net translation for rodders 3.

34
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.970
What happens if we clear the net translations.

35
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.220
So there are no net translations at the moment.

36
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.370
We're not paying from rodded three to Google.

37
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:26.490
We suddenly see translations and the pings start succeeding sexten brought it to pain.

38
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:27.350
Google dot com

39
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.190
noticed it too can now no longer paying google.com.

40
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.740
Let's clear the net translations again.

41
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.960
Ratatouille is now able to pin Google's outcome

42
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.960
but Raanta 3 is not

43
00:03:51.280 --> 00:04:00.830
so it looks like when we clear the translations one device is able to connect to google showed Bruhn

44
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:14.860
if 0 0 is correctly configured with an IP address and is configured as the outside interface.

45
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:25.480
If zero slushed one has the correct insight IP address and as configured as the inside interface OK.

46
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.030
Can you see the problem.

47
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.520
What's going on here.

48
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.000
Just will not play the next.

49
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.060
Translation a game

50
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:42.170
and then ping from router 3 which wasn't able to ping previously the pings.

51
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.860
Now succeed.

52
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.450
Show IP match translation.

53
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:54.570
We now see a net translation 4 out of three so going back through the configuration and I'll scroll

54
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.090
down to the net config.

55
00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.060
Can you see the problem.

56
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.520
OK.

57
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:10.080
Have a look at this IP not inside source list 1 which is pointing to access list one that means that

58
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:21.430
any IP address will be netted but it's pointing to a poll called my poll the Nat Poole is configured

59
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:30.900
with a starting IP address of 8 8 8 to 2 and an ending IP address of 8 8 8 2.

60
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:39.790
That means we've only put one IP address in the poll hence only one internal host can be netted at any

61
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:40.790
given time.

62
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:52.900
So let's remove this.

63
00:05:52.980 --> 00:06:02.110
We told you we can't remove it so let's clear the that translations translation install and try and

64
00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:03.110
remove it again.

65
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.520
So it's removed now.

66
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:15.110
What we should do is add additional IP addresses to the poll Sol and from 2 to 20.

67
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:23.930
Previously it was from 8 8 8 2 2 8 8 8 to 2 but now it's going from 2 to 20.

68
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:38.240
So show run piping clewed that will show us that configuration so Ken rodders paying Google yes it can.

69
00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:47.320
Ken Rodda to ping Google yes it can it took it a while but right to can ping Google router 3 can ping

70
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:52.310
Google and we see the net translations for both of them.

71
00:06:52.780 --> 00:07:02.150
Notice please that the one device is not netted 2 8 8 8 3 and the other one is netted up to eight today

72
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:03.020
to today.

73
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:13.190
So show IP net translation shows us that two addresses in the pool have been used show IP not statistics

74
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.540
at the moment we have six dynamic translations.

75
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:23.870
Notice our poll shows us the list of IP addresses.

76
00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:30.790
So we have a starting address of 8 8 today to 2 an ending of 8 8 2 8 to 20.

77
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:35.980
They are on 19 addresses in the pool and two have been allocated.

78
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.830
So this would be another good command to use.

79
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:44.600
Let's clear the net translation and remove the command

80
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.700
and add it back.

81
00:07:54.020 --> 00:08:02.850
With only a single IP address in the pool it's a show IP not translations.

82
00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:09.830
No translations at the moment show IP that statistics.

83
00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:13.440
Notice we only have one IP address in the pool.

84
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.250
So when Rodda three pings

85
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:25.570
and we look at the statistics again notice 100 percent of the pool is allocated.

86
00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:33.210
So that's why I wrote it to he's not able to ping because the because the pool consists of a single

87
00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:36.800
IP address and it's already been allocated.

88
00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:39.400
So again be careful with your polls.

89
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:46.390
You need to allocate enough addresses to the poll so clear the net translations again.

90
00:08:51.810 --> 00:09:08.970
All remove that poll configure it again with let's say from 2 to 25 to show IP not statistics.

91
00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:14.840
We have 24 addresses in the poll in this range.

92
00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:24.600
None have been allocated Well since some traffic from both wrote to and wrote history.

93
00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:29.300
So we can see that Rodda is being netted and so is Rodda three.

94
00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:37.380
And now when we look at the statistics noticed 24 addresses are available to have been allocated.

95
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:44.150
So that was an example of how to troubleshoot network address translation or net hope found the video

96
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:46.020
useful if you enjoyed it.

97
00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:50.700

98
00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.640
I wish you all the very best.
