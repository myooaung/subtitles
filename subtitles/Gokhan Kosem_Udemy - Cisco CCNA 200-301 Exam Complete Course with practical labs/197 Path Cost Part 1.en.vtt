00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:08.650
A part cost is the cost to get to the root bridge or route switch path costs are calculated from the

2
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.490
cost of a port and the number of links to get to the root bridge.

3
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.640
As an example a one gigabits per second link may have a cost of four.

4
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.620
If a switch is directly connected to the route to switch the path cost would be fall because theres

5
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.340
a single link with a cost of four.

6
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:38.700
However if switch three had a link to switch to where the port costs to fall and switch to had a link

7
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.840
to switch 1 which is the route with a port cost or for the cost of switch three to get to switch one

8
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.090
using these links would be 8 because its four plus full.

9
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:58.710
To get to the root bridge support costs are incremented in a similar way to hop count in a protocol

10
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.320
such as support.

11
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:08.190
Cost is calculated from the sum total of Port costs to get to the root bridge.

12
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.990
Based on a path of multiple links to the bridge support costs a do have default values on a per port

13
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.060
and PV land basis.

14
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.750
You can change the port cost valleys but they do have defaults defined by the I triple E There are two

15
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:33.870
stents the triple E cost 1998 and I triple E cost 2000 for some Cisco switches still use the old Poth

16
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:40.080
cost and you can change the switch to use the new path cost by using the command spending tree path

17
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.810
cost method long in the apology.

18
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.250
I have five switches switch one two three four and five.

19
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.610
Nothing has been configured on these switches except for the switched names so they are running a default

20
00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:01.170
configuration of connected hubs to the switches so that we can do Y shot captures an apology but please

21
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.410
note this is not a recommended spending tree topology.

22
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.580
Its simply used to demonstrate some of the features and functions of spending tree.

23
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:20.210
So lets determine who the root switches on which one shows spanning tree is the switch.

24
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.190
The root of the spending tree.

25
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.810
The answer is No.

26
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.650
We can see that the switch has a MAC address of the following but the root has a MAC address of the

27
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.850
following.

28
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:39.920
The local switch also has a path cost to get to the root switch via port 1 which is gigabit 0 0.

29
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:47.480
In other words it's cost to get to the root Brydges for based on the triple E 1998 spec..

30
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:54.500
Scrolling down we can see that gigabit 0 0 is the root port for the switch.

31
00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:02.700
So in other words because the path cost is for it's most likely that switch to is the root switch because

32
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:09.060
the support has a cost of 4 and the path cost to get to the root switch is full.

33
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.710
In other words they'll be a single link to get to the root bridge.

34
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:21.960
One switch to show spanning tree this switch is the root and we can see it displayed clearly in the

35
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.220
output.

36
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:31.710
You can also see that the MAC address of the root and the local bridge or local switch is the same.

37
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.340
What you also notice is that all ports are forwarding.

38
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.860
So this is the route such currently.

39
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:44.260
Let's see what BPT use are being advertised by that switch.

40
00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.630
So he has a BPT you

41
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:57.050
the destination of the frame is the well-known MAC address for spending three in the spending tree output.

42
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:03.920
We can see that the switches running rapid spanning tree will change that in a moment.

43
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.500
But notice the part.

44
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.890
Cost is zero.

45
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.740
That's the root identifier and the local bridge identifier of the switch and the values are set the

46
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:22.760
same of information including the max age holloed time and for delay as shown in the output.

47
00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.110
So I'll stop at that.

48
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.840
Was Shot capture So switch to is currently advertising that it's the root of the typology.

49
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:41.470
Let's have a look at what switched three shows with regards to parthe cost shows spending tree.

50
00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.410
It also has a past cost of four and it's using pt. 1.

51
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.130
In other words gigabit is 0 0 as its root port.

52
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.730
So this port is the root port to get to the root of the spending tree.

53
00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.360
And this is the link the search is using with a path cost to fall.

54
00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:04.040
What about switch for shows spending tree.

55
00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:12.500
We can see here that the path cost is 8 not full and to the point that it's using is gigabit is 0 0.

56
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:18.770
So in other words this port is the port that it's using to get to the root bridge.

57
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:27.680
It has a path cost Costa for because this link has a cost of four and this link has a cost of full on

58
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:37.500
switch three we could use the command show interface spending tree interface gigabit zero three cost

59
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:44.710
to see that it's advertising a cost of four on the support.

60
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:50.730
So from its point of view it's got to cost a full plus for to get to the bridge.

61
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:57.100
We can also use the command show spanning tree route to see that the local switches using gigabit 00

62
00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.130
as it's a route port.

63
00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:05.490
The cost to get to the route is eight the route ID or bridge IDs the following.

64
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.490
So four plus four gives us eight.

65
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:16.490
What about switch five switch five shows spending tree.

66
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:23.360
There's the command the output shows us that the path cost to the route is 12.

67
00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:28.240
In other words four plus four plus for these 12.

68
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:35.320
So as you can see the pot cost is incrementing on a per link basis.

69
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:44.420
Once again show spending tree root Poth cost to get to the root is twelf the local root port is gigabit

70
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:54.620
00 that port has a port cost of four because the switches are using the 1998 cost of one gigabit per

71
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.240
second port has a cost of four by default.

72
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.830
So let's make some changes will make switch one route.

73
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:09.290
See how that affects the PPD use advertised bus which would change the path cost method too long to

74
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:12.170
see how that affects the path costs of the switches.
