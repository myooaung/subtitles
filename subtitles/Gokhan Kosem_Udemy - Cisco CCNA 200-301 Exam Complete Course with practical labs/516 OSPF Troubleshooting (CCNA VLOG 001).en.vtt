00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.730
Welcome to this troubleshooting video.

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.520
This is one of multiple videos that you'll find on my YouTube channel which helped me prepare for the

3
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.500
CCMA petition.

4
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:17.060
Now we've been told in this apology that P.S. 1 is not able to ping P.S. 2.

5
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:24.000
So let's do some investigation in this example P.S. One is actually in Iowa's router so I'm running

6
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:31.140
Iowa's V with ingenious 3 show IP raft shows us that there are no rafts on this road.

7
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:38.910
Acting as a P.C. if you see outputs such as this default gateway is something and the IP routing table

8
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.350
isn't displayed but you see something such as ICMP redirect caches empty.

9
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:53.130
It's probably because routing has been disabled on this router so noticed this command no IP routing

10
00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:00.300
that simply turns this round into an expensive a very basic P.C. so if it was a physical router you

11
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.220
essentially disabling the functionality of the router can.

12
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.870
P.S. 1 ping P.S. 2 based on information that we've been given.

13
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:20.550
As you can see in the output it's not able to ping P.C. to notice we're getting you dot you dot u u

14
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.740
means unreachable.

15
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.680
That means that P.S. 1 is forwarding traffic to a router which could be right of 1 and that drought

16
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:36.040
it doesn't have a route to the remote network that does host resides on now to speed things up I'm going

17
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:45.970
to use the command no IP domain lookup and then I'm going to trace route 2 tendered 1 or 3 to 2 so notice

18
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:54.380
we are able to get to road 1 10 1 1 1 but road one doesn't know where to forward the traffic so there

19
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.100
seems to be a problem on Route 1.

20
00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.020
So not a one show IP interface brief.

21
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.640
This looks correct.

22
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.450
This IP address is configured on this interface gigabit.

23
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:16.510
0 1 this IP address is configured on this interface gigabit 00 can write a 1 ping router to.

24
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.630
The answer is yes it can.

25
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:25.330
Initial ping failed because it was doing an op for the MAC address of rider to so let's have a look

26
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:33.220
at the writing table show IP brought in the output we can see that we only have connected ruts and local

27
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.070
routes no other routes have been learnt.

28
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:45.340
We only see Network 10 1 1 0 and Network 10 1 2 0 slash 24 and the local host addresses on the interfaces

29
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.910
of the road.

30
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.130
We don't see a network 10 1 2 3 0.

31
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.490
Are we running a routing protocol on this router so show IP protocols shows us that we are running a

32
00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:03.910
routing protocol in this case it's always P.F. process 1 Rada idea of the router is this.

33
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:11.280
It's an area border router it has an interface gigabit 0 0 in area 0.

34
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:21.320
In other words this network here is an area 0 and this interface gigabit is 0 1 is an area 1 show IP

35
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.460
SPF interface brief is another useful command.

36
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:33.800
This gives us brief information so we can see that gigabit 0 0 with 0 SPF process 1 is in area 0.

37
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:40.790
We can also see the IP address and subnet mask used on that interface subnet masks need to be the same

38
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:50.690
IP version 4 for Rogers to form a neighbor relationship gigabit 0 1 is in Area 1 of 0 SPF process 1

39
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.750
and it's got this IP address.

40
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.530
Show IP 0 SPF.

41
00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.890
Neighbor know neighbor relationships have been formed so SPF is running on gigabit.

42
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.950
0 0 overall to 1 but is not forming a neighbor relationship with 4 out 2.

43
00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.460
So let's have a look at draw to t and see if we can find a problem.

44
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:20.030
Show IP protocols always be a process one is running on this rota and in the output can you see the

45
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.010
problem.

46
00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.540
You should already be able to determine the problem by that output but I'll also use this command show

47
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:35.110
IPO SPF interface brief to help me can you see the problem notice on Route 1.

48
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:43.350
This interface gigabit 00 is an 0 SPF area 0 on Rod a 2 gigabit.

49
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.510
0 0 is an area 2.

50
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:54.660
It's a requirement in 0 SPF that both sides of the link be configured in the same area so show run interface

51
00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:06.470
gigabit 0 0 shows us that this interface has been configured in 0 SPF process 1 but in Area 2 whereas

52
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:14.550
on the side show run interface gigabit 0 0 shows us that that interface is an area 0 so to fix this

53
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:27.940
we need to change the area to area 0 so to show run interface gigabit 00 notice the ISP f area has changed

54
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:40.830
show IP SPF interface brief the area has now been set properly show IP protocols shows us now that this

55
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:51.810
interface is an area zero where as gigabit 0 1 is an area to show IP of SPF neighbor a neighbor relationship

56
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.530
has been established.

57
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:59.610
Now why were we not seeing output on the screen one of the reasons for that is that a logging could

58
00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:06.620
be disabled so do show run pipe include log notice this command has been added to the running config.

59
00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.800
No logging console.

60
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:15.580
I added that on purpose so that you didn't see warning messages on the screen to help you determine

61
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.310
what the problem was.

62
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.460
So now as an example if I shut down gigabyte 0 0

63
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:33.800
or rather I should remove the no logging console and enable logging and now go onto the interface and

64
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.870
shut it and then no shut it.

65
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.860
We should see output.

66
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.190
As in we should see that the interface comes up and there you go.

67
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:44.150
And we should see that.

68
00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.640
Who is Peer.

69
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.400
Relationships are formed and there you go.

70
00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:50.650
Be careful of your logging.

71
00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:58.180
If you telnet or SSA to Radha don't forget to use the command to Mun so that you see logging on the

72
00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:00.580
Viti y lines.

73
00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:03.610
Logging is enabled by default on the console.

74
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:08.050
But I had purposely disabled it so things are looking better.

75
00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:20.120
We have a neighbour relationship show IP of SPF neighbor shows us that on the side show IP who is always

76
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.540
SPF neighbor.

77
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:29.600
Neighbor relationship is there show IP wrote notice we now see an entire area always appear from 8 to

78
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.730
10 1 3 0 via 10 1 2 2.

79
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:39.320
So can the shrouded ping the remote P.C..

80
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.000
Yes it can.

81
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.530
Can P.S. 1 ping the remote.

82
00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:51.680
Yes it can and when we do a trace that's also successful let's test in the reverse direction just to

83
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.070
make sure everything is good.

84
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.720
That looks fine.

85
00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.320
Notice the problem is trace right.

86
00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:05.480
If you don't disable IP domain lookup the trace Rod is going to take a long time while it tries to resolve

87
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:13.920
the names so I've disabled the trace no IP domain

88
00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:25.540
lookup through the trace again notice it's a lot quicker now because it's not doing a domain lookup.

89
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.940
I'll do that again.

90
00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.290
There you go.

91
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:31.650
So P.S. 1 since traffic to write a 2.

92
00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:36.540
And then it sends traffic to road 1 and it then hits the destination

93
00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:44.420
so that was an example of troubleshooting 0 SPF.

94
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.880
Don't forget that with 0 SPF you can configure it.

95
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:57.670
One of two ways you can configure it on an interface as I've done in this example or you can use the

96
00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:04.540
network command under the running process I'll leave the troubleshooting of match to a separate video.

97
00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:13.000
So if you get a simulation in the exam make sure that you check that 0 SPF areas have been configured

98
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.160
properly.

99
00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:15.610
Thanks for watching.

100
00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:17.920
Let me know which videos you want me to record.
