00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:07.380
We'll start off with a quick overview of Wayne technologies and the various encapsulation that could

2
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.600
be used across a when.

3
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.690
And then we're going to look at the features and functionality of both HDFC and PDP.

4
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:23.820
And as always I'm going to show you multiple demonstrations of these encapsulation as a when or wide

5
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:31.060
area network connects devices separated by large geographical areas so you may have an office in New

6
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.960
York in the US and an office in London in the United Kingdom.

7
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.760
And you would use a point to point a serial link as an example to provide a dedicated permanent point

8
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:50.690
to point connection between those two sites a point to point or serial link also called a leased line

9
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.310
provides a dedicated connection between two sites.

10
00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.780
So it's a point to point connection between the New York office and London office.

11
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.510
This uses a service provider network to provide the connection from one site to another.

12
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:14.240
So unlike Ethernet on the local area network which is owned by the company the infrastructure used to

13
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:22.520
connect these sites is owned by a provider which could be AT&amp;T in the US or British Telecom or Beatty

14
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:30.000
in the UK for example the concept here is that devices are far apart from each other.

15
00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:38.430
So as an example you could have an office in San Francisco in Houston in London and in Tokyo these offices

16
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.150
are far apart from each other and it's not possible to use an infinite cable such as cat 5 or CAT 6

17
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:51.390
cabling to connect those sites together because they're too far apart so local area connection would

18
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.990
be used on premise at the customer's site but then the local area network would be connected to the

19
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:07.230
when and the encapsulation or layer to technology changes from Ethernet to for instance HDFC or BPP

20
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.620
now.

21
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:16.070
Today a lot of point to point at least lines or serial connections have been replaced by virtual private

22
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.870
networks or VPN ones where the connection is made across the Internet.

23
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:29.780
It's a lot cheaper to set up a VPN across a DSL connection than it is to lease a leased line or use

24
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.470
a serial point to point connection.

25
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:41.570
The reason why it's called a least a line is you are leasing a cable or connection or line between sites.

26
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:48.790
So hence the term leased line also called a serial connection also called a point to point connection.

27
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.750
So we are no longer talking about lands or local area networks we're talking about ones where we connecting

28
00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.010
these sites or offices in different parts of the world so that they can communicate with each other.

29
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.960
A When is often represented as a cloud connecting multiple sites together.

30
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.510
The reason for the use of the cloud is that the enterprise is not concerned with what's happening within

31
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.370
the service provider network.

32
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.970
That is someone else's domain or someone else's problem.

33
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:26.260
The Enterprise is simply sending traffic from the San Francisco office to the service provider and somehow

34
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.010
it appears in London or in Tokyo as an example.
