00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:15.650
In this network we've been told to subnet 1 9 2 1 6 8 2 1 0 slash 24 into 4 subnets.

2
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:24.190
In other words we need a subnet for site one site to the serial link and this serial link.

3
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:29.760
Now we haven't been told to use a slash of 30 mosque on the serial links.

4
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:37.090
We'll do that in a separate video so all we need to do after this point is take 1 9 2 1 6 8 wondered

5
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.460
0 slash 24 and subnet that into 4 subnets.

6
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:49.750
Now when we look at a network address such as 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 0 we need to determine which point is the

7
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.670
network and which part is the host portion.

8
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.530
Currently this portion is the network portion.

9
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:09.860
We can't change the network portion but we can manipulate and change the host portion of the address.

10
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.500
So in other words what we can do is change this lost octet.

11
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:23.320
The reason why we can't manipulate the first three octet is because that's part of the network 24.

12
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.870
Essentially means that we have 24 binary ones.

13
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.800
Now you don't have spaces in an octet like this.

14
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:41.990
I'm just doing it to make it easier to read but essentially 24 means that we have 24 ones into the subnet

15
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:55.300
mask so that's 24 binary ones which essentially equates to 255 255 255 is zero.

16
00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:02.590
It's important that you know how to convert a decimal to binary this binary value equates to decimal

17
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:09.000
255 so the host portion of the address is once again that portion.

18
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:16.030
This portion is the network portion we can't manipulate the network portion but to the host portion

19
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.890
consisting of eight binary zeros can be manipulated.

20
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:28.990
Now when we subnet think of submitting kind of like stealing butts we're going to steal butts from the

21
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.310
host portion.

22
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:37.560
We need to work out how many bits are required for the number of subnets that we need in this example

23
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.840
we need four subnets.

24
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.990
Now when it comes to subletting there are two formulas that you need to know.

25
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.680
Two to the power of n and two to the power of n minus two.

26
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:57.590
This formula is used when we asked for subnets which is what we've been asked in this question.

27
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.140
This formula we need to use when we asked for a certain number of hosts.

28
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:10.980
So if we were asked to subnet this subnet 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 0 select 24 and create as many subnets as possible

29
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:18.210
each having 4 hosts we would use two to the power of n where n is the number of bits that are required

30
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.020
minus two.

31
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.490
So if we needed to get 4 hosts we would actually need two to the power of three minus two which would

32
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.500
be to to power of three which is eight minus two which means that we would be able to have six hosts

33
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.440
per subnet.

34
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.920
We need to subtract two because of broadcast and network address but we don't need that.

35
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:46.590
When asked for networks two to the power of two equals four which is what we need for the number of

36
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.060
subnets that we've been asked to create.

37
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.020
This is the number of bits that we stealing or using for the subnet portion.

38
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.780
This is the number of bits that we would keep for the host portion.

39
00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:06.470
Now we're not using that formula so I can basically scratch that from our example.

40
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.930
So basically remove that to we are not using that formula.

41
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.780
In this example this is the formula that we need.

42
00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:21.590
And once again that's because we've been off to four subnets we haven't been asked for hosts.

43
00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:28.310
Now two to the power of one equals t that doesn't give us enough subnets due to the power of two gives

44
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:35.540
us four subnet two to the power of three gives us eight subnets two to the power of four would give

45
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:41.960
us sixteen subnets we don't need that many we only need four subnets.

46
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:50.300
So all we need to do is use two bits which means we can steal two bits from the host portion for our

47
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.470
subnet portion.

48
00:04:52.220 --> 00:05:03.560
So the host portion is now only six bits in length the subnet portion is now two bits in length.

49
00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.790
So write it like that.

50
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:11.570
Once again there's obviously no spaces here in binary but that hopefully just makes it easier to read.

51
00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:20.740
So we're going to steal two bits from the host portion and allocate to that to the subnet portion.

52
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.880
So how many bits are part of the network and subnet.

53
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.240
We've got our 8 bits from our original example.

54
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.470
An additional eight but from our original example plus eight bits.

55
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.040
So that's sixteen plus one plus one.

56
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:48.010
So in other words this is now a slash twenty six subnet it's no longer slash 24 because we've stolen

57
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.950
bits from the host portion for the network portion.

58
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:58.570
So the first network that we have is 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 dot 0.

59
00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.530
Look at to these 8 2 binary bits to make it easier to read.

60
00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:11.230
Notice we've got eight binary bits I've just split them up with spaces here to make it easier to demonstrate

61
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.150
which party's subnet in which parties host.

62
00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:21.670
But notice there are eight binary but say eight binary bits equates to zero in decimal.

63
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:26.450
So the network is 1 9 2 1 6 8 wondered 0 slash 26.

64
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.680
That's our first network.

65
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.270
Now what's the second network.

66
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.830
The second network is 1 and 2 1 6 8 1.

67
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:41.350
Dot and what we do now is we just go through the different binary options.

68
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.440
This is 0 0 this is 0 1.

69
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:49.030
This one would be 1 0 and this would be 1 1.

70
00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:52.930
So those are the different binary options that we have.

71
00:06:52.930 --> 00:07:01.200
So if we'll look at this network that second binary but to set to a one what does this equal to this

72
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.920
equals to sixty four in a decimal.

73
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.350
So the next network is 64.

74
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:10.180
What is is this equal.

75
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.710
It looks like this.

76
00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:15.650
Which equals 128.

77
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:24.340
Now as soon as you've worked out this second subnet you can simply do addition by that number.

78
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:32.620
So zero plus 64 64 plus 64 is 128 plus 64 is 192.

79
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:39.760
But if you look at the binary it's 128 plus 64 which equals 192.

80
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:46.460
So there are are four subnets that we've been asked to work out in this example.

81
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:51.370
So we've got four subnets the first one is for side one the second one is for the link between right

82
00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:58.060
of one an Internet router third one is for side 2 fourth one is for the link between right at 2 and

83
00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:05.480
the Internet router so the first subnet would be 1 0 2 1 6 8 wondered slash 26.

84
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.540
And I'll zoom in here to make it clearer.

85
00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.190
So that's our first subnet.

86
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:21.810
Per our calculations second subnet is 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 64 slash 26.

87
00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:27.870
Third one is 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 128 slash 26.

88
00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:38.320
And the last one is 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 192 flash 26 so those subnets are these subnets that we worked out

89
00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:46.700
so we need to now configure the network with this information in the first step we need to work out

90
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:53.760
to the subnets but now we need to configure the route as per the instructions so as an example the lost

91
00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:58.950
IP in the subnet should be configured on rather one second lost IP address should be configured on the

92
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:07.390
switch third lost IP address should be configured on the DHB server per these instructions we also need

93
00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:15.150
to configure a DHB pool on the DHB server so I'm going to start with the subject first and get that

94
00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.040
working and then I'll move to the other subnets.
