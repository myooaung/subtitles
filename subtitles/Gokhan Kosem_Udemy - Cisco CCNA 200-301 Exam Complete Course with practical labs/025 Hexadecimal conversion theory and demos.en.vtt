00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:09.080
The easiest way to explain hexadecimal is to refer back to binary and decimal in binary you have two

2
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.690
values either a 0 or a 1.

3
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.750
So all numbers are made up of either those two values.

4
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:25.020
As an example 128 in decimal equals one followed by seven binary zeros decimal numbers are made up of

5
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.860
combinations in range 0 to 9.

6
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:39.580
So as an example 128 consists of 1 2 and an 8 255 consists of the number two followed by two fives.

7
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.490
Hexadecimal has values from 0 to f..

8
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:57.960
In other words it's 0 1 2 3 up to 9 followed by A B C D E and F.

9
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:09.180
So these are hexadecimal values the decimal equivalents are 0 1 2 3 all the way up to 9 and then a equates

10
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:19.630
to 10 B equates to 11 C crates to 12 DS 13 and decimal in hexadecimal is 14 in decimal and F in hexadecimal

11
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.820
is 15 in decimal.

12
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.900
If you remember that then hexadecimal isn't very difficult.

13
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.880
That's the first thing you need to remember when working with hexadecimal.

14
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.930
So if I gave you a number such as F in hexadecimal you need to remember that that equates to 15 and

15
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:53.160
decimal he equates to 14 D equates to 13 C equates to 12 B is an 11 and then a equates to 10 and then

16
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.010
the values are 0 to 9 of the same as decimal values.

17
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.900
0 2 9.

18
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.900
Now if I gave you a more complex example let's say 128.

19
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:10.810
The easiest way to work that out is to convert it to binary so 128.

20
00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.940
It looks as follows in binary.

21
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.640
And then what you need to do is to split it into two portions of four plus.

22
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:27.660
The reason why is that if we look at 15 or F in hexadecimal and convert that into binary you'll see

23
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.150
that it equates to four binary ones.

24
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:43.040
10 equates to 1 0 1 0 in binary 11 is 1 0 1 1 in binary a zero in hexadecimal equates to four binary

25
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.890
zeros.

26
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.430
So the highest number in hexadecimal consists of four binary ones.

27
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:56.350
So whenever you work out a larger number like 128 for an IP address.

28
00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.830
Break it into two portions of four binary zeros.

29
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:09.940
So if we looked at for binary zeros that would equate to zero in hexadecimal 1 followed by three binary

30
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.270
zeros equates to eight in both decimal and hexadecimal.

31
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.580
Hence 128 in decimal equates to 80 in hexadecimal.

32
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:30.340
Let's confirm this by taking the windows calculator and going to program mode and selecting a decimal

33
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.090
value of 15 and converting that to hexadecimal.

34
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:41.840
You'll see that it equates to binary Yeff in hexadecimal Let's take another decimal value such as 10

35
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.880
convert that to hex and you'll see it's anay.

36
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:56.700
So what about a 128 128 in decimal equates to 8 is 0 in hexadecimal.

37
00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:58.890
As we worked out.

38
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.540
So let's do a few more examples to make sure that you understand how to do this conversion.

39
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.800
So what about 255.

40
00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.980
That equates to a binary value of eight binary ones.

41
00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.880
If you split into two portions that gives you full binary ones and 4 binary ones.

42
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.590
So to convert into hexadecimal.

43
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:30.510
Convert this to decimal which is 15 and 15 in hexadecimal equates to f..

44
00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:43.910
So 15 gives us f and 15 gives us f that's why a broadcast of 255 255 255 255 equates to 8 binary F's

45
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.930
in binary you've got eight binary ones put 255.

46
00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:58.340
And if you convert that into hexadecimal you'll notice that eight binary ones equates to 15 and decimal

47
00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.250
which is f in hexadecimal.

48
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:10.120
So we end up having eight hexadecimal F's the rule to remember is that a in hexadecimal equates to 10

49
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:18.050
in decimal or 10 decimal equates to a in hexadecimal 11 and decimal is a B and hex 12 and decimal is

50
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:26.390
a C in hexadecimal 13 and decimal is a D in hexadecimal 14 in decimal is an E in hexadecimal and 15

51
00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.410
equates to F in hexadecimal.
