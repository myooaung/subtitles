00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:12.800
OK so the next subnet is 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 64 slash 26.

2
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:19.540
I'll copy the previous example but remember this is actually a different subnet.

3
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:29.900
Now the subnet address is slash 64 so we'll need to update these values in the last octet.

4
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:37.420
So to work out the first host you simply add one to the subnet portion subnet portion is 64.

5
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.880
So 1 added to that is 65.

6
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.830
The next subnet is 128.

7
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.300
So going back to our original example this is the second subnet.

8
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.890
This is the third subnet 128.

9
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.320
That means that the broadcast for the subnet is 127 because 128 minus one equals 127.

10
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:09.940
This is the next subnet minus one gives us our broadcast for the current subnet lost IP address in the

11
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.820
subnet is 126.

12
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.990
Next one is 125.

13
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.220
Next one is 124.

14
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:24.360
So there is our subnet broadcast for second lost host and third lost host.

15
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.230
I haven't rechecked the binary.

16
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.280
You could do that if you wanted to.

17
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:34.450
I'm simply using a quick method to work out the IP addresses so this road needs to be configured with

18
00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:47.440
the first ip address on the serial interface so interface serial 0 1 0 no shut IP address 1 9 2 1 6

19
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.670
8 165 uses that subnet mosque.

20
00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:01.420
So again it's just one more than the broadcast address show IP interface brief there's the IP address

21
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:11.920
on the serial interface on the Internet router we need to use one less than the next subnet 127 show

22
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:23.160
IP interface brief on the first serial interface interface serial 0 1 0 no shut IP address 1 9 2 1 6

23
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:36.440
8 1 1 26 with the subnet mask 127 is the broadcast one less than that gives us a lost IP address so

24
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.880
can we paying 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 sixty five yes we can.

25
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.760
So that's great.

26
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:51.230
We have IP connectivity between this router and the Internet router and notice and 0 SPF neighbour relationship

27
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:58.910
has come up the rods were pre configured with arrays P.F. so hopefully this Roddick can now ping the

28
00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:10.070
DNS server on the Internet and notice it can on P.S. 1 can it ping the DNS server yes it can.

29
00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:20.990
If I trace to the DNS server traffic is going to write a one on the Ethan it interface then it's going

30
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.580
to the Internet writer on the serial interface then to the Internet.

31
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:33.500
The reason it works is this writer has been pre configured with 0 SPF but is also being pre configured

32
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:40.910
with Network Address Translation The slave is concentrating on subletting so I pre configured the net

33
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.760
and writing protocols so that you didn't have to worry about that.

34
00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.660
Can we get to Cisco dot com.

35
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.130
Yes We Can.

36
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.040
Can we get to Facebook.

37
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.020
Dot com yes we can.

38
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.610
So that works on P.C. zero.

39
00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.360
What about P.C. to can we get to Cisco dot com.

40
00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.750
Yes we can.

41
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.060
Can we get to Facebook dot com.

42
00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.810
Yes we can.

43
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:13.010
So I'm hoping and radiate to this point you've learnt a lot about IP addressing subheading how to configure

44
00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.990
it and how to make it practical in a network in the next video.

45
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:24.170
I'm just going to continue doing something very similar for the other subnets and I'm going to speed

46
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.020
it up by using tricks rather than binary.
