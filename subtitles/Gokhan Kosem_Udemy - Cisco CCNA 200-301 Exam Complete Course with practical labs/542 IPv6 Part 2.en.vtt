1
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:17.620
The second step consists of setting the seventh but of the 64 bit address this but identifies the 48

2
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:24.530
but MAC addresses uniqueness or lack there of an ethernet address has two significances.

3
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.840
It's either globally managed or locally managed globally managed means that you use the Venda MAC address

4
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.990
locally managed means that you rewrite the MAC address with your own value.

5
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.250
In other words you change the MAC address to a locally significant value.

6
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.320
So that's seven.

7
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:49.900
But all the usual but is set to either one which means the address is unique or set to zero meaning

8
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.030
the address is not unique.

9
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.540
Now in this example let's assume that we're using a vendor MAC address.

10
00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:03.950
So in other words this part gets sick to one if you have a binary value of six zeros followed by one

11
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.480
followed by zero.

12
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.950
Converting that back to hexadecimal will give you a value of 0 2.

13
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:18.580
So just to reiterate you have a hexadecimal value of 0 0 that's converted into binary the seventh binary

14
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.610
but is either set to 1 or 0 depending whether it's globally unique or not globally unique.

15
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.290
That is then converted back to hexadecimal.

16
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:37.400
So once again the V-6 aggregate of all global unicast address is 128 bits in length half of the address

17
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.460
is the network prefix which is 64 bits and half of the addresses the interface identify which is 64

18
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.080
bits the network prefix is broken up into two major parts.

19
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.970
You have the global routing prefix which is used for the public apology.

20
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.950
In other words the Internet and the subnet ID which is used for the site topology.

21
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.720
In other words the subnet portion of the address would be used to create subnets within an enterprise

22
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.710
or within an organization or within a site.

23
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:18.780
It's 16 but same length that means that a service provider will give you a slash 48 subnet for every

24
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:27.330
site organization that you manage that gives you 16 bits for subnets which allows you to create 65000

25
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:34.080
536 subnets within your organization from one subnet given to you by the service provider.

26
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.440
You would continue using a 64 mosque on every link no matter whether it's a point to point link or an

27
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:47.490
Ethernet subnet the service provider network consists of a slush Forty-Eight network your internal networks

28
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.390
consist of flesh 64 subnets.

29
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.460
So once again the ISP will allocate your slush forty eight subnet you will allocate a slice 64 subnet

30
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.200
to each interface.

31
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:05.710
Once again no need to do complicated submitting all your subnets or slash 64 was from the slash forty

32
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.870
eight that you were allocated by your service provider.

33
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:16.450
Remember there is no net all internal addresses within your organization are using these IP V-6 aggregated

34
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:24.980
all global unicast addresses which are the equivalent of public IP addresses with an IP version 4 the

35
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.070
version 6 address is actually broken up into more fields.

36
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.970
I wouldn't worry too much about this but I just want to show you the actual format for this aggregated

37
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.870
global unit cost address.

38
00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.240
You firstly have the interface identify which is 64 bits in length.

39
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.320
I've explained that that identifies the equivalent of the host portion in an IP version 4 address.

40
00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:52.840
The next part is the SLA ID or site level aggregation identifier.

41
00:03:52.880 --> 00:04:00.080
This is like your subnet identifier which represents subnets within an organization its 16 bits in length

42
00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:06.090
giving you over 65000 subnets to use within a site or an organization.

43
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.460
Then you have the ID which is the next level aggregation identifier.

44
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.840
And this will be used by your ISP.

45
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:21.410
They are a reserved bits which are not currently used and then you have the TSA ID which is the top

46
00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:28.550
level aggregation identifier used by various regional Internet registries around the world the Internet

47
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:36.220
registries will then assign TLM IDs to large ISP is specifically transit providers and exchanges.

48
00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:44.790
And then lastly we have the format prefix which is set to 001 once again this portion of the address

49
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:51.930
is the public typology and we are not particularly concerned with that in this course within enterprises

50
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.820
or sites we would have the subnet ID which is used for site typology.

51
00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:03.530
And then once again the interface ID which is used as the host portion of an IP B-6 address.

52
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.030
The advantage of this IPV 6 address layout is aggregation.

53
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.980
It allows for aggregation or summarization of addresses within the global Internet.

54
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:19.720
Just be aware as well that every ITV 6 interface contains at least one loopback address which is cold

55
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:27.800
uncurl and one slash 128 optioning interfaces might include multiple unique local and global addresses.

56
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.260
This is an important concept in provision for on a Cisco router.

57
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:38.050
You can only allocate a single IP address as the primary IP address on that interface.

58
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.420
All subsequent IP addresses are configured a secondary IP addresses.

59
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:48.500
However an IP version 6 you can configure multiple primary IP addresses on an interface.

60
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.910
That's quite a major change from IP version for.

61
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:58.170
I'll show you in a moment when you enable IPV 6 on a Cisco routers interface multiple IP addresses are

62
00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.900
automatically allocated to that interface.

63
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:07.860
And once again the whole reason for this address layout is aggregation and summarization.

64
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.680
So let's look at global aggregation in Internet registry.

65
00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:21.780
We'll have for instance a slash 16 address so 2001 colon colon slash 16 a slash 32 subnet is allocated

66
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.110
to an ISP.

67
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:30.120
So in this example 2001 Carlon one two three four colon colon slash 32 is allocated let's say for instance

68
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:37.540
to this ISP the service provider can then allocate a slash forty eight subnet to an organization or

69
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:38.550
enterprise.

70
00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:45.100
So in this example let's assume that 2000 on one call on 1 2 3 4 call on 1 call and call and slash 48

71
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:46.920
is allocated to customer.

72
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:56.200
A customer can then subnet the slash 48 to slash 64 subnets and allocate those subnets to every interface

73
00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.350
within the organization.

74
00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:04.280
So nerdish year 2001 one two three four Colan one which is a slash forty eight subnet.

75
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:10.690
The Enterprise was allocated is subnetwork again to Colon to Colon colon.

76
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.740
In other words a slash 64 subnet is allocated to this interface.

77
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:20.860
And then notice over here three is allocated to this interface all link just to help you once again

78
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.030
with these addresses.

79
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:29.220
Remember these values on hexadecimal a single value in hex equates to four binary bits.

80
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:37.190
So we have one two three four hexadecimal values for hex values times for 16 binary.

81
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:38.060
That's.

82
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:40.380
So this is actually a 16 bit address.

83
00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:49.180
Hence slash 16 by the same token here remember this is 16 and this is 16 so the values between the colons

84
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:55.340
are 16 bit values so 16 for 16 gives you 32 so hence slash 32.

85
00:07:55.660 --> 00:08:01.890
Once again here we have another valley between Colon's so it's 16 16 and 16.

86
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:05.450
Remember leading zeros can be dropped in an address.

87
00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:16.900
So that gives you 48 bits in 48 and lost the this address there is 1 2 3 4 values between colons leading

88
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.560
zeroes have been dropped.

89
00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:22.830
So that's four times sixteen giving you slash 64.

90
00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:26.550
I hope that helps you decipher the address a little easier.

91
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:33.990
Please note on the subnets we have not displayed the host portion of the address.

92
00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:37.830
Now without further ado let's set up a basic IP version 6 network.

93
00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:45.260
In this example I have Route 1 and router to both route have a foster ethernet interface router one's

94
00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:51.810
network and the Ethan and interfaces going to be 2001 column one column one code on one router to use

95
00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:58.200
force Ethernet subnet is going to be 2001 Carlon one Cullin one code and three the rod is connected

96
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:04.200
by a serial link and the subnet is going to be two thousand in one color and one color in one color.

97
00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:10.660
Notice once again the subnet mask is always slushed 64 on all subnets.

98
00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:15.200
OK so in Rato one I'm going to break out of the initial configuration dialog

99
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:30.190
go into global config mode and give the Rodda a name and then I'm going to enable IPV 6 UNI costs routeing

100
00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:38.750
so that we can run the B-6 on the serrata and then I'm going to go into it 0 0 the first ethernet interface

101
00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:44.670
and give it an address or IP V-6 and notice there are a lot of options here.

102
00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:51.070
But I'm going to specify a dress and then I'm going to specify an IP V-6 address.

103
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.390
So 2001

104
00:09:56.090 --> 00:10:04.900
and in this case I'm going to give the interface an address of one that's as simple as that to configure

105
00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:08.010
an IP version 6 address on a router.

106
00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:12.050
This portion is the network portion.

107
00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:17.640
And notice we've got code on Colan So there are a bunch of zeros not displayed here.

108
00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:25.830
And we ending in a one and then I can no shut the interface and as you can see it interfaces come up

109
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:30.180
so knock on top do paying two thousand and one

110
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:35.060
and paying the kids race.

111
00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:40.300
And as you can see the ping is successful on the serials zero interface.

112
00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:46.010
I can do the same thing IPV six the drapes 2001

113
00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:55.200
and on this side I'm giving it an address of Colan one.

114
00:10:55.340 --> 00:11:00.760
And on this side I'm going to give an address of colon to some rodded to do the same thing.

115
00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:10.640
Enable IPV six unit costs routing and then on it seriously I sirra give it an ITV 6 address 2001

116
00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:20.230
no shut the interface and 0 0 0 give it an address

117
00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:32.570
and I shut that interface.

118
00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:36.190
So hopefully now from router to I should be able to ping Router one

119
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:49.180
that doesn't work because I forgot to shut the interface on the side so I'll know shut it and go back

120
00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:53.160
to it to see if the thing succeeds this time.

121
00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:58.450
That interface came up and as you can see the ping succeeded.

122
00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:03.170
It's as simple as that to configure IP addresses on a Cisco router.

123
00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:09.920
Now on the first ethernet interface I could give it another IP address so I could say IPV six the drapes.

124
00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:17.250
So let's just be lazy that's given an address of 2001 Carlon call on one 64.

125
00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:21.180
Now as you can see the rod has accepted that address on the road.

126
00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:28.990
I cannot ping 2001 called On-Call on one and as you can see the thing succeeds like I got to the interface

127
00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:30.450
and give it an address as follows.

128
00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:37.970
IPV 6 address and it's a 2001 Carlon to Colon colon.

129
00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.980
Notice it gives you the option of link local address but we don't want to do that.

130
00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.650
Let's go for Slash 64.

131
00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:48.000
Notice please I haven't cooked a host portion on this address.

132
00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:55.580
Just specify the network portion and now what I can do is I can specify UI 64 and hit enter.

133
00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:59.460
So we are going to use the Mac address as part of that address.

134
00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:05.710
So now I can type the command show run interface seriously sirra to show you the configuration.

135
00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:10.200
And as you can see there's no provision for address configured on this interface.

136
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:16.440
There are only IP version 6 addresses and there are three IP version 6 addresses that we have manually

137
00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.610
configured.

138
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:30.310
I couldn't up show interface 0 0 the MAC address of this interface is C 4 0 1 0 8 followed by four zeros.

139
00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:38.030
So the Venda portion of this address is C 4 0 1 0 F and the unique portion is e-rate followed by four

140
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:39.120
zeros.

141
00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:46.110
So just to display that nicely I'm going to say show interface 0 0 pipe include the a.

142
00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:49.580
So it only shows that Mac address in the output.

143
00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:59.200
And there it is and then I'm going to type show IPV 6 interface 0 0 and only include the addresses that

144
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:06.580
we configured and the other three IP addresses be configured on the interface so noted here please.

145
00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:12.860
We'll start from the right inside the unique portion of the MAC address is eight followed by four zeros.

146
00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.990
There it is in the IP address.

147
00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.490
Remember leading zeros can be dropped.

148
00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:24.840
So this zero represents those four zeros the eight is the right over there.

149
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:32.130
If if if he has been inserted in the address to make it 64 bucks and then notice the remaining portion

150
00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:40.780
is C 4 0 1 0 F which is represented here as C 6 0 1 F..

151
00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.160
Once again leading zeros can be removed.

152
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.740
Notice the zero in front of this f has been removed.

153
00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:59.070
