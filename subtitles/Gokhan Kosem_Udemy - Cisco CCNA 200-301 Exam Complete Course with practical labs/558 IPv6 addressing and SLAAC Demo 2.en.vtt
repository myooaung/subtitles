00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:11.020
So let's power on the PC and open up a console and see if it now receives an IP address so I can fake

2
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.710
ethe 0.

3
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.190
Notice the difference.

4
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.530
It's now received a global IP address.

5
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:28.440
2001 Kahlon face the network portion is that followed by some zeros.

6
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:35.730
This is the host portion which you'll notice is the same as the link local host portion and is based

7
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.500
on the MAC address of the host.

8
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.990
So back in Wireshark

9
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:50.580
there all the rot advertisements we saw previously and scrolling down we see a broader solicitation

10
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:59.970
message to F-F 0 to call on column two from a host with a MAC address ending in six a Forby.

11
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:07.270
So this year six A for B going to all routers on the local segment.

12
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.950
There's the MAC address which is the layer to MAC address for IP version 6 multicast.

13
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:27.740
In this case for a 5 0 2 call on call on 2 and we can see that the multicast was sent from the host.

14
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:35.000
There is the link local address as shown here in y shock.

15
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:41.900
So the host is sending a router solicitation to all writers in the local segment and the writer replies

16
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.120
back to all hosts on the local segment.

17
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:55.460
There is the IP version 6 multicast address from the router to the IP version 6 multicast laya to address

18
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.440
sources the router destination is F-F 0 2 column column 1.

19
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.050
It's a rotten advertisement.

20
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:11.790
And the is once again telling the host it's a local Mac address there's the linked layer address.

21
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.910
Here's the empty you mean here is the IP version 6 Prefect's.

22
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.660
So the host has done amicably learnt the address.

23
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.210
So there was an example of slack.

24
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.020
What I'll do now is add a nother address on the router.

25
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:39.190
So let's call that 2001 Kahlon 0 1 0 1 so at an address

26
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:50.580
like this and let's see if the Rodda advertises that to the host notice there's the advertisement saying

27
00:02:50.580 --> 00:03:00.750
to all hosts on the local segment and back on the PC and back on the PC I have config eith zero.

28
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:08.060
What we should notice is it after a while we'll learn that network.

29
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.650
And there you go.

30
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:21.000
After a while the host has learnt that new address set can do the host paying the router show run interface

31
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:33.310
gigabit to 0 0 shows us the two IP version 6 addresses on the Rodda so paying 2001 face code on column

32
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.020
1.

33
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.870
Notice I'm using the wrong protocol I need to use ping 6 and that ping now succeeds.

34
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:53.900
So Ping 6 2001 0 1 0 1 colon column 1 that ping also works on the Radu we could do a de-bunk

35
00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.960
IPV 6 ICMP and I can do the ping to face once again.

36
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:11.340
And notice we see that output on the router I could request was received from a source with this IP

37
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.590
version 6 address.

38
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:25.800
Wife can fake it 0 shows us that IP address as configured on the PC notice it ends in 6.

39
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:36.030
A forby the destination of the echo request was the router and the router not sends a reply.

40
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.870
There is the IP version 6 echo request IP version 6 echo reply.

41
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.330
He has a Rodda advertisement sent from the local router to the destination.

42
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.290
F.f 0 2 colon colon 1 all nodes on the segment.

43
00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:03.020
So there was a demonstration of how slack and Raadt advertisements and Rodda solicitation messages can

44
00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.350
be used to automatically allocate networks to hosts.

45
00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.950
This is once again using the neighborhood discovery protocol or a.p.
