00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Before discussing routing protocols such as OSPF or EIGRP

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
you need to know the difference between a routed versus a routing protocol.

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
You should also be able to differentiate and explain the advantages

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and disadvantages of using static routes versus dynamic routing protocols.

5
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So why you would you want to use a static route

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
versus a dynamic routing protocols such as OSPF

7
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and as mentioned we want to talk about distance vector and link-state routing protocols
