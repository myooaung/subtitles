1
00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.250
And then lastly the stub area flag needs to be the same.

2
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:12.820
The stub area flag denotes whether this is a stub area or a normal area.

3
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.120
We'll talk more about stub areas once again in later slides.

4
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:24.430
Now let's talk about designated riders and backup designated riders in this apology I have six riders

5
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:32.410
connected to the same Ethernet segment so assume the D6 route is connected to a switch or a hub all

6
00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:41.310
sharing the same Ethernet segment designated riders or dealers are used on broadcast multi axis environments

7
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.280
such as Ethernet and certain when implementations such as non broadcast multi access environments in

8
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:57.080
frame relay so to explain why we have a designated Rata let's assume that this network 10 1 1 0 is connected

9
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:04.190
to auto 1 and the 6 riders are connected to this Ethan it segment and assume that this network goes

10
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:11.050
down so let's assume for the moment that there is no designated rider on this Ethan it segment and hopefully

11
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:17.430
you'll quickly see why there's a requirement for a designated rata with a designated Rado all of these

12
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:25.830
riders would have a full adjacency in a full adjacency LSD are exchanged between riders so in this example

13
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:33.030
or one needs to notify the other riders using a link state update that there's been a change in the

14
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:41.280
network topology so or one will send an update two or three send an update or two to our four to our

15
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:49.410
five to our six notifying all of the riders that there's been a change in the topology or two when receiving

16
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:55.500
that update from our one in this case because there's no designated rider has a full relationship with

17
00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.690
all other riders so it sends an update to all of its neighbors to notify them that there's a problem

18
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.680
the same will happen on our three or three received an update from our one so it notifies all of its

19
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.290
neighbors that there's been a change in the topology or fall do the same thing it received an update

20
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.140
from our one.

21
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.060
So it sends an update to all of its neighbors and I'm sure you're getting the picture now.

22
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.310
Our five received that update from our one.

23
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.030
So it sends an update to all of its neighbors.

24
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:32.280
And lastly our six sends an update to all of its neighbors so there's a lot of duplicate traffic when

25
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.160
a single network goes down and these six routers have a full adjacency with one another.

26
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.740
So rather than doing that a designated writer is selected on this specific segment.

27
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:53.060
So let's assume that R2 was elected as a designated Rada designated writers are selected on two criteria.

28
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.830
The first one is highest priority.

29
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.440
You can specify the priority on an interface.

30
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:06.220
The default priority is 1 0 excludes a writer from becoming a designated Rada or backup designate Rada.

31
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.840
The values for the priority are from 1 to 255 so the first criteria is highest priority.

32
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.450
If the priorities are the same then the Rada with the highest Rada I.D. is elected as the designated

33
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.400
Rada for that segment.

34
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.220
So in this example we have elected or to use the designated Rada and let us assume again that this network

35
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:35.190
goes down but what happens now is or one sends an update only to the designated writers designate or

36
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.320
others are listening on this multicast address.

37
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.630
2 2 4 0 0 6 other writers are not listening to that multicast address.

38
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:50.450
So from an OSB point of view they do not receive or C that update only the designated Rada receives

39
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:57.720
that multicast update now multicore thing isn't covered in this course but briefly this infrastructure

40
00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:05.340
was a hub so the writers were connected via hub at layer one that multicast would go to all the routers.

41
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.520
However only certain routers are listening or accepting that multicast so only certain writers have

42
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.380
subscribed to that multicast.

43
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:21.720
In this case only designated writers are listening for and accepting multicast to address 2 2 4 0 0

44
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.680
6.

45
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:30.300
So the other writers Adelaide 2 will drop this update OSP if residing at layer 4 knows our model will

46
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.540
not see this update on the other writers.

47
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.510
So writers 3 4 5 and 6 from an ISP point of view at lower 4 will not receive the update.

48
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.750
Only writer 2 will receive the update.

49
00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.050
So logically what happens.

50
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:50.000
The link goes down writer 1 is updating rider to the designated writer but sending a multicast to this

51
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.020
address only write it to the designated writers receiving the multicast write it to then sends an update

52
00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.920
to all the other writers on this multicast address.

53
00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.230
2 2 4 0 0 5.

54
00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:08.590
All OSB if writers are listening to this multicast address so they will receive the update.

55
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:14.000
Writer 1 would receive the update but wouldn't process it because it's always topology table is already

56
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.720
up to date so logically what happens is the update goes from our 1 2 or two or two sends that update

57
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.450
to all the other writers.

58
00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.130
They process the update and therefore their topology databases updated with the new information that

59
00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.480
this network has gone down.

60
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:38.180
As you can see here it's much more efficient to use a designated rather than to allow full adjacencies

61
00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.680
between all writers and have all those duplicate updates.

62
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:49.030
It's important to realize that only the designator order and backup designated writer will have full

63
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.060
relationships to all the other writers.

64
00:05:53.110 --> 00:06:00.850
So for instance four out of four and a five will only have a state known as two way in two way.

65
00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:05.880
They know about each other but no updates will be exchanged between the writers.

66
00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:11.410
So in other words or for an hour five will not update each other neither will are five or six and so

67
00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:12.930
forth and so on.

68
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.490
All writers will only update the designated writer and backup designated writer with changes in the

69
00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:23.470
topology so they have a full relationship to the designated writer.

70
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:30.150
This allows for the saving of updates and duplicate traffic on a single segment.

71
00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:37.570
Once again it's important to realize that writers on the segment will only form full relationships with

72
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:40.530
designated writers and backup designated writers.

73
00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.010
Now this example I've only got a designated writer.

74
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:49.120
The issue with only having a designated Rada is that if this writer goes down updates will not be sent

75
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.330
and received properly.

76
00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:56.920
So on a segment a designated rider will be elected and normally a backup designated rider would also

77
00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.080
be elected.

78
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:05.560
So you'd have both a designated rider and backup designated Rada the BTR will become the D.R. if the

79
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.610
D.R. fails.
