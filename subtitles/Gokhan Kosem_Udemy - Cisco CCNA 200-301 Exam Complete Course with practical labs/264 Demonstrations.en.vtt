00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
There are 2 main ways that routes get added to the routing tables or routers.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The first way to use static routes

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
where an administrator manually adds a route to the routing table

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and the second way is to use dynamic routing protocols.

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So with static routes, you as the administrator are adding the routes to the routing table.

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The advantage of this method is that there is no overhead

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
on the network, in that, they are no keepalives

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
or constant routing updates sent between routers.

9
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
RIP or Routing Information Protocol which is an older routing protocol

10
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
sends it entire routing table every 30 seconds.

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So when using static routes rather than RIP that overhead is removed.

12
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
More modern routing protocols such as EIGRP and OSPF

13
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
remove this constant updating that took place in RIP every 30 seconds

14
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
but they still send hello's and keepalives

15
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
on the network which consumes bandwidth.

16
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
With static routes  that is removed

17
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
but the major disadvantage of static routes is that you as the administrator

18
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
have to update the routing table

19
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
which could be a lot of work if you have a large network.

20
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Static routes do not automatically taken to account changes in the network

21
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
you as the administrator would have to manually update

22
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
the routing table on a router or multiple routers if a link went down

23
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
so the overhead is not on the network

24
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
the overhead is on you as the administrator to keep everything updated.

25
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Static routes do not scale when networks become large.

26
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000
The amount of work involved in keeping routing tables updated manually is just too great

27
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
especially when there are lots of topology changes.

28
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Static routes do not update routing tables

29
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
when topology changes in most cases.

30
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Now that being said, it is possible these days to monitor IP addresses

31
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and for example to remove a route from the routing table

32
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
if an IP address is no longer available.

33
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So it's possible to implement some dynamic options with static routes

34
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
but the overhead is still large and static routes are cumbersome in large networks.

35
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Now static route are still used in lot of networks today

36
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
the most common example is a default static route

37
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
your home a DSL or cable or fiber router

38
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
will typically have a default route to your service provider.

39
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
So your home router doesn’t know about the routes on the Internet

40
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
it's simply forwards the traffic to your ISP

41
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
a default route in a router's routing table basically tells the router

42
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
when you don’t have a specific network for traffic

43
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
that you receive in your routing table simply send the packets to the router

44
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000
that’s configured as your default gateway or gateway of last resort.

45
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
So when you configure a default route on a router

46
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
you are pointing it to another router

47
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
which means that router will simply send that traffic to that default gateway

48
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
when it doesn’t have a more specific route in the routing table.
