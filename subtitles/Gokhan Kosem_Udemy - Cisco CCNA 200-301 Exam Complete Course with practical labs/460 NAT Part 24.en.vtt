00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:08.990
So at the moment in this typology Ratatouille is running not on fast Ethan it is 0 1 and is being overloading

2
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:16.190
on that interface to allow Ratto one and Rato for to connect to rodders 3.

3
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.760
So Ping 8 had one that one.

4
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:26.830
T Rotto one is now able to connect to router 3.

5
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.250
Now this is only for fun.

6
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:36.870
What I'm going to do now is extend the topology and connect genius 3 to my physical network interface

7
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:37.760
card.

8
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:45.830
So I mean it connected to my local area network and what I'll do is add a nother ethernet interface

9
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.730
to Ratatouille.

10
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:59.850
Sorority's now connected to the outside world on fast Ethernet 1 slash zero so on router to interface

11
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.460
one slash is zero.

12
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.620
No shut IP address DHC.

13
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:13.660
So that I get an IP address via DHP this interface connects me to my local area network which in turn

14
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:23.720
connects me to the internet so I can ping the Internet from my Windows PC as an example and I've now

15
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.960
bridged Jeana's 3 to the same network.

16
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:36.350
The rot has been allocated to this address and this is another reason to use overloading to an interface

17
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.300
because previously we configured an IP address statically.

18
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:48.050
But on this new interface we don't have an IP address statically configured the IP address is dynamically

19
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.910
configured so we want to overload the interface.

20
00:01:51.950 --> 00:02:00.940
So IP not inside source list specify an access list one which we created previously in this case.

21
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.190
I'm going to overload Ethan at one slash is zero.

22
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.890
To law both hosts to be netted and to be able to connect to the Internet.

23
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:20.190
So show IP Nachke translations shows no translations at the moment but I've enabled net on this interface

24
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.470
as well as this interface.

25
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:30.140
So not a one paying Google dot com doesn't work.

26
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:37.080
I need to enable IP domain lookup and I need to specify a name server.

27
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.390
And in this example I'll just use Google so ping Google dot com.

28
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.190
Sure IP not translations.

29
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.470
I'm not seeing any translations at the moment.

30
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.360
So let's do some troubleshooting.

31
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.500
Show IP raat.

32
00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:03.020
We have a default wrocht to 10 1 1 2 ping 10 1 1 t we can ping the router.

33
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.960
So let's do it D-bag IP Nat on this router.

34
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:18.160
Also to check whether this router can pin google.com directly the moment it can so IP domain look up

35
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.770
my IP name server specified Google

36
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:40.740
so that Rodek can ping Google get the local rodded to ping Google let's see if we see a problem if zero

37
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.570
slashes zero is on the inside.

38
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:43.510
That's right.

39
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.080
If 0 1 is on the outside.

40
00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.400
That's correct.

41
00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.490
But I forgot to put IP Nat outside on first.

42
00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.880
Ethan it once was zero.

43
00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:08.880
So IP not outside needs to be enabled on that interface show IP Nat translations no translations at

44
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.340
the moment.

45
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.600
Let's ping Google dot com.

46
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:12.540
That looks a lot better.

47
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:21.260
Ping's succeed and I'm getting my next translation so tender wondered wondered one that Rodda is translated

48
00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.960
to 1 2 1 6 8 1 1 15:9 going to google at the top here.

49
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:33.280
You can see the DNS query to the Google DNS servers and then a reply comes back.

50
00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:41.210
So this router running ingenius 3 is doing DNS queries against Google's DNS server on the internet.

51
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.880
Locally the rod is being netted from 10 1 1 1 to this address.

52
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:56.720
Now that is a nother RAFC 19:18 address but on Rodek to through DHP Mahratta has learnt that the default

53
00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:05.810
Gateway's 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 2 5 4 which is my local DSL internet router you can see some of the net queries

54
00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.140
coming out here.

55
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:16.210
Let's do a ping again show IP Nat translation there's a net translation in the table.

56
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:24.650
I could as an example telnet to Google dot com on port 80.

57
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.650
It's connected.

58
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.390
So connection is open.

59
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:36.930
You can see that the traffic is being nattered there it's going out press control See here you can see

60
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.120
we get some bad HMO.

61
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:45.140
And the that continues I could as an example go to another Web site.

62
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.860
Let's go to yahoo dot com.

63
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:54.280
So they had traces 46 of a go to put the port number in.

64
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.950
So the net is taking place but the server denied the connection.

65
00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:06.420
Let's go to port 80 and you can see that the connection is now opened to yahoo dot com and we can see

66
00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.110
the translations taking place.

67
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:18.270
Price controls see we get a bunch of HVM all here and you can see some translations taking place.

68
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.080
Notice he has the body of the HMO.

69
00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:30.800
And if we scroll up we'll probably be able to see some messages from yahoo dot com as an example.

70
00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:37.550
So that's an example of using overloading on two separate interfaces.

71
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.710
In one example we keeping it with ingenius 3.

72
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.930
And then the other example we actually connecting to the Internet.
