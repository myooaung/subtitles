00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In the previous videos, we've configured these interfaces

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
between the switches as trunk ports

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and configured the links to the routers and switches as access ports.

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This port as an example is in VLAN 10

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
this port is in VLAN 20, this port is in VLAN 1

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and this port is in VLAN 1 and these core ports are trunk ports permitting all VLANs.

7
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Now, this is a layer 2 infrastructure running between our switches.

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
In a layer 2 network when you have redundant links as we do here

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
we need to run Spanning Tree to prevent loops in your topology.

10
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Spanning Tree is enabled by default on Cisco switches

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
so when I type sh run  |  include span

12
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
you’ll notice that the switch is configured to run Rapid PVST+

13
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and is using an extended system IDs.

14
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
so when I use the command sh spanning-tree vlan 1 as an example

15
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
you can see the output for VLAN 1

16
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
the default priority for this switch is 32768 in decimal

17
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
that’s 8000 in hexa decimal.

18
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So the switch is using the default Spanning Tree priority

19
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
but because its using extended systems IDs

20
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and this is VLAN 1

21
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
the priority of the switch is 32769 in other words 32768 +

22
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
the VLAN number, we could see that as an example for VLAN 10

23
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
priority 32768 + extended system ID

24
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
so the priority of this switch is 32778.

25
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
For VLAN 20 we can see that the priority is 32788.

26
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So looking at VLAN 10 as an example, switch has this priority.

27
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
The roots of the Spanning Tree also has that priority.

28
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
The Spanning Tree that we're using is Rapid PVST

29
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
this is the address of the root bridge

30
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
this our local address or local MAC address.

31
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So the bridge ID is this number + this number

32
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
but the local switch is not the root bridge.

33
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Another switch is the root bridge

34
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and the port used to get to the root bridge is port 0/0.

35
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
so from switch 1 points of view, the root bridge is somewhere here

36
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
so we could have a look as an example

37
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
as switch 2 to see if that switch is the root.

38
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So on switch 2, sh spanning-tree vlan 10

39
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
shows us that this switch is the root bridge.

40
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
In other words, this bridge is the root

41
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
switch 2 is the Spanning Tree root for VLAN 10.

42
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Notice it doesn’t show a path cost to get to the root

43
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
it shows us that switch is the root and we can also see that by looking at the address.

44
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
notice the MAC address of the root is the same

45
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
as the MAC address of the local bridge or local switch.

46
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
All interfaces on this switch are designated ports and all ports are forwarding

47
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
whereas if we look at switch 1 once again, the switch has a root port.

48
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
the root port is forwarding and the switches root port is gigabit 0/0

49
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
we can see that once again by looking at the output here

50
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
but hopefully, at this point, you can see a problem in this topology.

51
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000
This core switch is blocking on all ports except gigabit 0/0.

52
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
So if we draw this topology and mark which port are forwarding and blocking

53
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
we'll be able to see what’s actually happening in the network.

54
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Looking at topology as follows, it looks like you have a lot of redundancy

55
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:53.000
and traffic from this host as an example may take an optimal path to get to destination

56
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
but that may not actually be true because of the ports that Spanning Tree are blocking

57
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
by default, so let’s have a look at what’s going on in this topology.
