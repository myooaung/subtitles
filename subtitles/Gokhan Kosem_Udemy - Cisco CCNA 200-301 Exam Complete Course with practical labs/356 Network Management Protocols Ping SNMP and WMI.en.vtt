00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:07.720
Understanding network management protocols is an important part of your job as a network engineer and

2
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:14.770
he's also important within the role of doing network management network management protocols for a key

3
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.160
part of the solar winds product.

4
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:26.950
In other words solar winds management tools make use of management protocols to manage network devices.

5
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:34.690
This video will provide an overview of how network management applications live reach network management

6
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.160
protocols would also describe the different types of network management protocols that are available

7
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:46.360
and then explain the most common protocols when discussing network management protocols.

8
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.720
We need to think about three main things before we talk about that.

9
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:58.330
We'll look at how Arayan leverages network management protocols and which types of protocols are leveraged

10
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:05.170
for different types of monitoring solutions network performance monitor does both fault monitoring as

11
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:13.390
well as performance monitoring for fault management most network management systems including Selwyn's

12
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:19.160
use ICMP or ping to detect whether a device is up or down.

13
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.180
It's as simple as the network management system or in a mess sending out a ping request and waiting

14
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.820
for a ping response.

15
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.950
If the ICMP response isn't returned the a message seems that the device is down.

16
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:40.510
Now you know Ryan it works slightly differently in that if a response isn't returned Arayan places the

17
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:48.220
nodes in a mode warning stage which means that Arayan is going to do a fast poll of the device to verify

18
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.130
that it's really down.

19
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:58.610
NPM all Arayan by default will monitor the device in a fast polling mode for 120 seconds before notify

20
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.740
g that the device is down.

21
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.660
This is configurable on the Advanced Settings in the NPM system manager.

22
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:14.060
Monitoring for Fultz on some elements like interfaces and volume's he's done differently as it's done

23
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.760
via an MP Well simple network management protocol.

24
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.410
For example if the enemy is pinging a router to see if it's up or down and a response doesn't come back

25
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.410
they are in a mess doesn't really know whether that device is down.

26
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.720
All it knows is that the response didn't come back.

27
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.510
The device could be down but they could also be a routing problem or an intermediate device could be

28
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.760
done or a device between the end a mass and the router could be down.

29
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:56.670
So some device along the path could be down all traffic could be blocked by an ACL or a firewall rule

30
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.860
all the enemies knows is that it can't reach the device that it's pinging.

31
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.640
It's an AP On the other hand is different with SMP.

32
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:14.510
The enemy is acquiring a device and the device is telling the enemy via Asen MP the state of an interface.

33
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.410
So if a device indicates that interface first Ethan is 0 0 as an example is down.

34
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:27.120
The enemy knows 100 percent that that information is accurate because it received that information via

35
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.710
its an MP from the device that it was queering.

36
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:37.140
Now in the event that the actual devices down rather than an interface on the device you will get an

37
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.470
unknown state.

38
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:45.460
That's a different type of signifier than if the interface is down on a device that's up and running.

39
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:53.760
In terms of performance monitoring ICMP or ping is used for availability calculations and latency response

40
00:03:53.770 --> 00:04:03.210
times SMP is used for almost all the other statistics including CPQ memory buffers interface traffic

41
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.970
and errors and many many other statistics.

42
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:17.250
In some cases for Windows systems the NMSL might leverage WMI or Windows management instrumentation

43
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.380
to check for performance count a type of values.
