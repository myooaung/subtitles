00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.100
This is one of multiple videos discussing IP version 6 rating in a previous video.

2
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.060
I configured these two routers to use static IPV six routes

3
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.160
using the local outgoing interface.

4
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:33.910
What I'll do in this typologies remove backed several and face and connect to these routers using the

5
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.110
ethernet interface.

6
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:44.390
So at the moment to show IPV 6 interface brief shows us that the address is configured on the serial

7
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.690
interface.

8
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:53.340
So what I'll do is go into the serial interface and type no IP V-6 address.

9
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.510
So now we don't have an IP address configured on the serial interface.

10
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:14.350
I'll do something similar on the site no IPV 6 address to show IPV 6 interface we can see that loopback

11
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:24.380
is configured with an IP V-6 address but no other addresses have been configured on any interfaces.

12
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:34.530
So what we do know is no shut the first ethernet interface and configure the IP version 6 address on

13
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:49.110
the Internet interface so IPV 6 address and the specific address show IPV 6 interface shows us that

14
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:58.500
the interface is up up the link local address used is us the global unicast address used is this the

15
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:05.010
Rodda has joined all hosts on the local segment and all routers on the local segment multicast groups

16
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.100
and has joined some other groups as well.

17
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:17.270
Show IP V-6 interface brief shows us the link local address as well as the global unicast address configured

18
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:28.800
on the router show IP V-6 route shows us connected route and local ront link local addresses are not

19
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.160
added to the writing table.

20
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:38.920
We also see information for the loop back that was previously configured on the site interface F-0 slash

21
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.190
is zero.

22
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:53.870
No shut IP the 6 address 2001 column one colon colon to slash 64 paing 2001 colon one colon column one

23
00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:03.780
wrote two is able to ping Rotto one using the first ethernet interface show IPV six route only shows

24
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.330
connected and local rats in the writing table and that's true on both Brodeur's.

25
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.760
Now a static route does exist in the running config.

26
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.660
But that's not used because the local interface has gone down.

27
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.270
But what I'll do here

28
00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.830
is remove that route.

29
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.240
You can do the same on the site

30
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.310
so no IPV 6 Raat

31
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:49.310
to remove the rot show IPV 6 route again shows us that we only have local and connected routes in the

32
00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.180
running table.

33
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:58.640
So to allow rodded to ping the Lupica wrote a 1 what we would do is type IPV six route specified the

34
00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.840
destination network which is 2001 kobun face colon.

35
00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:13.630
One colon colon slash 64 we can specify an interface or the next hop IP address.

36
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:21.190
So the next top IP address is going to be 2001 Collen one colon colon on one and we can specify and

37
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.780
administer of distance for the rot.

38
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.960
I'm not going to do that show IPV six route.

39
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:34.870
We now have the static route in the writing table and we should be able to paying 2001 toll on face

40
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:43.170
call them one code on call on one and we can can write a one ping the Lupica wrote it to note at the

41
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.820
moment.

42
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:57.030
We have to configure around the city so IPV six raht 2001 face to slash 64 specified next hop of 2001

43
00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:05.040
one to say can we paying 2000 one face to one.

44
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:14.270
Yes we can show IPV six or eight shows us the study grot in the running table but in this example its

45
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:19.870
via the next top IP address same is true over here.

46
00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:26.660
So thats different to the previous example where I configured the IP V-6 static route to using the local

47
00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.180
outgoing interface of the router.

48
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.030
So that was an example of how to configure IPV six static routes.

49
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:40.400
