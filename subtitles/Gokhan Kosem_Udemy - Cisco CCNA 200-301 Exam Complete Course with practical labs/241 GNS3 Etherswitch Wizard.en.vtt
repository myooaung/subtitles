00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now you don’t have to configure an EtherSwitch module

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
directly through a router as I’ve done here.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
so if I type show diag

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.000
you'll be able to see various components in the router

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
including the EtherSwitch module of 16 ports

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
notice the product code is NM-16ESW show ip int brief

7
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:40.000
shows me the EtherSwitch module ports in a router.

8
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
You may wanna configure it as follows.

9
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So go to help, setup wizard

10
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
choose whether you're going to use a local GNS3 VM or local server

11
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
in my example, I'll use the local server.

12
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I’m gonna use a real IOS image

13
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and I’m gonna select an existing image my 3725 image.

14
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000
When prompted for the name I’m gonna specify that this is an EtherSwitch router

15
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and notice the name changes when I click next

16
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I can fill in the default values

17
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
notice this router has the EtherSwitch module builtin

18
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
go through the wizard click finish

19
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and notice here we see an EtherSwitch router with the switch icon.

20
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So when I drag this to my workspace

21
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
this shows up as a switch

22
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
now it’s essentially still a router with an EtherSwitch module in it.

23
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
So you can see it’s a Cisco 3725 router

24
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
but notice information has been configured for me

25
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
including the name of the router and this help shown here

26
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
showing you that this is a normal router with a switch module inside

27
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
but it has pre-configured and hard coded with speed and duplex.
