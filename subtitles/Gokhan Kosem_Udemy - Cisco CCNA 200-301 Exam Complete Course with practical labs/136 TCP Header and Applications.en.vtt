00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
TCP or Transmission Control Protocol is a transport layer protocol

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
residing at layer 4 in OSI model and is connection orientated

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
it once again allows high layer protocols access to the network layer or IP layer

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
but in this case providing reliability.

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It is connection orientated before transmission

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
a session is establish  between 2 devices.

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
TCP generally implements a full duplex mode of operation.

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
There are some exceptions but we won’t go into them here

9
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
In other words a TCP connection is a pair of virtual circuits

10
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
one in each direction which operate in full duplex mode.

11
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The transmitter can receive data at the same time its transmitting.

12
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Both host in a conversation can transmit and receive at the same time.

13
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
there is error checking in TCP

14
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
because there is a checksum in the datagram to verify that there’s no corruption.

15
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
TCP segments are also numbered in sequence

16
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
so that the destination can re-order segments and determine if data is missing.

17
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
There is also acknowledgement of receipt of data, so all data is acknowledge by the receiver.

18
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
the transmitter or sender can re-transmit the segment or terminate the connection

19
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
if it determines that the receiver is no longer involve in the conversation.

20
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
TCP implements data recovery features

21
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
in other words there can be re-transmission of lost data.

22
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
So if there’s no acknowledgement of a segment, the segment will be re-transmitted.

23
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
TCP segment are sent using IP packets.

24
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
The TCP header will follow the IP header supplying information specific to the TCP protocol.

25
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
As you can see here the TCP header has many more options than the UDP header.

26
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So firstly you have a 16 bit source port number which identifies the sending port.

27
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
We have a 16 bit destination port, which identifies the receiving port.

28
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
There’s a 32 bit sequence number, if the SYN bit is set

29
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
then this is the initial sequence number.

30
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
The sequence number of the actual first data byte are then this sequence number plus 1.

31
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
If the SYN bit is not set then the sequence number, is the accumulated sequence number

32
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
of the first data byte of this packet for the current session.

33
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
It then has a 32 bit acknowledgement number.

34
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
If the ACK flag is set or bit is set

35
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
then the value of the acknowledgement number

36
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
is the next sequence number that the receiver is expecting to receive.

37
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
This field acknowledges receipt of all prior bytes.

38
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
The fist ACK or acknowledgement sent by each end

39
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
acknowledges the other ends initial sequence number but no data.

40
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:15.000
The header length or data offset specifies the size of the TCP header in 32 bit words.

41
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
The minimum size of the header is 5 words and the maximum is 15 words.

42
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
The minimum size of the  header is 20 bytes

43
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and the maximum size of the header is 60 bytes in IPv4

44
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000
which allows for up to 40 bytes of options in the header.

45
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
The reserve fill the set to 0 and is reserve for future use.

46
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Now there are lot of flags or control bits available in the TCP header

47
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and we won’t go through all of them.

48
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
The Congestion Window Reduced Flag is part of a congestion notification mechanism

49
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
used in conjunction with the ECE bit or flag

50
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
or echo congestion notification echo field or flag.

51
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Once again used in congestion notification.

52
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
This can be used in  quality of service where the network

53
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
and the host communicate to indicate congestion

54
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
therefore letting the transmitter know that it needs to slowdown.

55
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
The URG flag can indicate that this segment is urgent

56
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
and should be process as soon as possible.

57
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
The ACK flag as mentioned is used for acknowledgement of data.

58
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000
PSH is the flag set by TCP sender

59
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
to cause the TCP receiver to immediately pass

60
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
that segment's data to the receivers application socket

61
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000
along with all other in order data that the receiver is yet to give to that application.

62
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Reset; resets the connection in other words, the connection is turned down.

63
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
SYN is used to synchronize sequence numbers.

64
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Only the first packet sent from each end will have this flag set.

65
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
FIN means that there is no more data from the sender.

66
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
The window size which is 16 bits in length

67
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
specifies the size of the received window

68
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
which is the number of bytes that the receiver is currently willing to receive

69
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
we'll be talking more about flow control and window sizes in a moment.

70
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
TCP also includes a 16 bits TCP checksum

71
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
which is used for error checking of the header and the data.

72
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
The 16 bit urgent pointer is used with the URG flag

73
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
which when set on means that the 16 bit urgent pointer is used.

74
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
This indicates an offset from the sequence number indicating the last urgent data byte.

75
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
There are also various options available in the TCP

76
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
but this are out of the scope of this course.

77
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And lastly we have the data, which is the data from higher layer protocols

78
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
encapsulated within the TCP header.

79
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:26.000
There are some examples of applications that rely on either TCP or UDP.

80
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Examples are file transfer protocols include; FTP or File Transfer Protocol

81
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.000
TFTP or Trivial File Transfer Protocol, NFS or Network File System.

82
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:49.000
In email we tend to use POP3 or Post Office Protocol to receive mail

83
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol or SMTP to send mail

84
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
or IMAP or Internet Message Access Protocol

85
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
which is another protocol used for email retrieval

86
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
For remote log in to devices, we could use telnet

87
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
which sends traffic in clear text

88
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
and is therefore in secure or secure SHELL or SSH

89
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
which allows for a secure connection to remote devices.

90
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000
For network management we can use Simple Network Management Protocol or SNMP

91
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
and for name management we can use Domain Name System

92
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
which allows for the use of names rather than IP addresses

93
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
and translates those meaningful domain names, into IP addresses

94
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
so for instance cisco.com will be converted to an IP address

95
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
when a user browses the internet.

96
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Before continuing I wanna mention again how the mappings work

97
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
between the different layers of the OSI model.

98
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
At layer 2 in an Ethernet 2 frame, there’s a field called the type number

99
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
which allows a host to differentiate between multiple layer 3 protocols

100
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.000
at layer 3, remember you could be using a protocol like IPv4 or IPv6

101
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
or in the old days IPX or apple talk.

102
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:20.000
So at layer 2 the NEC needs to know which layer 3 protocol to send this traffic to

103
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
and the type number is used to differentiate the different layer 3 protocols.

104
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
At layer 3 a protocol number is used to differentiate

105
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
the different protocols running at layer 4, so in an IP header

106
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
the protocol field will denote where the TCP or UDP is being used at layer 4

107
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:52.000
At layer 4 a port number is used to differentiate multiple applications being use at layer 7.

108
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000
So it’s important to note that at layer 4 the way TCP or UDP

109
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
know which application this traffic is destined to is by the port number.
