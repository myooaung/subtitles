00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:16.910
In this video we going to discuss IP version 6 access control lists or IP v 6 AC ls on the same way

2
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:24.050
as with IP version for IP vs 6 access control lists allow you to permit or deny traffic in your network

3
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.310
and are a component of a layered security model

4
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:31.840
access denied

5
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:45.530
and it's quite an extended access list so that's the access list we've got a point on gigabit to 0 zero

6
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:58.820
so say no and remove the access list to show IP vs 6 interface gigabit 0 0 doesn't show any access lists

7
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:07.150
applied to the interface and again show run shows us that no access list is applied to the interface

8
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.790
so we can ping

9
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:21.510
the loop back of router 3 from both the gigabit to 00 interface and loop back interface of wrought a

10
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:32.750
1 so let's create another access list so IP vs 6 access list and I'll use a name such as ACL 2 would

11
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.390
make more sense to use better names than that but that's okay for this lab.

12
00:01:40.370 --> 00:02:00.210
Now I'm gonna specify a protocol so permit TGP any any permit ICMP 2001 colon 1 colon colon slash 64

13
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.960
going anywhere.

14
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:13.960
Interface gigabit 00 IP v 6 and we have to use traffic full to here ACL to inbound.

15
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.800
So again can write a 1 ping the loop back of rudder 3.

16
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:27.600
The answer is no when using the loop back as the source but it can paying the loop back of router 3

17
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.370
using the physical interface.

18
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:38.630
Can we Telnet to the loop back of rudder of 3 the moment it says connection refused.

19
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:47.400
Let's have a look to the VQ y line of Aurora 3.

20
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:55.460
We need to allow telnet on the line to line V2 y 0 for transport input.

21
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.340
All passwords.

22
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.920
Cisco enable password Cisco to try again.

23
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:19.480
We can Telnet to the Rada and what happens if we telnet using a source interface of looped back zero.

24
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:28.990
Notice we are able to Telnet to Router 3 using both the loop Bank as well as the physical interface

25
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.970
but we can't ping from the loop back off Route 1.

26
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.460
So just to reiterate

27
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:48.950
we have created an access list show IP vs 6 access list we've created to the success list called access

28
00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.050
list too.

29
00:03:50.270 --> 00:04:01.430
That's permitting any TCB traffic but it's only permitting ICMP traffic from this network there is an

30
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.830
implicit to deny.

31
00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.750
So when traffic is sent from this loop back address as the source it's dropped

32
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.180
because it's not permitted by the statement or by the statement.

33
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:24.530
But if we Telnet to the loop back from the local loop back it works.

34
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:33.700
Notice when we do show access list we can see the matches have increased and just pulled us to the right

35
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.880
and put in the password to that again.

36
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:46.500
Notice matches of increased hit Enter matches have increased and try again.

37
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:55.350
Matches have increased so telnet is permitted from the loop back of this router but ICMP isn't.

38
00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.330
So again pings of failing

39
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:08.870
and that's because of this access list is only permitting ping ICMP traffic from this network.

40
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:15.250
We've also applied the access list inbound on gigabit.

41
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:24.470
0 0 of rudder 2 so that's an example of an extended IP version 6 axis list.

42
00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:31.040
A lot of the knowledge that you have with IP version 4 can be applied directly to IP version 6 access

43
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.680
lists.

44
00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.290
