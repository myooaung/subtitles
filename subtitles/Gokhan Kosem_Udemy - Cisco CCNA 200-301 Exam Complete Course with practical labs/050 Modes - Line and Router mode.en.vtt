00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:07.260
The next mode is a line mode which is used for connections such as the console connection or auxilary

2
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.160
connection.

3
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.240
So in other words when you want to configure options on the console port you would go to a line console

4
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.070
mode or if you wanted to configure the options on the exhilarate port where you may connect a modem

5
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.610
as an example you would go to line orc's port.

6
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.210
You also configure Viti why ports in line mode.

7
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:39.900
So you would for example type line Viti Y is 0 2 4 to configure the first five Viti y lines on a road

8
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:47.050
it was switch evictee y ports are used for telnet or S-sh connections to Erato will switch.

9
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.310
In this example I'm in interface mode.

10
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.920
So I'm going to type exit to go to global config mode so that I can then go to line mode.

11
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.630
Now please note you don't have to type exit.

12
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.700
You can jump directly from interface mode to line mode as an example.

13
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.790
So you can go from one mode to another mode directly.

14
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.090
But for this example we'll go to the global configuration mode so that you can see the hierarchy of

15
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.640
options available through the Cisco IOS and in global configuration mode.

16
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:26.370
I can type a line console's 0 which takes me to a line console's 0 which is used for configuring the

17
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.400
console port on the router.

18
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:35.000
I could enter the command password Cisco as an example online console's 0.

19
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:42.630
What this means is that when I connect to the console of the router I'll be required to enter this password

20
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.650
before I gain access to user mode.

21
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.410
So let's test this.

22
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.970
I'm going to type control Zayde to take me back to privileged mode and then type exit to exit out of

23
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.020
the Rodda.

24
00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.120
So I'm now connected to the console and I can press enter to access the router.

25
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.690
Now notice it didn't ask me for a password and it's important that you remember this.

26
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.250
Firstly it's important to test any changes that you've made.

27
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.670
But secondly the reason why I wasn't asked for a password is I have to type an additional command on

28
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.000
the line console.

29
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.130
So if I go back to line console I need to type the command log in.

30
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:31.000
Which means that when I log into the console I'll be required to enter the password of Cisco.

31
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.020
So to test this controls it to get back to privilege mode top exit to exit the router.

32
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:45.640
And now notice when I hit Enter I'm required to enter the password that I created on the line.

33
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:52.840
So just to reiterate this I put both a password and the logging command on the line console.

34
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.870
Now the order of those two commands doesn't matter.

35
00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.030
You could have either put a plug in first or password first.

36
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:08.540
As long as both the commands are typed on the line console you will be required to enter a password

37
00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.410
when you connect to the console.

38
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.360
You know a lot of Cisco material they'll tell you to put the log in command first and then the password

39
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.270
command.

40
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.640
That's fine.

41
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.160
But in reality it doesn't matter either will work try it on a live.

42
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:32.090
Cisco Rado will switch to make sure for yourself you can enable routing protocols on a Rato or three

43
00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:40.280
switch by going to router mode and various routing protocols or supported the CCMA course focuses mainly

44
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:47.850
on open shortest path first always P.F. and enhanced interior gateway writing protocol all GAAP.

45
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.770
There are others including BGP and Repp.

46
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.840
So you need to go to a global configuration mode and then you type a router and specify a writing protocol

47
00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.590
so you could type road trip as an example.

48
00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:07.380
That would take me to the writing process on this route 9 config Rodda mode.

49
00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:14.420
You would be able to configure various parameters for your writing protocol as an example the network

50
00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:21.390
command is used to enable the writing process on various interfaces on the router.

51
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.170
When using a protocol such as REPP SPF or Joe P..

52
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.540
At this point don't worry too much about Rato rep configuration.

53
00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.570
We'll be discussing OSPF and aiight GOP in other videos.

54
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:43.070
For now just notice that when I use the question mark I see commands that are valid or relevant for

55
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.240
this mode and specifically for this routing protocol.
