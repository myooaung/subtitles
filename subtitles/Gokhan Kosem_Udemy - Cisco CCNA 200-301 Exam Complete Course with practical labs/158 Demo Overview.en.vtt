00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In this example, we’ve got 2 switches and 4 routers

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
which are acting as PCs in the topology

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
we also got a hub which I'm going to use to capture traffic using Wireshark.

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
These devices have just booted up so that they have no configuration.

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
on the first switch, I’ll give this switch a hostname of S1

6
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and on the second switch give it a hostname of S2.

7
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:44.000
sh vlan    at the moment we only have 1 Ethernet VLAN configured VLAN 1.

8
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
All ports on the switch are configured in that VLAN

9
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Cisco switches also have some older VLANs by default 1002, 1003, 1004 and  1005

10
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
which were used previously for FDDI and token ring

11
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
those VLANs are not used anymore today.

12
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Switch 2 shows something similar so  sh vlan brief

13
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
we have VLAN 1 all ports are configured in VLAN 1.

14
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Here’s router 1 which is acting as our PC

15
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I’m going to configure the FastEthernet interface

16
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
with an IP address of 10.1.1.1/24 mask

17
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and I’ll no shut the interface on router 2

18
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
do something similar

19
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
no shut the interface given an IP address of 10.1.1.2

20
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
so without any further configuration

21
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
we should be able to ping between router 1 and router 2

22
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000
notice router 2 can ping router 1 and router 1 can ping router 2.

23
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
The switch just has a default config

24
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
all ports on the switches are in VLAN 1

25
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
we can see that by using the command sh int g0/0 switchport

26
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.000
this port gigabit 0/0 is using administrative mode dynamic auto

27
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
operation mode at the moment is static access

28
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
negotiation of trunking is on, in other words DTP is enabled

29
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
but at the moment because there is no switch to negotiate with

30
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
the port is in VLAN 1, the default VLAN.

31
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Now we can see the traffic by doing a capture using Wireshark.

32
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Various traffic is seen here we’ve got a Spanning Tree BPDU being sent

33
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
by the switch, we can see Cisco discovery protocol messages

34
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
being sent by the switch as well

35
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
showing the switch port, the platform and other information.

36
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000
But what I’d like you to see is all traffic is Ethernet frames.

37
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
There is no 802.1Q tagging on this frames.

38
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Let’s do a search for ICMP traffic.

39
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
At the moment there's is no ICMP traffic.

40
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I'll get router 1 to ping router 2 and notice we see the ICMP traffic

41
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:31.000
what you’ll notice is we have the source MAC address of router 1 pinging router 2

42
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:39.000
protocol type is IPv4 source IPv4 address is 10.1.1.1

43
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
destination IP address is 10.1.1.2

44
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:51.000
it’s a standard Ethernet frame encapsulating IP and ICMP.

45
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
In this case it’s an echo and the reply is in echo reply.

46
00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
There is no Ethernet tagging on this frames at all.

47
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
It's a standard Ethernet frame, there is no concept of VLAN either

48
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
no VLAN information is transmitted on the frames.

49
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Even the other frames such as CDP don’t show any VLAN information whatsoever.

50
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
I'll stop that capture.

51
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
this is an access port and this is an access port by default

52
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
the same  will be true on switch 2

53
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:38.000
I'll configure router 3 with an IP address of 10.1.1.3

54
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.000
no shut the interface and I'll do something similar on router 4

55
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:58.000
no shut IP address 10.1.1.4

56
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Can router 4 ping routers 3 acting as host 3?

57
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Yes it can.

58
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Start capture here.

59
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
We can see various traffic types being captured

60
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:23.000
including once again CDP on router 3, I'll ping router 4 ping succeeds.

61
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
I’ll filter for ICMP

62
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and once again you can see that this is a standard Ethernet frame.

63
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000
There is no information about VLANs contained in this frames.

64
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Just standard Ethernet frames.

65
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:49.000
So the PCs in the topology are unaware of any VLAN information.

66
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
they're sending untagged frames

67
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
in other words, standard Ethernet frames to the switches

68
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and the switches are sending untagged frames to the PCs.

69
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Now let’s concentrate on switch 1 for the moment

70
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.000
I’m gonna set the VTP mode of this device to transparent

71
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
which means it won’t try and synchronize VLAN information with the other switch.

72
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.000
sh vlan  once again show us that we have 1 Ethernet VLAN configured.

73
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Let's create VLAN 2,  sh vlan brief

74
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
we now have 2 Ethernet VLANs but no ports are configured in VLAN 2.
