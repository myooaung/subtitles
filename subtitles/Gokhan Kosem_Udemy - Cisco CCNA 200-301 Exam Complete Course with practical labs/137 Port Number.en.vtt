00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.670
Win a PC for example is connecting to a web server on the internet.

2
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.920
Traffic will be sent from a source IP address to a destination IP address.

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:19.670
So the source IP address in this transmission will be from the host 10 1 1 1 to the server 10 1 to 1.

4
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.610
Traffic will be routed from the PC to the server and when the traffic arrives at the server the server

5
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:34.170
needs a way to differentiate which application to send the traffic to the well-known port numbers are

6
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.260
used for various common day applications like HTP.

7
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.820
So this server will be running a web server application like ISIS or Petchey which serves up the web

8
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.440
pages for the web browser using Apache as an example.

9
00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:00.260
The Apache server will be listening to traffic on port 80 which is the well-known port number for HTP.

10
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:07.080
Your browser will automatically open up a connection to the servers IP address on that port number.

11
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:15.880
If the defaults a used when their traffic arrives at the transport layer TZP will send that traffic

12
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.800
to port 80.

13
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:24.490
The port number the Apache server is listening on and the Apache server at the application layer will

14
00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.510
process the data received.

15
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:36.260
The pc will use a random source port number in a specific range that range is dependent on the operating

16
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.700
system and whether the Ayana standards are followed.

17
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.490
But essentially a random port number is used as a source and a well-known port number is used as the

18
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.580
destination.

19
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.910
In this conversation when the reply from the server is sent back to the PC.

20
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.760
Note that the source address will be the servers IP address and the port number will be port 80 the

21
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:06.700
destination IP address will be the PC's IP address and the port number the PC selected as the source

22
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.780
port number.

23
00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:13.180
So no return traffic has the IP addresses reversed and the port numbers are reversed.

24
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.870
The PCs web browser.

25
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:24.380
Let's say for instance Internet Explorer will be listening on those ports 60000 and when the traffic

26
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.530
arrives at the PCs transport layer.

27
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:34.170
In this case TZP TZP will push that traffic to port 60000.

28
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:42.170
The port number that Internet Explorer is expecting to receive the traffic on that's port numbers bind.

29
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:49.300
Les afford to lay A7 allowing applications to communicate.

30
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.290
Now they are some well-known port numbers that you need to remember well-known port numbers are in the

31
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.980
range less than or equal to 1023.

32
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:08.860
So for example HTP uses port 80 and TZP as its transport layer protocol.

33
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:21.590
If the control which is used for the server and find negotiation uses port 21 using TZP data which is

34
00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:31.210
used for the actual transmission of data and if ATP uses port 20 and TZP telnet used for management

35
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:44.390
uses port 23 and uses TZP DNS is an interesting case because it uses both TZP and UDP and uses port

36
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:52.170
53 DNS primarily uses UDP on port 53 to serve requests.

37
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:59.530
In other words when a host needs a resolution for say Cisco Racan that will usually be port 53 TZP is

38
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:08.350
used when the response data exceeds 512 bytes or for tasks such as zone transfers zone transfers are

39
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:14.440
used for replication of databases containing DNS data across a set of DNS servers

40
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:30.910
TFT users UDP port 69 and SMP uses UDP port 161 once again to see a list of court numbers go to Google

41
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:40.200
and type on a port numbers and as you can see here the internet assign numbers authority or on a number

42
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:49.740
list is available for viewing as you can see here the well-known port numbers on the range 0 to 1023

43
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.790
I have that because of the number of applications that don't use is the second range known as the registered

44
00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:06.020
ports in the range 1024 3 to 49 1 5 1 which are generally used for proprietary applications.

45
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:16.440
Dynamic or private port numbers on the range 4 9 1 5 2 3 to sixty five thousand five hundred thirty

46
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.390
five.

47
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:27.260
As you can see the full port ranges from 0 to 6 5 5 3 5 to search for a well-known application I'm just

48
00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:33.370
going to use the key sequence control F and then type in for example Telenet.

49
00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.510
And as you can see here telnet uses port 23.

50
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:45.430
Now both TZP and UDP could be used for telnet but in most implementations TZP is used.

51
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:53.390
I could search for another protocol like let's say TFT P And as you can see here TFT P uses port 69.

52
00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:00.950
Once again TZP or UDP could be used but in real world applications UDP is used.

53
00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.880
I could search for example for HTP.

54
00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:13.920
And as you can see here notice port 80 there are many applications here some of which you may never

55
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.650
have used or seen.

56
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:18.770
There's another example.

57
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:25.530
BP and its derivative DHP use port 67 and 68.

58
00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:33.860
I could scroll down the list and show you many many port numbers as an example of the way.

59
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:39.520
And here's an example of some of the port numbers used by Bloomberg.

60
00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.650
Now according to the owner there are three ranges of port numbers.

61
00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:51.450
Well-known port numbers are less than or equal to 1023 registered port numbers on this range 1024 2

62
00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:59.310
4 9 1 5 1 and dynamically assigned port numbers which should be used by hosts when initiating sessions

63
00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:06.020
for instance well-known import numbers on the range 4 9 1 5 2 2 6 5 5 3 5.

64
00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:12.360
However Venda implementations do not necessarily follow that recommendation.

65
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:18.870
Ephemeral port numbers are short lived Portes used for the client side of a connection.

66
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:26.310
So when your PC initiate a session to a web server and ephemeral code will be used they are temporary

67
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.090
and only last for the duration of the session.

68
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:35.750
As I've shown you the honor suggests the range for 9 1 5 2 to sixty five thousand five hundred thirty

69
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:36.990
five.

70
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:47.830
However BSD uses this range 1024 through 4 9 9 9 Linux or Linux users.

71
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:57.570
Ports 3 2 7 6 8 2 61000 windows through to server 2003 use the range 1000 and twenty five to five thousand

72
00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:08.150
Windows Vista and 7 use the actual eye on a range and Free BSD users on a range since version 4.6.

73
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:15.730
So just be aware the source port number is used by hosts will very based on the Venda implementation

74
00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:21.280
and which ephemeral port numbers that vendor has decided to use.

75
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:28.940
So in this example this host which may be running Windows Vista is using a source port of 60000 when

76
00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:32.770
connecting to this Apache server on well-known port 80.
