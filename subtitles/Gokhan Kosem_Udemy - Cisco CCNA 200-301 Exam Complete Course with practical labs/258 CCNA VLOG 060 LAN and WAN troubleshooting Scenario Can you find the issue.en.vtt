00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:17.450
This is one of multiple troubleshooting videos we've been told that switch one on the left in this topology

2
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:25.580
is not able to ping switch to ON THE RIGHT IN THIS topology now in this topology I'm using physical

3
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:35.990
devices rather than Janus 3 I'm only using Janus 3 to show a diagram of the topology so let's verify

4
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:45.290
what we've been told on switch one can we ping switch to it looks like we can't the pings are failing

5
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.900
so let's do some troubleshooting show IP interface brief Can you see the problem here.

6
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.500
What's wrong in this output.

7
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.590
So here's the command show IP interface brief.

8
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.570
What's wrong.

9
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:13.860
Notice first Ethernet 0 3 is down down show interface if 0 3 we told that to the interfaces down line

10
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.150
protocol is down.

11
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.760
It's not connected now at this point you may need to check the cabling to see if there's a problem but

12
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.910
before you do that let's have a look at the connection.

13
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:35.020
On the other side so on rather 1 show IP interface brief on the side of the interfaces up down show

14
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.610
interface if 0

15
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:48.710
in this output we can see that fast ethernet 0 is up or down on the side fast ethernet 0 3 is down down

16
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.470
now based on this output.

17
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.510
What's the problem.

18
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.960
Can you see an issue between the switch and the rudder based on this output.

19
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.360
So before walking and checking the physical cabling or getting someone asked to check the physical cabling

20
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.940
what can you see that's wrong in this output OK.

21
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.610
So notice this full duplex of 100 megabits per second on this side.

22
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.460
Notice auto duplex 10 megabits per second.

23
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:26.900
It looks like there's a problem with the speed and duplex configuration.

24
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.240
So on this side a MAC address and an IP address have been configured on the first Ethernet interface

25
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.750
and the speed of the interface is 10 meg on the side and the output we can see that it's using full

26
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.970
duplex 100 make per second.

27
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.430
So if we look at the interface configuration notice the speed and duplex have been hard coded.

28
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.920
Typically today you wouldn't do that.

29
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.110
But let's say for example that we set the speed and duplex to 100 meg.

30
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.220
So on this side we set the speed to 100 meg.

31
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:06.150
Notice you can see that the interface came up and then went down and we are seeing another problem duplex

32
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:15.870
mismatch and we can see that on both sides we told that first Ethernet 0 is using half duplex and on

33
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:24.530
our side we're not using half duplex to show run interface f 0 speed is 100 what you probably want to

34
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:35.000
do is set this to do auto negotiation rather than hardcoded so that they can negotiate properly and

35
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:36.350
on this side

36
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.880
we probably want to do the same so show run interface.

37
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:52.690
If 0 slash 3 rather so let's set the speed to auto and the duplex to order so that it's automatically

38
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.780
negotiated with the other side.

39
00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.190
Here we still seeing problems with speed and duplex show run interface.

40
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:08.380
F 0 everything is set to auto and on this side show run interface f 0 slash 3.

41
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.240
Everything is set to auto show interface f 0 slash 3.

42
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:19.360
We can now see that the interfaces come up up it's connected show interface.

43
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.790
F 0.

44
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:27.520
Interface is up up so that looks a lot better so it looks like we've solved the problem between switch

45
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.240
1 and root of 1.

46
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.110
We didn't have to check the physical cabling.

47
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.640
The problem here was that the speed and the duplex were wrong.

48
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:47.950
Okay so can such 1 ping switch to we still having a problem we see used in the output.

49
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.600
In other words unreachable show running config.

50
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.820
Switch doesn't have a lot of config on it but what it does have is an IP address configured locally

51
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.380
and a default gateway so can we ping the default gateway.

52
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:19.100
Yes we can so disable IP domain look up to speed up trace route and if we trace 2 10 1 3 2 notice we

53
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.930
get to 10 1 1 1.

54
00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.030
But we don't get any further.

55
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:32.170
So it looks like the traffic gets too broad of one but we receiving an unreachable message because rider

56
00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:39.490
1 doesn't know what to do with a traffic so he has brought a one show IP Brunt.

57
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.570
Can you see a problem here.

58
00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.730
We only have a route for Ethan at zero.

59
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:55.750
There's no routes to get to switch to show IP protocol we are running EAI Joe IP on the router and it's

60
00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.380
enabled on all interfaces.

61
00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:07.260
So show run Section II GOP has the GOP configuration that looks good.

62
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:18.830
Show IP ya GOP interface G.I. Joe GOP is enabled on fast ethernet zero as well as serial zero show CTP

63
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:25.520
neighbors we see a seat neighbour relationship to switch one but we don't see a CW neighbor relationship

64
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:33.470
to switch to CTP allows us to check or layer 2 connectivity if CTP is working it means that layer 1

65
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:40.370
and layer 2 are working but at the moment it looks like layer 1 and layer 2 on not working so let's

66
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:46.800
check show IP interface brief can you see the problem.

67
00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:54.800
Notice serial zero is up and down there's a problem with the physical link between Rado 1 and write

68
00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:00.780
a 2 on brought it to show IP interface

69
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:11.110
we have the same problem here serial zero is up and down so now would be a good time to check the cabling

70
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:18.160
fortunately with serial interfaces we can use the command show controllers serial and specify the serial

71
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:26.200
interface number to check whether a cable is connected to the router in this case interface serial zero

72
00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:36.360
has a DTV cable connected it's a v 35 cable but notice the problem the clocks are stopped on the side

73
00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.450
show controllers serial Zero

74
00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:46.940
what's the problem here what's wrong and how do you fix it.

75
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:57.910
Okay noticed here we've got a v 35 a DC cable and there's no clocking on the cable show run interface

76
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.890
serial zero clocking hasn't been configured on the cable

77
00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:15.280
on a DTV cable you don't use the clock rate to command so I could specify a clock rate but that command

78
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:26.690
is gonna have no effect because this is a DTV cable but on this side if we enter the clock rate command

79
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:34.910
and notice they are different clock rates available I'm just going to use 64 K show run interface serial

80
00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:47.130
0 notice the command is retained in the running config and that's because the interface here is a DC

81
00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:52.800
interface so show IP interface brief

82
00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:04.050
interface is now map up on the side we saw a neighbor relationship established in IGP.

83
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:10.040
We also saw the interface come up to show IP interface brief.

84
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:14.120
The interface is now up up show.

85
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.320
Controllers

86
00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:21.540
serial zero on this side.

87
00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:27.530
We now see that transmit and receive clocks are detected on the side show.

88
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:35.670
Controllers serial zero the clocking is set to 64 kilohertz per second because this side is the DC side

89
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:36.420
of the cable.

90
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:41.160
A back to back cable is connected between right of one and rudder to

91
00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.530
and wrote it to is the DC side.

92
00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:51.690
So it needs to provide the clocking for the connection.

93
00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:53.650
So show GDP neighbors.

94
00:09:53.760 --> 00:10:00.850
We now see rider 2 as a neighbor on board a one ping 10 1 2 2.

95
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:11.860
We can ping rudder to show IPR GOP neighbor we can see right too as a neighbor and hopefully switch

96
00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:21.670
one will now be able to paying switch to which it can to confirm that I'll use the command debug IP

97
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:31.170
ICMP on switch 2 and ping from such want to switch to and we can see that an echo reply was sent switch

98
00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:37.920
to can also pane switch one so we've successfully resolved two issues in this network.

99
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:45.670
Be careful when troubleshooting it's a good idea to know your own assigned model and split the troubleshooting.

100
00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:50.970
Ping trace right in CBP are useful for troubleshooting networks.

101
00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.330
It's important that you learn your show commands.

102
00:10:54.330 --> 00:11:05.350
Don't just type it show run on a device learn how to use show commands to see the state of interfaces

103
00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:12.730
so as an example here we can see that the interfaces up up will be able to see other information on

104
00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:18.910
the interface such as the load packets sent and received and so forth.

105
00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:28.620
If I removed the clock rate on this interface by using the command no clock rate what we should see

106
00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:37.050
on rider 1 is that the interface goes down it stays up for a while because of the keep alive which is

107
00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:39.950
set to 10 seconds but after a while.

108
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:47.690
As you can see there UI GOP neighbor relationship went down and what we should see is that the physical

109
00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:49.640
interface goes down.

110
00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:50.540
After a while

111
00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:55.950
like that.

112
00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:57.780
So the interface has just gone down.

113
00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:02.220
Show interface several zero notice interfaces up and down.

114
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:08.210
So learn to use your show commands to see what's going on on the network.

115
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.110
So show controllers serial zero.

116
00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:23.810
Here we can see that a DTV cable is connected but we're not receiving clocking in clocking a set.

117
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:30.960
This will change as you can see here transmit and receive clocks are detected interfaces come up show

118
00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.850
interface serial zero.

119
00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:39.330
We can now see that the interfaces up one of the most important skills for years a network engineer

120
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:43.060
is to learn how to troubleshoot networks.

121
00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:47.430
