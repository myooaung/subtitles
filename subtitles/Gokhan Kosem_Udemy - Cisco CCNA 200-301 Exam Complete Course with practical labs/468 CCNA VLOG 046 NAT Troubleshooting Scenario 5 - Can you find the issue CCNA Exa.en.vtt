00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:17.110
This is one of multiple network address translation or not to trouble shooting videos in this typology

2
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:23.660
we've been told that hosts on the inside network rodder one acting as host one writer for acting as

3
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:30.740
host two and write a five acting as host three are not able to paying wrote a three acting as Google

4
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:37.730
wrote a tuneless typologies configured as the NAT router so let's do some verification on brought a

5
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:50.460
one to one able to ping the Google Server 8 8 8 8 and at the moment it's not let's do a debug on route

6
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:58.200
to acting as on NAT router so debug IP not do the ping again.

7
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:07.490
We are not getting any output on the console and we are monitoring debugs on the console at the moment

8
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.480
so let's verify that traffic is getting to the default gateway.

9
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.920
In this example the Rodda has a default gateway of 10 dot wandered wondered too far for a ping tendered

10
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.430
one would want to fight for traffic gets to the default gateway.

11
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.600
Let's trace to Google dot com.

12
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.740
Traffic gets to the default gateway which is Rodda to.

13
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.620
In this example

14
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.210
it gets no further.

15
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.520
So the Trace's timing out so let's determine if the problem is on the net to rodder.

16
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:53.410
So show IP net statistics shows us statistics of the net configuration.

17
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.760
Here's the command.

18
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.480
We don't have any active translations.

19
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.840
The outside interfaces gigabit is 0 1 which is correct.

20
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:09.400
Per our diagram inside interfaces are gigabit to 0 0 0 2 0 3 which is correct.

21
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:16.680
Per our diagram we have a dynamic translation configured for inside source addresses.

22
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:24.570
We're using access list one and a Nat Poole called Net pool which has this Sublette mosque and this

23
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.490
range of addresses.

24
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.320
So let's do some more investigation show run pipe include Nat.

25
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.280
These are the commands on the various interfaces.

26
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.070
We were able to see which interfaces had not configured through this output here.

27
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:47.680
So we know that some interfaces are configured as inside and one is configured as outside.

28
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.310
And that's what this config is showing.

29
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:57.630
You could if you wanted to make sure use commands such a show run interface and a individually interface

30
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:04.590
such as gigabit 0 or 1 to confirm that the match has being configured correctly on the interface.

31
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:13.110
But the statistics command has shown us that output is ready to show run pipe including that we can

32
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:21.150
see here that a net command is being configured netting inside source addresses using access list 1.

33
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:27.600
And in fact Paul called Net pool which is configured here and we can see a range of addresses in the

34
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:34.710
pool and a subnet mask show access lists.

35
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.970
We've got access list one configured and that's what's being referenced in the next statement.

36
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.220
And we have some matches in the access list show IP interface brief.

37
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.570
Can you see the problem.

38
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.570
Let's have a look at Rotto for sure.

39
00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.070
I've been to face brief.

40
00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:01.270
Can you see the problem here let me give you another hint.

41
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.400
Show interface give it a 0 0 show.

42
00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.580
Bruhn interface.

43
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:13.480
Give it to 00 and on Rotto for a show run interface gigabit 00.

44
00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:23.050
Can you see the problem is another hint to show run pipe include access look at how this access list

45
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.120
is configured.

46
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.550
Compare that to the IP addresses of the host devices.

47
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:36.430
OK so notice this host is in subnet 10 1 2 0.

48
00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:43.960
This host is in subnet 10 1 1 0 slushed 24 mosque here.

49
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:54.790
However the access list is matching 10 is 0 1 10 0 2 and 10 0 3 host 5 acting as our third internal

50
00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:04.320
PC has an IP address 10 1 3 3 slushed 24 the sexist list is incorrect.

51
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:20.790
So no access list one access list 1 permit 10 1 1 0 slushed 24 10 1 2 0 Slide 24 10 1 3 0 slash 24.

52
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.230
So show access list this access list looks better.

53
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:34.190
Let's confirm that networks are paying 8 8 8 8 Ping's succeeds.

54
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:44.400
We see the net translations on Route 2 for that host peing 8 8 8 8 Ping's succeed and we see the net

55
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:55.630
translations and on five of those internal host Ping's succeed and we see the net translations.

56
00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:05.880
So be careful with your access lists your access lists hefty match your data statements and be correct

57
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:13.440
for the hosts in the typology this net statement is matching X-ists list one access list one is now

58
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.020
correctly configured.

59
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.970
So we see matches on the access list.

60
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.770
That was an example of troubleshooting Network Address Translation.

61
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:24.670
I hope you enjoyed this video.
