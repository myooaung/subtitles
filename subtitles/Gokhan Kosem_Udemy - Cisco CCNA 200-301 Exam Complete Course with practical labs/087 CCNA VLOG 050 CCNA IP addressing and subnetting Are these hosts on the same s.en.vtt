00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:16.950
I've been asked a number of times to explain whether devices on the same subnet will separate subnets.

2
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.340
In this example I've got two PCs.

3
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.420
The one on the left will be configured with an IP address of tendered wondered wondered one and the

4
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.940
one on the right will be configured with an IP address of tendered one or two or two.

5
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.430
So here's the question Can these two hosts ping each other.

6
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.350
Are they in the same subnet.

7
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:44.260
It's a tricky question because you can't actually answer this question without knowing what the subnet

8
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.700
mask is.

9
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.820
You can't determine whether these two hosts on the same subnet.

10
00:00:49.840 --> 00:01:00.020
If you don't know what the subnet mask is on this example rather than using a Windows PC I'm using Cisco

11
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.220
routers as my PCs in my G and his three typology.

12
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.560
Don't worry if you're not familiar with the Cisco Seelye I cover that in more detail in my CCN a course

13
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:24.370
but in this example what I'll Firstly do is name the route on the left right of one and the router on

14
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:35.610
the right name is routed to at the moment no IP addresses have been configured on the gigabit Zerah

15
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.880
interfaces of these routers so show IP interface brief.

16
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:52.690
Notice no IP address is configured on gigabit 00 on either router show IP interface gigabit 00 shows

17
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.530
us that to the interfaces down Internet Protocol processing is disabled.

18
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.920
In other words IP doesn't work.

19
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:09.100
So what we need to do is go on to the gigabit 00 interface and no shut it that essentially enables the

20
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.100
interface.

21
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.740
And then I need to configure an IP address on the interface.

22
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:24.520
So notice if I type IP address 10 1 1 1 and Precentor I'm told that that's an incomplete command.

23
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.970
The same is true on the.

24
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.280
All enabled interface.

25
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:37.660
And if I try and enable an IP address of 10 1 to 2 I'm told that that's an incomplete command.

26
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.120
We need to specify the subnet mask

27
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.700
so that on the side as well.

28
00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:54.730
And notice now we're not top show IP interface gigabit 0 0 we are told that the IP address configured

29
00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:03.770
on this interface is tendered one tutor to slash 24 on the side show IP interface gigabit 0 0.

30
00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.910
We are told that the IP address is 10 to 1 and 1 1.

31
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:18.810
This is using Sajda notation 24 equates to 24 binary ones which is the equivalent of doing it this way

32
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.320
in dotted decimal notation.

33
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.570
So you say tomato or say tomato you say rodder what router with a router.

34
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:36.750
It's the same thing just a different way of phrasing it so 24 means 24 binary ones.

35
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.390
205 in decimal equates to 8 to binary ones.

36
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.580
So this is eight to binary ones plus eight to binary ones plus eight to binary ones which equates to

37
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.590
24 binary ones.

38
00:03:50.590 --> 00:04:00.580
So this is the same as this what this is telling us is that the first 24 bits of the IP address is the

39
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.500
network portion.

40
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:14.480
In other words to 5:5 first octet is network 4 5 second octet is network 2 4 5 third octet is network.

41
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.560
This is the network portion of the address.

42
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.450
This is the host portion based on the binary zeroes in the subnet mosque on this site.

43
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.160
Show run interface gigabit 00.

44
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.940
This is the network portion.

45
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.130
This is the host portion.

46
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:38.370
So when a device wants to ping another device it needs to determine whether the other devices in the

47
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:46.010
same subnet as itself the way it does that is it looks at the subnet mask and determines if the network

48
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:53.340
portion of the address is the same or if it's different if it's the same then the device will send out

49
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.570
an op.

50
00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:00.930
Now if Ethan it is used the device will send out an up to work out which Mac addresses associated with

51
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.180
the IP address.

52
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:08.360
If it's on a different subnet the device will typically forward the traffic to its default gateway.

53
00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:14.190
Now in this example notice when we try to ping from a router one to rodded to the ping doesn't work

54
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:23.910
because these two devices on different subnets can rotate to acting as PC to ping right of one acting

55
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.100
as PC one.

56
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:32.490
No it can't and that's because they in different subnets for use the command de-bug IP packets on the

57
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.090
site and do the ping again.

58
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.100
We are told that the packets are unreadable.

59
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.920
The broader doesn't know what to do with the packets.

60
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.970
In other words it doesn't know where to forward the packets.

61
00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:57.220
However if we change the subnet mask it's all configured the same IP address but use a slash 16 mosque.

62
00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.740
So show IP interface gigabit 00.

63
00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.510
Notice that slushed 16 and I'll just do that again.

64
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:13.050
So show IP interface gigabit 00 slushes 16 mosque show run interface gigabit 00.

65
00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:25.210
Notice it's 2 4 5 2 4 5 0.0 and all do the same on the side IP address 10 1 1 1 2 4 5 2 4 5 0 0 so show

66
00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:30.640
IP interface gigabit 0 0 notice say slash 16 mosque.

67
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:39.880
So again show IP interface but 00 IP address on the site is 10 1 1 1 slide 16 show run interface kickabout

68
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.150
0 0 IP address looks like this.

69
00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.770
So can these two devices now ping each other

70
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:57.740
you've got a lot of debugs they so let's turn off the deep bugging and try again.

71
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:05.860
Notice the ping succeeds on the side ping 10 1 to 2 ping succeeds.

72
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.550
Now debugging on router just allows you to see what's going on in the background.

73
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.500
So it allows you to troubleshoot what's happening on your network.

74
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:25.880
So notice by just changing the subnet mask I was able to get these devices to ping each other because

75
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.910
I've now told them that they are in the same subnet

76
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:36.000
when traffic is sent and we using the debug will be able to see what's going on.

77
00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:44.810
So notice here we had one failure one ping failed indicated by the dot and then four exclamation marks

78
00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.420
told us that the pings succeeded.

79
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:56.090
We had an encapsulation failure Firstly because the device had to send out an op to determine the remote

80
00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.820
PCs Mac address.

81
00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:06.580
And then once that was done a full packet was sent so ofter up resolution the packets were sent out

82
00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:12.280
onto the gigabit 00 interface to the destination 10 1 to 2

83
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:19.040
because these two devices are now in the same subnet.

84
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:20.780
They can ping each other.

85
00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:29.300
They know that they in the same subnet because $10 one the network portion is the same on both sides.

86
00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:32.640
I found it is very useful if it was a benefit to you.
