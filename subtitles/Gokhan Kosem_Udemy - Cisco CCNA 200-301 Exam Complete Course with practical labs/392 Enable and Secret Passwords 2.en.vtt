00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:08.370
So once again when I'm in user mode and I type the Nabl I gain access to the router by default using

2
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:14.600
privilege level 15 which means I have all rights to the router without a password.

3
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:15.830
So let's change that.

4
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.390
Configure terminal confetti.

5
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.630
There are two ways to configure passwords for the Enable mode or privilege mode when you type enable.

6
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.550
You'll see that you can configure a password for Enable mode or a secret password for Enable mode.

7
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.690
So both of these assign a privilege level type of password.

8
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:44.730
Now the Enable password is still in the Cisco CCMA which is surprising because it's a very weak way

9
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.850
of setting up passwords.

10
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.260
The reason why is the password is unencrypted as shown over here.

11
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.880
When you type in the password you either specify 0 which means that the password you're going to now

12
00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:02.730
type is in clear text or you specify 7 which means that the password is encrypted when you type it in.

13
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.910
By default you don't have to put the zero in.

14
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.580
Which means that the pause would you now typing is in clear text.

15
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.340
Now be careful hitting enter at this point you don't want a password of Siska space.

16
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.230
So I'm going to press backspace and then hit enter.

17
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.150
So the password configured is enabled password Cecka control Zeo controls.

18
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.430
It takes me back to privilege mode and now foretop show run.

19
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.540
You'll see the problem.

20
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.980
Notice the password is in clear text.

21
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.280
So if you are standing behind me looking over my shoulder you'd be able to see what the password is

22
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.700
configured as a way for copy the configuration to a TFT piece over and you opened up the file on the

23
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.870
server.

24
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.120
You'd also be able to see what the password is configured as.

25
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.770
So Cisco recommend that you change this default of no service password encryption to service password

26
00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.330
encryption to enable encryption of the password.

27
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.610
Now this is a trap.

28
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.620
Don't be fooled by this encryption.

29
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:10.350
So firstly when you type show run or show running config notice we've set service password encryption

30
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.930
and the password is encrypted with a type 7 password.

31
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.010
However if I copy that and paste it into a hacking tool.

32
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.860
Now make this tool available as part of the course.

33
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.560
So you should see it below the video.

34
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.460
If I paste that password in and click Show password.

35
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.620
Notice the password is decrypted.

36
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.550
So this password is only useful for stopping someone standing behind me looking over your shoulder and

37
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.250
seeing what your password is.

38
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.530
It is not actually something that you should be using today.

39
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.430
Now just to confirm that that type enabled password Cisco one.

40
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.790
And in this case I'll use the do show run command which means I'm running a show command from configure

41
00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:04.350
mode and I'm going to specify pipe include enable to show only lines in the running config with the

42
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.890
Enable word Notice the password is different to what we had previously.

43
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.670
So back in my hacking application I'll paste that in.

44
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.860
Notice there's the password.

45
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:23.620
I'll send it back to Cisco look at it again notice it's changed.

46
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.010
But when I pasted in the password is shown through this hacking tool.

47
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.180
So don't be fooled into using the Enable password.

48
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.570
One more thing I'll point out and then I'll show you a better way of doing it.

49
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:43.350
So when you type enable password notice the seven that means that the password that follows is encrypted.

50
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.050
So if I put it in like that it means that I've used a password of Cisco.

51
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.480
Now how does this help me.

52
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:59.160
Well when I type disable and now type enable notice I need to put in the password of Cisco So the Enable

53
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:08.820
password command is used to stop someone moving from user mode to enable mode without any cation.

54
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.540
You'll also notice that the password is not displayed.

55
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.120
It doesn't even show you the number of characters that you typing so when I type in table nothing is

56
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.530
displayed even though I'm typing the password.

57
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:26.340
So someone behind me wouldn't know how many characters my password is and you wouldn't know.

58
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.020
Watching this video.

59
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:35.090
So that's the Enable password recommendation is don't use it because it's in clear text by default.

60
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:42.390
So once again foretop no service password encryption and then type do show run the password is shown

61
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.120
is encrypted here.

62
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:51.060
If I change that to enable password Cisco do show run passio to shown in clear text.

63
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:57.330
So if you are going to use and enabled password and it's recommended that you don't it's recommended

64
00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.830
that you use the service password encryption option to encrypt your passwords.

65
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.530
Cisco still support the enabled password for backward compatibility but it's not something you should

66
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.570
be using in the real world.

67
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.960
Now let's look at a better way of setting security for Enable mode.
