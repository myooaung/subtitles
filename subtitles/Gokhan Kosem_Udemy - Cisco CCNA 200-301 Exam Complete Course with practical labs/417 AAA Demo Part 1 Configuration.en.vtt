00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:09.630
At the moment in this genus 3 topology we can log in to write a one with the user named David and password

2
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:19.600
Cisco the ISIS server however only has a username of admin so once we integrate our one with the ACM

3
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.110
server David will no longer be able to log in.

4
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:31.330
So let's configure or one to talk to the authentication server at the moment.

5
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:39.970
Please note that on the console when we use the command log in we have the option log in enter or carriage

6
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:48.820
return which means that the password on the line is used for authentication or we can specify that a

7
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.210
local username and password database is used for authentication.

8
00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:02.570
One of the first commands we going to use with Triple A is triple A new model.

9
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:10.850
This will enable new access control commands and functions and disable old commands.

10
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.080
So we've entered Triple A new model.

11
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:22.360
Now when we go onto the console and type log in notice the options have changed.

12
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:31.340
Previously we had log in local or log in enter but if we type logging into that doesn't work or log

13
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.540
in local that also doesn't work.

14
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:42.870
So the authentication commands have changed and now we have the options a log in authentication and

15
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.340
we can specify a word or the default option.

16
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:56.190
I'm not going to enter that now by default the authentication used is default and I'll show you where

17
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.350
that's configured in a moment.

18
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:05.290
So all we've done thus far is specify Triple A new model.

19
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.740
We need a local user name and password as backup.

20
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.700
But that was configured previously so we've got two usernames and passwords here.

21
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.970
David and Mary.

22
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.500
So what we'll do now is specify.

23
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:27.420
You could use radius but in this example I'm going to specify attack X host of 10 dot wandered wandered

24
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:41.020
1 that is this AC s server AC a server has an IP address of 10 dot 1 that one dot 1 so as an example

25
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:49.880
ping 10 dot wandered wandered 1 The Roddick and paying the ACA server we need to specify a password

26
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:58.160
that's going to be used for encryption so we use the command techniques server key and then specify

27
00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.160
a password for the encryption or key for the encryption.

28
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:11.120
I'll use Cisco here and now we need to specify Triple A options we have authentication authorization

29
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.280
and accounting.

30
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.850
I'm going to specify authentication.

31
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.980
What are we going to authenticate.

32
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:26.730
In our example we're going to authenticate a log in attempts to the Rada so Triple A authentication

33
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:27.680
log in.

34
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.320
You could also use triple A for PDP sessions.

35
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:39.120
In other words chap or pap or when someone uses the enable command to go to enable mode but she will

36
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.140
simply do it for logging.

37
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.090
We can use a word or default and that's where that default option comes in.

38
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:55.270
Default means that this authentication method is going to be applied to all lines on the router.

39
00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:02.100
That means the console the Exelon report Viti wine lines and Titi wine lines.

40
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.190
We didn't apply authentication on the auxiliary port in this router but by using Triple A it's a lot

41
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:16.290
easier to apply an authentication on every line on the device and not miss some of the lines.

42
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.650
So it's a lot better than doing things locally.

43
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.420
We can then specify what's going to be used for authentication.

44
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:32.280
In our example we want to specify a group which is going to be tax because we're using a tax protocol

45
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:40.560
and then as a backup authentication method we can use local what that means is that if the router is

46
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:48.120
unable to connect to the tax server because the network is down or the server is down a local username

47
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:54.680
and password database will be used as an alternate method for authenticating the user.

48
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.520
Now please note authentication failures to the TAC server.

49
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.700
It doesn't mean that the local database will be used.

50
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:12.240
The local database is only used if the tax server is unavailable so that was the configuration show

51
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.490
run will allow us to see that.

52
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:21.670
So we specified Triple A new model we specified our authentication default method is going gonna be

53
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.270
using tack X and then a local database.

54
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.540
These were configured previously but you would need to configure a local username and password as a

55
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.100
backup.

56
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:42.410
He has our tech X server information and notice on the lines we no longer see a log in local the console

57
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:51.750
is using the default which is to use tactics and if that fails to use a local database so when we try

58
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:59.010
and log back into the router with the user name of David and positive Cisco it works at the moment because

59
00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.910
the router isn't connected to the TAC server.

60
00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:10.440
We still have to configure the TAC server to allow the router to communicate with the TAC server at

61
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.920
the moment.

62
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.450
We have some other devices here but the genius 3 Rodda isn't configured.
