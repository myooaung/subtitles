00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:07.170
Now in networking devices specifically with quality of service we have the concept of trust and a trust

2
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.460
boundary.

3
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.690
Who are you going to trust.

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.050
So as an example if a switch receives a data packet from a P.C. is it going to trust the markings.

5
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.510
If the piece is telling the switch that its traffic is very important.

6
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:30.450
Typically a switch will not trust a P.C. but a switch made trust to the markings from a phone an IP

7
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:37.280
phone as an example will tell a switch by using a marking that its traffic is very important.

8
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.740
A switch needs to be configured to trust that marking from the phone.

9
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.280
So we have this concept of a trust boundary an untrusted domain is the part of the network that you

10
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.290
are not managing.

11
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.180
So it could be a P.C. it could be a printer.

12
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.260
You're not going to trust the marking sent by a user's P.C. from a quality of service point of view.

13
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.240
The trusted domain is the part of the network that only administrators can manage.

14
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.490
So they are trusted devices such as routers and switches and in some cases IP phones.

15
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.480
A broad is going to trust the markings that it receives from a switch and a switch is going to trust

16
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.460
the markings that it receives from an IP phone.

17
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.230
Now the trust boundary is where packets are classified and marked.

18
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.680
So as an example the IP phones are a trust boundary.

19
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.200
We don't trust the markings to the left of the IP phones but we do trust the marking centre between

20
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.100
phones switches and routers so in an enterprise any markings received by any of these devices will be

21
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.110
trusted.

22
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:47.360
A service provider or ISP however may not trust the mocking sent on packets from customers.

23
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.640
So this would be a separate trust boundary.

24
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:58.830
The ISP will trust any markings of packets in its own domain or in its own network that may not trust

25
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.920
the markings sent to it by a enterprise customer in an enterprise network.

26
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.070
The trust boundaries typically the edge of the network for an ISP the trust boundaries typically found

27
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.670
at the Lost device that it manages.

28
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:21.390
So as an example if the ISP provide you a router that it manages the trust boundary is set there and

29
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.630
it will trust any markings of devices that it controls but not markings received from devices that it

30
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.410
doesn't control.

31
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.670
Trust boundaries are important because by default Cisco riders will override any quality of service

32
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.180
markings that they receive on an untrusted boundary.

33
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.160
So foist traffic and video traffic and data traffic will be treated to the same.

34
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:52.140
If you don't remark that traffic in other words if a rider receives traffic on an untrusted interface

35
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.760
it will treat it the same which can have a negative effect on quality of service.
