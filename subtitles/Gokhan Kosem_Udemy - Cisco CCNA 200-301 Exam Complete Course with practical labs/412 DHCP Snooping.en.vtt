00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.940
In a previous video which I've linked here and below I showed you how to set up Kelly or Carly if you

2
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.960
prefer Linux as a DHB server and then implement a man in the middle attack in a topology such as this

3
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:20.310
Kelly Linux is setup as a DHB server to allocate IP addresses to pieces such as Windows 10 host and

4
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:27.600
then set the default gateway to itself so that traffic is sent through the Kelly linux server onto the

5
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.450
Internet and onto other destinations.

6
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.190
That allows us then to implement a man in the middle attack because all traffic is going through Kelly

7
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.070
to other devices in the topology.

8
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.060
Now to stop that from happening we going to set up the switch to use DHB snooping so it's going to snoop

9
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:53.310
or listen in on the HP messages and only allow certain DHB messages from trusted servers.

10
00:00:53.310 --> 00:01:00.240
So the switch will allow clients to request IP addresses but will not allow Kelly or other servers on

11
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.140
untrusted ports to offer IP addresses to clients.

12
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:11.100
We'll setup this interface on the switch as a trusted port so that the writer is able to allocate IP

13
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.010
addresses to the P.C. but Kelly is not able to do that.

14
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.930
Okay so I'm not going to show you practically how to use DHB snooping to stop these kind of attacks

15
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.020
but I've also added some additional information below this video.

16
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.120
There's a PowerPoint presentation that you can download as an example that gives you the commands to

17
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.810
set this up on a switch.

18
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:54.040
Okay so on the windows computer I'm going to open up command prompt so open up a C D prompt IP config

19
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.940
shows me that this is the IP address of the PC at the moment.

20
00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:07.400
Default gateway is 10 1 1 2 5 4 which is the router in the topology on the router show IP interface

21
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.530
brief notice IP address of the router.

22
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:19.500
Is this the right it is configured as a DHB server show IP DHB binding shows me that two IP addresses

23
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.570
have been allocated one to the windows computer and one to Kelly on Kelly as an example.

24
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.500
If I open up a terminal and type I have config.

25
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.920
This is the IP address that's been allocated to the Kelly linux server.

26
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.110
Once again this is the IP address allocated to the P.C. by top IP config slash release to release the

27
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.330
IP address.

28
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.020
I'll make that a bit bigger and then type IP config.

29
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.530
You'll notice that it's not been allocated an IP address.

30
00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:00.150
It's using a link local IP version for address and link local IP version 6 address.

31
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:09.310
But if I type IP config slash renew it should get an IP address from the DHB server and there you go.

32
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:19.800
IP address has been allocated by the router to the windows computer but now let's setup Kelly as a rogue

33
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:27.890
DHB server so to do that I'm going to run Yesenia and use a graphical user interface.

34
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.830
I showed you previously how to use this application and a lot of detail.

35
00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.440
So once again referred to the previous videos if you want to learn more about this application.

36
00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.010
But it's quite simple.

37
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:48.590
All I'm going to do is launch an attack and I'm going to setup a rogue DHB server so I'm going to select

38
00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.070
that option and click Okay.

39
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:59.930
If the IP address of the rogue HP server is going to be the local Kelly linux host which has an IP address

40
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:12.270
of 10 1 1 2 slash 24 now I'll use a different range of IP addresses for hosts that we allocate addresses

41
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.530
to using Kelly.

42
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:21.090
So let's say 100 to 110 release time and renew time all set to 3600 seconds.

43
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.680
Subnet Mask will be a slash 24 mask.

44
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.920
And this is how I can implement a man in the middle attack.

45
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.360
I'm going to set myself as the default gateway.

46
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.550
That means that the host will send traffic to the Kelly linux host which will then forward traffic to

47
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:45.610
the rider so we can implement a man in the middle attack without the user knowing what's going on DNS

48
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:46.000
server.

49
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.760
I'll set to Google and the domain I'll simply set to whom dot com and click Okay.

50
00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:01.660
So if we look at actions list attacks you can see that I'm running a DHEA P rogue server attack.

51
00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:07.970
You can see that the D.A. GP rogue server is currently running so on the client I'm going to release

52
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.770
my IP address again and then renew it.

53
00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:16.160
Now it may get an IP address from the broader rather than from the Kelly linux server.

54
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:25.630
It just depends which device replies first so you can see it got its IP address from the router so on

55
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:35.470
the router I'm going to type no service DHEA P I'm going to disable the DHB service on the router so

56
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.130
show IP DHEA HP binding.

57
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:47.910
You can see that the bindings have been removed from the router so on the P.C. I'll release my IP address

58
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:56.620
and then I'll renew it and let's see if it gets an IP address from the Kelly linux server on Kelly you

59
00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:03.410
can see there's a D HP Discover DHB discovers are being received.

60
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:09.410
Now sometimes this application bombs out or breaks so you have to rerun the DHB server.

61
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:13.840
That's a lesson in hacking you can't expect everything to work the first time.

62
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.050
You gotta be persistent and be tenacious and keep on trying.

63
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:25.470
So now it received a D HP request from the client and it acknowledged it.

64
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.680
In other words when I ran IP conflicts renew again it got an IP address.

65
00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:37.650
Okay so the P.C. has been given an IP address but not previously I had an error here saying unable to

66
00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:43.860
contact your DHB server request timed out the Yasuni application.

67
00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:49.100
Sometimes bombs art especially the graphical user interface it is an alpha release.

68
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.340
That's probably why you want to do stuff through the CSI if you can but to keep things simple I've done

69
00:06:53.340 --> 00:07:01.090
it through the gooey but the net result is that the piece he has been given an IP address from the Kelly

70
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:02.730
linux server.

71
00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.700
That's what we don't want.

72
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.910
Notice the default gateway is Kelly.

73
00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:13.090
That means a man in the middle attack could be used here OK.

74
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.950
So to stop this nonsense.

75
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.580
Now on the switch that the devices connect to.

76
00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.880
I'm going to enable DHB snooping.

77
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.140
This is a layer to switch or is configured as a layer to switch.

78
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.330
It does support other options.

79
00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:34.210
Show IPD HP snooping at the moment DHB snooping is disabled.

80
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.060
There's the command.

81
00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.330
Notice DHB snooping is disabled.

82
00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:46.390
It's not configured on any v lands and it's not operational on any V'landys no interfaces have been

83
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:55.920
configured to be trusted so in global configuration mode I'm simply going to type IP DHEA P snooping

84
00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:00.160
that enables DHB snooping on the switch globally.

85
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.790
But please note that's not how you make it work.

86
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:08.560
This is the first step type the command show IP DHB snooping again.

87
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:15.470
You can see that it's now been globally enabled but it's not enabled on any villains.

88
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:23.060
So don't forget to enable it on the villain and to do that you type IP DHB snooping the villain one

89
00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:29.740
so two commands are required show run pipe include DHEA P.

90
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:37.820
We have now used this command globally as well as this command globally on the switch show IP DHB snooping

91
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:49.320
shows us that DCP snooping is now enabled on VLAN 1 I'll type IP config slash renew on the P.C. now

92
00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:56.990
at this point it's not going to get any IP addresses because we've got DHB snooping enabled the Kelly

93
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.570
linux host won't be able to allocate IP addresses to the P.C. but nor will the router.

94
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:09.110
So to prove that on the broader all enable the DHB service again.

95
00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:20.240
So show run shows us that we've got this DHB people configured this is the network.

96
00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:21.590
This is the default gateway.

97
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:30.110
This is the DNS server but the piece is not getting any IP addresses so IP conflict slash renew notice

98
00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:39.500
no IP address is being allocated show IP DHEA P binding no IP addresses are allocated by the router

99
00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:46.430
and no IP addresses are being allocated by the Kelly Lennox host not to see what's actually going on

100
00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:49.280
we can run a debug on the switch.

101
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:55.120
So let's run debug IPD HP snooping packets so we can see a lot of detail.

102
00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:59.630
Be careful with packets you'll see a lot of detail in the output here.

103
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:11.170
So you may prefer to use events but let's run this again IP config slash Renee notice we seeing a lot

104
00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:12.120
of output.

105
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.600
But what I'll do now is turn off debugging for the moment.

106
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:17.940
We can see

107
00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:26.610
received a new DHEA packet from input interface gigabit 0.

108
00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:30.600
That is the P.C..

109
00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:32.860
It's a Discover message.

110
00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:36.910
Notice the source mac address is this ending in 7.

111
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:43.560
See double zero on the P.C. IP config slash all.

112
00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.460
That is the MAC address of the Windows computer.

113
00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:52.530
So the Windows computers requesting an IP address at least two we can see the source MAC address of

114
00:10:52.530 --> 00:11:01.890
the P.C. destination is a broadcast notice all Fs so hexadecimal FS broadcast at layer 3 destination

115
00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:08.670
is a broadcast IP version 4 source IP address is unknown it doesn't currently have an IP address it's

116
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.360
requesting an IP address.

117
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:20.730
So we've got invalid entry for flooding on ingress of V land one breach output port is null packet is

118
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:27.690
dropped so the switch is essentially just dropping that packet it's not forwarding it anyway to forward

119
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:34.190
that request to the writer on this interface we need to trust this port so we need to make gigabit 00

120
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:43.230
a trusted port so that that DHB requests can be forwarded to the router so on the switch interface gigabit

121
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:53.280
00 that's this interface connecting to the router IP DHEA AP snooping we're going to trust the port

122
00:11:54.920 --> 00:12:07.560
debug IP DHEA AP snooping packet back on the P.C. IP config slash renew let's try and get an IP address

123
00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:17.170
can see a lot happening here but notice right at the bottom of this debug breach packet sent to Port

124
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.850
gigabit 00.

125
00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:28.390
So the DHS P request received by the switch from the C is being forwarded to the router we've got the

126
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:38.320
HP Discover from the P.S. On gigabit 02 asking for an IP address but notice this problem we see here

127
00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:43.330
option 82 option 82 can cause problems.

128
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:49.540
Option 82 is used when you need to forward the HP requests from a writer to a D HP server as an example

129
00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:52.220
and include information such as port numbers.

130
00:12:52.490 --> 00:13:04.560
So if you have problems with that on the switch type no IP DHEA AP snooping information option enter.

131
00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:11.720
So we're not going to forward option 82 information to the writer so let's try that again I P conflict

132
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:12.750
slash renew.

133
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.130
Notice the P.C. now gets an IP address.

134
00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:18.040
So back on the switch.

135
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:21.230
A lot of output in the debug.

136
00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:29.320
So once again the P.C. is requesting an IP address inbound interface is gigabit 0 to the switch sending

137
00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.460
the packet to the rider on gigabit 00.

138
00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.470
The rudder replies back.

139
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:43.320
There's the DHB packet inbound on gigabit 00 we see the router allocating an IP address to the client.

140
00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:50.020
So in the output here we can see that this IP address which is the router is sending a broadcast it's

141
00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:57.010
a broadcast oddly a two broadcast at least three allocating the IP address to the P.C. thus once again

142
00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:02.650
if you remember is the MAC address of the P.C. so the writer has successfully allocated an IP address

143
00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:07.090
to the P.C. the P.C. got to that IP address from the router.

144
00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:14.250
Now it got given 10 1 1 100 because the P.C. will ask for the IP address that it had previously.

145
00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:19.090
Previously it had been given that IP address by the Kelly linux server.

146
00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:24.160
So Windows remembers that information and basically requests that IP address it had before so it got

147
00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:31.030
a different IP address but that IP address is in the pool of IP addresses on the router so you can see

148
00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:39.010
that this IP address was allocated to the P.C. and if we have a look at the DHB pool once again you

149
00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:43.630
can see that the pool is all IP addresses in 10 1 1 0.

150
00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:48.860
So 10 1 1 100 is a valid IP address in that range.

151
00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:49.130
Okay.

152
00:14:49.150 --> 00:15:00.580
So back on the switch let's recap what we configured show run pipe include DHEA P we configured DHEA

153
00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:07.370
P snooping globally on the switch we configured it globally on the veal and 1 so those are global configuration

154
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:08.720
commands.

155
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:17.720
We also stopped option 82 by configuring that globally and then we trusted the gigabit 00 interface

156
00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:20.960
so show run interface gigabit 00.

157
00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:24.980
Notice this interface has been configured as a trusted interface.

158
00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:33.740
Can we should do some show commands to show IPD HBP snooping we can see through the output of this command

159
00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:41.720
that DHB snooping is enabled globally also enabled on VLAN 1 not in other v lines all the devices in

160
00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:51.380
this network on VLAN one gigabit 00 is a trusted interface we are not a rate limiting that interface

161
00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:59.240
but what we may want to do is right limit requests from pieces so we may want a rate limit this interface

162
00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:12.740
and this interface the reason why is on Kelly Linux we could do a DHB P. a denial of service attack

163
00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:21.920
so send a DHB packets and basically just flood the network with a huge amount of DHB requests and that

164
00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.900
can actually kill or cause problems in the network.

165
00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:28.930
It's actually killing the switch so I'll stop that attack.

166
00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:40.390
So actions list attacks and I'll stop the D.A. HP Discover attack because it basically kills the switch.

167
00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:45.400
I'm going to get a huge amount of debug output now because I was running a debug.

168
00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:46.600
It's an important lesson.

169
00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:51.480
Don't leave a debug running and Kelly sent a huge amount of packets to the switch.

170
00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:56.970
So this may take a while so I'll turn off debugging.

171
00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:00.570
Not sure if you saw that about a topic quickly but there it is again unaltered.

172
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:09.980
And what I'll do is on the interface to the Kelly linux server which is gigabit 0 1 all enabled rate

173
00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:10.870
limiting.

174
00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:23.640
So IPD HP snooping the limit rate to 10 packets that means 10 packets per second so we'll rate limit.

175
00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:30.810
This packet generation on Kelly basically stop it from sending too many packets.

176
00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:33.650
So back on the switch.

177
00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:37.020
Notice DCP snooping error disable.

178
00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:42.720
We've received more than 10 DHB packets on gigabit 00 DCP snooping rate.

179
00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.320
Limit is exceeded.

180
00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.660
More packets have been received and what has happened.

181
00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:49.700
The interface has been taken down.

182
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:54.340
So show IP interface brief on the switch.

183
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:55.800
There's the command again.

184
00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:01.530
Notice this interface has gone down because Kelly has sent too many packets

185
00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:09.140
I'll shut it down to manually shut it and then no shut.

186
00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:12.130
And let's see what happens.

187
00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:13.870
It's actually locked up my switch.

188
00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:17.940
Now you can see the CPSU is gone crazy.

189
00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:25.640
Some Kelly all stop that attack.

190
00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:32.320
This is one of the problems using a virtual environments such as Janus 3 or Cisco viral or even G.

191
00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:37.540
The problem is this is not a physical switch so it hasn't got the A6 to forward lots of traffic through

192
00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:44.110
it so you can basically destroy the switch which has happened here but after a while what happened was

193
00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:51.310
the messages displayed KGB snooping ten BHP packets have been received and what has happened now is

194
00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:54.510
the interface is shut down once again.

195
00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:59.440
So show IP interface brief interface has gone down.

196
00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:05.590
So basically what happened is I shut the interface no shut it so many packets were being received from

197
00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:11.410
the Kelly linux host that the switch bombed out our physical switch wouldn't necessarily have that problem

198
00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:18.760
because it's got the ASX then the 10 packet limit kicked in and the port was shut down to protect the

199
00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:19.750
switch.

200
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:26.980
So there was a delay from interface going up see you being hammered by Kelly to the port being shut

201
00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:28.350
down by that command on.

202
00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:32.800
And that's because I'm using a virtual switch rather than a physical switch physical switch with Bolton

203
00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:35.670
ASX would stop this kind of nonsense from happening.

204
00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:39.950
Net result however is that the interface has gone down.

205
00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:42.570
We've protected the network.

206
00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:48.250
So in this video I showed you how to protect a network using DCP snooping I showed you how to stop rogue

207
00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.560
DHB servers on the network.

208
00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:57.880
I showed you how to stop a denial of service attack by Kelly Linux where it sends a whole bunch of HP

209
00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:58.760
messages.

210
00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:05.700
The switch will shut the port down if it receives too many DHB requests in a certain amount of time.

211
00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:09.370
Don't forget option 82 can cause problems like it did here.
