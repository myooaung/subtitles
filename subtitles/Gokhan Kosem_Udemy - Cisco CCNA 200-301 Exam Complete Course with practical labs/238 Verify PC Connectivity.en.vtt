1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I’ll now configure the PCs and make sure that they can ping each other.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So show ip on PC shows no IP address

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and I'm going to set an IP address on this PC of 10.1.1.1

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:26.000
On PC 2 show ip no IP address so ip address 10.1.1.2

5
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and let’s see if the PC can ping each other.

6
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So what you’ll notice is PC 2 is able to ping PC 1, PC 1 is able to ping PC 2.

7
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and just to prove that I’m gonna shut the ports down the routers.

8
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So router 1 int f2/0 shut it down, 2/1 shut it down

9
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
what you’ll notice now is PC 1 is not able to ping PC 2

10
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
if I enable the first interface

11
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
interfaces come up, pings will still be failing

12
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
because Spanning Tree takes time to converge.

13
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So show spanning-tree you can see the port is listening.

14
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
show spanning-tree, port now is forwarding

15
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
so 2/0 is forwarding and pings now succeed.

16
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000
If I enable f2/1 pings are still succeeding.

17
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.000
show spanning-tree this port is in the listening state but this port is forwarding

18
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
but traffic is still going across this 2/0 interface.
