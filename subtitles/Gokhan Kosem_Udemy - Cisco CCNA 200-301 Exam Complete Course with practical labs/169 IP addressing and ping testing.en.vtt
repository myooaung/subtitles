00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let’s start with the access switches.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Switch 3 and switch 4 are not going to do Inter-VLAN routing

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
these are gonna be configured as a layer 2 switches

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000
so I should change the symbol of these switches to be simple Ethernet switches.

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
They are simply going to be layer 2 switches

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
that provide connectivity to the rest of the network.

7
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So change this symbol of both the switches.

8
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
They will have 1 IP address configured

9
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and that IP address is only used for management purposes.

10
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So the IP address configured on the switches is only

11
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
to allow telnet or SSH to the switches for management purposes

12
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
they're not going to do any kind of routing

13
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
user devices shouldn’t typically be able to ping

14
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
telnet or SSH to the access switches.

15
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So on switch 3 conf t int vlan 1

16
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
This is known as a Switch Virtual Interface or SVI

17
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
if I type do show ip int brief on the switch

18
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and scroll down, you can see that the SVI has been created

19
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
but it was shut down previously

20
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
when I did the command show ip int brief

21
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
the SVI interface was not created.

22
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
So by using the command int vlan 1

23
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I've created this Switch Virtual Interface.

24
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So IP address 10.1.100.3 subnet mask is gonna be /24

25
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and I need to no shut the SVI

26
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
because by default its administratively down, type end ping

27
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
before I do a ping sh ip int brief

28
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
notice the interface is now up

29
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
so I should be able to ping myself 10.1.103 and I can.

30
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
So I'll save that config

31
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and then I’ll go to switch 4

32
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
once again sh ip int brief

33
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
no SVI currently exist only the physical interfaces

34
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
int vlan 1 ip address

35
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
In this example, it will be 10.1.104

36
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:44.000
so IP address 10.1.104/24 mask no shut it, save the config

37
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Interface VLAN 1 has come up as you can see over there.

38
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Ping 10.1.100.3 ping succeeds.

39
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
The first ping failed because the switch had to do an arp

40
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
for the MAC address of switch 3

41
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
but notice switch 4 is now able to ping switch 3

42
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and by the same token switch 3 is now able to ping switch 4.

43
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
So that’s a good sign because it means are links are up in a moment

44
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I'll discuss CDP and LLDP or Cisco Discovery Protocol

45
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and Link Layer Discover Protocol

46
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I’ll show you how to check the connections between switches.

47
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
On switch 1 and switch 2

48
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
we need to configure multiple IP addresses

49
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000
one per VLAN because these switches will be doing Inter-VLAN routing.

50
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000
so on switch 1 sh ip int brief

51
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
at the moment no SVIs are configured

52
00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:01.000
so int vlan 1 ip  address 10.1.101.255.255.0 no shut

53
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:17.000
int vlan 10 ip address 10.1.10.1/24 no shut

54
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000
int vlan 20 or int vlan 20 rather

55
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
ip address 10.1.20.1/24 no shut

56
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.000
CTRL Z or CTRL ZED sh ip int brief

57
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:46.000
at the moment only VLAN 1 is up, VLAN 10 and VLAN 20 are down

58
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and that’s because we don’t have any interfaces

59
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
configured in VLAN 10 or VLAN 20

60
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
I’m going to show you in a moment

61
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
how to explicitly configure these ports as trunk ports

62
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and then we should see that those SVI's come up

63
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000
now switch 2, sh ip int brief

64
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:15.000
no SVIs int v int vlan 1

65
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:23.000
ip address 10.1.100.2/24 no shut

66
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:35.000
int vlan 10 ip address 10.1.10.2/24 no shut

67
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:48.000
int vlan 20 ip address 10.1.20.2/24 no shut

68
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000
and sh ip address int brief

69
00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Once again VLAN 1 is up VLAN 10 and VLAN 20 are down

70
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
and that’s once again because when we use the command

71
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
sh int g0/0 switchport as an example

72
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
you’ll notice that the port is configured for VLAN 1

73
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
but no other VLANs have been explicitly configured across this port.

74
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000
The access VLAN is VLAN 1 by default if DTP or Dynamic Trunk Protocol

75
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
doesn’t negotiate with the other side to form a trunk

76
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
trunking a native VLAN is VLAN 1 by default.

77
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:38.000
So we only have interface VLAN 1 up, the other interfaces are down

78
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
but as that's our management VLAN were ok to use that for testing

79
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
so can switch 2 ping switch 1? Yes, it can.

80
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Should be able to ping itself? Which it can, what about switch 3?

81
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Yes, it can. What about switch 4? Yes, it can.

82
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
So we have IP connectivity in our network

83
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
the switches can ping each other

84
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
let’s do another test on switch 1, can it ping itself?

85
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Yes, it can, can it ping switch 2? Yes, it can.

86
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:19.000
switch 3? Yes, it can, switch 4? Yes, it can and I’ll save the config.

87
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
So we’ve configured IP addresses on the switches.

88
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Can this switches ping router 3 which is in the management VLAN?

89
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:39.000
so on switch 1 once again ping 10.1.100.253, 253 rather, yes, it can.

90
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
so switch 1 can ping this IP address of router 3.

91
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Now these routers acting as PCs are gonna be put into separate VLANs.

92
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000
So we'll do the pinging when we configure those devices in a separate VLAN.

93
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
At  the moment we haven’t got VLAN 10 configured properly in the networks

94
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
so we can't test connectivity between our PCs and the switches.
