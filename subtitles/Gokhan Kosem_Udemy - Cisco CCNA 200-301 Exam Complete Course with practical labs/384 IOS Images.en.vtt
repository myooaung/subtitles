The Cisco Iowa is a single file that a Rato will load into RAM when it boots up.

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:17.310
Typically from flash in this example I've connected to an 18 41 router show flash shows us the operating

3
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:27.760
system stored in flash show version shows us that this is the system file that the router is using.

4
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:35.430
So the router loaded this image from flash into RAM and that's the operating system that the rod is

5
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.110
currently using.

6
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.520
Now every operating system has a file system that's used for the organization of files and operating

7
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.750
system will typically store files in a fault system which includes directories and files within directories

8
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.980
in Windows as an example.

9
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.100
You use a backslash to indicate directories.

10
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.840
So as an example in Windows you would ghoti see Colan backslash uses.

11
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:13.290
DAVID In my example desktop to view files on the desktop Linux uses a forward slash for the directory

12
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:20.410
structure on a router once again show flash shows us the flash Diyar or.

13
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.950
Well so shows us the contents of flash.

14
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.300
Notice flash and Ford slash.

15
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:36.940
We also have the Mac directory option so we could create a directory called Test in Flash.

16
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.900
So now when we use the Kamandi are we see this directory called taste which is very similar to what

17
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.510
you typically find in Linux.

18
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:55.570
I could then use the show running Komando Show running conflict command and I could pipe that.

19
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.910
And in this case I could redirect the output to flash

20
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:11.280
test and then let's push it to a file called Show run dot see if g.

21
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:18.550
So now when I use the Kamandi are I see the directory test but I could use the command via our flash

22
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:28.040
test and we can see the show run see if Chief file stored in that directory.

23
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.340
Notice the show flash command not only shows me the root directory but in this case also shows me that

24
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:44.990
file in this directory called test so I noticed Dhia are vs show flesh.

25
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.690
So if you've used Linux this is very similar to Linux commands.

26
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:54.200
Or if you've used C D in Windows it's very similar.

27
00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:03.640
We can read the contents of that fall by using the more command some more flash colon test Ford slash

28
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:12.440
show run C of G and that actually reads the contents of the file in that directory.

29
00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:21.010
So the Cisco IOS provides a feature called the Cisco Iowas integrated file system or Cisco efface.

30
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.680
This system allows you to create navigate and manipulate directories on a Cisco device.

31
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.330
The directories that are available are dependent on the platform that you are using false systems that

32
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.530
you'll come across include flash memory file contents as I've demonstrated.

33
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:44.180
You also have network false systems such as TFT or trivial file transfer protocol RCP or remote copy

34
00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:52.090
and file transfer protocol or if DP You also have other places where you can write data such as in the

35
00:03:52.090 --> 00:04:00.020
RAM so a Cisco device could have a USP flash it could have flash memory on the motherboard.

36
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.460
It could have RAM NV RAM and DP.
