In this video we're going to discuss the Enable and secret passwords on Cisco devices.

2
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:13.220
In this example I have a Cisco router and when I hit Enter I'm taken to user mode and then I can type

3
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.730
enable Which takes me immediately to enable or privilege mode.

4
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.020
There is no authentication at all.

5
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.290
I'm immediately able to start configuring the router from a security point of view.

6
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.930
That's a really bad idea when someone connects to the console of a router or switch.

7
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:41.150
You typically want to have a password configured so that that person is not able to go from the user

8
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:47.200
mode to the Enable or privilege mode without some type of security.

9
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:54.170
It's very risky to have a router configured without some type of us any cation.

10
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.670
Now in this example ingenius three it works a little bit differently.

11
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.330
Vibratos take you to privilege mode immediately.

12
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:11.110
So I'm going to open up a console to this Cisco router running in Janissary And I'm told that I can

13
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.750
press enter to get started and I'm taken to privilege mode immediately.

14
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:27.060
So if I type exit and hit enter notice I'm taken to privilege mode straight away on a real Cisco router.

15
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:36.020
So a physical router you can see in this example that I'm using a 12:32 when I type exit and then hit

16
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.750
enter.

17
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.340
I'm taken to user mode not privilege mode and then I need to be able to go to privileged mode.

18
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:51.720
Now apart from that you can test the entire lab on Jena's 3 because you can type disable and then type

19
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.390
enable.

20
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.730
And that takes you from user mode to privilege mode once again.

21
00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:05.700
So the issue here is that when you connect to real routers via the console you can gain access to the

22
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.010
router without entering a password.

23
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.420
So we want to change this and add some type of security.
