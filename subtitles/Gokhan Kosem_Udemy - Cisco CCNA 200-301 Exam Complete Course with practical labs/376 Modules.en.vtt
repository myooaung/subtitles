00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:09.690
For example this 40 400 series router may have modules installed such as in this bottom example or may

2
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.300
not have modules installed.

3
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.620
So when the route boots up it's got to determine what interfaces it has inserted what modules are available

4
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.790
how much RAM is available and various other components.

5
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.550
You could even install a UCSC survey into a rodded today.

6
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.550
So when the rocket boots up it needs to determine what's physically installed and available on the router.

7
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:42.210
So the power on self test will test the basic functionality of the rod hardware to determine whether

8
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.760
it's working determined whether it's supported and determine which components are present.

9
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:57.570
As an example you may have mistakenly inserted a voice interface card into wanting to face card slot

10
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:05.160
voice interface cause of Vicks may need to be inserted into specific modules and you may have inserted

11
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.660
the wrong card into the wrong module on a router so it needs to do this power on self-test to determine

12
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:18.000
what's installed and where the things are installed correctly and working correctly.

13
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.540
Run monitor includes a low level operating system that is used for troubleshooting possible recovery

14
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.810
and testing.

15
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.440
This is different to the standard Rato operating system and doesn't support routing.

16
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.750
You could use Ramona's as an example to download a router operating system.

17
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.560
If there's none available on the router or you could use Romagna to do a password recovery which I'll

18
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.270
demonstrate in this course.
