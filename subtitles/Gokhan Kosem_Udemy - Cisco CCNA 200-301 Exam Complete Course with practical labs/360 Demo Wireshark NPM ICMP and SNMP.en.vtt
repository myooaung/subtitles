00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:06.320
Something to point out in the ICMP message NPM is inserting data.

2
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:15.600
So the NPM server 10 1 100 100 is sending an echo request but he's including data in the message NPM

3
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.330
does this by default.

4
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.760
And one of the reasons for doing this is that some devices between your enemies and the device that

5
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.570
you pinging may block ICMP packets with certain criteria in the data fields.

6
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:37.530
Some firewalls as an example may block packets with a zero sized data field and some firewalls will

7
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:45.150
block packets with large payloads some devices even block ICMP packets that are even or odd in size

8
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:53.640
in this capture we can see that the response packet was sent from Rodda to to the end a mess.

9
00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:00.990
So it's an ICMP echo reply message and the NHS will calculate the difference between the time that the

10
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:09.570
request was sent and the reply received and it uses that to calculate the round trip response time or

11
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.740
latency of the network.

12
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.950
Now he has an SMP message once again from the network management station.

13
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.380
In other words NPM to Rodda to 10:01 102.

14
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.670
You can see this is an SMP message and isn't it uses UDP.

15
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:37.190
Or use a datagram protocol which is a connection protocol unlike TZP UDP doesn't provide reliability

16
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.970
in the same way that TZP does.

17
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:46.610
You'll also notice that the ports port 1 6 1 so the network management station is communicating with

18
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:55.520
the Rodda on destination port 1 6 1 and the rodders replying back from port 1 6 1 to the ephemeral or

19
00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.070
random port number that was chosen by the end a mess for this connection it's important to remember

20
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:09.850
that UDP port 161 is the destination port that the mass initiate sessions too.

21
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:19.840
In other words the NMSL NPM in this case is going to be initiating sessions to routers on port 161.

22
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:29.960
You need to ensure that your firewalls all access lists or ACLC permit or allow UDP port 161 from the

23
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.630
mess to the devices that are being monitored.

24
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.820
And the reverse traffic also needs to be permitted.

25
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.220
You may even want to configure devices to use a non-default port for SMP.

26
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:51.700
So rather than using the default port of 161 you may choose to use a nother port number like 10000 161.

27
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.490
You would configure that on the device and you would also need to configure that on NPM So knows which

28
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:07.130
port number to use to connect to that device for monitoring in both the House and AP get S&amp;P request

29
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:18.390
as well as the response you'll see the ID values and move information that NPM is getting from the device.

30
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.170
So in the request we can see that the values are null and in the reply we can see the actual values

31
00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.740
for those IDs.

32
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:34.000
We'll explore that in more detail in a separate video where we discuss over IDs maps and other options.
