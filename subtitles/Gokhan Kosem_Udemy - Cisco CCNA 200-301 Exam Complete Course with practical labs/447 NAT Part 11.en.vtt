In this example I have three rodders Rodda one Ratatouille and rotas three wrote a one and write a two

2
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:15.930
on the inside network and Ratatouille connected to artistry on the outside or Internet link.

3
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:22.770
Now typically with static network address translation you are allowing a device on the outside to access

4
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.670
a device on inside.

5
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:36.290
In this example I'm using routers but typically Rato one would actually be a server of some description.

6
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:46.500
So in your minds I think of this as a server and think of this device on the bright as a computer or

7
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:55.350
client and router 3 Our client is trying to access the server hosted on the inside network.

8
00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.370
Now in the lab I'm going to leave these as roads but when thinking about this think of Route One being

9
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:10.080
a server and Rodda 3 being a PC and router 3 is trying to access Rotto one on the inside network.
