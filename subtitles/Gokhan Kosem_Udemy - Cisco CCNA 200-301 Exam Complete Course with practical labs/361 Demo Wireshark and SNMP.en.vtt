00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.990
Now he has an SMP message once again from the network management station.

2
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.250
In other words NPM to Rodda to 10:01 102.

3
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.530
You can see this is a nascent Impey message.

4
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:23.870
And S&amp;P uses UDP or use a datagram protocol which is a connection with protocol unlike TZP UDP doesn't

5
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.970
provide reliability in the same way that TZP does.

6
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.950
You'll also notice that the Porto's Pt. 1 6 1.

7
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:38.330
So the network management station is communicating with the Rodda on destination port 1 6 1 and the

8
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:45.620
rodders replying back from port 1 6 1 to the ephemeral or random port number that was chosen by the

9
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.210
end a mess.

10
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:55.110
For this connection it's important to remember that UDP port 161 is the destination port that the.

11
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.660
And a mess.

12
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.810
Initiate sessions too.

13
00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:08.350
In other words the NMSL NPM in this case he's going to be initiating sessions to routers on port 161.

14
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:17.970
You need to ensure that your firewalls all access lists are ACLC permit or allow UDP port 161 from the

15
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:24.120
mess to the devices that are being monitored and the reverse traffic also needs to be permitted.

16
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.990
You may even want to configure devices to use a non-default port for SMP.

17
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:39.610
So rather than using the default port of 161 you may choose to use a nother port number like 10000 161.

18
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:46.520
You would configure that on the device and you would also need to configure that on NPM So knows which

19
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:55.160
port number to use to connect to that device for monitoring in both the House and AP get an S&amp;P request

20
00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:05.090
as well as the response you'll see the ID values and maybe information that NPM is getting from the

21
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.420
device.

22
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.200
So in the request we can see that the values are null and in the reply we can see the actual values

23
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.770
for those IDs.

24
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:22.180
We'll explore that in more detail in a separate video where we discuss IDs maps and other options.
