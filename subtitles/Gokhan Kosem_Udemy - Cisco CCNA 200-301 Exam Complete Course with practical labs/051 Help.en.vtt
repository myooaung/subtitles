00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now there’s a lot of help available to you, in the Cisco Command Line Interface

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
or CLI, the first one to remember is context sensitive help.

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Don’t forget that question mark is your friend.

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
When in doubt, use the question mark to help you,

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
it’s one of the best places to start.

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Type part of the command and press ? to view  the various options available to you.

7
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It’s important that you use the ? before asking or looking

8
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
for help elsewhere because invariably it’s gonna help you

9
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and don’t forget to read the messages on the screen.

10
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Look at console errors that you receive, this will display for example

11
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
incomplete commands or incorrect commands.

12
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I’ve shown a few of those already, if you don’t complete a command as an example.

13
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The router will warn you, if you type the incorrect command

14
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
the router will warn you about that.

15
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So in these example, I’ve got cmd prompt open on my windows machine

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and I’m gonna telnet to my Cisco router.

17
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So I’m gonna telnet to the IP address of the router.

18
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I’m gonna log in with my password, sh ver

19
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
shows me that this is an 1841 Cisco router running advance IP services.

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
You can see here that it's an 1841 and if I use question mark once again

21
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
notice I can see the various options available to me.

22
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
If I type conf t notice I'm told that invalid input is detected at the current marker.

23
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
If I try and type router ? notice I'm told that this is an unrecognized command.

24
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
If I type e question mark (e ?) notice I get the options enable or exit.

25
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
en question mark (en?) I get the option enable.

26
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000
en space question mark (en ?) I can run enable at different privileged levels.

27
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
15 are full privileges which will allow me to do anything on the router.

28
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
carriage return is enter, so I’m gonna do that option, in this example I’m told to enter

29
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
an enable password, so a password has been configured on this router

30
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
which requires me to enter it before going to enable or privilege mode.

31
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So I put my password in, lets use this command clock

32
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
it's quite a nice one to show you the options.

33
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So if I type clock enter, incomplete command, see question mark

34
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
clock is one of the options but if I type c enter, I’m told that it's an ambiguous command.

35
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
cl question mark (cl?) there are still 2 matching entries clear or clock.

36
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
clo tab, a command can now auto complete, question mark.

37
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I’ve got 3 options here, if I hit enter incomplete command.

38
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Up key or ctrl p to get the previous command back, question mark so I’m gonna use set

39
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
as the option, question mark again, in this example I'll set it to 20:00:00 hours

40
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and I'll set it to the first of July 2015 question mark.

41
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Notice at this point I can hit carriage return

42
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
if I get rid of the year and hit enter I’m told that's an incomplete command.

43
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Notice the question mark helps me at every step of the way

44
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
it’s a good skill to learn, to use question mark and tab.

45
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000
so if I type c here, tab doesn’t work, co tab doesn’t work, con tab doesn’t work

46
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
conf now I get configure, question mark

47
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
You want terminal, press tab, so t tab completes the command

48
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Question mark tells me carriage return. Now I’m in global config mode.

49
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Router question mark, various routing protocols are available

50
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
let's choose ospf and hit enter.

51
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
I'm told it’s not a complete command. I need to specify a process id.

52
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Now I can hit enter or carriage return, now I’m taken to config router mode.

53
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Question mark shows me lots of options available within OSPF.

54
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
let’s go for network

55
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
I need to put my network command in.

56
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
if I enter it as just 10, I'm told that it's incomplete, if I make a crazy

57
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
network like that, I'm told it's unrecognized command, so it needs to be valid

58
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
I need to put my wildcard mask in, OSPF uses what’s called an inverse mask.

59
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
I’m told to put my area in, if I don’t, I'm told it’s an incomplete command.

60
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Hit enter now, incomplete command, so I have to say area and then specify

61
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000
an area and hit enter, control Zed, takes me back to privilege mode.

62
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
The point is get used to using the question mark.

63
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Remember that some commands are valid but you have to be in the right mode.

64
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.000
So if I type, router ospf 1 in privilege mode, that is not an accepted command.

65
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
I'm in the wrong mode.

66
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Initially it may be confusing, you believe you're typing a correct command

67
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
but the router doesn’t accept it, make sure you're in the right mode.

68
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
So just because a command is not accepted doesn’t mean

69
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
the command is incorrect, it could simply mean that you’re in the wrong mode.

70
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
So check your mode, use question mark to help you and try again.
