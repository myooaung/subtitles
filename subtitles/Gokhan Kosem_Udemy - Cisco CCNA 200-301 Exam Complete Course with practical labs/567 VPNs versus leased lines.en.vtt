00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.580
Now as mentioned VPN or virtual private networks have replaced a lot of deployments of leased lines

2
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.590
but you'll still find them.

3
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.900
They've been around for a very long time.

4
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:18.560
And depending where you on the world this may be the only way to get a high speed connection to a business

5
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.750
site.

6
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.560
Now because these have been around a long time and have been used in various parts of the world they

7
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.210
often referred to with different terms or different names.

8
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:35.030
So the first term is a leased line which once again implies that you are leasing the line from a provider

9
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.600
you don't own the connection you are paying a monthly fee.

10
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.160
In other words a monthly leasing fee to lease the line from the service provider which would typically

11
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.400
be a telephone company or telco such as AT&amp;T or British Telecom.

12
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.030
So some terms that you may come across include leased circuit or leased line.

13
00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.800
These terms are often used interchangeably.

14
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:06.800
A circuit refers to the actual electrical circuit between the two endpoints in the old days we used

15
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:13.830
to have circuit switch networks where you'd make a telephone call between two sites and use an analog

16
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.560
modem to send traffic between those two sites.

17
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:25.410
So it was a circuit that was established for the duration of your telephone call a leased line however

18
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:33.090
is a dedicated circuit between two sites so you don't have to make a call to send data across it.

19
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.380
It's a permanent point to point connection between the two sites.

20
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.370
You may also come across the term serial link or serial line.

21
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.220
Once again these are used interchangeably and mean the same thing.

22
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:54.120
The term serial in this case refers to the fact that the bits sent across the wire flow serially and

23
00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:01.170
that is used serial interfaces to make the connection a point to point link or point to point at least.

24
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:08.760
Line refers to the fact that you are making the connection between two points rather than between multiple

25
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.140
sites at the same time.
