00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.560
This is one of multiple videos that help you troubleshoot CCMA scenarios in preparation for the CCMA

2
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.950
exam.

3
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:28.160
We've been told that P.S. 1 on the left in this topology is unable to ping P.S. 2 in this topology I'm

4
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:35.550
using genus 3 and Cisco Iowa's v routers as rather one and Robert T.

5
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.950
And to mimic the pieces in the topology

6
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:49.080
and don't trust a user when they tell you something as Ronald Reagan said Trust but verify we've been

7
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:55.340
told that P.S. One is not able to ping P.S. 2 and we verified that that's true.

8
00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.830
Notice we're getting a U in the output which means that the traffic is being forwarded to a router and

9
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:11.850
that Rondo doesn't know what to do with a traffic now to ensure that trace route runs quickly.

10
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:19.710
All disable IP domain lookup and then we'll run a trace right to PCI to notice that traffic is getting

11
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.390
to write a one but is not going any further.

12
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:31.830
So it looks like there's a problem on road or one en route to one show IP road show ip route shows us

13
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.160
that the only routes in the routing table are directly connected networks and the local IP addresses

14
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.170
on the router because this is a remote network.

15
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.320
We need to run routing protocols on Route 1 and wrote a 2 to exchange runs.

16
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:56.060
So rather one needs to learn about network 10 1 2 3 0 from router 2.

17
00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:03.280
So on Route 1 show IP protocols are we running a routing protocol.

18
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:13.090
And the answer is yes we are we're running 0 SPF 0 SPF is enabled in area 0 on gigabit 00 and in aerial

19
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.130
one on gigabit.

20
00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.890
0 1 so show IP 0 SPF neighbor.

21
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:30.890
We don't have any neighbor relationships though show IP or SPF interface brief 0 SPF is enabled on gigabit

22
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:38.250
0 0 in area 0 and it's enabled on gigabit 0 1 in Area 1.

23
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.930
So rather one looks good.

24
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:40.620
What about right.

25
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:51.000
To show IP protocols we are running 0 SPF on wrote a 2 but can you spot the problem.

26
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.790
You should be able to see it in the output of this command to help you show IP SPF interface brief notice

27
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:07.820
or SPF is not running on any interfaces on Robert 2 Why is that.

28
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.330
Look at this output.

29
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:20.400
Its routing for networks 10 dot 1 0 0 0 0 0 255.

30
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.940
This means there's an exact match on the first 3 octet.

31
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.510
In other words 0 SPF is only running on Network 10 1 0 0.

32
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.660
Do we have any interfaces in that network show IP interface brief.

33
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.860
No we don't.

34
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.190
We have an IP address configured as follows and one configured as follows.

35
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:55.540
0 SPF is not running on any interfaces on this rather show run pipe section or SPF that allows us to

36
00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.130
view the SPF configuration so SPF has been configured.

37
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:08.820
But notice the network command has been configured incorrectly so rudder or SPF 1.

38
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.650
No

39
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.740
network 10 1 0 0.

40
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:25.200
The command should be 10 1 0 0 0 0 255 255.

41
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:31.540
Now you don't have to do it that way but that's one of the options noticed Suddenly.

42
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.140
A neighbour relationship is established.

43
00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.610
Let's have a look at the output against the show IPO SPF interface.

44
00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.970
Let's rather do a brief because that's too much output.

45
00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:48.730
Notice Oh SPF has now enabled on both interfaces of Robert to show IP protocols.

46
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.800
This looks a lot better.

47
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.610
Show IP who SPF.

48
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.510
NEIGHBOUR.

49
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.720
NEIGHBOUR relationship is established to write a one show IP round.

50
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:10.100
We have an entire area right on road a two to Network 10 1 1 0 and on Route 1 show IP 0 SPF neighbor.

51
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:15.230
We have a neighbour relationship to 10 1 3 1 show IP rot.

52
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.640
We have learnt a rod through a whisper.

53
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.500
Now notice it's not an entire area rot.

54
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.420
The rot is in the writing table but it's showing as an intra area rot.

55
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.830
Whereas this rot.

56
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.860
Is an entire area rot.

57
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:36.210
Ken P.S. 1 pain P.S. to answer is yes.

58
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.700
So this is a decision that you would need to make based on your design.

59
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:51.500
Show IP protocols on Route 1 shows us that 0 SPF has 1 interface gigabit 0 0 in areas 0.

60
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.220
That's fine.

61
00:05:53.220 --> 00:06:05.870
This interface is an area one where as on route to we have both interfaces in area zero so the network

62
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:06.720
works.

63
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.780
But perhaps you want to do it this way.

64
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.770
So Radha who SPF 1.

65
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.050
Network 10 1 2 0.

66
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.610
And do it more explicitly and then network 10 1.

67
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.390
3 0.

68
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.820
I'll show you the output in a moment if you weren't sure about what I was typing.

69
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:40.580
So show run section of SPF we have to network commands configured this network is an area zero based

70
00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:46.120
on this command and this network is in Area 2.

71
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:51.680
Based on this command show IP SPF neighbour.

72
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.590
Neighbour relationship is established.

73
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:59.160
We have an entire area right on Road at 2 and on Route 1.

74
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:05.260
We now see an entire area Route 10 1 3 0 slash 24.

75
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:09.300
In other words this network

76
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:21.630
is in area 0.

77
00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:22.950
This is area 2

78
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:28.700
and this is area 1

79
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:39.120
it's important that you update your documentation and make sure that you configure your network correctly

80
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:45.540
per the documentation so to confirm that show IP protocols.

81
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.720
This is correct.

82
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.530
Its area 0.

83
00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.200
This is also correct.

84
00:07:50.290 --> 00:08:01.730
That's area 1 show IP protocols en route to output looks as follows this network 10 1 2 0 is an area

85
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:05.560
0 and this one is an area 2.

86
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:12.820
Now the reason why we have a difference in the output is notice the interfaces on Rider 2 don't have

87
00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:15.170
a SPF commands on them.

88
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:23.410
We enabled 0 SPF in the writing process using the network command where as en route a 1

89
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:35.380
0 SPF was enabled on the interfaces individually and not under the 0 SPF process.

90
00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:41.310
Both methods work in IP version 4 in IP version 6.

91
00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:48.780
You need to use this method to enable 0 SPF on individual interfaces so that's an example of how to

92
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.500
troubleshoot 0 SPF.

93
