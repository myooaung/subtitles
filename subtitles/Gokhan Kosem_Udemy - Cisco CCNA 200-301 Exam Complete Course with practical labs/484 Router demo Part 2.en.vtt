00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:03.510
He could also match on other values.

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:14.400
So notice you could match on IP precedents and specify values such as 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 or 7.

3
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.640
These values also have names.

4
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:25.990
So as an example if I specify three here and then type two show run notice it shows up as three.

5
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.180
But I could also specify flash.

6
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.710
That's also a valid way to match.

7
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:42.590
That's very similar to using port twenty three or the word telnet in an access list so you can either

8
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.280
use the word or the number to specify the traffic that you're going to match on

9
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.330
notice we also have a cause value that we can match on so we could specify a car's value of five.

10
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.040
There are many other options available here.

11
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.020
So match and let's say application.

12
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:10.160
And here we can match on specific applications such as RTP or H3 2 3.

13
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:18.570
We can use network based application recognition to match on higher level protocols so rather than just

14
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.780
matching on layer two or layer three we could match on higher layers of the OSA model.

15
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:32.840
We can also match NPL s values so we can match experimental values in the range 0 to 7.

16
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.180
So as an example we could match experimental value 5.

17
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.860
Now once you've matched on traffic you need to do something with it.

18
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:50.400
So you either need to privatize it or rate limited or queue it or delay it or drop it as an example.

19
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.840
And that's what some of the other mechanisms do on rudders and switches.

20
00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:01.370
Once you've classified or matched on traffic What are you going to do with that traffic as an example

21
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.740
if you've got a first class boarding ticket you may go to the left door but if you've got an economy

22
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.020
class ticket you go to the right door and you get a different quality of service and a different experience

23
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.180
based on the ticket that you hold.
