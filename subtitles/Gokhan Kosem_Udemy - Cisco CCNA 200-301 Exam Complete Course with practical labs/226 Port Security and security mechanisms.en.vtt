Port security is one of a multiple security mechanisms that you can implement in a network security

2
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.600
is kind of like a castle of old has shown here.

3
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.590
The idea is is that you have multiple security mechanisms that in of themselves don't provide total

4
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:26.630
security but each layer of security or each mechanism adds a another level of security.

5
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:33.140
So in this example you'd have to get across the sea to get to those castle then you'd have to scale

6
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.720
the outer wall and you still not at the core of the castle.

7
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:45.170
You'd have to climb up this hill and then scale the inner wall to be able to get to the king in the

8
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.740
castle as an example.

9
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.330
So insecurity security implement multiple walls or mechanisms to make it harder for a hacker to attack

10
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.430
your network.

11
00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.180
This also applies to users who inadvertently or without being malicious do something that they shouldn't

12
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.330
do on your network.

13
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.090
So port security isn't a catch all security mechanism.

14
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:13.850
It's just one of many and provides a basic or entry level security mechanism to your network Ethernet.

15
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.780
Once again has no security built into it a user could simply plug a laptop into your network and gain

16
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.530
full access to the network.
