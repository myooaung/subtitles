00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Link state routing protocols however also have drawbacks or disadvantages

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the first disadvantage is that they have a greater demand for resources

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
than distance vector routing protocols do.

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Link state routing protocols require more memory

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the routers have multiple tables

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
so for example, they’ll have a peer table or neighbor table

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
they’ll have a topology table or Link State Database also called LSDB database

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and they have a routing table.

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
More memory is required to hold multiple tables

10
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
then would be necessary with a distance vector routing protocol.

11
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000
There’s also more demand on the CPU of the router or switch when running OSPF or ISIS.

12
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The Dijkstra algorithm can be very process intensive

13
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
especially when there are a lot of changes in the topology.

14
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Link state routing protocols also requires strict designs

15
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000
in OSPF as an example, area 0 is always required when you have more than 1 area.

16
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
All other area have to touch the backbone area or area 0.

17
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
All traffic from 1 area to another area has to traverse the backbone area.

18
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The configuration of OSPF is, therefore, more complex

19
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
than distance vector routing protocol such as RIP.

20
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
However, the advantages of link state routing protocols generally far out way

21
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
the disadvantages and this is especially true in large environments.

22
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Thus in large topologies, OSPF is seen as a much better choice than RIP.
