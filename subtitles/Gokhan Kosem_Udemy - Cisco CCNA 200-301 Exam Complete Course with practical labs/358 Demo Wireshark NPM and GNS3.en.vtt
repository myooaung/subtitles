00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.390
In this lab I've got three Cisco routers running with ingenius three connected to a switch which in

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.970
turn has NPM connected to it.

3
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:19.640
Here's my NPM server and as an example I can ping 10 1 100 1 which is Rotto one on Broadway one is an

4
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:29.120
example I can type debug IP see ICMP and back on NPM when a ping then an IP address I'm getting echo

5
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.030
replies sent on the Rodda.

6
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:39.890
So the Rodda is receiving the ICMP messages from the NPM server.

7
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.860
So log in under node's Cisco.

8
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.700
I can see that I have three routers currently up.

9
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:56.820
Says an example wrote a one with IP address 10:01 101 is shown is up and I can see some information

10
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.040
about that device.

11
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:06.960
Now ingenius 3 I'm going to start capturing on the link from NPM to the switch I'll capture traffic

12
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.630
on the switch interface.

13
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:20.410
What I'd like to point out is notice ICMP messages from NPM the server has an IP address of 10 1 100

14
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.410
100.

15
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.010
That's what we are seeing as the source in the Why Shock capture.

16
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.690
So echo ping request.

17
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.820
And then he has a response from the router.

18
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:41.540
So as an example I could filter for ICMP messages and what we can see here is an example is ICMP message

19
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.160
from NPM to router to and Rodda to replying.

20
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.670
It can also do a search for SMP.

21
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.730
So in this example we've got an S&amp;P message from NPM to Rotto 3.

22
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.260
Opening that up we can see it's a data request message.

23
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.660
It's trying to get this I.D. information.

24
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:10.210
A response back from the Rodda more response information sent back notice o id information.

25
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:17.580
So in the background NPM is requesting information from the road as in this example it's queering Rodek

26
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.680
to and Rodek to is responding here it's queering Rodda 3 and so forth and so on that information is

27
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:34.400
then displayed in a nice graphical format on the NPM server as an example of a click and Rotto one I

28
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.520
can see information about this device.

29
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:46.100
I can see that it's up seats IP address see other information including the SSAs object id lost to boot.

30
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:54.480
I could even click on the telnet link and launch a telnet application to telnet to directly to the device.

31
00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.350
That would require a telnet client enabled on my PC.

32
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:07.470
Scrolling down I can see as an example that the polling method is used for those devices and MP and

33
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.880
the polling interval is 120 seconds.

34
00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.160
I can see as an example to interfaces and the state of those interfaces we can see other information

35
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:26.400
about the device including that it was rebooted Let's have a look at rowdier to see his router to we

36
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.050
can see information about the node.

37
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.780
Once again that it's up we can see that it's being polled with an MP we can see the interfaces once

38
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:35.200
again.

39
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:43.060
So let's have a look at cereal 0 0 in this case we can see the utilization isn't very high on the thing

40
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.380
to face because no traffic is being sent.

41
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:53.260
And we can see that the interface is up to a router to interface serials 0 slash 0.

42
00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:01.890
That's the interface that we're looking at in NPM or shut the interface down interface has gone down.

43
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.770
I'll click poll and now.

44
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.800
And as you can see the interface is being shut down.

45
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.780
That interface has gone down in Wireshark.

46
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:20.310
We can see that a message was sent from NPM to the router and the router then responded with information

47
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.080
about the IDs on the device.

48
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.890
So let's do that again.

49
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.160
What I'll do is restart the capture.

50
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:37.060
We're going to search for Asen MP and I'm going to specify an IP address Tennet wondered one hundred

51
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:44.530
or two so we can see requests from the management station and then responses back from the Rodda.

52
00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.390
What I'll do now is no shut the interface so bring it up.

53
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:55.010
So I'm bringing up serial 0 0 back in the management interface.

54
00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:05.430
I'll click poll now and notice there are no values for different IDs and now responses are coming back

55
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.350
from the Rodda poll again interface's up.

56
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.270
So that was done previously.

57
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:20.920
So the NPM device is able to retrieve status information of network interfaces by using SMP.

58
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:28.110
We can see for instance the speed of the interface utilization and other options on the interface of

59
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.930
the Rodda all running within Jena's 3.
