00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:19.300
This is one of multiple IP addressing and submitting scenarios rather than just working out the subnets

2
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.880
for a scenario.

3
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:28.330
We can work them out and then configure the devices so that we can practically design and configure

4
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.480
a Cisco IP network.

5
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.400
OK so now that we've worked out the subnets we need to configure the devices in our network.

6
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:45.760
Let's assume that these switches are Layer 2 switches the local area networks need to support up to

7
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:52.580
60 hosts including an IP address allocated to the switches and the routers.

8
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:59.590
So let's start with a one on the first Ethan and interface.

9
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.910
I'm going to shut the interface.

10
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:11.170
We need to configure an IP address so 1 2 1 6 8 1 and this is why subsetting is so important.

11
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.530
What address are we going to allocate to the Rodda.

12
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.920
So the network we are using is 1 2 1 6 8 1.0 slice 26.

13
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.910
So let's see we want to use the last IP address for the router.

14
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.500
What is the first IP address and last IP address in the subnet.

15
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.440
So therefore addresses that we need to think about we need to think about the subnet address thats 1

16
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.690
on 2 1 6 8 1 0 is like 26.

17
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.380
Then we need to work out the first IP address.

18
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:52.610
Well first host that can be allocated then we need to work out the last IP address and we need to work

19
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.530
out what the broadcast address is.

20
00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:04.780
So we already have the subnet address to work out the first IP address what you do is you set all binary

21
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.760
bits to 0 in the host portion except for the last bit.

22
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.640
So if you look at this that equates to 1 in decimal.

23
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.220
So the first host will be 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 1 slice 26

24
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.660
is our subnet.

25
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:36.700
Is our first host to work out to the last address in the subnet you fold the host portion only the host

26
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.440
portion with binary ones.

27
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:46.740
Except for the last but which is set to binary 0.

28
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:54.010
So notice the host portion is fulled with binary ones except for the last but.

29
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.400
So what does this equal.

30
00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:08.140
Its 32 plus 16 which is 48 plus 8 which is 56 plus 4 which is 60 plus 2 which is 62.

31
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.900
So that equals 62 slash 26.

32
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.600
And what is the broadcast address equal to.

33
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.910
Now talk about easier ways to work this out but lets work it out as follows.

34
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:30.600
So to work out the broadcast what you do is you fool the host portion with binary ones and that will

35
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:39.090
give you 63 slash 26 so you can either count up all these bets or you do it in reverse.

36
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.580
You say it's 255 minus 128 minus 64.

37
00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.010
This is why it's good to have this in the exam.

38
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:53.420
So when you go to the exam write this stone so that you can work out the values.

39
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:58.330
So this address is a cost address so we can't allocate that to the Rodda.

40
00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.780
But what we can do is allocate the last IP address to the Rodda.

41
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:13.290
So the routing needs to be configured as 1 to 1 6 8 1 62 and the mosque is 2 4 5 2 4 5 2 for 5 1.

42
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:29.150
Remember the mosque is 2:55 255 255 192 IP address again is 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 62 which is what we've configured

43
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.870
on the router.

44
00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.620
So I can press enter.

45
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:41.430
So we've now configured the router and as an example we should be able to paying ourselves which we

46
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.940
can and if we're paying 63 that is actually a broadcast

47
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.130
so show IP interface Fost.

48
00:04:53.140 --> 00:05:03.730
Ethan It was 0 0 notice the Rotty is configured as follows IP addresses 1 9 2 1 6 8 162 slushed 26.

49
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:11.840
This is all hostes on my quick approved cost but this is a local subnet to provide cost.

50
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:18.430
So again show run interface if serious slash if there is zero there is our configuration.

51
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.320
Now we need to configure the hosts

52
00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:34.620
and let's assume that we are going to configure the first host using the first IP address in the subnet.

53
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.930
So it's 1 9 2 1 6 8 1

54
00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:46.280
so it needs to be configured as 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 1 slashed 26.

55
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:59.640
So 1.1 some of that mosque is 2 4 5 2 5 2 for 5 or 92 default gateway is 62 and all set the DNS to the

56
00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:10.220
default gateway click safe lets start up that host and open up a console to the host.

57
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.290
So here it is.

58
00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:18.170
I have config is zero IP address of the host is configured as follows.

59
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.790
Mosque is set to the following.

60
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:27.390
So Ping 1 on 2 1 6 8 1 2 1 and ping itself can we ping the router.

61
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.100
Yes we can.

62
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:35.380
Not to prove that we could do de-bug IP ICMP and ping from the host to the router.

63
00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:40.860
You can see the pings are succeeding and we are getting it debug on the router.

64
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:41.990
Turn off the Debug.

65
00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:52.160
Ping 1 on 2 1 6 8 1 2 1 Rodek and ping the first PC show on the interface brief again.

66
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.140
This is the IP address of the router.

67
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.440
Lets configure the second PC 61

68
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.880
so configure that statically

69
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:22.410
61 subnet mask 255 255 255 192 Rodda sixty two will set to the DNS to the Rodda

70
00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.850
and stalked the PC up and open up a console.

71
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:42.940
So here's a boon to two PC to I-F config ethe zero IP address is 61 subnet mask is this Can we paying

72
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:45.100
the Rodda.

73
00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:46.510
Yes we can.

74
00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:47.790
Can we ping the other host.

75
00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:49.580
Yes we can.

76
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:53.900
So we've configured the IP addresses on the subnet.

77
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:54.870
Now one last test.

78
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:57.810
Let's ping the broadcast address.

79
00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:05.500
Notice the option we are told that we have to explicitly specify broadcast and when I broadcast the

80
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:10.220
router actually replies to that broadcast the other host doesn't.

81
00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:20.320
But we are pinging the broadcast address when we use 63 so the broadcast isn't 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 255 the

82
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:24.990
broadcast address for the subnet is 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 63.

83
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:29.450
So we have successfully configured this subnet.

84
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:35.330
Now we need to configure the subnet and this gets a little bit more interesting because it's 1 9 2 1

85
00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:39.110
6 8 1 64 slice 26.

86
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:40.990
