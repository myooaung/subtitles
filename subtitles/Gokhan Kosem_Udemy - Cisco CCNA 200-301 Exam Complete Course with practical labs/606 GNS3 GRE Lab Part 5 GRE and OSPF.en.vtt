00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.930
At the moment broader one is able to ping rather five.

2
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.790
Acting as P.C. too.

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.620
And that's because we've configured a tunnel

4
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:18.670
but we've also configured EAI GOP to learn remote grants so your job he has learnt about network 10

5
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.450
1 2 0 via 10 1 3 2 through tunnel 0.

6
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:37.580
So if we removed the GOP right one would no longer be able to ping a 5 because Roddick 2 has no root

7
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.350
to get to that network.

8
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.830
It can send the traffic of via rod a 3 but draw a 3 also has no visibility of that network en route

9
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.840
a 3 show ip route shows us only directly connected interfaces.

10
00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:06.560
So in this example it's enable SPF so Rada or SPF 1 network and once again only enable SPF on Network

11
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:15.470
10 not on network for show IP or SPF interface and let's do a brief

12
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.160
SPF is enabled on tunnel 0 and on Fost Ethan at 0 0.

13
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.850
Notice the cost is very high and it's a point to point link.

14
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:35.680
We need to configure router for Radha for so the neighbor relationship go down to write it to when we

15
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.990
remove DIY GOP.

16
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:50.270
So now let's remove the GOP and write a for and enable who SPF Network 10 0 0 0 with the relevant mask.

17
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:58.450
Show IP 0 SPF interface brief before I present to notice the neighbor relationship has already come

18
00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.630
up you can see tunnel 0 and first Ethan at 0 0.

19
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:13.470
Have always been enabled on them show IP or SPF neighbor neighbor relationship to 10 1 3 1 is full.

20
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.490
Notice it's a point to point link so we don't see any election taking place but rather for now has a

21
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.380
relationship directly to Rod 2 through tunnel zero.

22
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:35.890
So show IP round we have now learnt about a right 10 1 1 0 through 0 SPF from this neighbor rather 2

23
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.880
through tunnel 0 so can write a 1 now ping root of 5 and the answer is yes.

24
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:50.590
So we've successfully changed the writing protocol used across the jury tunnel from EAI GOP to 0 SPF

25
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.220
1 can trace as an example to write a 5.
