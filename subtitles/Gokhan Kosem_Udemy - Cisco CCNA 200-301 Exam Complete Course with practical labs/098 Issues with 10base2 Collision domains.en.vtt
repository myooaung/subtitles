00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now there was other issue with 10base2, the first issue is cable length

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
the longer the cable the greater the signal degradation was.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
In other words as your cable increase in length the more likely it was

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
that one host signal wouldn’t be received by another host.

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The host on one side of the cable might send the signal

6
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
but because of degradation a host at the other end of the cable

7
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
may not be able to receive or interpret the signal.

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Another problem is cable breaks.

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
A cable break at any point would cause the entire network to fail.

10
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So if someone accidentally broke the cable at this point the whole network would fail.

11
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Host A cannot communicate with other devices in the network.

12
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
those devices cannot communicate with host A

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
However because of this cable break there’s no terminator on the cable.

14
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The cable is also damaged, so what happens is signals get reflected

15
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
D might send a signal to C but it’s going to continue across the cable

16
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and then it’s going to be reflected back causing collisions on the network, so this

17
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
network wasn’t very robust and that cable breaks to bring down the entire network.

18
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Now it gets worst, 10base2 implies 10Mbps Ethernet however, this is not 10Mbps for

19
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
each device it's 10Mbps shared between all devices on that segment.

20
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
In addition because of collisions you can only use between 30 and 40%.

21
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
So you are only get 30 to 40% utilization.

22
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Collisions increased dramatically above that utilization

23
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
so a conservative figure would be 30% utilization

24
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
that means 10Mbps would be shared between all devices on that segment.

25
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So in this case we have 4 devices

26
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
so that means the 10Mbps divided by 4 devices times 30% (10/4*30%)

27
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
only gives you 0.75Mbps and not 10Mbps per device.

28
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
This is not ideal because the bandwidth available to your PC

29
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
is very low especially in a large network.

30
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
So as more devices are added to the network

31
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
the bandwidth available to each devices decreased

32
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
this is also known as a single collision domain

33
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
in other words, if a collision takes place at any point on the network

34
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
all devices in this network are affected by that collision and would need to back off.
