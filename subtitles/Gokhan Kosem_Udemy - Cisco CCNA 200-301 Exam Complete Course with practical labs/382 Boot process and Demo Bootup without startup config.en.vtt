00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:08.760
The first step the Rada performs a power on self test or post then it loads and runs the bootstrap code.

2
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.310
Thirdly it finds the Cisco Iowa software.

3
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.120
So the bootstrap code determines where the Cisco Iowas software is.

4
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.620
That should be run.

5
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:25.180
Normally this is located in flash memory but it could also be stored on a TFT server configuration register

6
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:31.840
and the configuration file determine with Cisco Iowas falls are located and which image file to use

7
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:38.680
if a Cisco Iowa image cannot be located a scaled down version of the Cisco Ioway is copied from Rome

8
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.990
into RAM.

9
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.760
That only applies however to older versions of Cisco routers in the past.

10
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.150
A mini operating system would be used but today the road will boot into run monitor mode.

11
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:56.620
If no Cisco is available after the bootstrap code is found the correct image it loads the image into

12
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.740
RAM and starts the sky with software.

13
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.860
Older rod is used to run the operating system from flash and memory.

14
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.350
But today once again the entire operating system is loaded into RAM.

15
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:17.380
Once the operating system is loaded the Radu will find the configuration which is typically stored in

16
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:24.880
nv ram so to load the startup config from nv ram and then apply it the startup config is loaded in RAM

17
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.800
and becomes the current all running config on the router.

18
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:34.420
The running configuration of Varada contains the IP addresses it determines which running protocols

19
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.620
need to be started.

20
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.500
Which passwords need to be configured and other characteristics of the router.

21
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.070
If no configuration file exists or the router enters the Setup Utility what Timpson.

22
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.350
Or to install of a configuration file from a TFT server.

23
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:57.040
The router then runs the configured Iowa software that's important to remember that Cisco Karaite the

24
00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.210
Iowa software.

25
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.660
You can't change that but you can change how it's applied by changing the configuration on a router

26
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.110
in the same way as with Windows.

27
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.180
You can change the Windows operating system but you could change your desktop.

28
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.850
You could change the phones and other options in Windows.

29
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:23.200
The Cisco Iowa software can be manipulated through the configuration so you may decide to run the OSPF

30
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.110
routing protocol on one router but use the GOP on another router.

31
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:38.220
Your configuration determines the behavior of the Cisco Iowas on a router on those Fratta as an example.

32
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:45.720
They wrote it does have a startup config so show startup config shows us the configuration of this router

33
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.140
on this router.

34
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.170
We could raise the startup config

35
00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:02.060
so now the shows start up c'mon show startup config.

36
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.070
C'mon shows us that there's no rodder configuration.

37
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:15.770
If we reload this router it will boot with no configuration and we should be prompted to enter the startup

38
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:21.280
wizard on this Shradha which does have a startup config.

39
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:29.350
So once again show start when we reload the router it should boot with the startup configuration applied

40
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.650
as the running config so shrouded doesn't have a startup config.

41
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:44.180
Whereas this router on the left does have a startup config so we should see the difference when they

42
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:51.870
boot up.

43
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.610
We can see the Rania's tryna get a configuration from a server.

44
00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:03.590
So it's trying to boot and retrieve a configuration so it's sending a broadcast looking for a network

45
00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.710
config this route is continuing to boot up

46
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.010
and notice a configuration has been applied.

47
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.030
The Rodda has a name.

48
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.410
And if we scroll up

49
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.300
we can see that various interfaces came up.

50
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:33.500
But in this case sure run shows us that a configuration has been applied.

51
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.310
So the configuration was copied from start up to running.

52
00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.380
Ways and this Rodda the system configuration.

53
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:47.530
Dialog starts up and I pressed enter a few times and hence it was shown a few times and then I broke

54
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:55.570
out of the initial configuration dialog and noticed in this case shows start shows us that there's no

55
00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:02.540
startup config and the router has a default configuration applied.

56
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:12.250
Now it did configure an IP address automatically on the serial interface using what's called slop.

57
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:21.370
That's why we were seeing this era where it was trying to connect to a TV B server and download a network

58
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.090
config as well as a Cisco net config file.

59
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:35.020
On some routers when there's a serial interface the router will automatically apply an IP address based

60
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:42.060
on the neighboring router to this interface and try and pull a config down from that neighboring router.

61
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.480
This router however has a configuration so we can see OSPF has been enabled.

62
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.420
There's a loopback IP address there's an IP address on the serial interface and any other configuration

63
00:05:54.420 --> 00:06:01.350
would have been applied with this Rodda that doesn't have a startup config boots up.

64
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:09.450
No startup config is applied and it uses a default config and may do some automatic configuration or

65
00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.450
use automated methods to try and find a configuration.

66
00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.960
The moral of the story is as follows.

67
00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:22.080
If there's no sort of config the router will typically boot up with some default values.

68
00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:30.170
Such as having most interfaces shut down ways if a startup config is available in the router that startup

69
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:31.700
config will be applied.
