00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:08.040
When using a central authentication server a client will log in to a network device.

2
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:14.860
They will be prompted for their credentials but that information is not checked against the local username

3
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:22.120
and password database but is forwarded to an authentication server such as Cisco ACARS.

4
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.360
Using two protocols radius and techniques.

5
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:34.360
So the username and password information is forwarded in encrypted format to the authentication server

6
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:42.070
and a response is sent back from the Tripoli server either saying that the log in is accepted or not.

7
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:49.090
That is then passed to the client so the client knows whether the authentication attempt was successful

8
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.290
or not.

9
00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.470
Now radius is an open standard protocol that combines authentication and authorization into a single

10
00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:57.600
process.

11
00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:05.710
Once the users are authenticated they are also authorized radius users UDP for authentication and authorization.

12
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:13.660
Tack X is a Cisco proprietary protocol that separates the triple A services of authentication authorization

13
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.010
and accounting.

14
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.980
Because of that too you could separate authentication from your authorization and accounting services

15
00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.950
tax also uses TGP rather than UDP.

16
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:34.930
Tax is often used for network devices with radius is used for uses Tech X uses port number forty nine

17
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.530
and radius 16 45 and 1812.

18
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.870
Both protocols encrypt the password but tax encrypts the entire packet.

19
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.590
Tack X is great for use with network devices such as Cisco routers and switches because you can authorize

20
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.320
a subset of CLIA commands.

21
00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:01.010
In other words you can centralize which users can issue commands on devices in your network.

22
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.780
As an example only certain users may be allowed to reload a router so you can limit who can do what

23
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:14.350
on your network devices using tack X the Cisco ACA server makes this very easy to do.

24
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.090
And as mentioned allows you to centralize your authentication authorization and accounting services.
