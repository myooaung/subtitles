00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.270
As mentioned there are some major advantages to using digital signatures rather than appreciate keys.

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:13.740
There is however one major stumbling block when PDA sends these public key to Sarah Jo hacker could

3
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:22.080
intercept that public key and replace it with his own public key and send that on to Sarah pretending

4
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.680
to be Peter.

5
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.950
That means that Sarah believes that traffic coming from Joe hacker is actually Peter.

6
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:38.130
In this case she needs a mechanism to prove that Peter is who he says he is and that he hasn't been

7
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:46.260
replaced with someone else and that allows us to introduce the concept of a Certificate of Authority.

8
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.650
Now in brief the easiest way to understand this is to think of the Certificate of Authority as a trusted

9
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.940
third party.

10
00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.990
When you connect to a website like Amazon dot com you trust that website because of a trusted third

11
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:09.840
party like VeriSign or thought essentially a Certificate of Authority is introducing Peter to Sarah

12
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.470
and allowing them to receive each other's public keys knowing that that public key actually belongs

13
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.550
to that person.

14
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:26.620
What happens in brief is Peter will send his public key to the Certificate of Authority and the Certificate

15
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:33.430
of Authority will issue Peter with a certificate stating that the public key contained in the certificate

16
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.570
is actually Peter's public key.

17
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:44.680
The Certificate of Authority does that by taking some of Peter's information is public key hashing that

18
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:52.080
data and then signing it with the certificate of authorities private key putting that into a certificate

19
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:59.700
and issuing that certificate to Peter the Certificate of Authority will do the same with Sarah taking

20
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:08.520
Sarah's data taking her public key hashing that information and signing it with the certificate of authorities

21
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:17.940
private key this whole infrastructure known as the public key infrastructure or P.K. I relies on businesses

22
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:26.840
trusting the certificates issued by the Certificate of Authority before setting up a VPN Pete and Sarah

23
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.850
will exchange the tickets.

24
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.110
So Peter will send his certificate to Sarah.

25
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:39.020
Sarah trusts the information contained in the certificate from Peter because the certificate has been

26
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.350
signed by a trusted third party let's say in this case.

27
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:53.010
Very sign and she trusts VeriSign so because Sarah trusts very sign and various sign trusts Peter Sarah

28
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.300
now trusts Peter by the same token Sarah sends his certificate to Peter.

29
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:06.220
Peter trusts Sarah because he trusts very sign and very sign trusts.

30
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:14.280
Sarah better sign or whichever Certificate of Authority you use is the trusted third party allowing

31
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.880
for the secure exchange of public keys.

32
00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.260
Now what is IP sic IP sic or IP security is a network layer protocol.

33
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:30.140
In actual fact it's a suite of protocols that protects and authenticate IP packets.

34
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:37.440
It's a framework of open standards that is algorithm independent and thus can use multiple algorithms.

35
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.690
They are three main IP sic protocols.

36
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:47.980
The first one is Internet key exchange or IHC which provides a framework for negotiating security parameters

37
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.490
and establishing authenticated keys.

38
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.640
A lot of the information I've just covered about appreciate keys and digital signatures relies on Ike.

39
00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:04.200
We also have authentication head or or a h which does not provide encryption but provides authentication

40
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.880
and integrity.

41
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.790
And then thirdly we have what's called encapsulating security payload or ECP which provides for encryption

42
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
authentication and integrity there are two modes that can be used an IP SEC VPN.

43
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:24.870
The first one is transport mode where the original IP head of the packet being encrypted is used to

44
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:31.860
transport the packet and the second one is tunnel mode where the original IP packet being encrypted

45
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.650
is not used to transport the packet a new IP header is tagged on the front.

46
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:45.110
So you have double IP addresses the head is used for writing the packets of the IP addresses of the

47
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:51.610
peer devices involved in the VPN not the originating host and destination host.

48
00:04:51.800 --> 00:05:00.860
So he has an example of a site to site VPN and we are going to used ISP with tunnel mode which is very

49
00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.140
common.

50
00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.490
Please note we have a MacBook with an IP address of 10 one on one and a server with an IP address of

51
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.160
10 1 to 1.

52
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:16.100
But we also have two routers router one with IP address quadruple one and router 2 with IP address quadruple

53
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:22.950
2 and the IP sic VPN is going to be setup between router 1 and route at 2.

54
00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.670
So if we look at the IP headers when the MacBook sends traffic to the server the source address will

55
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:36.020
be 10 1 1 1 and the destination address will be 10 1 to 1 on the local LAN that traffic will then be

56
00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:41.470
routed to a 1 when that traffic is sent through the IP sic tunnel.

57
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:47.940
Notice all the information so the data and the original IP headers.

58
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:55.280
In other words source address 10 1 1 1 and destination 10 1 2 1 are encrypted and non readable on the

59
00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:04.610
Internet and ISP header is tagged onto the front as well as a new source IP address and destination

60
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.080
IP address.

61
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:13.550
So if Joe hacker was sniffing packets on the Internet he would see traffic from router 1 going to write

62
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:22.160
it to he would not see who was actually involved in the conversation when Rod it too receives those

63
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:30.780
encrypted packets without it too will strip off the outside headers decrypt the packets as per what

64
00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:36.350
we've discussed previously and then send the original packets on towards the server.

65
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:43.890
So the source IP address will be 10 one on one destination will be 10 1 to 1 if sniffed on this local

66
00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.130
land.

67
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:54.120
So this once again is an example of a site to site IP SEC VPN using ISP in tunnel mode.

68
00:06:54.120 --> 00:07:04.170
E P if you remember provides encryption so confidentiality data integrity and authentication notice

69
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:11.880
also that we're using tunnel mode because we have inserted new IP headers now in using IP sic.

70
00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.350
You have various options to choose from.

71
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:19.710
The first thing to choose is which IP SEC protocol are you going to use.

72
00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:24.310
Are you going to use ISP or are you going to use a h.

73
00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.160
Or are you going to use them together.

74
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:32.430
Now firstly is provides encryption but H doesn't.

75
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:38.610
So if you need confidentiality don't use a h or authentication headed by itself.

76
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:48.670
Use ISP however ISP combined with a h provides for stronger authentication and encryption and therefore

77
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:55.660
for example in banking environments they may choose to use both ESPN HD together.

78
00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:58.900
The next thing to choose which I haven't got on the slide is which mode are you gonna use.

79
00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:05.720
Are you gonna use tunnel mode or are you going to use transport mode please remember if the devices

80
00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:12.350
setting up the VPN are not the actual devices communicating you need to use tunnel mode.

81
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:18.920
So in this example because the routers are not the source and destination of the actual traffic they

82
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.150
are configured in tunnel mode.

83
00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.600
You need to choose an encryption algorithm.

84
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:31.940
So are you going to use days or couple days or is it recommended today to use a s what authentication

85
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.310
and integrity are you going to use.

86
00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.520
Is it empty five or Sha.

87
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:44.180
Also you're going to use preset keys or you going to use digital signatures and therefore digital certificates

88
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.740
digital certificates are harder to implement but are most scalable.

89
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:55.600
So for a very small VPN you might use appreciate keys for authentication but in a large environment

90
00:08:55.930 --> 00:09:02.350
you may decide to use digital certificates which version of Helmand are you going to use Duffy Hellman

91
00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:08.880
one or two and to the film and five now I'm hoping at this point that you have a good understanding

92
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:15.440
of the various protocols and that's why I spend a lot of time discussing the various protocols because

93
00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:21.290
if we don't cover the groundwork this slide will mean nothing.

94
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:25.260
So what types of VPN can you expect to encounter.

95
00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:32.610
The first type is site to site where you for instance have a remote office or home office with a local

96
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:41.250
router connecting back to the head office which may be using a router or an HSA or another type of device.

97
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:51.060
The IP sic VPN tunnel is setup directly between router 1 and routed to the advantage of this is firstly

98
00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:59.830
that the devices like the MacBook and server do not need to run any encryption software from their point

99
00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:01.020
of view.

100
00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:07.300
It's as if there is a leased line or direct connection between the two lands.

101
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:12.890
Another advantage of using IP sick is because it runs at the network like they always model.

102
00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:16.080
It can encrypt all highlighted protocols.

103
00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:22.630
So rather than just being able to encrypt for instance HDP it can encrypt Oracle traffic sequel traffic

104
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:26.650
HDP traffic FCP traffic and so forth and so on.

105
00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:30.740
The second type of VPN you'll probably encounter is a remote access.

106
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:40.780
My basic VPN in this case a remote client like a Windows laptop has installed the Cisco VPN client and

107
00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:48.230
a VPN is being configured and setup between the laptop and HQ rather directly.

108
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:52.030
The advantage of this method is that the user could be roaming.

109
00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:58.730
So in other words the user could be in a hotel and can connect securely across a public wireless network

110
00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:01.460
in the hotel to the head office.

111
00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:07.010
The user could also be in an Internet cafe or Starbucks or some way connecting to a wireless network

112
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:12.500
that because they are running the VPN Klein soft way their traffic is encrypted and authenticated and

113
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:16.430
so forth directly from the laptop to the central site.

114
00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:22.420
Is an example of the Cisco VPN client software running on my laptop.

115
00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:28.220
All I would need to do to connect back to the office for instance would be to double click on the VPN

116
00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:33.680
entry put in my authentication information like my username and password and I'll be able to connect

117
00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:40.660
back to the corporate environment the disadvantage of this method is that you have to install the Cisco

118
00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:43.680
VPN client so it's not client lists.

119
00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:52.260
You have to install a piece of software the next top of remote access VPN is an SSL Secure Sockets Layer

120
00:11:52.260 --> 00:12:00.570
VPN these days there are two variants of this you firstly got the client list SSL tunnel where you could

121
00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:08.790
be in an Internet cafe or somewhere and you can connect securely to the HQ Rada without installing any

122
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:13.360
software on your P.C. or client.

123
00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:18.350
There were some restrictions originally with which applications and protocols could be used.

124
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:26.250
These days Cisco have something called the any connect client which allows you to connect via SSL but

125
00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:32.350
download a Java applet that allows more applications to be used through the SSL tunnel.

126
00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:34.750
No software has to be installed locally.

127
00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:41.450
Any connect client can automatically be downloaded and installed when connecting to the central site.

128
00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:43.370
So for this course just be a way.

129
00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:51.710
The advantage of an SSL VPN is that you do not need to install any software now which devices support

130
00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:52.990
VPN.

131
00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:57.550
Cisco routers do Cisco firewalls like the Cisco NSA do.

132
00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:03.560
They are various clients that can be used the first one of the 30 compliant which can be used on wireless

133
00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.290
PDA and other devices.

134
00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:12.230
We have a legacy device called a VPN 3A to hardware client which is a physical device that will be installed

135
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:17.570
at a remote site that would allow for easy VPN connections back to a central site.

136
00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:23.240
And then as I've shown you you have the Cisco VPN software client these days you also have the any connect

137
00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:28.850
client that can be downloaded automatically when connecting by an SSL VPN.

138
00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:36.910
So to sum up what are the benefits of using VPN a major driver for VPN is cost savings because VPN is

139
00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:42.640
all compatible with broadband technologies like DSL and cable.

140
00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:49.480
Rather than having to install expensive leased lines or other private networks a virtual private network

141
00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:57.120
can be established across a public infrastructure like the Internet VPN to provide security in that

142
00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:05.130
they provide encryption authentication data integrity non repudiation anti replay protection and so

143
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:13.530
forth and DP ends of very scalable VPN can scale to many many countries and I've been involved in VPN

144
00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.810
that spanned 50 countries.

145
00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:22.680
Now it's easy and a level you're not expected to know how to configure and setup IP safety pins but

146
00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:29.280
I'm going to demonstrate the setup of an IP safe VPN by using the VPN config generator which you may

147
00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:35.680
have got depending which package you purchased so let's look at setting up a site to site VPN between

148
00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:42.540
Rado 1 and Robert it too with networks 10 1 1 0 and 10 1 2 0.

149
00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:50.770
As private networks that need to be encrypted so I'll launch the site to site VPN wizard in our example

150
00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:55.850
both sides of the IP sic tunnel or routers so we'll click next.

151
00:14:55.960 --> 00:15:04.370
In this case we are requiring IP sic encryption so we're going to go for an encrypted tunnel.

152
00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:08.560
We're not running dynamic routing protocols or multi costing etc..

153
00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:14.860
I'll take next day in our example let's just assume that we're using static IP addresses on both sides

154
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:25.620
and not dynamic IP addresses so we'll click next so this is sort of what our diagram looks like.

155
00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:36.910
We're going to encrypt traffic from 10 1 1 0 going to 10 1 2 0 and our 2 routers IP addresses all quadruple

156
00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:42.420
1 and quadruple ti when setting up IP sic.

157
00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:46.480
You've got to specify your Ike well I say KMP options.

158
00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:53.980
So for example let's be really secure and go for a s turn 56.

159
00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.200
In this example we only gonna use appreciate keys.

160
00:15:56.210 --> 00:16:03.070
I'm just going to leave it at Cisco 1 2 THREE AND THEN I'M GOING TO CLICK ON THE generate button and

161
00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:06.010
this is what that configuration would look like.

162
00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:10.150
You have to create an access list specifying which networks are going to be encrypted.

163
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:17.690
This is known as an interesting traffic access list so traffic from 10 1 1 0 going to 10 1 2 0 would

164
00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:23.090
be encrypted because we're looking at router ones sort of the configuration.

165
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:32.090
Now notice here we are using empty five hashing we could change that to show we're using a 256 encryption.

166
00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:41.120
We're using Duffy Hellman group to we're using pre shared authentication notice when talking to write

167
00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:41.740
a T.

168
00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:51.350
We're using a positive Cisco 1 23 from an IP SEC point of view we're using e p a s.

169
00:16:51.440 --> 00:17:01.430
So encapsulating security payload using a s with MDG 5 and we're using tunnel mode we are specifying

170
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:08.740
who our peer is for IP sic we are binding the access list so the rider knows which network should be

171
00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.060
encrypted and so forth.

172
00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:15.310
I hope that gives you an idea of how to configure an IP sic VPN.

173
00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:22.450
Once again for CCMA it's not expected that you know this configuration but I've just put it in for completeness

174
00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:24.090
en route it to.

175
00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:27.590
We would just have a mirror image of that configuration.

176
00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:35.500
So notice the same password but going to IP address quadruple one so whatever we covered we looked at

177
00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:39.700
an overview of the ends I explained various VPN components.

178
00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:45.900
We discussed IP sic discuss a lot of options including encryption authentication and integrity.

179
00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:50.740
Please remember at this course level you're not expected to know commands but you expected to have an

180
00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:56.380
appreciation and an understanding of the various IP sic VPN technologies.

181
00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:57.130
Thank you for watching.
