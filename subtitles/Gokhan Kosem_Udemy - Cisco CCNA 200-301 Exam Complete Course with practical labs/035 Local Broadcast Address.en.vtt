00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The next type of Special Address is the Local Broadcast Address

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This is used to communicate with all devices on the local Network

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The address is populated with binary 1s so it looks like this

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
in binary or this in decimal

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
In other words all octets are populated with binary 1s

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
which equates to 255.255.255.255

7
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
this address is used for example by a host

8
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
when requesting an IP Address from DHCP server

9
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The host doesn't have an IP Address yet, so it doesn't know which

10
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
subnet it belongs to, it also doesn't know the IP Address of the

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
DHCP server so it will send a broadcast to this address

12
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
the Local Broadcast Address to request an IP Address

13
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
from a DHCP server, just in case you're not familiar

14
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
with DHCP, DHCP is Dynamic host Configuration Protocol

15
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and it's a service that provides IP Addresses dynamically

16
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
to devices such as PCs, phones, iPads, IP Telephones

17
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and other devices that you may encounter on a Network

18
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So rather than you manually configuring IP Addresses

19
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
on your iPhone or your iPad or an IP Telephone or a PC

20
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
for that matter, you would allow that device to boot up

21
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
sends out a broadcast to the Local Broadcast Address and the

22
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
DHCP server hears that broadcast and then allocates

23
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
an IP Address to the host from a pool of IP Addresses

24
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
or scope of IP Addresses, you've probably encounter this

25
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
many many times so as an example at home you may have a broadband

26
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
or DSL type router providing wireless connectivity at home

27
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
so that you can get on to the Internet

28
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
when your PC or your iPad or other devices connect

29
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
to that Wireless Network that automatically allocated

30
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
an IP Address in the same way when you go to Starbucks

31
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
or another coffee shop, you may be an IP Address

32
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
via DHCP server providing both Wireless connectivity

33
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
as well as IP Addresses to Client devices

34
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Be aware that Local Broadcast Addresses are always dropped

35
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
by Layer 3 devices such as routers and Layer 3 switches

36
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
you can override that functionality by configuring what

37
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
is called DHCP forwarding also called DHCP relay

38
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
on your routers and switches, so as an example if you had a PC

39
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
or device in VLAN 10 but your DHCP server

40
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
was on a different VLAN or different Network

41
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
somewhere else in your topology

42
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
the DHCP request from the PC or phone would not be received

43
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
by the DHCP server by default, you would have to configure

44
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
IP forwarding or IP DHCP relay

45
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
on the switch or router to forward the DHCP request to the DHCP

46
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000
server, so you would type an example like ip helper address

47
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and then specify the DHCP servers IP Address on the router

48
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
or Layer 3 switch, typically in this example

49
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
the router or switch still blocks the Local Broadcast

50
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
so when it receive that Local Broadcast from a PC or phone

51
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
it drops it but then sends a Unicast DHCP request

52
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
to the DHCP server on behalf of the PC or phone

53
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
in VLAN 10, this then allows the router or switch to

54
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
proxy the DHCP request on behalf of the PC or IP Phone

55
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
What you need to be aware of is that traffic sent

56
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
to this address 255.255.255.255 is dropped by routers

57
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
in Layer 3 switches, additional configuration is required

58
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
on the router or layer 3 switch if you want PCs

59
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
in different VLANs to receive IP Addresses from a DHCP server

60
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
in a remote or different VLAN and that's because once again

61
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and that's because once again routers and switches

62
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
drop this Broadcast Address by default
