1
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:13.680
Okay so let's see if we can answer the questions in the scenario we've been told or that P.S. One pings

2
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:20.190
P.S. two and we need to answer these questions based on the Echo request message sent from P.S. One

3
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.750
to P.S. 2.

4
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.290
So we firstly asked What is the destination MAC address in the frame at point A in the network when

5
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:36.970
traffic is sent from one layer to network across a a piece is going to OP for the runners MAC address

6
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:45.980
and encapsulate the frame with the writers MAC address when sending traffic to a remote destination.

7
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:54.580
So the MAC address that will be used is the MAC address of the routers gigabit 0 0 0 interface which

8
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.270
is configured as this.

9
00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.560
So the answer to the question is e rather ones gigabit.

10
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:14.680
0 0 MAC address so I would say 4 Question 1 The answer easy but let's verify that by using simulation

11
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:21.730
mode in Packet Tracer I'm going to edit my filters to only show up and ICMP traffic.

12
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:29.680
You can click this option show all and then uncheck the various traffic types that you want to view

13
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.750
on P.S. 1.

14
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:44.490
I'm going to send a ping to the IP address of P.S. to and in the output here I'll be able to view the

15
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:56.870
ICMP traffic so the inbound PD shows us that the destination MAC address is the routers MAC address

16
00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.920
which is configured as follows.

17
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.830
So again answer to Question 1 is the road is gigabit.

18
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:13.600
0 0 0 address is the MAC address used as the destination MAC address in the frame.

19
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:27.840
And that address is this so that would be the answer for question 2 which is asking us for the destination

20
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.170
MAC address.

21
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.010
Question 3 asks us what is the encapsulation used.

22
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:45.920
Notice the encapsulation is Ethernet to So if 2 is the encapsulation used at point A in the network

23
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.880
we can see that again in the packet tracer capture.

24
00:02:51.950 --> 00:03:05.750
We then asked to do something similar at point B in the network so I'll click capture forward we could

25
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:15.040
actually look at that under the frame on the switch and look at the outbound PD you notice the destination

26
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.590
MAC address is the same ether type is Ethan it too.

27
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:28.930
This is the mac address of the router so the answers here would be very similar.

28
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:39.640
We're not asked in this example for the encapsulation used but the encapsulation used is ether to so

29
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.700
we could look at is that.

30
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:51.040
Yeah or we could look at the inbound PDA view on the rudder and you'll notice it has the same information

31
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.320
so that's the answers to questions.

32
00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:04.510
One two five we then need to answer the question What is the destination MAC address at point C in the

33
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.850
network.

34
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:15.890
In other words over here so looking at the outbound PD you what you'll notice is there is no mac address.

35
00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:24.620
The encapsulation used on the surreal interface is HDL C HDL C doesn't use MAC addresses MAC addresses

36
00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:39.120
are used in Ethernet so we could see that here or as the inbound PD you on a rather to inbound PD shows

37
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.050
something very similar.

38
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:52.390
Notice the encapsulation used his HDL C there is no mac address so the answer to Question 6 is there

39
00:04:52.400 --> 00:05:02.950
is no mac address at point to see in the network and the encapsulation used is HDL C.

40
00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.580
We then asked similar information at pointed D in the network.

41
00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.830
So what is the destination MAC address.

42
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:17.210
What is the actual MAC address and what is the encapsulation used at point D.

43
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.860
So D over here so we could look at the road as outbound PDA you

44
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:39.340
MAC address is this that is the MAC address of the P.C. So IP config shows us the IP address of the

45
00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:50.170
P.C. IP config slash all shows us the destination MAC address of the P.C..

46
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.270
So this is the actual MAC address used

47
00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:05.230
going back to our questions.

48
00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:14.430
We need to specify whose MAC address is in the destination frame at point D that is PCI 2s MAC address.

49
00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:21.840
This is the actual MAC address and we back on Ethan at which means it's going to be Ethan it too as

50
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:32.150
the encapsulation we can verify that by looking at the outbound PD you on the router notice its Ethernet

51
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.510
to.

52
00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:44.490
So this is gonna be Ethernet to once again we could also if we wanted to look at the ingress traffic

53
00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:55.280
on the switch ingress shows something very similar destination MAC address Frank type is Ethan to

54
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:10.050
that's actually going to be the same under this link so on e we could either look at the packet outbound

55
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:23.940
on the switch notice it's the same or we could look at the ingress PD you onto the P.C. exactly the

56
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:34.420
same information is shown for these questions so if we look at point E the answer to the question will

57
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:47.850
be the same its P.C. 2s mac address MAC address is that and the frame type is Ethernet to So were you

58
00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:54.090
able to answer those questions and can you answer the questions for the return traffic.

59
00:07:54.090 --> 00:08:03.330
In other words the echo reply so if I click capture forward now notice we getting an echo reply message.

60
00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:11.670
So if we look at the inbound PD you and we scroll down the type here is this.

61
00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:13.080
But if I go back

62
00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:30.120
the inbound PD you honor the P.C. had a type of 8 so echo request and then the echo reply message over

63
00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:30.660
here

64
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:36.070
has an ICMP type of this.

65
00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:46.240
And notice you can see that the source MAC address is P.C. to button the destination MAC address is

66
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:49.920
rather to so on it to

67
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:55.290
show run notice.

68
00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:03.510
This is the MAC address configured on gigabit 0 0 0 and that's the MAC address that we see as the destination.

69
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:08.790
At this point for the Echo reply source MAC addresses this.

70
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:18.450
Let's work through the process when it gets to the router the router will see that information on the

71
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:23.900
inbound PD you destination MAC address is itself.

72
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:32.960
Source is the P.C. but on outbound there on no mac addresses a different encapsulation is used.

73
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:38.070
Cancellation is HDL C but notice the IP address information stays the same.

74
00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:53.080
If we go across the link look at Route 1 inbound PD U is h still C outbound PD U is Ethernet to destination

75
00:09:53.080 --> 00:10:04.680
MAC address is P.S. 1 to look at the config of P.S. 1 notice that is the MAC address of P.S. 1 source

76
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:16.850
MAC address is the router with this MAC address capture forward it'll be the same on the switch inbound

77
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:21.410
and outbound PD use will show that to the destination MAC addresses.

78
00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:25.880
P.S. 1 source MAC address is the router.

79
00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.140
Same for outbound.

80
00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:35.400
So in and out we'll have that and if we capture forward again we'll see something similar under the

81
00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:46.350
P.C. for the inbound PD u destination is the P.C. source is the router so Packet Tracer allows you to

82
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.440
see the life of a packet quite nicely.

83
00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:58.170
At every stage in the network it's important that you understand encapsulation as source and destination

84
00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:05.310
MAC addresses and how are they used for the CCMA exam Opie enjoyed to this video.
