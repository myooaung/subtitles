00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.410
Okay for this question and on a blog I got a question from Remus.

2
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:23.370
He asks What is the use of giving a default gateway to a switch using the IP default gateway command

3
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:42.980
be remiss in this June 3 typology of a router connected to a layer 3 switch which in turn is connected

4
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.650
to a lead to switch at least three switch has IP routing enabled.

5
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.870
In other words it will rot from Villon one to violent two and back again switch to a late to switch.

6
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.560
In other words it doesn't have IP writing enabled.

7
00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:06.920
So for the CCMA this could be a twenty nine fifty switch or 21:16 and this could be a 37 50 35 50 as

8
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.140
an example.

9
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:15.130
So on Router one is Rotto 1 able to ping switch to on trees.

10
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.010
No the router is not able to ping switch to.

11
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.920
What about trace and to speed things up I'm going to.

12
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.110
No IP domain.

13
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.500
Look-Up so trace route to tend and wondered wondered what.

14
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:39.540
OK so the traffic gets to switch one so it goes from about a one to switch one tenth of 1 to 2 to 2

15
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.300
5 4.

16
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:48.990
And then the trace fails so cannot ping 10 1 2 5 4.

17
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.150
Yes I can and I would have known that from the trace.

18
00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.310
But what I'd like to do is check the following.

19
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.180
Can write a one paying the same IP address on the other side.

20
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.470
Well switch one.

21
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:01.790
Yes it can.

22
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.000
So that means that the problem is not here.

23
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:13.210
The problem is somewhere on the site so on switch one can we paying switch to.

24
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.690
The answer is yes.

25
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:22.930
On switch to Kennet paying switch one on villaine one.

26
00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.040
Yes it can.

27
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:33.970
But Kennet paying a cross switch one remember one was able to ping this IP address in Villon one so

28
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.800
switch one is going to be LAN routing but can switch to pings which ones IP address in violent too.

29
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:47.690
And it looks like it can't this is a very typical Signoria way.

30
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:54.890
You can't ping or telnet to a switch in a remote subnet.

31
00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.050
Now on the switch when we use the command show IP raht notice no default gateways being set.

32
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.420
This means that IP writing has been disabled on the switch.

33
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:13.840
So what I need to do is type IP default gateway and point the switch to its default gateway so show

34
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.690
IP.

35
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.920
Notice default gateway set told you that come on again is the default gateway.

36
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.540
So on router 1 10 we paying switch to monsters yes.

37
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.740
So you need to configure a default gateway on a late to switch.

38
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.580
In other words a switch that hasn't got IP routing enabled to allow that switch to send traffic to remote

39
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:43.900
subnets traffic from router one could get to switch to but won't be able to get back again if switch

40
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.140
to doesn't have a default gateway configure it.

41
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.680
Now this can get confusing if the switches the last three switch or supports Les's free functionality.

42
00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:01.080
Notice at the moment once again IP routing is disabled because we don't see a writing table here show

43
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.520
run pipe include IP raat.

44
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:07.500
Notice this command.

45
00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.460
No IP routing IP writing was disabled on the switch.

46
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.960
That's a default on all the switches.

47
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.200
So IP routing that's enabled that through the show IP wrapped.

48
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.830
Come on again notice the output is very different.

49
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.880
Notice also that the gateway of last resort is not set.

50
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:38.600
So Ken wrote a one ping switch to answer his node show run pipe include default.

51
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:46.560
We still have the IP default gateway command configured on the switch but because IP routing is enabled

52
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.050
that command is ignored.

53
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:56.320
So you only use the IP default gateway command when IP rodding is disabled so let's do that again.

54
00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.110
No IP routing

55
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.350
pings succeeds IP routing

56
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.700
Pingo file.

57
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.490
So an IP routing is enabled like this.

58
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:19.750
What you need to do is you need to create a default route to a default gateway so something like that

59
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.260
and now routing works.

60
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:31.360
So here's the thing to remember if IP routing is enabled on a switch you must use a static default drop

61
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.080
like this will run a routing protocol if IP routing is disabled.

62
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:42.880
He used the IP default gateway command to allow a switch to send traffic to a remote subnet remiss.

63
00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:46.670
I'm hoping that answers your question and I hope that helps everyone else.

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.400
