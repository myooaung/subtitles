1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:13.670
So wrote a one paying 10 1 1 2 that works right a one can ping it to write it one has a static route.

2
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.230
In this case it's a default route sending all traffic to route to.

3
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.800
Ken road a one paying 8 1 1 2 3.

4
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:32.180
The pings are coming out on Route 3 show IP route shows us that the router doesn't have any routing

5
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.990
enabled it doesn't have a static route.

6
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.920
All it knows about is this network.

7
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.460
So de-bug IP ICMP to that ping again on Brodeur's 3 we can see that the traffic is arriving.

8
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:53.830
So router 3 is receiving the pings from Route 1 but it's receiving them from 10 1 1 1.

9
00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:01.950
So Rodda 3 is trying to reply back to the ICMP echo message using this source 8 dot wondered one or

10
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:11.930
two going to 10 1 1 1 but the router doesn't have a route back and we can see that by doing debug IP

11
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:19.310
packet we can see that the packets are unreadable rodef 3 doesn't know how to send the traffic back

12
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.550
to Route 1.

13
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:30.080
So let's configure dynamic knocked on Rodek to allow both router and wrote a one to send traffic to

14
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.560
rotatory.

15
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.760
So show run pipe including that at the moment no net has been configured.

16
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.970
The first thing I mean to do is go on to the fast isa net zero wanting to face and make that to the

17
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:52.020
outside interface so this interface is now deemed to be outside from the routers point of view going

18
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.700
to foster and it's 0 0 IP that insight.

19
00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:06.180
So those commands are very similar to static not what we need to do now however is specify a pool and

20
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.390
an access list.

21
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:14.820
So we'll start with the access list so access list one permit and who are we going to allow to be netted

22
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:23.820
in this example I'll allow anyone in the 10 1 1 0 network so anyone in this network will be permitted

23
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.370
were allowed to have their addresses translated so that will affect route one and wrote.

24
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:37.270
Now I can use the common IP Nat and rather than choosing static I'm going to use the option pool to

25
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.600
define a pool of addresses and then we need to create a name.

26
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.930
So I'm just going to call this Nat Poole what's going to be the first IP address in the pool.

27
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:54.710
So I need to specify a range of IP addresses on the scene to face some going to say 8 1 1 5 2 8 1 1

28
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.690
10.

29
00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:04.000
And then I need to specify the network mask so the network mosque will be a slash 24 in our example

30
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:13.980
and loosely I need to specify IP net inside source list access list one which we created is determining

31
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.930
who's going to be nattered who's going to be allowed to be netted and we are going to net them to a

32
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:30.300
pool of addresses which we called that Poole to show run type include and that will allow me to see

33
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.320
the commands that I configure.

34
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.010
We specified that inside and outside interfaces which should be on these two interfaces.

35
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:47.770
We created a pool of addresses this net command is allowing anyone in access list one.

36
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:55.630
So anyone in this range based on that entry to be netted to an address in the pool and the pool contains

37
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.460
these addresses five to 10.

38
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.910
So I've added six addresses to the pool.

39
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:09.190
So de-bug IP not to allow us to see things in real time Radu one wasn't able to ping rotisserie previously.

40
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.540
Let's see if it works now.

41
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:18.990
Notice after a while it started working and we can see that this addressed 10 1 on 1 was translated

42
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:27.870
to 8 1 1 5 for traffic going to 8 1 1 2 so we can see traffic's being netted and then the reply came

43
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:28.870
back.

44
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:35.280
These pink timeouts are probably due to the OP taking place between rodded 2 and rotisserie.

45
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.210
So they on the third attempt the reply came back.

46
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.870
So 8 1 1 5 was translated to 10 1 1 1 and that continues.

47
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.540
Ken Rotto for Ping 8 1 1 2

48
00:04:51.930 --> 00:05:00.760
seat that's taking place pings start succeeding in the output we can see that 10 1 1 4 was translated

49
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:09.690
to the second address in the pool 8 1 1 6 4 traffic going to 8 1 1 2.

50
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:17.490
That means that both wrote a one and wrote a form can send traffic to 3 and Rodda to will dynamically

51
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.690
do the net between the addresses.

52
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:26.220
So this is brought a for he has Rodek to being netted show IP net translation.

53
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:34.560
Now in this example every ping is going to get a new dynamic not increased so to keep it simple I'm

54
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.000
going to use telnet.

55
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.740
So all the enabled of Etowah lines on router 3

56
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:59.460
and all telnet to router 3 from out of 1 and I'll do that from Radio 4 as well.

57
00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:12.570
On a TV show Oppy net translation we can see the dynamic and net increase created for those two hosts

58
00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.020
accessing Rato 3.

59
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:24.000
You can see that the Sadrist 10 1 1 1 was netted 2 8 1 1 5 and 10 1 1 4 2 2 8 1 1 6.

60
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:31.770
And then the actual traffic for that telnet session is shown as a dynamic net entry here with a Portlanders.

61
00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:36.950
If we exit out of both of those telnet sessions

62
00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.270
after a period of time these dynamic entries will disappear.

63
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.110
I can remove them by typing clay IP.

64
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.290
NET translation store.

65
00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.710
So at the moment notice there are no net translations.

66
00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:04.560
As soon as I sent traffic a translation is Karaite it for that host entry.

67
00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:12.430
If I leave it long enough those net translations will time out and be removed.

68
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:20.120
That's very different to a static net translation where the static net translation stays permanently

69
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.960
in the net table.
