00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:08.730
Open shortest path first or SPF 0 SPF is an industry standard powerful routing protocol used in many

2
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.430
networking environments in the world today.

3
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.550
The word open means that it's an open standard.

4
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.480
This is a great advantage to using 0 SPF because of vendor interoperability.

5
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:25.800
You can make Cisco routers with Nortel routers HP routers and others and be assured their rights will

6
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:36.270
be exchanged between the different vendors shortest path first or SPF also known as the Dykstra algorithm

7
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:44.520
named after the developer who published the algorithm in 1959 is used by SPF to determine the shortest

8
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.120
path or best route to a destination.

9
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.000
So what we're going to cover is firstly an overview of SPF and we look at the features of OSP.

10
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.220
I'd like to show you how to set up a network using a single O SPF area.

11
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.210
I going to show the importance of loop backs and how they determine the Rada I.D. We'll look at quite

12
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:12.520
a few configurations and setups and oh SPF including multiple area of SPF and authentication 0 SPF once

13
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:21.190
again is a link state routing protocol and will flood links that advertisements or else essays throughout

14
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.520
the network or area describing firstly the links attached to Arata.

15
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:34.030
In other words the writing interfaces and the state of those links the state meaning a description of

16
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:40.390
an interface and its relationship to neighboring routers is the interface up or is the interface down

17
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.230
that description would include for example the IP address of the interface the subnet mask the type

18
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.600
of network to which it is connected and the rudders that are connected to that network and so forth

19
00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.860
the collection of all of these linked states forms the top a logical database or linked state database

20
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.600
routers form neighbor relationships by sending out hello messages using either multicast address 2 2

21
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.100
4 0 0 5 or unique costs.

22
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.950
LSA is once again a flooded throughout the network or area and the links state database is created from

23
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:26.410
these links that advertisements or LSD OSB if once again uses the shortest path first algorithm or Dykstra

24
00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.670
is algorithm to determine the best path to each destination.

25
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.640
Now there's a bit of debate about this.

26
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.420
Engineers will often discuss where in the OS and model various protocols reside.

27
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:51.590
SPF resides directly on top of IP or SPF does not use or UDP for transporting of updates and information

28
00:02:52.280 --> 00:03:03.230
it resides directly on top of IP OSB if is referenced in the IP header with protocol I.D. 89 DCP reference

29
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:11.220
with protocol 86 and UDP protocol I.D. 17 and thus some would debate that ISP if resides at Layer 4

30
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:18.830
for this course however we are going to say that OSP resides at Layer 3 directly on top of IP.

31
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:26.970
Also at Layer 3 for a lot of us in the real world this isn't a major concern but maybe from a theoretical

32
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:27.570
point of view.

33
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:38.230
He has a wide shot capture showing various SPF packets so as an example this first one is from Iran

34
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:47.440
too with an IP address of 10 1 1 1 Going to the well-known multicast address for 0 SPF 2 2 4 0 0 5 so

35
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:54.540
that's the address used by ISP for hellos on for instance and Ethan its segment and you can see in the

36
00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:03.760
output here at Layer 2 We've got the source MAC address of the router sending information to an IP version

37
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.830
for multicast address.

38
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:16.490
In this case the well-known multicast address for a wispy if Adelaide to the ether type is 0 800 in

39
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:18.500
hexadecimal.

40
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.360
In other words referencing IP

41
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.500
at layer three.

42
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:33.920
We've got the source IP address once again of 10 1 1 1 and destination of 2 2 4 0 0 5.

43
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.030
You can see this is an IP version of full packet and you can see here.

44
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:50.070
The protocol I.D. is 0 SPF in hexadecimal referenced as 0 x 5 9 using a Windows calculator.

45
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:56.130
We consider to use hexadecimal set the value of fifty nine and then change it to decimal and you can

46
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.690
see the protocol I.D. is eighty nine.

47
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.010
So at least three hours P.F. is referenced with protocol I.D. 89.

48
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:12.960
The source once again is 10 1 1 1 destination is the multicast address 4 0 SPF residing directly on

49
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:24.660
top of IP is 0 SPF so notice we have Ethernet IP 0 SPF 0 SPF does not use TTP or UDP as a transport

50
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:34.030
it uses IP you can see the 0 SPF header version two of our SPF you can see that this is a hello packet.

51
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:43.160
In other words Type 1 you can see it's for area 0 0 SPF areas can be referenced either as single decimal

52
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:51.570
numbers like 0 or in dotted IP decimal notation as in 0 0 0 0.

53
00:05:51.650 --> 00:06:00.990
It's like saying tomorrow or tomorrow it's the same thing you can see the sources 10 1 1 1 you can see

54
00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:10.110
it's a hello packet is information like the network mosque the hello interval the a priority the route

55
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:16.910
a date interval to the designated road is to the back of designate a road is who the active neighbour

56
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.720
is and so forth.

57
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.550
We're going to cover a lot of this information in the upcoming slides the important thing to note is

58
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:29.460
once again is that oh SPF resides directly on top of IP.

59
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:37.300
If we look at the next message we're out at 10 1 1 2 is sending a database description to rout at 10

60
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.310
1 1 1.

61
00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:47.360
You'll see once again that there is no TCO or UDP or SPF is reference with protocol i.e. eighty nine

62
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:53.490
in an IP vision for header always before this course resides at layer 3.

63
00:06:53.490 --> 00:07:00.490
But as mentioned is a bit of debate about exactly where it resides Arata sends links that advertisements

64
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:09.030
to advertise the state of the link immediately when the state changes or periodically by default.

65
00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:16.200
Every 30 minutes the databases will be synchronized with the State of the links ISP of routers from

66
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:22.490
neighbor relationships and the list of neighbors is stored in the adjacency table or SPF neighbor table

67
00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:31.810
so topping the command show IPO SPF neighbors will show you adjacent neighbors or SPF uses multicast

68
00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:39.360
addresses 2 2 4 0 0 5 and 2 2 4 0 0 6 which are linked local multicast.

69
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:42.910
In other words those multicast cannot hop across the road.

70
00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:50.200
The writers have to be directly connected always fearful store all routes learned in the OSP of topology

71
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:57.100
database or link state database link state database contains all routers and attached links in the area

72
00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:03.310
or network all OSB of routers in the same area share the same database.

73
00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:09.630
Best Routes are then put into the writing table also known as the forwarding table.

74
00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.140
There are various packet types used in ours.

75
00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:19.450
The first type is A Hello packet which is used firstly to dynamically discover neighbours and secondly

76
00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:23.580
to form neighbor relationships and maintain those neighbor relationships.

77
00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:31.360
The awesome default intervals for hellos on broadcast multimedia segments such as Ethernet the interval

78
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.960
is 10 seconds.

79
00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:38.860
The second default interval is 30 seconds which is used on non broadcast segments such as serial links.

80
00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:47.490
An MBA may non broadcast multi axis environments such as frame relay 0 SPF has what's called a dead

81
00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:52.530
interval or dead timer which is four times the hello interval by default.

82
00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:58.500
If you change the hello interval 0 is fearful automatically change the date interval to value 4 times

83
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.750
the hello interval on a specific interface.

84
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.340
So how close are used to discover neighbours.

85
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:10.260
And if a hello is not received within the date interval the neighbour relationship is torn down because

86
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:14.330
it's deemed that the neighbour is no longer available.

87
00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:22.540
The second type of packet is what's called a database description written as DDR or DVD which is used

88
00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:30.320
to exchange brief versions of each link state advertisement SPF is a linked state writing protocol riders

89
00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:35.000
exchange information about the state of links through link state advertisements.

90
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:41.530
When an initial relationship is formed between two two SPF routers they will exchange database descriptions

91
00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:45.390
giving each other an overview of what the database contains.

92
00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:52.570
If parts of the database are missing on one router it will send a link state request requesting full

93
00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:58.810
LSA information from the neighboring router the neighboring Rada will send what's called a linked state

94
00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:05.290
update which is a packet that contains links that advertisements and as mentioned is typically sent

95
00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:07.670
in response to a linked state request.

96
00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:13.570
This contains detailed information about the links state database rather than just an overview of it

97
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:20.970
which was contained in the database description link state acknowledgements acknowledge or confirm receipt

98
00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:22.290
of the link state update.

99
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:22.830
Message.
