00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:11.440
When you enable span on a switch as we've got over here the switch no longer learns MAC addresses on

2
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.070
the span destination port.

3
00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.390
It also doesn't allow traffic to be received from that port.

4
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.810
So if a one pings write a t it works.

5
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:35.920
And the MAC addresses are shown in the MAC address table but rather one is not able to ping the capturing

6
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:49.380
device so filtering for ICMP the pings are being received from right of one to the P.C. but no replies

7
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.600
are being accepted by the switch.

8
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.370
So in other words the ping from the one to the capturing device is received in this port and because

9
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.910
of the port mirroring or span the traffic is being sent out of this port and is received by the capturing

10
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:06.730
device.

11
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:13.370
But when the capturing device replies that traffic is not accepted on the destination spend port.

12
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.520
So the pings are failing

13
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:24.790
so once again notice there were no successes on the ping from Route 1 to the capturing device and just

14
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.750
to confirm that is the IP address of the capturing device.

15
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:38.570
If we want to allow that device to send traffic we have to configure the monitoring session to receive

16
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.410
that traffic so destination interface is fast Ethernet.

17
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.770
1 0 5

18
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.460
and we have to add this option ingress to enable ingress traffic forwarding

19
00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:05.000
and to specify that is un tagged traffic in VLAN 1.

20
00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.030
So I'll start to the capture again

21
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:21.600
and let's see if Radha one is able to ping that capturing station notice the pings succeed here's the

22
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.410
ping from Route 1 to the capturing device here's the reply and the pings succeeded.

23
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.350
So just to prove that again I'll do a repeat of just one

24
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:43.590
play the one shall capture one ping there's the ping sent from Route 1 Here's the reply we've seen duplicates

25
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:52.710
because we are looking at traffic sent and received on this port so we are receiving duplicates because

26
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:59.010
we are sending traffic to the monitoring station that's received or transmitted on this port so we get

27
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:12.280
some duplicates but they point to remember is that if we don't use the ingress command the monitoring

28
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.080
station is not able to participate in the network.

29
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:24.470
Essentially the MAC address is removed from the MAC address table so the MAC address is not learnt as

30
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:32.240
you can see over here traffic is not allowed to be received on this interface but with the ingress option

31
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.990
it can be received and the device is allowed to participate in the network.
