00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.620
winds network performance monitor is transforming the way administrators visualize and troubleshoot

3
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.550
their networks using advanced traffic simulation.

4
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.770
NET path continuously discovers and analyzes a dynamic network path.

5
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.620
See from source to destination and all the hops in between.

6
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.690
Here's an example path to google.com with traffic originating on our network routed to the ISP through

7
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:36.320
Google's internal network and finally to the destination server path also collects detail performance

8
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.880
metrics for each network node and link making it easy to spot bottlenecks.

9
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.790
In this example our router has three incoming links but only one is experiencing increased latency by

10
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.220
correlating real transit impact with comprehensive performance metrics.

11
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.010
NET path that immediately identifies the root cause of the problem.

12
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.450
In this instance it's high interface utilization.

13
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:04.550
Look inside the cloud and troubleshoot with unprecedented visibility follow Hopp by Hopp Internet pass

14
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.460
including all provider interlinks which deliver service for the first time.

15
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.550
You can inspect carrier networks and assist your ISP helpdesk.

16
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:19.160
This allows you to address issues with precise actionable information about the problem in their network

17
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.970
analyze past performance problems with net path.

18
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.060
You can travel back in time to compare routing changes and diagnose what was happening.

19
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.200
Visualize in complete network path is finally easy.

20
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.710
Specify a source a destination add branch offices and configure your most important services diagnos

21
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.340
service issues from sales for stock exchange or any other TZP service in just a few minutes.

22
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.550
Pinpoint network problems and solve them faster with the breakthrough capabilities of MANPAD.
