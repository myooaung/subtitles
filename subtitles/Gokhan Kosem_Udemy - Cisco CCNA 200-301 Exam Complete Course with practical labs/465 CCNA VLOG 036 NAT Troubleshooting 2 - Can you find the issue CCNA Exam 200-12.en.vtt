00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.520
This is one of multiple videos discussing network translation on the net.

2
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:20.810
In this scenario we've been told that devices on the inside of our network such as Rotto one acting

3
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:29.500
as PC one Rotto for acting as PC two and five acting as PC three are not able to ping Google.

4
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.990
In other words 8 8 8 8 in this typology Rodda 3 is configured as Google.

5
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.980
So let's do some verification.

6
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:48.840
Here's wrote of one acting as PC one at the top can ping 8 8 8 8 as we can see in the output it's not

7
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.920
able to ping the google address show IP run.

8
00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:04.770
We do have a static default dropped to 10 1 1 2 5 4 which is the IP address of router to acting as on

9
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.680
NAT router.

10
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.740
So let's do a trace 2 8 8 8 8 to speed things up.

11
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.560
Type No IP domain lookup do that again.

12
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.320
So we hit the default gateway but we don't go any further just to that again.

13
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:32.250
So Trace 2 8 8 8 8 it gets to the default gateway which is routed to but doesn't get any further.

14
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.770
So you can write it to ping Google ping 8 8 8 8.

15
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.590
Yes it can.

16
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.680
It can ping the Google IP address of quadripolar 8.

17
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:43.830
This is on Natrajan.

18
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:54.850
So let's do some not debugs de-bug IP Knecht Precentor that debugging has now enabled ping from radio

19
00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:03.580
one to Google we not getting any output in the next debug show IP not translations.

20
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.900
They know not to translations show IP not statistics.

21
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.350
OK so can you find the problem.

22
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.410
Can you see where the issue is in this output notice here.

23
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.080
Total active translations is zero.

24
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.790
We had Peke translations previously of two.

25
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.060
And here's the problem there are no outside interfaces.

26
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.510
They are only inside interfaces.

27
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.200
Gigabit 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 are configured as inside interfaces.

28
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.560
Looking at rodded to use interfaces that's incorrect.

29
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:42.590
This interface.

30
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:43.120
Gigabit.

31
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.560
0 1 is on the outside.

32
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.060
In other words it's connected to the Internet.

33
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.200
These three interfaces are on the inside.

34
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.610
In other words they are on the local LAN and they should be nutted.

35
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.170
So before I do a change let's look at the config.

36
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.630
This interface is inside.

37
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.650
According to the configuration this interface is the inside.

38
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.050
According to the config.

39
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.390
But according to the topology that should be the outside.

40
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:19.890
So that's wrong of interfaces or configured correctly as the inside interface.

41
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.950
But we need to change gigabit.

42
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.200
0 1 and make that the outside interface.

43
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.600
Notice the problem when I hit enter.

44
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:35.800
We are told that it's inside so no IP net inside IP Nat outside.

45
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.700
So we've made it the outside interface.

46
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:48.410
Now show IP Nat statistics shows us that gigabit is 0 or 1 is the outside these three interfaces are

47
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.750
inside interfaces.

48
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.630
So in router one can we ping Google.

49
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.090
Yes we can.

50
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.950
We can see the translations on re-added too.

51
00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:05.860
So Source IP address of 10 1 1 1 was translated to 8 8 8 to 5 for destination being Google.

52
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.970
We got the reply back and the reply was translated.

53
00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.510
So that looks good.

54
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:25.670
What about Rotto 4 and 5 acting as internal hosts being 8 8 8 8 Ping's succeeds wrote a 5 ping 8 8 8

55
00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.810
8 Ping's succeeds.

56
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.930
So we've resolved the network address translation issue in the apology.

57
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:40.820
Don't forget you need to configure inside and outside interfaces correctly when configuring network

58
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.020
address translation.

59
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.980
I hope you found this video useful if it's been of benefit to you.
