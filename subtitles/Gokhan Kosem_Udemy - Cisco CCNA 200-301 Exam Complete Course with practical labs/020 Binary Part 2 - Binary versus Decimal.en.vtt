00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now continuing with the analogy, imagine that you two cables

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
two cables can either have no current applied

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
so no current equates to 00 or for example you could have no current

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
on the first cable but have current on the second cable and that equates to 01

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
once again no current equals 0, current equals 1

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And continuing with that example, you could have current on the first cable

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and no current on the second cable, that gives us the value of 10

8
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
or we could have a current on both cables, so current on cable 1

9
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and current on cable 2, gives us a value of 11, so in this case, we have

10
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
2 cables but there are 4 combinations or 4 options, 00 no current on both

11
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000
01 no current on first, but current on second or 10 current no current

12
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
or 11 which means current on both

13
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The reason for this is that we have 2 cables and 2 possible states

14
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
either on or off, so 2  cables with 2 possible states gives us the value of 4

15
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
or 2 to the power of 2 equals 4, or if you prefer 2 x 2 = 4

16
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
So just ot summarize, in this example, we have 2 cables and 2 states per cable

17
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
2 cables times 2 states equals 4 combinations

18
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
thus 2 x 2 = 4 or 2 to the power of 2 equals 4

19
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
So extending that analogy to 8 cables, the reason why we're using 8 is that

20
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000
an IPv4 Address consists of 4 octets or 4 8 bit values

21
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
In this case, we might have no current on the first 7 cables

22
00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and current on the last cable that gives us 7 binary 0s and a single binary 1

23
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
we could once again go through all the various combinations as per the previous

24
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
examples where we put current on the last cable as in this example

25
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
or current on the second last cable and then go through all the combinations

26
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
until we reach the situation where we had current on all the cables

27
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
if you went through all the combinations, you would end up having

28
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:40.000
256 combinations or 256 binary values, 2 states across 8 cables gives you 256

29
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Now for the sake of time we're not going to do that here but if you do

30
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
decide to work it out, you would see that you have 256 binary combinations

31
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Now let's do a quick comparison between decimal and binary systems

32
00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Decimal is based on a 10 based system where it has values from 0 to 9

33
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
this is the numbering system used in everyday Math or Maths or Mathematics

34
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
whichever term you prefer. Binary, however, is 2 based system

35
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
which is the foundation of computer operations

36
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
once again we have 2 values either 0 or 1, this is once again what we're

37
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
going to concentrate on throughout the rest of this video

38
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
So all examples are going to be using a combination of 0s and 1s

39
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Here's some basic Math examples for those of you who may have forgotten

40
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
2 to the power of 0 equals 1, 2 to the power of 1 which in other words

41
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
2 multiplied together 1 time in another words 2 x 1 = 2

42
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Now extending that, 2 to the power of 2 which is 2 x 2 = 4

43
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
2 to the power of 3, which is 2 multiplied together 3 times

44
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000
in other words 2 x 2 x 2 = 8, 2 to the power of 4 which is once again

45
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
2 multiplied together 4 times equals 16

46
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Continuing 2 to the power of 5 equals 32

47
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
2 to the power of 6 is equals to 64

48
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
2 to the power of 7 equals 128

49
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
2 to the power of 8 equals 256

50
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
So that's some basic Math, essentially 2 to the power of a value is the

51
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000
value multiplied by itself, in this case, 2 to the power of 8 is

52
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000
2 multiplied by itself 8 times which gives you 256

53
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Now this is kind of basic Math is really important

54
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
when working with Binary, IP Addressing and Subnetting

55
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Now if you were ever going to learn a table to help you Binary and Subnetting

56
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
then this would be it. In the real world, we typically use calculators

57
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
but it's well worth knowing how to do this manually

58
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
to help you with your understanding. So if you ever need to work out

59
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Subnetting or Binary manually, I suggest that you write down this table

60
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
because it will make your life a lot easier when working out binary to

61
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
decimal and decimal to binary. What you have in this table is firstly your

62
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000
base exponent, so 2 to the power of 7, 2 to the power of 6, 2 to the power of 5

63
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
all the way down to 2 to the power of 0

64
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
put binary 1s below that and then the decimal equivalent

65
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:41.000
So 2 to the power of 7 equals 128, 2 to the power of 6 equals 64

66
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:48.000
2 to the power of 5 is 32, 2 to the power of 4 is 16, 2 to the power of 3 is 8

67
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
2 to the power of 2 is 4, 2 to the power of 1 is 2

68
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and lastly 2 to the power of 0 is 1

69
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Now these values are really important in IPv4,

70
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
so it's well-worth remembering this table
