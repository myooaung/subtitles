00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.580
Full the CCN a course you need to know three types of not the first one is static not.

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:14.650
Second one is dynamic not and food one is packed static Nat maps a private IP version for address to

3
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.900
a public IP version 4 address.

4
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.960
This is a one to one mapping.

5
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.950
This is very useful when a device must be accessible from outside the network.

6
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:31.820
For example you have a web server in your internal network that needs to be accessible from devices

7
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.090
on the Internet.

8
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:41.660
So this type of net is often used for servers that require a static IP address dynamic Nat maps a private

9
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:49.280
IP version 4 address to a public provision for address from a group of public provision for addresses

10
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.470
or from a pool of addresses.

11
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:59.040
This could be used as an example where two companies merge and they using the same IP address space.

12
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:06.500
So you have two companies for example using IP addresses 10 dot one dot 1.0 and the devices in those

13
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.590
two companies need to talk to each other rather than renumbering you addresses.

14
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.180
You can use dynamic nat to allow those devices to talk to each other.

15
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.480
It's not a very efficient and should only be used when absolutely necessary.

16
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.030
Now putit translational packed maps multiple private IP addresses to a single public IP address.

17
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.370
So in other words you taking many IP addresses and mapping them to a single public IP address.

18
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:44.220
Think of your network at home you may have multiple PCs iPhones iPads or other devices that only to

19
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:52.600
access the internet ISP however will typically only give you one IP address for your home network.

20
00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:00.850
So you may have three or four or maybe even more devices let's say 10 IP devices that are using one

21
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.190
public IP address.

22
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:10.570
So 10 devices or as many devices as you've got at home are using private IP addresses and those addresses

23
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.930
are then enacted to the public IP address on your router the Sheezus port numbers to differentiate between

24
00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.880
the different translations.

25
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.120
Hence the term port address translation pet is also known as Knecht overloading.

26
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.460
We are overloading a single IP address with multiple IP addresses.

27
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:37.630
It's a type of dynamic Nat and is the most common type of not in use today and you'll typically find

28
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.830
it all over the place in businesses as well as your home network.
