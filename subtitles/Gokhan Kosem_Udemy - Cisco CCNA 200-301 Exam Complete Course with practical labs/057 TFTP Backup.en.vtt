Itâ€™s good practice to backup your configuration to a TFTP server

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
so you should copy your config either your running config

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
or startup config to a TFTP server

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
so that you have a backup stored somewhere else.

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This would be useful for example if your router failed

6
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and you have to replace the device with another router

7
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
you could simply copy the config from the TFTP server back to the router.

8
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So either to the startup config which is a replacement

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
or to the running config, which is once again a merge of configurations.
