00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:07.340
Now a question often asked about SDM an open flow is is this actually real.

2
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:13.890
Are there any implementations of software defined networking or open flow in the real world.

3
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:20.770
One of the earliest examples of SD and an open flow can be found at Google Google started deploying

4
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.810
open flow in their networks in 2010.

5
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.960
Now at the time of this recording that is over five years ago so SD in an open flow have been around

6
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.100
for quite a while.

7
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:40.180
I recommend that if you're interested in seeing examples of SD and an open flow have a look at the open

8
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:48.050
networking summit videos on YouTube as first example which I've explained is open flow at Google

9
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.410
and the video explains how Google had problems with their existing infrastructure and then deployed

10
00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:03.430
their own switches running open flow and other protocols to scale in this presentation.

11
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:12.760
From 2012 Google's infrastructure is explained and us in this video explains how Google have got to

12
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:20.750
100 percent network utilization in their network He further explains why they used open flow in their

13
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.110
core network.

14
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:29.720
One of the reasons given is that networking costs do not go down as Google scaled their network.

15
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.930
This is in contrast to compute and storage when running a data center at scale.

16
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.870
Google expects massive savings compared to a small implementation.

17
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.590
This was happening to compute and storage but not to networking.

18
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:52.780
The cost of networking stayed linear or increased which was very different to servers and storage whether

19
00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:00.080
per device cost went down as the implementation was scaled in networking it was hard for Google to save

20
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.620
money even when there were large implementations.

21
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:12.050
So by implementing open flow and SDM Google were able to manage many networking devices as a single

22
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.820
unit rather than lots of individual networking devices.

23
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:26.720
Now they are updates to the Google presentation here's one from 2015 which provides a lot more detail.

24
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.690
There's also a presentation from 2014.

25
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.760
I strongly recommend that you watch this video.

26
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:40.470
The 2015 keynote presentation about Google's implementation explains the reason why and the advantages

27
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.580
of implementing open flow in SD and in Google's network

28
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.260
Google have also released more detailed information where they pull back the curtain on Google's network

29
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.300
infrastructure.

30
00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:00.810
So a lot of detail is provided on how Google have implemented their network and can manage multiple

31
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.140
devices using open flow and ISDN.

32
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:11.710
The history is provided of different Google implementations as well as detailed white paper information

33
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.730
explaining scaling network devices protocols used and so forth.

34
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.660
If you're interested in the details have a look at these documents otherwise simply watch this presentation

35
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.700
from the open networking summit.
