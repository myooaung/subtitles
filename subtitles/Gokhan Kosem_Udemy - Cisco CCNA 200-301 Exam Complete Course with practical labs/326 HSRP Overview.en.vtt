00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:09.390
In a previous video we made switch one the spanning tree root for veal and ten and a veal and one as

2
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:16.790
well as making switch to the spending tree root for veal and 20 we can see that as an example by going

3
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:24.840
on to such one and topping shows spanning tree veal and 10 notice of this switch or this bridge is the

4
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:35.810
spanning tree root for Valentin as well as the spanning tree root for villain 1 yes which 2 so shows

5
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:42.990
spanning tree v land 20 the switch or bridge is the root for veal and 20.

6
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.370
Once again the reason why we use terms bridge rather than switch in spanning tree is that spanning tree

7
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.150
has been around for a long time.

8
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.870
So we talk about bridges rather than such as in some of the spanning tree terminology spanning tree

9
00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.820
was developed when bridges were used instead of switches.

10
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.520
So we've got the roots configured in spanning tree.

11
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:10.760
We have enabled in previous videos redundancy between the switches.

12
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.630
So as an example switch three has to uplinks to the core.

13
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.820
And so to switch for so we have redundancy at layer 1 and layer 2.

14
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.070
But now we need to implement redundancy at layer three.

15
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:30.280
Here's the problem rudder one which is acting as P.S. One and this topology is in VLAN 10.

16
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.560
It needs to be configured with a default gateway so which switch will become its default gateway switch

17
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:44.690
one will switch to both switches have IP addresses in VLAN 10 switch one is tendered once attended one

18
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:51.740
and switch to is tendered Wanda tended to switch switch will be configured as the default gateway and

19
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.710
what will happen when that switch goes down as an example you probably want to make a switch one the

20
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.350
default gateway for router one because switch one is the spending tree route which should mean that

21
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.310
traffic at both layer 2 and layer 3 would traverse this link and get to switch one.

22
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:16.250
The problem is if you make switch one the default gateway for pieces in VLAN 10 and switch one goes

23
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:23.450
down where will those pieces send their traffic they won't be able to reach their default gateway which

24
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.300
means that they won't be able to send traffic off VLAN 10.

25
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.360
In other words they won't be able to access the Internet or other servers and devices in a separate

26
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:39.440
VLAN the same is true for devices in VLAN 20 if you lend twenty devices have switched to as the default

27
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.020
gateway in other words we configure the default gateways tendered one to twenty to two and switch two

28
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:51.500
goes down what happens then the default gateway is down which means that they won't be able to for example

29
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.750
ping devices in VLAN 10 or access devices on the Internet.

30
00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:03.830
So this is where first hop redundancy protocols such as hot standby writing protocol or H.S. IP are

31
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:11.150
used it just IP is a Cisco proprietary protocol that allows you to implement first top redundancy the

32
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.920
industry standard version of the protocol is VR IP or virtual rudder redundancy protocol.

33
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.920
The idea here is that you configure your two switches with a virtual IP address these two switches will

34
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:34.310
have an election and choose who is in charge of forwarding traffic on behalf of a virtual router in

35
00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:41.960
this topology will have two physical switches configured with IP addresses in say VLAN 10 but a virtual

36
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:49.370
switch or a virtual rudder is created through the configuration and that of virtual Rada or virtual

37
00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.350
switch becomes the default gateway for your devices.

38
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.740
I'll talk about virtual Rodders rather than virtual switches or layer three switches for most of this

39
00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:03.770
discussion because that's how HSR appears written and described but essentially what you do on your

40
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.600
P.C. is you configure a default gateway of a virtual switch

41
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:19.980
logically a Rada is created through H.S. or P..

42
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:26.410
Now this Rada is not a physical Rada or a real Rada that's going to exist in our topology.

43
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:34.750
It's simply created through the H.S. or P commands configured on the switches pieces such as the piece

44
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.280
in VLAN 10 will be configured with a default gateway.

45
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:49.040
In our example of ten dot 0 2 5 4 so rather than the PCI being configured with a default gateway of

46
00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.130
switch one or switch to the default gateway.

47
00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.940
Is this a virtual HS or piranha.

48
00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:02.720
This I just hope he rather will have its own IP address as shown here for VLAN 10 will also configure

49
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:08.380
a another virtual router for VLAN 20.

50
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:15.440
In addition this Rada has its own Mac address based on a group number configured in HS or P.

51
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.850
The pieces are unaware that they are talking to a virtual device.

52
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:27.300
They think they are talking to a physical Rada but in actual fact they are talking to the switches which

53
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:33.870
are pretending to be this virtual Rada we can manipulate which physical switch is going to be forwarding

54
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:41.640
traffic on behalf of the virtual Rada by changing a priority the default priority in HS IP is 100 and

55
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:49.260
the highest priority ones so we'll influence H.S. IP so that switch 1 becomes what is called the active

56
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:57.300
router for VLAN 10 and switch to will be the standby router for VLAN 20 switch 2 will be the active

57
00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.250
router and switch one will be the stand by Rada.

58
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:07.170
And that's because which one is the route in spanning tree for VLAN 10 and switch to is the route in

59
00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.140
spanning tree for VLAN 20.

60
00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:16.920
We want to ensure that traffic from this host and VLAN 20 is forwarded to its default gateway here which

61
00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.990
is the same device that suspending tree root.

62
00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:25.590
In other words traffic will take this path rather than the traffic having to go across multiple links

63
00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:33.390
to get to the default gateway by the same token the switch will be the active router or active forward.

64
00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:42.300
For VLAN 10 so that VLAN 10 traffic uses this uplink to get to the spending tree route as well as the

65
00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.140
default gateway.
