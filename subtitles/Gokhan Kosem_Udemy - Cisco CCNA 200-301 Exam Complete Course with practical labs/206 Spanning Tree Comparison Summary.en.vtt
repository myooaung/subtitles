00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So here’s a quick comparison of the different versions of Spanning  Tree.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The Spanning Tree 802.1D protocol doesn’t need a lot of resources

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
but it slow to converge.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
You only have 1 Spanning Tree instance for your entire layer 2 network.

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This can lead to sub-optimal traffic flows

6
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and 802.1D is generally not used today in Cisco environments.

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Just be aware that when you use newer versions of Spanning Tree

8
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Cisco switches are backward  compatible

9
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and can talk to all the switches or non-Cisco switches using 802.1D

10
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
PVST is the Cisco enhancement

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
that provides a single instance of Spanning Tree per-VLAN.

12
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It's Cisco propriety, it needs more resources

13
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
because 1 Spanning Tree instance is created per-VLAN.

14
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It is still slow to converge but thus allow you to split traffic flows

15
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
because you have 1 Spanning Tree instance per VLAN.

16
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
as an example, VLAN 1 traffic could use 1 uplink

17
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
but VLAN 2 traffic could use as separate uplink or a separate port in a network.

18
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Cisco have also enhanced PVST with features

19
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
such as Portfast, Uplink fast, backbone fast, BPDU guard, BPDU filter

20
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
root guard and loop guard we'll discuss some of those terms in this course

21
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
otherwise, you'll learn more about those when you attend your CCMP courses.

22
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol or 802.1W is an industry standard protocol

23
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
it doesn’t need as many resources as PVST+

24
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
because it supports a single instance of Spanning Tree for your layer 2 network.

25
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Its big advantage is that it provides very quick or fast convergence.

26
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
It also doesn’t address suboptimal traffic flow issues

27
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
because you can send VLAN 10 traffic for example down 1 link

28
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and VLAN 20 traffic down another link.

29
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
That’s the advantage of Rapid PVST+

30
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Rapid PVST+ incorporates the advantages of Rapid Spanning Tree

31
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
but allows you to create 1 spanning tree instance per-VLAN

32
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
so you can do load sharing of traffic, it provides very quick convergence

33
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
but uses a lot of resources especially when you’ve got many VLANs.

34
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
The advantage of Multiple Spanning Trees

35
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
is that it solves that high resource issue of PVST+

36
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Multiple Spanning Trees allows you to create an instance of Spanning Tree

37
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and then map various VLANs to that instance.

38
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.000
As an example, once again if you had 200 VLANs PVST or Rapid PVST

39
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
would require 200 instances of Spanning Tree

40
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
where’s Multiple Spanning Tree could use 2 instances to do load sharing

41
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and reduce the amount of resources required.

42
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
So CPU and memory requirements for Multiple Spanning Trees

43
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
are lower than those for Rapid PVST+

44
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
but resources are higher than those for Rapid Spanning Tree.

45
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Now you may find reference materials stating that PVST+

46
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
is the default Spanning Tree on Cisco switches

47
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
that really depends on a lot of switches today use Rapid PVST

48
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
is the default version of Spanning Tree.
