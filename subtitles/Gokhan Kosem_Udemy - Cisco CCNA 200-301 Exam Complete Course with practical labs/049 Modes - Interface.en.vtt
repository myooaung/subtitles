00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The next mode is interface mode and it displays the following, hostname, config-if

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and brackets followed by hash or pound sign hostname(config-if)#

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
This mode allows you to change the configuration of an individual interface.

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So for example you can change the IP address of the routers F0/0 interface

5
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
or you could disable the interface by shutting it down or enable the interface

6
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
by using the no shutdown command.

7
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So various options are available in interface mode and commands available

8
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
will depend on the type of interface that you’re configuring.

9
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
A Ethernet interface would have a different options to a serial interface

10
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
which would be different in turn to a DSL interface or ATM interface.

11
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So I can type int f0/0 which is interface FastEthernet 0/0 on this router

12
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
as you can see I’m abbreviating commands and it's good practice to do that.

13
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
As always remember you can hit the tab key which will complete a command for you.

14
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
So if I type exit to go back to privilege mode

15
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and then type int and press tab notice the command is completed and now want to use

16
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
question mark I can see a list of available interface types.

17
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So in the output I can see FastEthernet, loopback, serial interfaces and others.

18
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I could then type f press tab which completes the command.

19
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
So fastethernet, press question mark and I can see the options

20
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
in this example I need to specify 0, so I can type 0?

21
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And then told to enter forward slash and then i need to enter 0, so interface fastethernet
0/0

22
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Notice how the Cisco IOS helps you complete commands.

23
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It gives you relevant information about which options or parameters are available.

24
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
In the interface configuration mode I could use question mark.

25
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Once again to see a list of options.

26
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
These options are specific to this mode and specifically this type of interface.

27
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So I’m gonna type i?

28
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And I can see various options including IP, IPV6, ISIS, and ISO-IGRP.

29
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
In this example I'm gonna specify ip ? and I can see options that pertain

30
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
or that are relevant to IP so I could choose IP address.

31
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
notice the options a? is new list of options

32
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I can’t use ad cause there are multiple options

33
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
for that, so I have to specify add and now when I press tab

34
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
the command completes because that’s the only option available.

35
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I could now specify an IP address for this interface.

36
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
notice I'm being prompted for the relevant information  N

37
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
so if I go back again by pressing backspace and then use question mark of the IP address

38
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I’m prompted to enter the IP address and subnet mask.

39
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:17.000
It prompts me for an IP address and after the IP address I'm prompted for the subnet mask.

40
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
If I press enter without completing a command, I'm told that the command is incomplete

41
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I can use ctrl p or the up arrow key to display the previously entered command

42
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and now I can enter the mask but if I enter the mask incorrectly

43
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
and press enter I'm told that the mask is invalid.

44
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
So press the up key, correct the mask and now when I press enter. the command is accepted.
