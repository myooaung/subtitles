00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:07.830
The following videos showing you the integration between Jeana's 3 and NPM are based on this how to

2
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.170
guide which you can get from the below links.

3
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.730
This may be useful to you after you've attended the training.

4
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:22.320
So if you want to set up an PM and Jean history refer back to the sky ad which contains a lot of information

5
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:31.290
including how to install both genius 3 and NPM how to create the initial topology the commands used

6
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:39.010
on the routers including commands such as setting up SMP setting up the IP addresses and configuring

7
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.810
E.I. GOP.

8
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:48.450
I'll also include the commands on the routers on the relevant video in this training but you may find

9
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.310
the integration Guide to be of benefit to you for reference later in the next few videos.

10
00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:01.700
I'm going to show you how to build a topology within Jeana's 3 that consists of three routers connected

11
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.400
via serial interfaces.

12
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:10.660
These are going to be the interfaces monitored by network performance monitor the three Cisco routers

13
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.820
are connected to a switch which in turn is connected to NPM.

14
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.650
This is our out-of-band network management subnet.

15
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.340
You don't need a dedicated network for management but in this example that's the way we going to configure

16
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.450
it.

17
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.520
How ingenius three there are multiple ways to setup your Cisco routers.

18
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.970
You can either run Cisco Iowa's routers directly within Windows using what's called the local server

19
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:45.180
or you can use a virtual box PMS or a VM where volume's it's up to you which method to use.

20
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:53.140
The recommendation is that if you are only going to have Cisco routers and other basic devices such

21
00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:01.450
as the built in Ethernet switches Engine 3 you can run jenius three locally on your local Windows PC

22
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.520
or Mac.

23
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:10.330
However if you want to run more complex typologies using Iowa layer 2 or other more complex setups then

24
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.520
you're going to want to use the genius three VM.

25
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:20.680
Please refer to the genius 3 installation videos for more detail on how to set up and integrate Jeana's

26
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.340
three.

27
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:29.300
So in this example I have a Windows 7 Professional virtual machine running within a VM workstation.

28
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:39.040
I've allocated 4 gig of ram to the 64 bit operating system and I've allocated to cause so on the settings

29
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:48.140
of a VM workstation you can see that 4 Gig of RAM has been allocated at the moment only one process

30
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.870
being allocated.

31
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.280
Now some recommendations from solar winds.

32
00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:59.490
You can run NPM on Windows 7 Windows 8 dot 1 and Windows 10.

33
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.450
It suggested that you use two calls and 4 gigs of ram as the bare minimum.

34
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.930
It is better however to use 8 gig of RAM and for cause.

35
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.970
But as a bare minimum used to cores and 4 gigs of RAM.

36
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.540
So in this example I'm going to shut down my virtual machine and I'm going to increase the amount of

37
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:29.370
RAM and you so that it's a lot quicker when I do the demonstrations.

38
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.890
Now that's obviously dependent on what you have available on your PC.

39
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:44.240
But I'll set it to use for a cause and 8 gig of RAM and I'll power on the virtual machine again.

40
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:53.270
Now something I always do and this is up to you but I always create snapshots of my virtual machines

41
00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.030
in case something goes wrong.

42
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:06.310
So I've created a snapshot with for example a new install of Windows 7 with chrome installed and that's

43
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.990
where I am at the moment.

44
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:15.660
Virtual Machine is saying that I need to restart so that the.

45
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:26.810
So what I'm simply doing here is getting Windows 7 ready so that I can install NPM.

46
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:35.700
You may also want to download Windows 2000 and 12 so as an example you can download a VHDL file and

47
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:42.970
then import that into virtual box if you want to run in PM on Windows Server 2012.
