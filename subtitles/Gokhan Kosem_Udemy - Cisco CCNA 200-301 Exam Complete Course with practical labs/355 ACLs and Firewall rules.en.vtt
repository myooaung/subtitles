00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:07.920
Things that may affect your own network reachability or access control lists or ACLC and firewall rules

2
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:15.510
in many networks that aren't actively being managed you'll find that security engineers have blocked

3
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.990
protocols such as this in MP and ICMP.

4
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:25.890
Those two protocols are very important network management protocols but for security reasons they may

5
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.530
have been blocked in various points in the network by security conscious engineers.

6
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:39.240
So it's important that when you starting to audit the network in preparation to a rollout that you pay

7
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.150
special attention to where traffic is allowed and where it's denied.

8
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:52.410
Now from a best practice point of view it's ideal to deploy a management plan which is separate to the

9
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.350
villans used for user traffic.

10
00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:02.170
So a separate network or separate the villanies created and network management traffic is permitted

11
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:10.120
on that villain ACLJ and firewall rules on network devices would allow network management protocols

12
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:17.110
on that villain and allow anonymous to access the loopback of a router as an example.

13
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.550
Just be aware that if you limit access to network devices from only specific IP addresses.

14
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.020
So as an example you only allow the IP address of the network management system to access the rodders

15
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.550
loopback interface using SMP.

16
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:38.320
When you change things in your network such as expanding the network management applications you may

17
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.110
need to go back and adjust your access list or just your firewall rules.

18
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.980
So it may be simpler to permit a subnet access to your network devices rather than locking it down to

19
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:57.580
an individual IP address in the same way when discussing security you need to pay attention to different

20
00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.250
security zones.

21
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:06.460
A customer may have an outside interface on a firewall and inside interface and a DMZ interface on their

22
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.010
firewall the security zones can impact your network management systems.

23
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.900
So you need to understand how you're going to deploy them in a mess and how security rules and firewalls

24
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.460
zones are going to affect overall reachability and the management strategy that you deploy.

25
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.270
Now last but not least you need to think about overlapping and non ratable addresses in your network

26
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.350
overlapping a non-radical addresses can be a real headache when deploying network management systems.

27
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.080
You should audit your network and understand which addresses are reachable and from when the network

28
00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:51.610
and take that into account as you start documenting the systems and decide where to roll out your network

29
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.180
management system.

30
00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:59.140
In many cases if you have overlapping address space and you have devices on each of those overlapping

31
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:07.450
subnets that you need to monitor you'll need to create a separate polling engine for NPM for each duplicate

32
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.010
address space zone.
