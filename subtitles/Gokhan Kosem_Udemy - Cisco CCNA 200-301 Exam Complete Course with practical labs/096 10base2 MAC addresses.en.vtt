00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:08.230
Ethan at 10 base to use as correction CAPLE The specifications are different to the coaxial cable used

2
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.240
in cable television.

3
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:18.580
But the point I'm trying to make is coaxial cable running a baseband signal can only transmit or receive

4
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.700
a single signal at any given time.

5
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:29.020
Broadband uses coaxial cable that allows for multiple signals to be sent across the wire at any given

6
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:29.810
time.

7
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.310
Ethernet uses baseband signaling.

8
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.010
In other words 10 base two or ten base five in the past.

9
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.200
So in ten based to correction cable was used.

10
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:47.590
But you can see connectors we use to connect devices to the network a BNC connector would connect the

11
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.360
cable to the PC.

12
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.430
Don't worry too much about this.

13
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.830
This is just a bit of history so that you can understand why things are done in certain ways today.

14
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.560
What's important to realize is that a single piece of cable would have been in-seat connectors which

15
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.710
would allow you to connect devices to a single cable.

16
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.760
Multiple devices were connected across a single cable and at the end you would have Terminators to stop

17
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.750
signals bouncing back and gives an example of a terminator.

18
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:24.400
So what it terminated did is essentially terminate the signal or destroy the signal when it got to the

19
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.680
end of the wire.

20
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.990
So when the signal is sent across the wire it shouldn't bounce back and cause collisions.

21
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.290
So the Terminator would terminate the signal to ensure that it didn't bounce back.

22
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:43.300
Once again the reason for doing this is because baseband is used baseband only allows a single signal

23
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.280
to be sent across the wire or cable at any time.

24
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:53.860
So we couldn't have a signal bouncing back and causing a collision hence terminate as we used.

25
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.020
Now before we continue discussing the transmission of data in more detail let's talk about what a MAC

26
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:08.200
addresses a Media Access Control address or MAC address also called a physical address is a unique identifier

27
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:15.070
assigned to network interfaces and MAC addresses a layer to address identifying a network interface

28
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.550
card or MC.

29
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.600
It is typically boltin by the manufacturer.

30
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:28.360
In other words it's Boente in to the network card Bhave Nic manufacturer and it's 48 bits in length

31
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.070
the 48 bits are divided into two portions.

32
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.100
The UI portion is 24 bits in length and the station address is also 24 bits in length.

33
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:49.360
The UI organizational unique identifier identifies a vendor such as Cisco or HP or Dell or other vendors

34
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.470
that manufacture network devices or PCs or servers.

35
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.320
Each manufacturer is assigned and why.

36
00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:04.780
And each vendor in turn can create and assign and station addresses to Network Interface Cards the station

37
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.270
addresses should be unique.

38
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:14.000
Now they should be unique because there have been cases where addresses have been duplicated by manufacturers.

39
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.540
So you may end up having a network with duplicate MAC addresses which causes a lot of problems in an

40
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.680
Ethernet environment in an Ethernet environment on a segment or a piece of cable.

41
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.920
We're assuming that all devices have a unique MAC address.

42
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.900
It's also possible in software to change device MAC addresses.

43
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:43.230
So my interface card as an example I can go to properties go to configuration selected vaunts I can

44
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:50.060
then go to a locally administrated addresses and then I can change the valley so I could make it quadruple

45
00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.750
a quadruple be quadruple see and click ok.

46
00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:03.790
Opening ACMD prompt and tapping IP config for special and then scrolling up I'll be able to see that

47
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:12.230
my physical MAC address is now set to a b c I've just changed my MAC address from the phone to in the

48
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.960
address set by the manufacturer to something else.

49
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:23.080
Now if I did that on multiple PCs or multiple devices I would be causing an issue with duplicate MAC

50
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.230
addresses.

51
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.190
So once again the first portion of a MAC address is the UI.

52
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:34.050
And the second portion is a unique value assigned by a manufacturer.

53
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:40.070
So on my network card I'll set it back to the default.

54
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:47.610
So now when I run IP config less you'll notice the built in MAC address on my local area connection

55
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.520
uses the unique value assigned by the manufacturer.

56
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.770
Why Asharq has a nice tool to look at.

57
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.210
Oh you like coats.

58
00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:03.610
So I've just added the 0 0 0 1 E6 and that should list the manufacturer for that MAC address.

59
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:11.850
In this case you can see it's HP some MAC addresses that start with triple 0 1 6 hp MAC addresses.

60
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.410
I can also look on the dribbly Web site to see similar information.

61
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.930
Notice that both E-6 and IE 7 codes are manufactured by HP.

62
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:29.190
There's a long list of different codes and you'll be able to see which codes are associated with which

63
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.720
vendor.
