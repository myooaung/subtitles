00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So let’s check if Spanning Tree converges if we shut 1 of the links down.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
On PC 1 I’m gonna ping PC 2 and I wanna repeat that

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
so using question mark (?) I can see the option -c for count

4
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:30.000
so -c a thousand, allows me to send a thousand pings from PC 1 to PC 2.

5
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
What I’ll do now is shut this port on router 2

6
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
which is the port forwarding in Spanning Tree on router 2.

7
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
so to prove that show spanning-tree vlan 1

8
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000
we can see 2/0 is forwarding 2/1 is blocking

9
00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.000
so int f2/0 shut the port down pings failed

10
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.000
so negotiation takes place so sh spanning-tree vlan 1

11
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
notice 2/1 is now listening

12
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
this is using Common Spanning Tree

13
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
so it takes a time to converge, it's now learning

14
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
still learning and notice now the pings are succeeding

15
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and we can see the port is now forwarding.

16
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
So once again show spanning-tree vlan 1

17
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
shows us that common Spanning Tree is being used

18
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
or Compatible Spanning Tree is being used

19
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
this is the 802.1D version of Spanning Tree it's very slow compared to Rapid Spanning Tree

20
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
The port has to go through different states.

21
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So it has to go from listening to learning to forwarding that could take 30 seconds.

22
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000
But we’ve been able to prove that Spanning Tree works well in this topology

23
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I'll no shut the interface.

24
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
So I’ve no shut 2/0 the pings start failing

25
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000
once again, on our PC because spanning tree needs to converge.

26
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So show spanning-tree shows me that port 2/0 is listening, 2/1 is blocking.

27
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000
in the Spanning Tree calculation port 2/0 is a better port to 2/1

28
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
and as you can see now the pings are starting to succeed

29
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
so show spanning-tree

30
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000
we can see port 2/0 is forwarding 2/1 is blocking.

31
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
So that’s an example of how to setup Spanning Tree using an EtherSwitch

32
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
module on GNS3 and how to learn a bit about Spanning Tree.
