00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.100
Now you could configure a P.C. with two default gateways.

2
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.300
In other words set to the default gateway to switch one and switch two.

3
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:15.490
But that doesn't work very well in windows and other operating systems so I could go to my local area

4
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:25.200
connection go to properties change the properties for IP version 4 and try and configure multiple default

5
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:35.390
gateways but that's not going to work very well at all so it's better to set the pieces to use a single

6
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:42.680
default gateway which in this case is the H.S. IP virtual router and it's important to remember that

7
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.230
this is a virtual router not a physical rudder.

8
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:54.490
It doesn't actually exist in our topology but these pieces will be configured to talk to the relevant

9
00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:01.300
virtual IP addresses in the same VLAN and one of the physical switches will fold the traffic on behalf

10
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.660
of the virtual Rada that's once again determined through an election the device where the highest priority

11
00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.920
will become the forward.

12
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:17.410
For a villain so as an example we'll configure switch one with a property of 200 on VLAN 10 and switch

13
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:24.810
to with a property of 200 on VLAN 20 to ensure that such one becomes the active forward air will act

14
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:33.190
of Rata for VLAN 10 and switch to becomes the active of if we land 20 will then test that failover actually

15
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:41.330
takes place by doing a continuous ping between our species he has the console of switch one at the moment

16
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:49.100
show IP interface brief shows us the IP addresses configured on the relevant switched virtual interfaces

17
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.420
or SVM eyes on the switch we'll start with a VLAN 10 so that's the IP address configured on switch one

18
00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:04.130
can a top confetti to go to global conflict mode and then I'll go on to interface VLAN 10 pressing question

19
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:15.350
mark we can see the option standby which allows us to configure H.S. IP so stand by question mark you

20
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:24.680
can create multiple groups that allows you to split the sharing of who is the active Rado within a villain.

21
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.030
I'm not gonna do that here I'll simply create a group of one.

22
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.910
Now you may want to make the group number the same as the villain number in this case I'm not going

23
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:42.700
to do that because I simply want to show you that the same group number can be used on multiple villains.

24
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:50.630
So stand by one specify an IP address and in this case it's the IP address of our virtual router which

25
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:57.830
is going to be ten dot one dot tend to 254 for VLAN ten the site yes IP rather once again doesn't exist

26
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:05.660
we simply configuring the virtual Radha in this case I'm going to configure a priority

27
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.790
rather a stand by priority of 200.

28
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:23.110
The default is 100 but I want to influence the property to ensure that switch one becomes the active

29
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:34.360
Radha for Vreeland 10 we can see already that the switch has become the active router for v lantern

30
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.830
group 1.

31
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.800
Before I do a show command stand by one pre-emption

32
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.760
now what pre-emption does is ensure that such one becomes the active Rada when it's up.

33
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:56.310
So switch one went down and switch to then became the active Rada while switch one is down when switch

34
00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.330
one comes back again pre-emption will ensure that switch one becomes the active rudder again so it'll

35
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:09.090
basically force itself to become the active device we can view H.S. IP information by using the command

36
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:18.520
show standby as you can see here V Line 10 has Group 1 configured the local routers the active router

37
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.310
the virtual IP addresses configured as follows the active virtual Mac address is this.

38
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.260
So this is an HSR P Mac address.

39
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:39.570
Thus a virtual rudder on VLAN 10 is using this Mac address this portion of the Mac addresses the HSR

40
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.620
IP Well known Mac address.

41
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:49.170
So that is a reserved address for HS IP and this portion of the Mac address is a hexadecimal representation

42
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.110
of the group number.

43
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:56.810
Now we created group 1 so in hexadecimal it's shown as 0 1.

44
00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:05.450
If we had created a group of group 10 it would have shown as zero a a being hexadecimal for 10 plus

45
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.480
a cent every three seconds the whole time is 10 seconds at the moment.

46
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.960
No hollows are being received from switch to so switch one has become the active forward.

47
00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:21.160
If there were multiple routers in the topology they would send keeper lives to each other.

48
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.540
And that is how they know whether the other devices available.

49
00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:32.230
As an example when switch to is configured it should be receiving polos from such one every three seconds.

50
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:38.570
If it doesn't for a period of 10 seconds it will become the active router so it will move from standby

51
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.330
to active and we'll test that in a moment.

52
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:48.590
Pre-emption is enabled the active roster is the local router the standby it currently is unknown.

53
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:56.120
We haven't configured switch to with a Jess IP so switch one doesn't know about any standby rota at

54
00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.300
the moment.

55
00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:04.010
The local property of the Roddy is 200 and this is the group name which is the default group name so

56
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:10.670
let's configure switch T and see what happens in the election we'll configure switch to 4 VLAN 10 and

57
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.990
then we'll configure both routers with H.S. IP on VLAN 20.
