00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.610
In this video we get to discuss routing information protocol.

2
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.840
This is a troubleshooting video.

3
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:23.670
We've been told that in this typology wrote one on the left cannot ping Rotto four on the right.

4
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.750
So let's verify that ping 4.4 at 4.4.

5
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.530
We can see that the pings are not succeeding.

6
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.880
So the information that we've been given is correct.

7
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:42.990
I'm going to disable IP domain look up to speed up a trace route and then I'm going to use trace route

8
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:49.950
to forward forward forward for we can see that the trace gets to tend at wondered one or.

9
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.760
But then doesn't get any further.

10
00:00:53.310 --> 00:01:01.460
So show IP ROFFT we have network Forder for that 4.4 in the writing table.

11
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:07.680
It has a distance of 20 and a hop count of three.

12
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:14.910
It's available via standard wondered wondered to the local interface to use to get gigabit 00.

13
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:24.230
So we are learning about that network through a routing protocol which in this case is Ripp IP protocols

14
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:34.580
shows us that RP is enabled on the router and it's learning rots from Tanda wandered one to again when

15
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:42.640
we trace to 4.4 that 4.4 the trace gets to 10 but wondered wondered too and doesn't get any further.

16
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:51.910
So let's have a look at 10 1 1 2 which is rodded to show IP interface brief this atrocity.

17
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.190
This is the IP address that the trace route is getting to.

18
00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.120
But it's not getting any further can we paying quadruple for here.

19
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:07.340
Yes we can show IP route the route is available in the writing table.

20
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:15.050
It was learnt via RUP and we are able to ping network 3:56 that 4.4.

21
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:26.000
So let's have a look on route for if the traffic from both routers gets to the router.

22
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:36.740
So I'll repeat the ping once pings succeeds and we can see that a reply sent back from radio for two

23
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.080
Rodek to 10 1 to 1 the IP address.

24
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:52.010
Now let's do a ping where we specify the source address being tendered one bit one to two and I'll repeat

25
00:02:52.070 --> 00:03:01.700
that once so we pinging from router 2 but we pinging from the gigabit 0 interface the ping fails.

26
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:09.620
Here we told that an echo reply is going to be sent but notice the echo reply didn't get back.

27
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.310
So let's do a debug IP packet here.

28
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.070
Be very careful with this command in the real world.

29
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.560
I'll do the ping again.

30
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.320
And notice what we are seeing here on ratable.

31
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.340
The router doesn't know how to send the traffic back to that again.

32
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.810
We see unreadable on this side.

33
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:41.040
If we paying could triple four and repeat it once

34
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:51.630
we also see unridable messages for destination traffic of 10 that wandered 1.1.

35
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.010
So the traffic is getting too to fall.

36
00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:02.970
But Rob Ford doesn't know how to get back notice in the writing table a Foy's learnt about network 3.3

37
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:10.240
to treat a 3 and 10 1 to zero but it's learnt about no other networks through rap.

38
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.710
So for some reason reform is not learning the rance.

39
00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:23.810
Let's have a look at wrote a three show IP ranked this fraud is learning about the Lubeck of reform.

40
00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:32.050
But it's not learning about network 10 1 1 0 or the Lubeck of wrote a one and wrote it too.

41
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:41.690
So let's have a look at the database the database and Rodda 3 only shows these networks 10 1 2 0 10

42
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:42.650
1 3 0.

43
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.690
These two networks and the loopback of rodders free and four.

44
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.200
It's not learning about this network.

45
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:56.550
And again the loop back to a rate of one and rockety can Rodda three paying rodded too.

46
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:57.770
Yes it can.

47
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:06.210
So we have IP connectivity between the two routers router two is learning about routes from router 3

48
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:14.190
but router 3 is not learning about routes from router to what is show IP protocols show us on both these

49
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:23.620
routers on a TE version 2 is used on all interfaces.

50
00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.930
That's true on router 3 as well.

51
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:34.720
Rotisseries routing for network Taina network 3 router to is writing for network to a network 10 it's

52
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:44.110
got to Gateway's on the side we've also seemingly got to Gateway's but notice how old this entry is.

53
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:49.160
There seems to be a problem with Roths learnt from rodded T.

54
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.110
These entries are fresh.

55
00:05:51.190 --> 00:06:05.110
This looks like a stale entry de-bug IP de-bug IP wrap all up updates being sent and received to sending

56
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:06.210
an update.

57
00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:12.030
2 2 2 4 0 0 9 out of gigabit 0 0.

58
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:20.020
So aversion to using the well-known multicast address it's received an update on gigabit 0 0 sends an

59
00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.940
update out of gigabit 0 0.

60
00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.510
What about on the side sends an update to the loopback.

61
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.220
That's not of great importance.

62
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.540
Sends an update out of gigabit.

63
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:41.760
0 1 cirrhotic 2 is definitely advertising rats to rodef 3 but it doesn't look like rota 3 is receiving

64
00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:43.110
updates on gigabit.

65
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:53.500
0 1 it's sending out an update but where is it receiving an update on gigabit 0 1 it received an update

66
00:06:53.590 --> 00:07:03.490
on gigabit 0 0 but I don't see any updates received on gigabit 0 1 wrote it 2 is definitely sending

67
00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:08.890
updates of gigabit to 0 1 so it's sending updates to router 3.

68
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.910
But it doesn't look like rotisseries receiving those updates.

69
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:18.980
Let's turn off debugging show access list.

70
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:25.180
Can you see the problem show run interface gigabit.

71
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.840
0 or 1.

72
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.810
Can you see the issue.

73
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:35.570
Ripp uses UDP port 520 for updates.

74
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:51.410
So if I use the command access list 100 denie UDP any any equal 520 that would equate to up so show

75
00:07:51.470 --> 00:08:01.230
access list which showed the sentry that entry equates to this entry.

76
00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:05.200
In other words 520 equals RP.

77
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:17.560
So what we need to do as an example is going to Gigabit 0 1 and remove the access group from the interface.

78
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:24.610
So previously we had this IP access group bound inbound on gigabit.

79
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:34.240
0 1 which means that the router would not accept any updates from RP because of this entry.

80
00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:43.930
Notice we are getting matches on that entry so abrupt updates were being denied on Rotto 3 show IP ROFFT

81
00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.380
the IP writing table looks a lot better.

82
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:54.970
We have these entries in the writing table and if we have a look at Rotto for previously noticed we

83
00:08:54.970 --> 00:09:07.760
only had these entries in the writing table but now we see this network as an example so Route 1 is

84
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:15.750
now able to ping the loopback of Rotto for we successfully solved the issue.

85
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.640
Be careful with access lists.

86
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.810
Rupp sends updates on UDP port 520.

87
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:29.030
If you are denying UDP port 520 Ripp updates will not be sent or received.

88
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:34.620
Depending on how you bind your access list whether it's inbound and outbound So be careful with the

89
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.600
access lists.

90
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.180
