00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.240
The VPN config generator makes us very easy to setup.

2
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.730
In this example I've brought a one in router to RADA one has this IP address could ripple 1 Write it

3
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.040
too has this IP address could ripple to on these interfaces rather one is going to be configured with

4
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:22.580
this tunnel number and write it to is going to be configured with us tunnel number but it's very easy

5
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:29.330
to change that kind of information I could change the a name and noticeable change in the diagram and

6
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:38.980
update the configuration accordingly I could as an example decide to use tunnel 100 on both sides rather

7
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:52.120
than using different numbers for the tunnels I could also change the subnet used across the GOP tunnel.

8
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.620
Just make sure that the IP addresses on the same subnet because this is like a point to point link so

9
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.190
the IP addresses need to be in the same subnet.

10
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.710
Click show result and you'll be able to see the details here.

11
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:13.940
So as an example on Rado 1 we can see a description with the link to write it to the IP address tunnel

12
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.730
source and tunnel destination for this tunnel.

13
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.940
You can either use physical interfaces or source IP addresses as the source of the tunnel.

14
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:30.570
In this example we're using physical interfaces he has wrote to once again write a 1 you'll be able

15
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:40.020
to see the description as well as adjustments for maximum transmission unit and negotiation of maximum

16
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.570
transmission unit.

17
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.970
Now adjust MSF is a bigger discussion but essentially it allows end devices to negotiate the size of

18
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.440
empty use so they don't try and send packets that are too big that can't be transmitted across this

19
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.500
link.

20
00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:04.730
We have to reduce once again the size of the payload because of the additional headers added by GOP.

21
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:12.740
You could adjust that to a lower number if necessary so both sides just set the empty you Valley accordingly.

22
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:21.880
Click on Show result and that will then adjust these two commands based on your inputs a more complex

23
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.330
configured rate is also available.

24
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.650
So we have an IP sic configure reader and when I click on Show results here.

25
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:38.380
You'll notice that there is more involved because you have to setup both the encryption and authentication

26
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.730
on this router you have to determine which traffic is interesting you have to set your ISP came PPI

27
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.640
policies as well as your IP SEC policies.

28
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:56.770
So there's more configuration involved but the VPN config generator makes it very easy to select which

29
00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:04.400
options you're going to be using for encryption and authentication and then you simply click on show

30
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.700
results and the configuration will be changed accordingly.
