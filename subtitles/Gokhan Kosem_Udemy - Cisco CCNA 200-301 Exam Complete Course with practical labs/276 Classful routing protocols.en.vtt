00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So now let’s look at the difference between

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
a classful and a classless routing protocol.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Firstly, classful routing protocol do not advertise

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the subnet mask as an example, they would advertise network 10.0.0.0

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
but would not inform other routers of the subnet mask.

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So other routers wouldn’t know if this is a /8 or /24 mask.

7
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Now this becomes very important in routing because for example

8
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
if I had a PC configured with an IP address of 10.1.1.1

9
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and your Pc had an IP address of 10.1.2.1 are our PCs in the same subnet?

10
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Well that very depends because if the subnet mask used is /8

11
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
then our PC's are on the same subnet but if the mask used is /24

12
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
then our PC's are not in the same subnet.

13
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
This makes routing very difficult

14
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
so what classful routing protocols do

15
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
is they assume that everyone else is using the same subnet mask as they are.

16
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So in other words, if they received a routing update

17
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
with a network of 10.0.0.0 on a interface

18
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
where the IP addresses configured with /24 mask

19
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
the router will assume that other routers will also using with /24 mask.

20
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Now we all know that making assumptions can be very, very dangerous.

21
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
What this means is that routers assumed network consistency

22
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
in other words, that the same mask is used in the network.

23
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The routers assume that everyone else is using the same subnet mask

24
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
as they are and that all mask are the same.

25
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
In other words, everyone is using a /24 mask

26
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
that’s not scalable or deployable in networks today

27
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
so in today's networks, we don’t use classful routing protocols such as RIP version 1.

28
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
classful routing protocols also summarized routes across classful boundaries.

29
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
So when you go from a class A subnet like 10.0.0.0

30
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
to a class B subnet like 172.16.0.0

31
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
the routers will automatically summarize all subnets to the classful boundary.

32
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:41.000
In other words a subnet of 10.1.1.0/24 will be summarize to 10.0.0.0/8

33
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
example of classful routing protocols include RIP version 1 and IGRP

34
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
IGRP is no longer used and you shouldn’t be using RIP version 1.
