00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:03.750
So let's get started configuring jury tunnels.

2
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:11.600
In this example write a one and write a five are configured as pieces topping the show IP right.

3
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.840
Come on shows me that no routing is enabled on this rudder a default gateway has been configured to

4
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.110
10 1 1 2.

5
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:30.130
Now I disabled routing on the rudder using the command no IP routing so this router doesn't even have

6
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.120
a routing table as you would expect from a normal rudder.

7
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:43.160
I've turned off routing and essentially turned the rudder into a P.C. the rudder can ping its default

8
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:54.180
gateway which is right at too but cannot ping router 5 and that's because no routing has been configured

9
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.080
on rudder 3

10
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.380
rudder 3 has only been configured with IP addresses.

11
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:10.210
The command show IP rot on rudder 3 shows us that it has directly connected interfaces it has an interface

12
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:19.390
here and an interface here but no routing is configured the only configuration at the moment is IP addresses

13
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.320
on these interfaces and the interfaces have been enabled.

14
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.080
Once we've configured this topology however rudder one should be able to ping wrote A5 without rudder

15
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.910
3 having any visibility of the Ten Network's ten is once again in RF C 1918 address.

16
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.800
In other words it's a private IP address.

17
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.570
I've used network 4 which is part of Level 3 on the Internet.

18
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.960
So this is a public IP address that belongs to an ISP.

19
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.980
So I'm doing that in this topology to emulate the Internet.

20
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:58.240
And once again wrote 3 and this example has no visibility of this network or this network and we are

21
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.880
not going to configure it with any visibility of these private IP addresses.

22
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:11.040
But when the jury tunnel is configured logically traffic is going to go across this Ethernet interface

23
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.560
hit this rather go through the tunnel come out of the tunnel and go across the seas and at interface

24
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.280
and hit rate of 5 and return back through the tunnel.

25
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.820
So we should have connectivity between rudder 1 and rudder 5 I wrote at 2 and rather 4 have static default

26
00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.130
rates pointing to rudder 3.

27
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.820
So in this example rudder 2 is configured with an Internet facing IP address as well as internal IP

28
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.890
address on Fost Ethan at 0 0.

29
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:47.120
And once again with a default gateway pointing to rather 3 rather 4 has something similar.

30
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:56.120
Show up he wrote shows default not pointing to 10 1 2 1 which is rather 3.

31
00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:03.480
We have an Internet facing interface and an internal interface but at the moment no tunnels have been

32
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:10.410
configured on these riders so on router 4 we see faster Ethernet 0 0.

33
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:19.880
We see serial to slash 0 but we don't see a tunnel interface and on route to the same is true.

34
00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.860
There's fast Ethernet.

35
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.180
00.

36
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.690
Here is serial to slash 0 so that's the initial topology.

37
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:34.020
Now let's configure that tunnel between router 2 and router 4 and prove that we can send traffic from

38
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.430
Rado 1 2 out of 5.
