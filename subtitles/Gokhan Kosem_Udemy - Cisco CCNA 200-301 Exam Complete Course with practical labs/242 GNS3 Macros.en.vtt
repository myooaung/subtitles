00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
You can view VLANs using the sh vlan-switch brief command.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The developers have made this a lot easier for us because they've created macros.

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So VL displays the VLANs such as the following.

4
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
this command allows us to add a vlan

5
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
notice we need to be in configure mode so configure VA 3

6
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and you can see a macro has been run

7
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
so do sh vlan or sh vlan-switch

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:42.000
shows me that, that vlan has been added

9
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I could also just do VL which shows something similar,

10
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
so the developers have made it easier

11
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
by allowing you to pre-create an EtherSwitch module

12
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
but be aware this is still just a Cisco router with an EtherSwitch module inserted.

13
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So you can do it either the hard way as I demonstrated

14
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
or use some of the pre-built options available within GNS3.
