1
00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:08.720
So yes which one show IP interface brief we can see the IP address of switch one on VLAN 10 is tendered

2
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.250
one attended one shows stand by.

3
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:23.230
Shows me that the switch is the active router for VLAN 10.

4
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:34.090
So what I'll do now a ping from Rod a 1 to Router true but make that continuous with a thousand pings

5
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:43.990
so quantity interface VLAN 10 if I press enter to shut that down I'll start the continuous ping on router

6
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.520
1 and now shut the interface on switch.

7
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:57.580
1 as you can see here the state went from active to in it and we losing pings on right 1.

8
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:10.270
We now however getting successful pings through two shows stand by on switch one notice

9
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.860
that is the switch has a state of init because the interface is down so active Rod is a known stand

10
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:30.400
by Rod is unknown on VLAN 20 it is still the standby Radha however on switch to show standby.

11
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:39.450
Shows me that this switch is now the active router the standby Rod is unknown.

12
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:46.980
So once again at the moment broader one can still ping right up to and brought it to can still ping

13
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:54.640
not a one we've just shut down VLAN 10 on switch 1 which means the rudder one cannot ping switch one

14
00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:02.680
on VLAN 10 and we can prove that by doing a ping to tendered one tendered one the IP address of switch

15
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:12.190
one on VLAN 10 notice the pings are failing and that's because the interface is shut down on switch

16
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.460
one

17
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:25.840
but rather one acting as P.S. One is still able to communicate to the virtual Radha

18
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.380
because switch to is now replying as the virtual Radha and is forwarding traffic on behalf of the virtual

19
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:46.480
Radha on switch to as an example if we do debug IP ICMP and write a 1 pings that a virtual IP address

20
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:54.890
notice we see the output on switch to switch to is acting as the virtual rudder and rudder one believes

21
00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:03.360
it's still talking to this H.S. IP device so now let's do the reverse process we'll do a ping again

22
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:11.490
from right one to write it 2 through the network and let's see what happens when we bring up the V Line

23
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:22.370
interface on switch one so do the ping again no shut on switch one shows stand by

24
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.380
to show Stand by.

25
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.590
I notice it went from listen to active while I was doing that.

26
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.440
So the local router is the active Roorda the standby Rada is unknown at the moment

27
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:53.140
standby radar is switched to and pings are now succeeding so we were able to prove that rather one acting

28
00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:01.010
as P.S. One competing rudder to acting as P.S. to through this four network even when we bring down

29
00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.090
one of the interfaces.

30
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:11.740
Now you may be thinking that it takes too long for the pings to continue but that's based on these timers

31
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.200
which we can change the default.

32
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:14.820
Hello Thomas.

33
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:22.730
Three seconds the default hole timer is 10 seconds at the moment we didn't change the config of HAARP

34
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:23.490
timers.

35
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.650
We just left them at the default.

36
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:34.360
But I could type stand by one timers and I can actually specify millisecond timers but for now I'll

37
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:42.220
just specify a hollow timer of one second and a whole time of three seconds.

38
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:51.040
So copy that config and go on to switch to the villain 10 and change the timers.

39
00:04:51.070 --> 00:05:03.040
So do show run interface VLAN 10 that's the config of HAARP on switch to a villain 10 and to show run

40
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.630
interface VLAN 10 on switch one that's the config on switch one.

41
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:16.470
So let's do that test again interface VLAN 10 before I press enter.

42
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.460
Let's do a ping again.

43
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:26.790
Pings of succeeding shut down the interface notice we only lost two pings in this example because I

44
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.100
reduced the time this switch one went from active to in it

45
00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:39.980
switch to notice on VLAN 10 group 1 went from standby to active.

46
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:48.240
So we've managed to improve the performance with a loss of only two pings in this topology.

47
00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:55.030
Now once again you can reduce the packets lost even more by using millisecond time as rather than second

48
00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:56.010
timers.

49
00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:03.220
But for this topology and for the CCMA those timers are good enough so I'll do the ping again and then

50
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.530
no shut the interface.

51
00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:14.260
Let's see how many pings we least Shia so interfaces come up we've gone from listen to active

52
00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:27.170
to show standby local Radha is the active Radha standby Radha is switched to and we didn't lose any

53
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:28.080
pings at all.

54
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.320
So that's a much better response than what we had previously.

55
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.050
That's an example of HS or P in a switched environment.

56
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:41.720
Showing you what happens when an interface or switch goes down I shut down an interface rather than

57
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:47.600
rebooting the switch just to make it happen quicker and allow us to see changes more easily.

58
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.540
But you would see something similar if you rebooted an entire switch or rather when using HS or P.
