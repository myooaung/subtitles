00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In the previous video in this topology

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
the switches were configured with host names

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and unused interfaces were shutdown.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So as an example, switch 4 was given a name of S4

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and any unused interfaces were shut down on the switch.

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The VTP mode was set to transparent and VLAN 10 and 20

7
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
were created on the 4 switches in this topology.

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Router 1 and router 2, acting as PCs in the topology

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
were configured with IP addresses on their FastEthernet interfaces.

10
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Router 3 was also configured with an IP address

11
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
in FastEthernet 0/0 as well as on FastEthernet 0/1.

12
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The switches will also configure with IP addresses.

13
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So the access layer switches were configured

14
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
with IP addresses in the management VLAN.

15
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Which in this example is gonna be VLAN 1 the default.

16
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The core switches were configured with 3 IP addresses.

17
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
1 in VLAN 1, 1 in VLAN 10 and 1 in VLAN 20.

18
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
In this video, the interfaces on the switches will be configured as either trunks

19
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
so these ports will be configured as trunks or access ports

20
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
So on the access switches, gigabit 0/2 on both switch 3 and switch 4

21
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
will be configured as an access port in the relevant VLAN

22
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Once we’ve got this configured properly, the routers acting as PCs

23
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
should be able to ping the core switch IP addresses in the same VLAN.

24
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So switch 1 core switch.

25
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
This interfaces gonna be configured as trunk ports.

26
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
This interface will be configured as an access port in VLAN 1

27
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
which is connected to Solarwinds network performance monitor.

28
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
In a later video, I’ll show you how to integrate NPM with this topology

29
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
using SNMP so that we can manage these switches and the routers using SNMP.

30
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
So switch 1, first thing to check is which VLANs are configured on the switch.

31
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
So I configured the commands sh vlan or sh vlan brief

32
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
sh vlan brief shows me that vlan 1 is configured.

33
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And all these interfaces belong to VLAN 1, VLAN 10 and VLAN 20 have been configured

34
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
but no interfaces have been put into VLAN 10 or VLAN 20.

35
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I could also do a command such as sh int gigabit 0/0 switchport

36
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
So here’s the command

37
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and its shows me that this interface g0/0 is enabled as a switchport.

38
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
In other words, it’s a layer 2 interface not a layer 3 interface.

39
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
So it’s acting as a layer 2 switch interface rather than as a routed interface.

40
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
This switch is going to be negotiating the encapsulation

41
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
as well as the negotiation of trunking.

42
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
In other words, it’s using dynamic trunking protocol or DTP.

43
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Now rather than using that were going to statically configure the trunk port

44
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and access ports rather than relying on DTP.

45
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
It’s recommended that you disable DTP.

46
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
The access mode VLAN is 1.

47
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
In other words, if this port negotiates to be an access port

48
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
it’s gonna be in VLAN 1 and the native or untagged VLAN

49
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
on the trunk port when it's a trunk port will be in VLAN 1.

50
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000
We can see other information here including the VLANs allowed across the trunk.

51
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
All VLANs are allowed by default.

52
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Pruning is enabled for VLANs 2 to 1001

53
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
so conf t rather than configuring each interface individually

54
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
I’m gonna configure a range of interfaces.

55
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:47.000
So interface range gigabit is 0/0 to gigabit 0/0 - 3

56
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
so I’m gonna configure this interface

57
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
this interface, this interface, and this interface to the range command.

58
00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Notice what happens when I trying change the mode to trunk.

59
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
I’m told that the command is rejected

60
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
an interface whose trunking capsulation is set to auto

61
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000
cannot be configured to trunk mode so the command failed on gigabit 0/0.

62
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
On some Cisco switches including this one

63
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
you need to specify the trunk encapsulation

64
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
before you change the mode to trunk.

65
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
this switch supports 802.1Q and ISL

66
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and can negotiate encapsulation with the neighbor

67
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
so I want to explicitly set the encapsulation to dot1q

68
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:44.000
and now I’ll be able to type switchport mode trunk and then I can type end.

69
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
So let’s look at how the interface is changed.

70
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Before I do that notice interface VLAN 10 and interface VLAN 20 have come up.

71
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
These are SVIs on the switch.

72
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
So sh int g0/0 switchport

73
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
You can see that the administrative mode is trunk

74
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
and the current operational mode is trunk.

75
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
I have manually or statically set this interface to trunk.

76
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Previously the administrative mode was dynamic auto

77
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
the interface was using dynamic trunk protocol or DTP

78
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
to negotiate with neighboring switches to set up trunking.

79
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
But now we’ve configured it to manually trunk.
