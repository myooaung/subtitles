00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:04.210
So here are my devices.

2
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:12.640
First thing is let's configure the Rodda so deface fust.

3
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.670
Ethan it is 0 0.

4
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.240
No shut interface first.

5
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:26.040
Ethan It's 0 0 1 so I'm going to create a sub interface with IP address 10 1 2 1 2 2 5 4.

6
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.810
But notice what's going to happen when I press enter.

7
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:36.940
I'm told that configuring IP routing on a LAN sub interface is only allowed if that sub interfaces are

8
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.850
ready configured as part of an ADA to that one.

9
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:50.620
Q So the line from the top and kept isolation got one key line one and this is on native land untagged.

10
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:59.980
Vigeland So now I can put the IP address on that sub interface second something to face in kept solution.

11
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:13.760
Got one key villain to IP Address 10 1 to 2 2 5 4 slushed 24 mosque suit sub interface.

12
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:24.090
This is going to be encapsulation dupped one key violent three an IP address 10 1 3 2 5 4 slushed 24

13
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.790
mosque.

14
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:31.620
So it does show run pipe begin face.

15
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.000
So here is our first interface here.

16
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:44.950
Our office three sub interfaces that's how you configure in TV land routing on a Rotto on a stick.

17
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:52.810
So lets configure our PCs show IP shows that PC one doesn't currently have an IP address.

18
00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:12.260
So IP Tendo one to one slash 24 mosque default gateway is the Raanta PC to IP Address 10 or to treat

19
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.800
one

20
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:23.910
turned out one to three to five for so PC one ping its default gateway.

21
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.350
Yes it can.

22
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.510
What about PC to.

23
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.800
It can also ping its default gateway.

24
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.970
So these two PCs can paying Rato one on the respect of sub interfaces.

25
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.080
Can the PCs ping each other.

26
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:53.770
PC one paying 10 1 3 1 Ping's succeeds PC to paying $10 one to two to one Ping's succeeds that traffic

27
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.350
is being switched to the Rodda being interval and routed and sent back to PC to

28
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.190
all deal with shock capture in a moment.

29
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.490
But notice what happens when I shut the physical interface Foster Ethan it is 0 0

30
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:21.260
PC one is no longer able to ping PC to when no shut the interface on the Rodda

31
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.500
interface comes up and pings start succeeding.

32
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:36.440
That's how you configure it to switch with different villans and an external Rodda acting as a Rotto

33
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.970
on a stick during the interview and routing.

34
00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:46.020
So now let's run a one shot capture so we can see what's actually happening.

35
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:56.250
I'm going to run the y shall capture on the switch so we can see the frames going to the Rodda.

36
00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.960
So when PC one Ping's PC two we should see that it's tagged with relend too.

37
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.350
But when it comes back again from the Rodda it's tagged with the LAN three

38
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.550
PC one ping PC to.

39
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:25.620
So we can see the traffic from 10 1 to 1 going to 10 1 3 1 in the frame.

40
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:35.910
We can see it's tagged with the line to the destination MAC address of this frame.

41
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.500
He's the rodef show interface is 0 0

42
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.100
notice the Mac address.

43
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:51.680
See 2 0 1 1 e 3 C quadruple 0.

44
00:04:51.680 --> 00:05:00.640
So that frame is going to the router tagged with Villon to he has another frame.

45
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:07.680
Notice the source Mac address is the router and the villain ID is Villon 3.

46
00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:15.320
So what's happened is the frame arrived on port 1 was sent out a port three going to the Rodda tagged

47
00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:23.540
with land to and was received back from the Rodda going to PC to get received on this port tagged as

48
00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.880
villaine 3.

49
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:32.400
And once again there's the frame going to the Rodda tagged with the Leonti.

50
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:41.370
Here's the frame from the Rodda source mac address of the router tagged with villaine 3 the IP packet

51
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.660
is stole from PC one going to PC to.

52
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.780
So what about the return traffic.

53
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.510
Yes.

54
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:55.290
Traffic from PC to note is tagged with violent three going to the rodder.

55
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.390
So that's the frame here going to the router.

56
00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:05.370
Here's the frame from the router tagged with the Leonti.

57
00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:11.910
So once again hits untagged hits the switch is tagged as Villines 3 to the Rodda.

58
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.080
It's in TV land rodded tagged is violent to send sent back to the switch.

59
00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.510
Untagged 2 pc 1.

60
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:30.990
So we are seeing the tag frame on pork's 3 from PC to to the Rodda tagged in villaine 3.

61
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:36.790
And then here from the router two PC one tagged in the land to.
