00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.850
In this video I'm going to show you how to download and install Cisco Packet Tracer on a Mac.

2
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.290
In this example I'm running Cisco is Catalina

3
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.310
now Cisco packet Tracy's free software that you can download from the Cisco website.

4
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.390
All you need to do is register for free course.

5
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.610
You don't have to take the course if you don't want to but you need to register and then you'll be able

6
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.540
to download Cisco Packet Tracer.

7
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.990
So I'll show you how to register for that course how to download the software how to get it running

8
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:49.100
on a Mac how to create a basic topology and explain a few features within Cisco Packet Tracer.

9
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.950
So once again I'm running Mac OS Catalina I'm going to open up a web browser and I'm simply going to

10
00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:02.760
search for Cisco Packet Tracer my first hit is the network CAD Web site.

11
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:09.870
So Medicaid courses Packet Tracer now in the past you had to have a dedicated logging to this Web site

12
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.220
so you had a dedicated log in for the Networking Academy Web site that was different to Cisco dot com.

13
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.750
Now this same log in is used.

14
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.520
So if you have a Cisco log in you can simply log in to the Medicaid web site using your Cisco credentials.

15
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.200
If you don't have a log in scroll down and click and roll to download Packet Tracer.

16
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.800
This course is an introduction to Cisco Packet Tracer.

17
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.680
It's 10 hours in length.

18
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.150
It's once again free.

19
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.630
But you do need to sign up for this course if you want to download Cisco packet tracer and you don't

20
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.040
have a Cisco log in.

21
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.650
So I'm going to click sign up today select English and I'm going to specify my logging details.

22
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.850
So first name last name and email address.

23
00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.450
Now you email address has to be a valid e-mail address by going to email you some details it has to

24
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:12.890
be a valid email address so once I've done that and I've clicked submit I'm told to check my email and

25
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:19.400
click on the Get Started link to access your account self now received an email from the Cisco Networking

26
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:28.210
Academy they click activate account to activate my account so I need to specify my email address my

27
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.780
first name last name I need to specify my country and company.

28
00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.580
And let me give you a hint.

29
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:43.580
If you don't work for a company specify the company itself as in self-employed so specify your country

30
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.110
specify your company itself.

31
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:57.090
If you don't work for a company put in your password reconfirm that enter the capture information refresh

32
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.240
it.

33
00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:06.650
If you can't read it decide whether you want to receive emails or not and click register registration

34
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:15.110
process is now complete and we're told that we'll be redirected to log in some to specify my email address

35
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:24.910
into my password and click sign in we told that they were excited to have us join them.

36
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:31.990
But they need more information so we need to specify First Name Last Name Email address specified whether

37
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:41.500
we want to receive important emails from Cisco Networking Academy specify gender country specify state

38
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:50.840
how many years we've been in the networking industry do we have a disability specify OUR BIRTH DATE

39
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.450
SO THEY want quite a bit of personal information here.

40
00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:01.860
Decide if you want to disclose your race and whether you've served in the US military and then click

41
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.740
Create Account.

42
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:11.760
OK so there you go we've now registered and we have access to the network Academy website.

43
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.030
You can launch the course at this point if you want to but I'm not going to do that.

44
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:23.810
I'm going to close that and go to resources download Packet Tracer scrolling down there are different

45
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:30.770
versions of Cisco Packet Tracer there are Windows versions Linux version but what we want is Mac OS

46
00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.710
so I'm going to click the download link for Mac OS and I'm going to download Cisco Packet Tracer to

47
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:44.120
my computer so all you need to do now is wait for that download to complete Cisco packet traces about

48
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:50.970
146 Meg and size as you can see there are a few steps that you have to take to download Cisco Packet

49
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.930
Tracer but it is free software.

50
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.730
In the past you had to be part of the Networking Academy that's no longer true.

51
00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:05.050
Anyone can download Cisco Packet Tracer by simply registering on the Cisco Web site okay.

52
00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:13.960
The software has downloaded I'm going to double click on the DMV file and then double click on the installation

53
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.290
app

54
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.180
we warned that this application was downloaded from the Internet.

55
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.000
Do we really want to open it.

56
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.260
Yes we do.

57
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.660
Some may click open the package traced the setup was it displays.

58
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.710
I'm going to click continue

59
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:38.560
to install the software you need to accept the license agreement so read through that and click Accept

60
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:39.940
of a license.

61
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:46.440
Click Continue and then click install Cisco Packet Tracer is now being installed.

62
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:52.230
So it's a fairly simple installation process you simply need to agree to the license and install the

63
00:05:52.230 --> 00:06:00.690
software put in your password to allow Packet Tracer to make changes the installation has finished.

64
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:07.430
So I'm going to click continue and click done okay so there you go packet tracer has now installed so

65
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:13.220
I can search for that on my Mac and start a Cisco Packet Tracer.

66
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:18.650
Now because we running Packet Tracer for the first time we told that user files will be stored in this

67
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.780
directory we can change that through preferences at a later time.

68
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:24.640
I'm okay with that.

69
00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.360
Someone click Okay.

70
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.690
As you can see packet traces starting up now when packet traces starts up.

71
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:39.160
We need to specify our user name or email so I'm going to do that and click Next specify my password

72
00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:45.460
and click sign in and there you go packet traces is now running on my Mac.

73
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.400
Once again I'm using Mako as Catalina in this example.

74
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:57.310
I've got Cisco packet tracer version 7 to 2 running on my Mac.

75
00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:04.900
Now Cisco Packet Tracer supports a lot of devices we have routers so various types of riders switches

76
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:16.510
hubs wireless devices firewalls when emulation devices they are end devices such as pieces laptops various

77
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:20.800
home devices we can program Internet of Things.

78
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:28.920
There are various connection types but to get us started let's build a basic network of Cisco devices.

79
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:35.860
Here's a router cell select the rider and then click in the workspace and add it to the workspace area

80
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:37.990
or topology area.

81
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:45.320
So here's my first router I'll select a second router so I've got right of one and right to now I'll

82
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:52.100
select a switch and let's take a 35 60 and add that to the topology.

83
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:55.580
Now you can change the icons if you like.

84
00:07:55.580 --> 00:08:02.060
I'll show you how to do that in a separate video so you could change to the logical or physical view

85
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:03.810
of your devices.

86
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:09.360
But for now let's select connections various connection types can be used.

87
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:12.680
So we could allow it to automatically choose the connection type.

88
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:19.880
We've got console straight through cables crossover cables fibre cables phone cables etc. But in this

89
00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.480
example I'm going to select straight through copper cable.

90
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:31.550
Select the first router first Ethernet interface select the first Ethernet interface on the switch and

91
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:38.270
I'll just zoom in here to make sure that it's easier to see what I'll do here just to show you the process

92
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.700
is deletes this connection.

93
00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:41.840
Press escape

94
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:52.610
selected my ethernet cable selected the first Ethernet interface on the router first Ethernet interface

95
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:59.300
on the switch select straight through copper again second Ethernet interface on the switch first Ethan

96
00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:05.030
it interface on the router K that zoom is not showing the icons very nicely but you can change the icons

97
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:12.500
if you like Cisco packet tracer today is very powerful if you go to Cisco packet trace preferences you

98
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:19.400
can change as an example the font of your CLIA interface and I'm gonna want to do this because otherwise

99
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:27.200
it's going to be too small something to set it to 18 and click apply you can change the way the interface

100
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:35.120
looks so as an example Shope put labels in the logical workspace and that shows us our interface labels

101
00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:45.040
in this topology diagram notice at the moment the interfaces are down Cisco routers by default have

102
00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.250
their interfaces shut down.

103
00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:55.630
Here's a view of my router I can zoom in and as you can see there are two gigabit interfaces on this

104
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:59.530
writer I could add modules to the right if I wanted to

105
00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:11.030
I need to give packet tracer rights to do stuff on my computer so I'll do that and then what I'll try

106
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:15.390
and do is add that module to the router I can't because it's currently powered on.

107
00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:20.830
So if I wanted to add a module to the right I need to turn the rudder off and then I can add the module

108
00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:28.420
to the rider and then I could turn it on again so if I go to the CLIA you'll see that the road is currently

109
00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.900
booting up.

110
00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:36.490
Now again if this font is too small what you can do is go to Cisco Packet Tracer preferences go to font

111
00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:40.330
and then let's make this even bigger let's make it 20 and click apply

112
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:51.030
and what you can see there is the font is bigger rather interfaces as I was saying are by default shut

113
00:10:51.030 --> 00:11:01.100
down switch interfaces are by default up when the device is turned on but the switch is currently off

114
00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:07.230
so if I go to see a lie We're told that the device must be powered on.

115
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:14.500
So I need to add a power supply to the switch and now the switch starts booting up.

116
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:21.070
If I go to the second router zoom in.

117
00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:27.780
No modules added but as you can see here the router has booted up.

118
00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:32.860
Now you can change the labels of your devices.

119
00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:37.500
So what I'll do is I'll change them to the following.

120
00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:42.970
I'll call this right to rather than write a one and that broader one and the switch one on right at

121
00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:47.390
two I'll bypass the initial configuration dialog.

122
00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.370
That was an older way of configuring devices.

123
00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:57.170
I wouldn't recommend that you use that a press Enter to get started and I'm now in what's called the

124
00:11:57.170 --> 00:12:07.110
user mode on the router user mode allows you to view options or outputs on the device but not make changes

125
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.650
to it.

126
00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:15.860
So as an example I can type show a version to see the version of router so I type quite quickly there

127
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:17.160
so let me go back.

128
00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:23.970
That command show version shows me the version of operating system that this writer is using.

129
00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:26.750
It's running Cisco XY software.

130
00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:32.100
Here's the version of software 15 dot five.

131
00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:38.970
I can see that to the right according to packet tracer has been up for five minutes and spacebar allows

132
00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:42.240
me to see one page of output at a time.

133
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:49.020
If I type E and press tab that order completes the command and thus takes me to what's called privilege

134
00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.620
mode or enable mode.

135
00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:58.200
This gives me full rights to the system it's kind of like it administrator in Windows or root in Linux

136
00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:08.010
gives me a lot more privileges to do things such as go to configure mode I'm going to type C O an F

137
00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.980
and press tab t tab.

138
00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:17.250
This takes me to what's called Global configuration mode and I can now configure things on this device

139
00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:18.670
such as the hostname.

140
00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:22.180
So I typed H O host tab.

141
00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:28.020
Question Mark tells me what options are available and what I'll do here is specify the hostname of the

142
00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:34.600
writer so hostname We'll be right to on interface so type I N T.

143
00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:36.440
Tab gigabit.

144
00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:38.500
0 0 0 so g.

145
00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:47.180
Tab question mark shows me the options available carriage return here sir on interface gigabit.

146
00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:48.330
0 0 0.

147
00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:48.960
I'm gonna type.

148
00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:49.950
No shut.

149
00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:54.860
Notice the interface when Green interface has come up.

150
00:13:55.260 --> 00:14:02.790
Specify an IP address in this case I'll specify 10 1 1 2 with a subnet mask of that type.

151
00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:06.460
And that takes me back to privilege mode or enable mode.

152
00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:12.840
And I'm going to type the copy running config startup config to save the broader configuration.

153
00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:17.810
What I've done here is configure an IP address on this right write it to.

154
00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:22.890
Now the reason why this is green is because switches run something called spanning tree which helps

155
00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:28.940
stop loops in a topology suspending tree takes a while to converge or sort things out.

156
00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:34.020
So this will go green and there it's just done that once spanning tree has determined that there are

157
00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.960
no loops in the topology.

158
00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:43.320
I'll go back to write a one bypass the initial configuration dialog press Enter two or return to get

159
00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.280
started.

160
00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:51.540
Type enable notice I can use shortcut commands rather than typing the full command and I could specify

161
00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:55.140
the hostname as write a one interface gigabit.

162
00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:56.820
0 0 0.

163
00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:03.630
No shut which is actually no shut down to enable the interface interfaces come up and I can specify

164
00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:07.740
an IP address of 10 1 1 1 and a subnet mask.

165
00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:14.370
Now I've just decided to use these IP addresses you could use any IP address that you want to use that

166
00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:16.260
makes sense in your topology.

167
00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.360
I typed end yet to go back to privilege mode.

168
00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.140
Now once the interface has gone green.

169
00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:28.290
In other words once spanning tree has converged I'll be able to ping the other rider for the moment

170
00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:35.430
alt ping myself as a test so rider 1 has pinged its IP address you can see the IP address of the rider

171
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:41.640
by typing show IP interface brief this IP address is configured on this interface.

172
00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:45.810
So I've been able to ping myself in this topology.

173
00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:53.580
I won't be able to ping Rider 2 until spending 3 converges because spanning tree blocks traffic as in

174
00:15:53.580 --> 00:16:00.000
pings or any type of normal user traffic until the network has converged.

175
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.850
And as you can see there the pings started succeeding.

176
00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:05.210
Once the interface went green.

177
00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:11.710
In other words once spanning tree had converged and now I'll be able to ping Rider 2.

178
00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:13.350
Now it's running a little bit slow here.

179
00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:14.880
There it's a bit quicker.

180
00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.880
Don't worry too much about that.

181
00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:19.170
The moral of the story is that right.

182
00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:26.280
One can ping Rider 2 and ride it to camping rider 1 and there you go.

183
00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:34.150
Last thing I want to do once again is save my configuration so copy of Running config startup config.

184
00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.830
Save the rider configuration.

185
00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:41.990
That's a longer way to do it but that's the way they will teach you to do it in the CCMA.

186
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.660
I typically type w are much quicker way of doing it.

187
00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.130
That's an older command.

188
00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:49.920
Saves you a lot more time.

189
00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.260
Now we haven't done any configuration on the switch.

190
00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:59.850
I can bypass the initial switch configuration dialog type enable conf t takes me to global config mode

191
00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:04.130
give the switch a name and in this example I'll simply do that.

192
00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:10.230
Save the config so I've given the switch a name but I haven't done anything else on the switch at this

193
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:10.550
point.

194
00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:18.090
I could close my packet tracer topology down but I'm told that I'll lose my changes don't want to save

195
00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:19.370
them and the answer is yes.

196
00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:22.080
Give it a name.

197
00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:31.890
So my first packet tracer network and click save and then save the topology.

198
00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.900
Let's start packing tracer up once again.

199
00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:37.550
So I'll start it up.

200
00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:45.840
I'll go to file open recent files select my packet trace the network and there you go the topology has

201
00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.350
been restored.

202
00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.820
Now our interface labels are not showing nicely.

203
00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:58.680
So what I prefer to do is manually configure my interface labels but you can decide based on this option

204
00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:06.030
whether you want to display port labels in a logical workspace so it's interesting in this example is

205
00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:09.720
packet traces not displaying the interface labels nicely.

206
00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:16.330
What I tend to do is place a note here and then specify my interface labels like that.

207
00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:25.620
Once I did that it actually showed them properly but you could use this option where you manually add

208
00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:35.870
the labels and what I like about that is you can control where the labels are in your topology So I'm

209
00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:39.010
to go to Cisco packet tracer preferences.

210
00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:47.160
I'm going to not show the port labels and then I'm going to manually move these around where I want

211
00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.320
them to be in the topology.

212
00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:52.200
So I prefer doing it that way.

213
00:18:52.200 --> 00:19:00.450
I'll go back on to write a 1 C ally the router has booted up now so typing able.

214
00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:04.180
Can we ping it too from writer 1.

215
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.090
And the answer is yes we can.

216
00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:11.950
So I've shown you now how to download and install Cisco packet tracer on a Mac.

217
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.600
I've shown you how to create a topology how to save that topology how to restore it.

218
00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:19.780
Basically how to use the basics of Cisco packet tracer.

219
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:24.900
Have a look at the course on Cisco's website if you want to learn more about the options available within

220
00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:25.860
Cisco Packet Tracer.

221
00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:30.990
I'm not going to try and show you in my videos all the options within the Cisco Packet Tracer software

222
00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:36.840
Cisco have already created a free course that shows you that I'm going to show you specific options

223
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:42.750
for the CCMA exam and how to practically use this to learn networking.
