00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:17.000
So six to four tunnels must use this address range 2002 colon colon slash 16 as I've mentioned this

2
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.110
is a special address signed by the Ayana specifically for six to tunnels.

3
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.740
The advantage of this method is it allows for the establishment of automatic tunnels and it gives a

4
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.510
prefix to the attached IP version 6 network.

5
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:40.870
The version for address is converted to hexadecimal and added to this address so 16 bits plus 32 bits

6
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.000
gives you 48.

7
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So the subnets must have a mosque slash 48.

8
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:55.210
Note this IP address 1 9 2 1 6 8 9 9 1 which is the IP address of rota of one's interface connecting

9
00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:02.560
to this IP version 4 infrastructure 1 6 x 32 out one is the IP address of router 2 and acting to the

10
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.470
IP version for infrastructure.

11
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:12.950
Now using a Windows calculator one and two in decimal equals zero in hexadecimal.

12
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.750
1 6 8 in decimal equals 8 in hexadecimal.

13
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:29.510
In other words this portion of the address is the hexadecimal representation of this IP address.

14
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.910
This portion of this address is the hexadecimal representation of 191 ex-city not one.

15
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:45.580
So when traffic is sent from this MacBook to this network router one knows that it needs to encapsulate

16
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:55.990
that traffic and send it to 1 9 2 1 6 8 0 1 and vice versa when the server sends traffic to this MacBook

17
00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.690
on this network.

18
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.850
It's going to send it to its default gateway router to router to knows that it needs to send that traffic

19
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:11.110
to this IP address which is the IP address of router one because of the information contained in the

20
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:19.360
IP version 6 address router to encapsulate that IP version 6 traffic inside an IP version 4 tunnel and

21
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.270
send it to Route 1.

22
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:28.690
We will then deescalate it and send it as an IP version 6 packet to the MacBook intra site automatic

23
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:35.530
tunnel addressing protocol is an automatic overlayed tunneling mechanism that once again uses IP version

24
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.000
4 as a linkage layer for IP version 6.

25
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.800
These type of tunnels allow individual IP version 4 IP version 6.

26
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.830
Joel Steck hosts with a site to communicate with other hosts on a virtual link creating an IP version

27
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.150
6 network using the IP version for infrastructure.

28
00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:01.780
It would allow a host for example to set up a dynamic IP version 6 tunnel to a Cisco router a cross

29
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:08.970
an IP version for infrastructure Torito tunneling allows for host to host automatic tunneling instead

30
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.500
of Gateway tunneling.

31
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:18.610
It can be used to postes unique cost IPV 6 traffic when Joe Stack hosts are located behind one or multiple

32
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:25.240
IP version 4 network address translators for this cause Don't worry too much about the technical details

33
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.940
of these two tunneling methods.

34
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:34.220
Just recognize that they are valid IP version 4 2 IP version 6 transition mechanisms.

35
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.540
Let's look at tunneling IP version 6 over IP version 4.

36
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:47.300
So when we are only going to run IP version for serial 00 we are going to configure 10 1 to 1 on our

37
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:56.490
1 and 1 or 2 serial 0 0 we are only going to configure 10:01 Tuti so on Router one show run interface

38
00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:05.460
serial 0 0 shows us that we still have IP version 6 configured so lets remove that

39
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:21.690
do show run interface serial 0 0 shows us that the IP address is removed nature moved up just to clean

40
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:35.860
up the configfs.

41
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.500
And as you can see all IP version 6 configuration has been removed from the interface.

42
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.030
Its do the same on router to

43
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.700
interface 0 0 0.

44
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.310
No IPV 6 address no IPV 6 rUK

45
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.900
enable.

46
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.910
Once again only IP version formis interface.

47
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.930
So back router 1 laptop show IPV six route.

48
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.090
It'll only see the local Borat's.

49
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.680
I will not be able to ping

50
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:31.540
this remote network because there is no IP version 6 connectivity from this router to this router.

51
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:40.480
So just to sum up show run interface if 00 shows us that we're not running IP version for on the fast

52
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.530
ethernet interface

53
00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:51.350
and we are not running IP version 6 on the serial interface of our one on our t

54
00:05:54.140 --> 00:06:01.020
shell run into base 0 0 shows us that we're not running our provision for on the fast ethernet interface

55
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.460
and we are not running IP version 6 on the serial interface.

56
00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:15.570
So let's set up a tunnel to allow connectivity between the IP version 6 networks.

57
00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.790
So to do that you have to create a tunnel interface.

58
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:25.980
Some of the interface tunnel Zira I'm going to be lazy now and just say IPV 6 address 2003 colon column

59
00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:38.240
1 specify the tunnels source is 10 to 1 2 2 to 1 that tunnel destination is going to be 10 dot 1.2 or

60
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:50.120
T which is this IP address on the serial in the face of arti the tunnel mode is going to be IP V-6 IP

61
00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.620
otherwise the default of GRB would be used

62
00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:09.110
in this case I'm going to specify a static route.

63
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:16.010
So this route is available through tunnels 0 on router 1 on router.

64
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.710
I can be something similar.

65
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:23.860
So create a tunnel interface specify an IP version 6 address

66
00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.660
specify the tunnel source

67
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:34.590
tunnel destination

68
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:48.500
tunnel mode that is the various options you are going to go for IPV 6 over IP encapsulation specify

69
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:57.200
a steady grot.

70
00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:58.460
Now let's see if it works.

71
00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:07.330
So on Rotto one show IPV six route shows me that steady route through tunnels Zira.

72
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:14.240
So let's ping 2001 on one column one column three column column one.

73
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.220
And as you can see it succeeds.

74
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:23.340
We do a trace.

75
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:27.840
You can see it succeeds just to prove this to you again if I shut the tunnel down.

76
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:38.950
And trying to ping the ping will time out as you can see the that again.

77
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:51.610
So let's know shut the tunnel telling devices come up and say you got it's working because the tunnel

78
00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:56.270
is now up and functioning proxying and translation.

79
00:08:56.290 --> 00:09:02.890
In other words in net Peetie or network address translation protocol translation al-Assal the translation

80
00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:06.080
of both IP addresses and protocols.

81
00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:11.830
In other words this host on the left hand side only communicate using IP version for the host on the

82
00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:15.470
right side only communicates using IP version 6.

83
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:22.870
The router in the middle can act as a translator translating between IP version for an IP version 6

84
00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.740
and vice versa.

85
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:27.850
I'm going to demonstrate this in a moment.

86
00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:36.570
So let's look at an example of configuring net P-T or net protocol translation Rotto one is only running

87
00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:45.660
IP version 6 router 2 is doing protocol translation between IP B-6 on it's serial 00 interface an IP

88
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:49.390
version 4 when it's Fosset Ethan and 00 interface.

89
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:58.680
Router 3 is only running IP version for on Route 1 show IP interface grief shows you that there are

90
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.210
no IP addresses configured on any interfaces.

91
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:10.220
In other words there is no IP version for running on this router show IP V-6 interface grief shows you

92
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:14.160
that we have this IP address configured on the serial 00 interface.

93
00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:24.630
On router 3 show IP interface brief shows me that I have I could raise 10:01 one to configure it on.

94
00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:33.880
Ethan It's 0 0 as per our diagram show IP V-6 interface brief shows me that I have no IP addresses configured

95
00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:34.640
on the router.

96
00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.910
So no IPV 6 in-running on the router.

97
00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:47.670
On router te show IP interface brief shows me that I have IP address 10 111 configured on the first

98
00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:57.540
Ethan interface but no other IP addresses show IP V-6 interface brief shows me that I have this IP address

99
00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:01.670
configured on the serial interface as per our diagram.

100
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:09.280
Now I've configured this command IPV 6 Knecht on the first Ethan an interface

101
00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:17.280
as well as on the serial interface again you can see the IP address on the first.

102
00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:25.320
Ethan interface's IP version 4 and the IP address on the serial interface is IP version 6 at the top.

103
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:26.070
These commands

104
00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:37.530
this command defines the IP V-6 prefix used as the net protocol translation prefix in the six domain.

105
00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:42.330
The only prefix lenth supported is a slash 96.

106
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.900
And they're not created static mappings.

107
00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:48.920
I'm telling the router that this IP address 10:01 one.

108
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:55.350
Which is the IP address of router 3 needs to be translated to this IP version 6 address.

109
00:11:55.380 --> 00:12:02.280
I'm also telling it that this IPV 6 address which is the IP address of Rodda one should be translated

110
00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.010
to this IP address.

111
00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:08.700
Notice 10 1 1 3 doesn't exist as an IP address on any device.

112
00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:12.990
Neither does this IP address in the first Nat statement.

113
00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:16.760
We are translating IP version 4 to IP version 6.

114
00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:25.420
So it's a valid IP version 4 address on router 3 configured to a fake IP address in a second net C'mon

115
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:28.590
we are doing IP V-6 TV for translation.

116
00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:36.810
So this is a real IP address configured on router 1 Going to a fake IP address in the IP version 4 domain.

117
00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.970
But within the subnet.

118
00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:49.120
So now on router 1 I can pin the IP V-6 address associated with the IP version 4 address over out of

119
00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:54.920
three and notice the ping succeeds on router 3.

120
00:12:54.940 --> 00:13:06.620
I can ping 10 dot wandered 3 which is the IP version for address that represents Rotto 1 and noticed

121
00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:14.960
the ping succeeds to prove this let us type debug IP ICMP on Route 3 and then on Route 1 do a ping to

122
00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.840
that address.

123
00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:25.700
And as you can see here router 3 is sending a reply from a source of 10 1 1 to its IP address to a destination

124
00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:35.480
of 10 1 1 3 the netted IP version 4 address for router ones IP 6 address tapping the command show IP

125
00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:40.880
NAT translation shows no translations by tapping the C'mon show.

126
00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:49.730
IPV six net translations shows me my net translations 10:01 one twos going to that address 10 1 1 3

127
00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:52.130
is going to that address.

128
00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:54.020
Those are source translations.

129
00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:57.570
Notice IPV for source to IPV B-6 source.

130
00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:03.340
But notice the source and destination options and thats what you are seeing over here.

131
00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:15.070
So that was an example of net translation lets do a debug debug IPV 6 net and it just enable all that

132
00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:20.800
obviously in the real world you need to be very careful doing that.

133
00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.550
And here's an example you can see IP version 6.

134
00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:32.050
NET translating ICMP with a source address which is IP version 6 to an IP version 4 source that race

135
00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:41.140
going to a destination of 10 1 1 2 which is IP version for the IP V-6 equivalent that we created in

136
00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:41.700
net.

137
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:53.920
Is that address by the same token a ping to 10 1 1 3 and you can see the net translations taking place.

138
00:14:53.920 --> 00:15:01.510
So this is an example of static IP vision for the IP version 6 Network Address Translation protocol

139
00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:03.250
translation or net.

140
00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.330
Peetie So what are we covered.

141
00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:13.230
I explained the need for IP version 6 the 3rd of February 2011 was a major milestone in the history

142
00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:17.880
of the Internet with the exhaustion of an allocated IPV for addresses.

143
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:21.320
We are now being forced to implement IP version 6.

144
00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:24.090
I explained the format of an IP version 6 address.

145
00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:27.110
We looked at methods of assigning an IP address.

146
00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:32.760
We spoke about the updated routing protocols which are used in IP version 6 environments including Ripp

147
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:35.720
energy and OSPF vision 3.

148
00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:41.840
We spoke about various implementation strategies such as tunneling jewelled Stex net.

149
00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:47.640
I was to some time demonstrating the functionality of IPV six networks including the configuration of

150
00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.030
Ripp in G.

151
00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:49.950
Thank you for watching.
