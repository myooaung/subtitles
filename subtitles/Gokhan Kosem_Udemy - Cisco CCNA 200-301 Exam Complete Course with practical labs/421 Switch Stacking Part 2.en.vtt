00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.040
And fortunately the answer is yes there is a better way of doing this.

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.630
I've done a search in Google for Cisco stacking images and you'll find many images such as the following

3
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.320
showing you examples of Cisco switches being stacked.

4
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.730
Now they are different technologies for doing this.

5
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.520
In other words they are different stacking technologies.

6
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:31.880
One of the oldest is stock wise which was used on the 30 750 switches but again if you do a search in

7
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.210
Google where you have a look at some of the Cisco documentation you'll see a lot of examples of different

8
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.400
stacking technologies that can be used to stack Cisco switches.

9
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.700
So what's the advantage of stacking switches in this way.

10
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:55.020
In brief when you stack switches they appear to be a single switch to the rest of the network you configure

11
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.630
it as a single switch.

12
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.550
They act as a single switch protocols such as spending tree and CTP.

13
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.940
See that switch as a single switch.

14
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:13.100
So again Cisco has various technologies that you can use to stack switches or aggregate shesays.

15
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.850
So we have these terms switch stacking and chassis aggregation separate physical switches work together

16
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:27.690
and cooperate together to act and appear as a single switch rather than multiple discrete switches.

17
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.420
As an analogy it's as if the switches are acting as blades in a chassis based Switch switch.

18
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:41.900
Stacking is often used at the access layer and chassis aggregation is often used at the distribution

19
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.430
and core layers of a network.

20
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:50.930
So if you've got multiple access layers switches or multiple distribution or core layer switches rather

21
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:57.350
than you having to configure each switch individually and configure protocols such as spanning tree

22
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:05.270
VTB CTP and so forth you configure multiple physical switches as if they one switch they have a mac

23
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:12.800
address table they run protocols as if they were a single switch and share a MAC address table.

24
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.740
So when you stack switches at the access layer you're literally creating a stack of switches joined

25
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.560
together via special cables.

26
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:29.210
So a stack of physical switches in a wiring closet as an example can act as a single switch you would

27
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:36.740
manage the stack with a single management IP address you would telnet or SSA to 1 switch the one that

28
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.740
has the management IP address and not have to telnet or SSA to multiple switches.

29
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:49.760
There's one configuration file which is included across all the physical switches spanning tree CTP

30
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.740
and VTB are running on one switch not on multiple switches the ports on each physical switch appear

31
00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.120
to be part of the same logical switch.

32
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:07.370
In other words you may have four physical switches each having their own physical ports but logically

33
00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.760
you've got one switch with all of those ports there's one MAC address table that references all the

34
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.570
ports on all physical switches there are some additional advantages but the moral of the story is you

35
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:29.330
have a single virtual switch that you managing rather than four separate discrete switches now to connect

36
00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.140
these switches together you use special hardware ports called stacking ports.

37
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.820
Again they are different Cisco technologies.

38
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:44.450
We've got as an example Cisco flex stack and flex stack plus stacking technology.

39
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.420
You would as an example insert a stacking module in each switch and then connect them with a stacking

40
00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.560
cable.

41
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.510
Different stacking technologies work on different switches.

42
00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:07.060
So flex stack and flex stack plus all supported by 29 60 switches such as the 29 60 Yes 29 60 are 29

43
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:16.570
60 x and 20 960 XOR switch families 37 50 switches which are older switches support stack wise.

44
00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.540
And what are these stacking cables do is they form a ring between the switches.

45
00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.950
In other words the switches are connected in a series with a lost switch connected back to the first

46
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:35.300
switch as shown in this topology by using full duplex on each link the stacking modules and cables create

47
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:42.020
two paths to forward data between the physical switches and the stack switches use these connections

48
00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:48.950
to communicate between the switches in the stack as well as to forward frames and perform other overhead

49
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:49.670
functions.
