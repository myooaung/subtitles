00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
There are various category of cable.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
In general the higher the category the more twist

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and the less susceptible the cable is to electromagnetic interference.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The higher the category the more stringent the specification are

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
for crosstalk and system noise.

6
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Higher cable categories typically support higher frequencies and higher speeds

7
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I wouldn’t try to remember all the categories of cable if I were you.

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Just see this as an explanation of the various categories

9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
you may encounter in networks or in documentation.

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Category 1 was previously used for telephones and modems.

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So category 1 is a grade of unshielded twisted cabling

12
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
designed for telephone communications and was it one time the most common on

13
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
premise wiring, this is not suitable for data transmission.

14
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Category 2 was previously used for telephones and data networks up to 4 Mbps.

15
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Category 3 was used previously for data networks up to 10 Mbps.

16
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It's now generally used for telephones.

17
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
category 4 defined up to 20 MHz with speeds up to 16 Mbps.

18
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000
category 5  is defined up to 100 MHz speeds of 10 or 100 Mbps when using 2 pairs

19
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and 1 Gbps when using 4 pairs

20
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Category 1, 2 and 4 are no longer used.

21
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Category 3 is no longer used in data networks.

22
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And generally category 5 is no longer used, but there’s a lot of installations

23
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
that have category 5, so you may still come across it.

24
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Cat5e was an improvement on Cat5, it supports frequencies up to 100 MHz

25
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and supports speed up to 1 Gbps.

26
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
It has a maximum distance of a 100 meters

27
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and is similar to Cat5 but improve the Cat5 specification

28
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
by reducing noise and signal interference

29
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
so some crosstalk was improved with the new specification.

30
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
The category 5 specification improves upon the category 5 specification

31
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
by tightening some crosstalk specifications and introducing new crosstalk

32
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
specifications that will not present in the original category 5 specification.

33
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
The bandwidth of Cat5 and Cat5e is the same.

34
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
In other words 100 MHz and the physical cable construction is the same

35
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and in reality is that most Cat5 cables meet Cat5e specification.

36
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Though it may not be tested or certified as such.

37
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Category 6 defines frequencies up to 250 MHz and increases

38
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
the number of pair twist per inch to reduce signal noise and interference.

39
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
It supports 10 Gbps but only up to 55 meters.

40
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000
The type of specifications in Cat6 guarantee 100 meters runs at 1 Gbps

41
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
so category 6 cable commonly referred to us Cat6

42
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
is the standardize cable for the gigabit Ethernet

43
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and is backward compatible with Cat5 or Cat5e

44
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and Cat3 cable standards compared to Cat5 or Cat5e

45
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Cat6 f1atures more stringent specifications for crosstalk and system noise.

46
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
The cable standards provide performance up to 250 MHz

47
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and is suitable for 10Base-T, 100Base-TX or Fast Ethernet

48
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and 1000BaseT or gigabit Ethernet as well as 10 gigabit Ethernet.

49
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Cat6a or augmented Cat6 defined frequencies up to 500 MHz

50
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
which is twice that of Cat6.

51
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
It also includes improvements with regards to crosstalk

52
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and support speeds up to 10 Gbps

53
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
but in this case with the extended cable length of a 100 meters.

54
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Cat6 maximum cable length was 55 meters

55
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
in a favorable environment but only 37 meters in an environment

56
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
where a lot of crosstalk to place such as when cables are bundled together.

57
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:15.000
So cat6a or Cat6a improved the specification allowing for 10 Gbps up to 100 meters.

58
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Category 7 or Cat 7 defined frequencies up to 600 MHz

59
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.000
and supports speeds of up to 10 Gbps up to 100 meters.

60
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
The connectors in Cat7 can be terror connectors rather than 8P, 8C or 8 physician

61
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
8 contact which we commonly refer to as Rj-45 connector.

62
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
So here’s an example of a terror connector and Cat7

63
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
notice the pairs of cable in Cat7 are protected by a foil shield

64
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
the twisting of pairs and the number of turns per inch, is also increased

65
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
to protect from crosstalk and in addition has a 10 copper Twinax

66
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000
category7 is also known as class F and also has a classFa

67
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
which defined frequencies up to 100 MHz per second

68
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and which in theory supports speeds up to 40 Gbps and 100 Gbps at 50 meters.

69
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
This is currently an ISO or ISO's standard

70
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
but is not recognized by the TIA/EIA.

71
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.000
For brand new installations, it’s generally recommended that Cat6a or Cat7 be use.

72
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.000
If reusing existing Cat6 cabling, cable segments must be tested up to 350 MHz

73
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
and limited by TIA/EIA recommendations.

74
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Now Category8 is the next generation twisted pair cabling specification

75
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
and is being develop to support 40 Gbps

76
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
in other words 4 times the speed of 10 Gigabit Ethernet.

77
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
The technical recommendation for Category8 was released in March 2013

78
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and has both class 1 and class 2

79
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
in other words category8.1 cable and category8.2 cables.

80
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Category8.1 is fully backward compatible and interoperable with category6a

81
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
using Rj-45 connectors.

82
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Category8.2 is interoperable with category7 cabling

83
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
using either Rj-45 or terror connectors.
