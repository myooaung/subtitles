00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:06.160
In this example we'll configure dynamic not in the typology we have to rodders Rodda one and wrote a

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.090
four that are on the inside.

3
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:15.290
They are connected via a switch to Rodda too which is going to do the actual network address translation

4
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.040
will configure done Nemec not on Rodda too.

5
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:27.340
To allow both router 1 and Rodda 4 to access router three which in our lab is deemed to be the Internet.

6
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.200
So the 8 network is on the outside.

7
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:37.190
That is the internet 10 1 1 0 is our internal network with these three devices connected to each other

8
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:45.050
via switch one later on I'll expand the typology to actually connect rotisserie to the Internet so that

9
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.070
Rodda 104 can connect to sites such as Google dot com.
