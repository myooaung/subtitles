00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.150
Now what is enable mode.

2
00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:07.820
Also cold enabled mode privileged mode or privileged mode.

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:15.030
It goes by any one of those names enabled mode allows you to use many more show commands than you have

4
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.680
in user mode.

5
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.220
It also allows you to run debugging on the road it was switch where you can see life output or real

6
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.380
time output.

7
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:32.190
So as an example you could see the real time updates of OSPF messages sent between routers.

8
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:38.970
This mode allows you to access all device commands such as those used for configuration and management

9
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:47.910
and can be password protected to only allow authorized users access to this mode using either a secret

10
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.880
or enable password.

11
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:57.600
So you need to go to enable mode if you wan to go to other modes such as a global configuration.

12
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.410
Once again you have many more options available in privileged mode than you would in user mode and you

13
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:10.060
can see that quite simply by using the question mark command in enable mode.

14
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:17.790
They are many more commands available here and I have to press space bar multiple times to see all the

15
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.250
commands available in this mode.

16
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:29.220
Debug commands such as debug IP ICMP excepted in this mode I can go to global configuration mode by

17
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:37.500
typing confetti or configure terminal controls Zayde as I call it or control Z will take me back to

18
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.650
enable privileged mode.

19
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:49.360
So in summary use exec mode only allows a limited number of commands including basic monitoring commands.

20
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:57.320
This mode is also referred to as a view only mode the use exec level does not allow for the execution

21
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:05.650
of any commands that may change the configuration or control the operation of the Rato switch.

22
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.560
So as an example you cannot reload a switch or router from user mode.

23
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.880
You'd have to do that from Enable or privilege mode by default.

24
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.930
There is no authentication on user mode.

25
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:26.300
In other words no authentication is required to access this mode but it's good practice to enable authentication

26
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.920
when you initially configure a device.

27
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.990
So you would configure a password on the console of a Rotto switch as an example the next most is global

28
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:45.600
configuration mode or global config mode the prompt that you'll see is hostname as in the name of the

29
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:53.850
road it was switch followed by config in brackets and followed by a pound sign or hash sign global configuration

30
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.870
mode allows you to change global parameters of a rod or switch.

31
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:06.210
So for example you could change the name of the router you could specify a banner message of the day.

32
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.150
And many other options through global configuration mode.

33
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:17.580
So as an example from enable mode I can type confetti which is the abbreviated version of configure

34
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.860
terminal and that takes me to global configuration mode on the router.

35
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.240
I can then use the command hostname and specify a new name for this router.

36
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.320
In this example.

37
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.990
Taste.

38
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.600
And when I press enter.

39
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.180
Notice the prompt has changed.

40
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:40.330
So I see the hostname of the router followed by config in brackets followed by hash or Â£0 if you prefer.

41
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.730
If I enter the command banner message of the day and press enter.

42
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:54.150
I'm told that this is an incomplete command I can use control P or the up arrow key to view the previously

43
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.460
typed command.

44
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.380
And then I can use a question mark to see the options available.

45
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.280
So I'm told that I need to enter a delimiting character.

46
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:10.200
So in this example I'm going to use hash or once again if you prefer the pound sign and then I'm told

47
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:16.980
to enter some text so I could say something like Hello this is Rato one press enter.

48
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:24.840
Now I'll enter the delimiting character which is hash and when I press Enter I'm taken back to Global

49
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.340
config mode.

50
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:33.190
Now Ben a message of the day is a message that displays every time you log into a router switch.

51
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:40.680
So if I press control Zed to get back to enable mode and then type exit to exit the router notice I'm

52
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.220
told that I'm connected to console zero on the router.

53
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.640
And now when I press Enter notice the banner is displayed.

54
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:57.120
Now it's important that you don't use a remote or message of the Day message here like welcome to my

55
00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.990
Rodda or welcome to my network.

56
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:07.740
You should use a legal statement stating that for example this is a private network and unauthorized

57
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.640
access is not permitted.

58
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.780
There's an urban legend that you may hear where hackers were able to access a device.

59
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:20.070
In other words the hacked teen and when they were caught they got away with it because the message on

60
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:27.240
the road said welcome to my router and they told the authorities that they felt welcomed to the router

61
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.790
and therefore decided to gain access to the Rodda.

62
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:37.350
So it's important that you put some legal statement stating that unauthorized access is not permitted.

63
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:44.250
So anyone connecting to your road or switch knows that only authorized individuals are allowed access

64
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.600
to the device.

65
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:53.160
So once again in privileged mode I can type confetti and that takes me to global config mode in global

66
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.130
config mode.

67
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.910
There is a long list of commands available and Christian Mark displays them.

68
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:06.840
So as you can see these lists are quite long and it's unlikely that you'll ever learn all the commands

69
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.710
available in the Cisco IOS because there are thousands of them.
