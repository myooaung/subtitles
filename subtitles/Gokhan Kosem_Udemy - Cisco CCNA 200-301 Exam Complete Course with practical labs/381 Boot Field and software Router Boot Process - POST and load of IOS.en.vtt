00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:07.260
So the poor field lost to value determines how the writer will boot

2
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:19.610
that consists of four binary bits which are either set on or off a value of 0 means Romanova to a value

3
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.930
of 1 means boot into our boot.

4
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.760
In the old days all today means boot using the first operating system in Flash.

5
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.240
Setting it to two or a great number such as F or e.

6
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.070
In other words anything from 2 to F means normal boot.

7
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.050
So this value is set to 2 or greater means normal boot.

8
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.700
So in other words enables default booting from flash memory you can override that by using the boot

9
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.360
system commands in the running config of a router.

10
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.790
So on a radio you could use the boot system command to specify that a different operating system is

11
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.220
used as an example.

12
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.480
So the router would boot from a TFT server as an example.

13
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:20.430
So in other words on the router you could use a command such as pooched system and tell the router to

14
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:29.100
boot its operating system off a TFT piece of war and peace over as an example rather than puting the

15
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:38.220
operating system from flash when I wrote it boots up it goes through a series of steps which include

16
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:45.030
loading the Cisco Iowa software from Flash or if specified from somewhere else such as a nifty piece

17
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.620
of into the ram of the router.

18
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:56.160
The router will also load the configuration stored in startup config and apply that and use it as the

19
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.750
running config.

20
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.480
So here are the steps that it takes when booting up the first thing it does is perform the power on

21
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.610
self test or post.

22
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.280
This is a series of hardware tests that verify that all the components of a Cisco Rodolf functional

23
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.620
during the test.

24
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.340
The rod also determines which hardware is present.

25
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.060
This executes from microcode that is stored in the system from.

26
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:28.980
So he has a router and his APC are going to do an immediate reboot on the router

27
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.540
so you can see the rod is booting up and then is loading the operating system.

28
00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.110
Now its going to do a power on self-test but thats not very clear on this router.

29
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:57.490
So what Im going to do is show you the power on self tests on a Cisco switch so I'll do a reboot on

30
00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:58.520
the Cisco switch.

31
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:15.640
And you can see the 29 50 bootloader is being used.

32
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.570
It's now loading the operating system from flash.

33
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:28.470
And what I'd like to show you here is notice the power on self tests that are shown on the switch so

34
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:36.120
you can see clearly back power on self tests have been passed on the switch.

35
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.520
And then the switch boots up and the interfaces come up.

36
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:47.550
So scrolling back noticed power on self-test power on self-test can see the operating system is loaded

37
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.830
and then the switches ready to start.

38
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.420
Now something similar is taking place on a router.

39
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.040
We just don't see it as clearly in the output.

40
00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.250
But here's the output.

41
00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:09.610
When I reloaded the router you can see run monitors initialized the program loads are taking place.

42
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.460
The operating system is being decompressed and loaded.

43
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.650
So the first step on a router is to perform a power on self-test.

44
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.450
The router then loads and runs the bootstrap code which is used to perform subsequent events such as

45
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:32.710
locating the Cecka Iowa software loading it into RAM and running it off to the Cisco Iowas software

46
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:40.030
is loaded and running the bootstrap code is not used until the next time the rod he's reloaded will

47
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.640
power cycled on this 1041 router.

48
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:53.320
We can see that the bootstrap code is loading the operating system.

49
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.660
And here we can see which version of operating system has been loaded into RAM.
