00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.740
In this video I'm going to demonstrate how OSP version three routers conform neighbor relationships

2
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.900
without you manually configuring IP addresses on interfaces.

3
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:29.470
In other words in this topology we'll form a neighbor relationship between router 1 and rudder 2 without

4
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.720
configuring IP version 6 addresses on the gigabit 00 interfaces.

5
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:42.220
This will demonstrate how SPF forms and neighbor relationships using link local addresses and doesn't

6
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:48.760
require IP version 6 addresses to be configured or IP version 4 addresses.

7
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.420
So in this topology the two writers have just booted up.

8
00:00:52.420 --> 00:01:01.780
There is no configuration on the Rogers I'll bypass the initial configuration dialog so that we can

9
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:10.120
configure the rudders manually so the right on the left will call right a 1 show IP right shows us that

10
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:18.250
there are no IP version for rights available on this rather show IP vs 6 rot shows us that there are

11
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:26.940
no IP version 6 ruts available on the strata at the moment these rowdies have just booted up again with

12
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:37.740
no configuration so show IP brought no IP vision for Roth's show IP vs 6 rout no IP version 6 runs show

13
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:49.140
IP interface brief no IP addresses configured on Route 1 show IP 6 interface brief shows us that they

14
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.750
are on no IP version 6 addresses

15
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.220
same on the site show IP interface brief no IP version for addresses.

16
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:08.750
Show IP vs 6 interface brief no IP version 6 addresses configured Okay so IP vs 6 unique cost routing

17
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:17.620
needs to be enabled for us to use a wispy P.F. what we'll do now is enable SPF as a writing protocol

18
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:26.410
the writer will complain as you can see there that no writer I.D. can be selected and that's because

19
00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:35.050
we have no IP version 4 dresses configured so I need to select a right I.D. in dotted decimal notation

20
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:46.160
such as the following IP vs 6 unit cost routing IP vs 6 Roorda or SPF 1

21
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:57.310
Once again we need to configure a right I.D. I'll configure the side as to toe to toe to toe to so show

22
00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:08.540
IP vs 6 SPF interface brief shows us that 0 SPF is not enabled on any interfaces on the router what

23
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.150
we have to do is go onto interfaces

24
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.450
and enable IP vs 6 on an interface

25
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:28.650
and then enable a wispy P.F. on that interface.

26
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:38.970
So on this side gigabit 00 IP vs 6 enable to enable IP vs 6 on the gigabit 00 interface and then IP

27
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:46.800
vs 6 0 SPF process ideas one area will set to zero.

28
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:57.960
So now show IP vs 6 0 SPF interface brief shows us that 0 SPF is enabled on gigabit 0 0 with a process

29
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:09.630
idea of 1 in area 0 at the moment to the is down and that's probably because I didn't enable the interface

30
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.620
so let's do that.

31
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.440
So now show IP vs 6 0 SPF interface brief.

32
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:24.840
Notice the state is set to wait on no shut the interface on the side.

33
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:39.410
Show IP the 6 interface or SPF interface brief or SPF is enabled on gigabit 00 in area 0 using a SPF

34
00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:40.770
process 1.

35
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.300
The state is white at the moment.

36
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.350
Show IP v 6 0 SPF neighbor.

37
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:56.610
We are forming a neighbor relationship with a broader with neighbor I.D. one dot wandered wandered one

38
00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:04.860
on the side show IP vs 6 0 SPF and neighbor notice the neighbor relationship has now moved to extort

39
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:13.960
and has just moved to full so you can see the neighbor relationship went to full they brought a 1 is

40
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:22.130
a PDR and on this side we can see that rather it too is the designated Rada.

41
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.910
So we have formed a neighbor relationship

42
00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:35.860
with the other Rada without enabling an IP version 6 address on the gigabit 0 interface.

43
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:43.430
So notice there is no IP version for address and there is no IP vs 6 address enabled on this interface.

44
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:52.880
And the same is true on the site but we do have a whisper from neighbor relationship with the other

45
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:53.640
router.

46
00:05:53.930 --> 00:06:01.540
And if we look at the writing table we can see at the moment that we have a local network in the writing

47
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.390
table but no other rights exist.

48
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:13.280
They show IP vs 6 Rada shows us that a link local addresses configured on gigabit 00 so show IP vs 6

49
00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:20.260
interface gigabit 00 shows us that the interfaces up IP B6 is enabled.

50
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.230
This is the link local address on the interface.

51
00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:31.390
This writer has joined various multicast groups including two with P.F. groups.

52
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:42.180
This is all devices on the local segment on the side show run interface gigabit 0 0 or show IP vs 6

53
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:53.370
interface gigabit 00 rather shows us the link a local address on the side so to prove that writing works

54
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.880
on Route 1.

55
00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:05.960
I'll configure a loop back IP address so IP 6 address and in this case we'll call it 2001.

56
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:23.880
Facebook 1 Colin Colin 1 slash 128 on the site interface looped back 0 IP vs 6 address 2001.

57
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:25.080
Facebook

58
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.560
colon colon to 128.

59
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:42.190
Notice those are 128 networks so these two are separate networks show IP vs 6 around.

60
00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:52.750
We have a loop back address in the writing table but we don't see this address because we need to advertise

61
00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:57.700
and that network into a SPF.

62
00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:05.480
So now once that network gets advertised we should see it available in the writing table of Rider 2.

63
00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:07.680
And there you go.

64
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:15.420
We have learnt about Facebook one via the link local address of root of one.

65
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:20.550
Once again show IP vs 6 interface gigabit.

66
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:22.170
0 0.

67
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:27.470
This is the link local address of writer 1 and that's the address that we are learning.

68
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:40.960
The router from on the side show IP vs 6 root we haven't learnt about to look back on the side and I

69
00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:41.890
think I made a mistake.

70
00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:48.430
So let me double check the configuration I made to this zero rather than a two.

71
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:56.660
So what I'll do is remove that IP address and put it back

72
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:12.630
as to Colon column to IP Peavey six SPF 1 area zero once that network gets advertised we should see

73
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:16.640
it on broad a one and there you go.

74
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:27.030
The branch is now available on Route 1 So we've learnt the address via o SPF let's try and ping the

75
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:27.750
address.

76
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:28.740
What do you think.

77
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.220
Will it work.

78
00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:35.490
Sipping IPD six this address.

79
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:36.630
Does it work.

80
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:37.860
Yes it does.

81
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:46.920
We can ping the loop back of broader to on this side show IP vs 6 round.

82
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:48.020
Can we ping

83
00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.250
the loop back.

84
00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:54.920
Yes we can.

85
00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.290
Notice you don't have to specify IP vs 6.

86
00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:06.620
The rod is intelligent enough to work out with that this is an IP vs 6 ping debug IP vs 6 ICMP.

87
00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.060
Let's do that ping again

88
00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:16.950
notice we see that an echo request was received and reply was sent.

89
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:27.100
So again the gigabit 00 interfaces of both these routers don't have either an IP version for dress or

90
00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:36.580
an IP version 6 address configured as soon as we enabled IP version 6 on the interface a link a local

91
00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:47.280
address was allocated as shown here and a twist a users link local addresses for neighbor establishment

92
00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.750
and ranked advertisement.

93
00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.500
And that's what I've demonstrated here.

94
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:56.880
