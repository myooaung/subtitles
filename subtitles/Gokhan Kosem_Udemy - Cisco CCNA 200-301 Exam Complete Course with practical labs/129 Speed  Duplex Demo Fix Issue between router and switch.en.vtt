00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So let’s fix this problem between router 1 and 2950-1.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So on the router it’s currently configured to use a speed of 100.

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So I’m going to set the speed to auto.

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This router doesn’t give me the option to set duplex.

5
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So show run int f/0 speed is auto sh int f/0 speed is still half duplex.

6
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The router can’t negotiate with the switch.

7
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So once again it moves to a full back position of 10 meg half duplex.

8
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and this is what has cause a lot of problem in the past because the 1 side

9
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
such as the router can’t negotiate with the other side, it simply moves to the

10
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
lowest possible speed which is half duplex 10 Mbps where's the switch is using full duplex.

11
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So on this switch sh run int f0/3, speed is 10, duplex is full

12
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:35.000
let’s change that to speed rather speed auto, duplex auto, sh run int f0/3 no configuration

13
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:46.000
sh int f0/3 notice it is now using 100 meg full duplex and on the router

14
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000
we are getting 100 meg full duplex, so thats a lot better.

15
00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.000
The router and the switch have negotiated correctly to use 100 Mbps full duplex.

16
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So can we ping router 2? Yes we can.

17
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Let’s do a large ping, large datagram size, pings are being sent without any problems

18
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000
we're not seeing any late collisions at the moment because the speed and duplex have

19
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
negotiated properly, this may indicate a problem somewhere else in the network.

20
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.000
At the moment every things looks good, sh int f0

21
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Now we still see late collisions but that’s because of the previous counters.

22
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000
So I’m gonna clear the counters and then do the command sh int f0 again.

23
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And notice you see 0 late collisions.

24
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000
So when looking at your output be careful of the information.

25
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Clear counters and we could specify a specific interface.

26
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Allows us to clear the counters on that interface

27
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
so that we see fresh information

28
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:32.000
So once again if we ping 10.1.1.2 1000 pings.

29
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Large packet size, we're sending some traffic on this side, sh int f0/3

30
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
we’ve got the input errors and CRC's

31
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:55.000
so clear counters f0/3 we don’t see any input errors and CRC's.

32
00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Obviously you need to monitor that over period of time

33
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
so we are seeing a certain number of packets in and certain number of packet out.

34
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
So traffic is definitely being sent and received on this interface.

35
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
We're not seeing any input errors which is better than we saw last time

36
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
but you just need to monitor that for a period of time

37
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000
on the routers sh int f0 we see the number of packets input

38
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
number of packets output. we have no late collision at the moment.

39
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
So that's a lot better than what we saw previously.

40
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Now on this switch we're still seeing another problem with the duplex mismatch to switch 2.

41
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
So this connection here has a duplex problem.
