00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.680
So that was an example of basic span.

2
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.190
There are multiple options when you can figure span.

3
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:15.090
So let's remove our current session and then specify monitor session.

4
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:25.100
Let's create a new one of one source port is going to be interface first Ethernet to 1 0 3.

5
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:34.880
In this example and I'm only going to do receiving of traffic monitor session destination

6
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.310
interface 1 0 5

7
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.240
rather 1 0 5 and hit enter.

8
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:58.040
Now I purposely are only creating one session with the same number to keep it simple but be aware that

9
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.490
you can create multiple span sessions.

10
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:08.450
There are some dependencies and rules with regards to span a span destination port can only be used

11
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:16.570
with one span session at a time a span destination port can also not be a span source port.

12
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:23.330
When you create a span destination port the switch no longer treats that port as a standard Ethan at

13
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.190
port.

14
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.740
As I demonstrated MAC addresses are not learned on that port and traffic received on that port is not

15
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.860
accepted by default.

16
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:41.480
You can remove a spam destination port by using the no monitor session and a number and the destination

17
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.880
interface and then add it to a different monitor session.

18
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:51.640
So in other words you can move it from one session to another multiple spans sources can be used within

19
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:59.600
a single span session one span session cannot mix interfaces and VLAN sources so you must either look

20
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:07.730
at multiple interfaces or multiple villains one span session can use any combination of directions so

21
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:17.240
transmit receive or both ether channel can be used as a source port in Port monitoring or span trunks

22
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.010
can also be used as source ports if required.

23
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:28.220
So in this example we've only got a single interface but we could change that to foster Ethernet.

24
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.060
1 0 3 and then specify a range of interfaces if required.

25
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.030
So let's say 1 0 1 and typical Cisco fashion.

26
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.720
The command is different here to other commands so I'll do receive on both those interfaces so do show

27
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:54.020
run pipe include monitor or in our example span ports.

28
00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:02.900
We're going to look at traffic received on 1 0 1 as well as 1 0 3 so I'll restart the Y shall capture

29
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:12.710
on Route 1 I'm going to send a single ping to write it to what you'll notice even though we only looking

30
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:21.230
at receiving of traffic we captured both ping Echo as well as Echo reply so the echo would have been

31
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:28.070
received on this port when Rata 1 transmitted traffic to write at 2 and the Echo reply would have been

32
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:36.560
received on this port so hence we received both the echo and echo reply if we had only configured this

33
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.650
port we would only have received the echo and not the echo reply.

34
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.730
So let's do that so no monitor session 1

35
00:03:51.410 --> 00:04:00.630
we only gonna capture the traffic received on this port and then we'll send it out of port 1 0 5.

36
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:11.270
So now when I clear the session and do a ping notice we only receive half the traffic so be careful

37
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.320
which ports are the source of your capture.

38
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.020
And be careful of the direction of traffic.

39
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:22.730
Both will allow you to capture traffic in and out of that port receive is only traffic received on that

40
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:31.070
port transmit is traffic sent out of that port you could as an example capture on the V lan.

41
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:43.750
So let's get rid of session one and what I'll do is say v land one received traffic and the destination

42
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.450
will be port five I'll clear the Y shock capture

43
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:59.300
and do a single ping again and notice here we see both the echo and echo reply message so this echo

44
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:08.590
reply has echo request because this port and this port on V land.

45
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:16.940
This port 1 0 2 is actually shut down in this topology so we could delete that port from the topology

46
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:25.890
some show commands again show monitor we can see that we've got one session enabled it's a local session

47
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:34.740
we receiving traffic on VLAN 1 destination port is 1 0 5 we're using a native encapsulation and ingress

48
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:44.190
is disabled so traffic will be dropped that's received on this port we can also look at detailed information

49
00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:55.670
so it's a local session they are no source ports configured we only have a source of V villain configured

50
00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:03.810
and we capturing traffic received on VLAN 1 not transmitted on VLAN 1 a remote spend session is not

51
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:12.900
configured the destination port for the span session is 1 0 5 other options are not configured.
