00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:08.060
So let's configure and test port security in this example I've got to Jinnah's three running Iowas relate

2
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.840
to that SAO switch in the topology and then I'll go to Cisco Iowas router.

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.070
It's a 37 25 router image which I'm using as the PCs in the topology so Router one will actis PC one

4
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:29.960
and router two will act as PC two will configure MAC addresses on the routers and then change them to

5
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.970
prove that port security works.

6
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:40.310
MAC addresses with vendor code 0 0 to 3:33 belong to Cisco Systems.

7
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:47.760
So we'll use this MAC address range so that we can see the output and why shock and Krait easy to read

8
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.350
MAC addresses in the lab.

9
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.890
The Rawdon's switch have booted up with no configuration

10
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.330
selfmade no configuration changes on these devices.

11
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:09.250
Let's start off by naming this device which one rod of one has already configured and says router to

12
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:16.360
based on the default configuration in G and has three but the switch has no configuration.

13
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:23.230
So at the moment if we top show port security you'll notice that there's no output.

14
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.560
Because port security is not currently enabled shows a MAC Address table.

15
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.210
Shows that no MAC addresses have been learnt.

16
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:50.640
Rather one let's configure first Ethan it is 0 0 with MAC address 0 0 T-3 3 3 0 0 TRIPLE 0 0 1 and 0

17
00:01:50.640 --> 00:02:02.180
no shut that port will do something similar on route to which just make this two rather than 1 and No

18
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:10.610
shut to the port show MAC Address table shows us that the switch has learnt both these MAC addresses.

19
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:17.010
So Rotto one is available on gigabit 00 router 2 is available on gigabit.

20
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.880
0 1 both addresses were linked dynamically.

21
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.970
In other words we didn't statically configured these MAC addresses.

22
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.260
They have been dynamically learnt by the switch.

23
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.180
So port security still shows us that port security hasn't been enabled.

24
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.230
We have no output so going on to Gigabit is 00.

25
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.810
Let's try and enable port security.

26
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.430
Notice the command is rejected.

27
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.050
And that's because we're running dynamic trunking protocol or DTP on this port.

28
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.550
We haven't statically configured this port as an access port or as a trunk port.

29
00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:03.710
So let's top switch port mode access and will enable port security again.

30
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:15.730
The command is now accepted so show port security shows us that the port is gigabit to 0 0 the maximum

31
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:24.280
secure addresses allowed on the port is one by default only a maximum of one MAC addresses allowed on

32
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.960
a port security port.

33
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.420
How many MAC addresses have currently been learnt on his one.

34
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.020
How many security violations have occurred.

35
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.130
Zero.

36
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.830
And what security action will be taken if there's a violation.

37
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.970
The port will be shut down.

38
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.680
In other words it will be disabled.

39
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.800
We'll look at some of the other options in a moment but let's see what happens.

40
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.520
Show port security.

41
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.600
Let's look at some options.

42
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.140
Address

43
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:06.470
so he has the secure MAC Address table on villaine one this MAC address has been lent.

44
00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.910
The type is secure dynamic.

45
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.570
We dynamically learnt about the address.

46
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:22.230
The port is is 0 0 the remaining age is a hyphen you can determine how long a MAC address that is learnt

47
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.420
is remembered before it's aged out on a port.

48
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:32.370
Now notice this example is not restricting this port to specific MAC addresses.

49
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.880
It's limiting the port to one MAC address.

50
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.230
We didn't statically configure the port.

51
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:45.680
So show run interface gigabit 00 shows us that we enabled port security and that's all we did.

52
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.660
We didn't statically configure a MAC address but if we change the MAC address on the port to let's say

53
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:58.170
three let's see what happens soon as the port came up.

54
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:05.290
We get an error disable message port security violation error detected on gigabit is 0 0 0.

55
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:12.630
The port is now being put into a disabled state the security violation occurred caused by this MAC address

56
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:21.400
notice ending in three on port gigabit 0 00 the line protocol has gone down.

57
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.070
So show interface.

58
00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:24.710
Gigabit 0 0

59
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.370
there's the chemo and shows us that the port is down down.

60
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.650
And the reason for that is irreducible disable the port was a disabled port has gone down

61
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:49.280
this router and let's give it an IP address will not be able to send traffic to this device.

62
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:58.540
Sarada to acting as PTT because the port is down.

63
00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.370
Show port security.

64
00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.280
Please note this is not the status of the port.

65
00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.740
This is the action that's taken when there's a violation.

66
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:18.660
So port security interface gigabit to 0 0 shows us that port security is enabled in the port.

67
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.910
The status is secure.

68
00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.630
Shut down the violation mode is shut down.

69
00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.410
This is the last MAC address that was seen on the port.

70
00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:33.750
Only one MAC addresses allowed the violation count is one.

71
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:40.040
And that's because the MAC address that's allowed in that port which is not shown here because the port

72
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.760
has gone down.

73
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:48.030
I'll just scroll up to show you the output was the MAC address and we've changed the MAC address so

74
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.410
ending in triple 0 1 is the MAC address that's permitted.

75
00:06:53.800 --> 00:07:01.170
But this is the last MAC address that was seen that caused a violation.

76
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:05.460
So let's change the MAC address back to one.

77
00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:11.750
And on the side you go on to the port and shut it down.

78
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:22.400
And then wait for that to go down and then no shut it show port.

79
00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:30.840
You can see that show port security before Precentor notice the porters come up supporters come up schematic

80
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.020
MAC addresses one at the moment it hasn't to to MAC address.

81
00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.060
Let's do a ping to Rhonda

82
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:49.780
as you can see now it's now learnt a MAC address.

83
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:51.310
So now the pings succeed.

84
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:52.560
Sure.

85
00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:57.640
Port security shows us that the max MAC address a lot is one current addresses one.

86
00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.090
So one has been learnt.

87
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:05.190
Let's look at the interface again again of its 0 0 at the moment there is no violation.

88
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.880
The port status is secure up

89
00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.500
the violation mode is to shut the port down.

90
00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.920
But currently the port is up scrolling back up

91
00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:26.950
previously noticed it was secure shut down based on the violation mode of shutdown.

92
00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:33.010
But now it's secure up because the correct MAC address is being learnt which is the MAC address.

93
00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:39.220
So notice here the first MAC address that was received was added to the list of permitted MAC addresses.

94
00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:41.100
It was dynamically learnt.

95
00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:45.130
So you would have to ensure that the right MAC address is received on the port.

96
00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:48.220
If you reboot the switch that information is lost.

97
00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:52.500
So the first host that's connected to that port will be permitted.

98
00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.670
And that may not be what you want.

99
00:08:54.690 --> 00:09:01.080
You may want to explicitly permit only certain MAC addresses associated with certain machines.

100
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.440
So let's have a look at that.
