00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:08.930
As demonstrated in a separate video Telenet sends traffic in clear text and passwords and data can easily

2
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.420
be captured on the wire.

3
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.740
So it's better to use S-sh

4
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.830
as an example or capture the traffic between Ronald one and wrote it to

5
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.190
and for comparison.

6
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:35.220
I'll do a telnet to read it to from router 1 and log in with my username and password in y shock.

7
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:46.850
I can simply filter for telnet and in the output I'll be able to capture the password which is c i s

8
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.040
CEO and other with Cisco.

9
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:57.900
But more than that if they use a top to come on such a show run and looked at the running config of

10
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.830
the Rodda or did any kind of configuration.

11
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.680
All of that is sent in clear text.

12
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.470
So a hacker could simply search for the data.

13
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:19.720
So there is an example as the prompt of the Rodda off the log in and searching through the data we can

14
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.190
see show run and here's the current config of the Rodda.

15
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:32.380
So we are able to view the full configuration of the rattus as an example there's an IP address on an

16
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.010
interface

17
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:45.090
scrolling down more configuration if there were passwords on the console or other ports we'd be able

18
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.100
to see those passwords.

19
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.860
So as an example is the password on the Viti wireline.

20
00:01:51.970 --> 00:02:00.760
I could also simply look at the TCAP session and the full configuration of the Rodda is simply displayed

21
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.400
through Y shock.

22
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:11.360
So not a great way to manage devices when someone sniffing the network can capture the traffic.

23
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.360
This is more of a problem when you are using a public network such as the Internet than your local network.

24
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.460
But it's important to be aware that telnet sends traffic clear text.

25
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:30.020
So we want to enable secure shell or S-sh and to do that we firstly have to specify a hostname.

26
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.700
It cannot be the default of switch or router.

27
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.150
The name was ATI but I've reset it just for completeness to show you the command.

28
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.450
So you have to set a hostname and then you have to specify a domain name.

29
00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.450
Which is required for the generation of kids so specify some kind of domain name I'll use Cisco dot

30
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.510
com.

31
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.900
You have to have a user name.

32
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.130
Now I've already configured a user name of David

33
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.530
and a password but I'll just do that again for completeness.

34
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.110
And then we have to generate keys.

35
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:21.910
So crypto key to generate RSA specify modulus and then specify size that should be in 1024 So let me

36
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.040
do that again.

37
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:29.790
The larger the size of the key the more secure the transmission of data.

38
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:38.530
So the modular sizes from 360 to 2048 and once again I specified 1024 the ratable then generate what

39
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.380
are called private and public keys.

40
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:48.070
So as you can see here the keys are going to be replaced because I'm regenerating them a private key

41
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:55.940
means a key that you don't share it's private to yourself a public key is derived from a private key.

42
00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.790
And that's what you share with everyone else in secure communications.

43
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:06.760
So if you want to send something to me that no one else can read you would encrypt it with my public

44
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:14.050
key which means that only my private key can decrypt it if I want to send something to you that only

45
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:22.650
you can read I would encrypt it with your public key and only your private key can decrypt it.

46
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:30.400
A public key is derived from my private key something encrypted with a public key can only be decrypted

47
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.260
by the relevant private key.

48
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:40.400
So if you encrypt something with my public key only my private key can decrypt it.

49
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:51.710
Now on the V-twin Why lines we can specify transport input and specify protocol and I'll specify telnet

50
00:04:52.130 --> 00:05:01.640
and S-sh for security reasons you may only want to allow S-sh rather than telnet and S-sh specified

51
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.910
log in local.

52
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:12.370
So the local username and password databases used and then specify a version of S-sh version 2 is more

53
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.370
secure than Version 1 show.

54
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:25.100
IP S-sh we can see that S-sh is now enabled show S-sh they are no connections at the moment.

55
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:32.030
Now I can still telnet to the Rodda because we allowed telnet sessions

56
00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:48.560
but if we did the following line Vittie y 0 for transport input S-sh telnet sessions would no longer

57
00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.410
be allowed.

58
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:56.860
So show run pipe begin Viti why we're using log in local.

59
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.580
So this is not required.

60
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:06.070
We are only allowing S-sh sessions and interactive sessions will timeout after five minutes.

61
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:13.780
So S-sh we have a few options to specify 10 1 one to notice.

62
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.050
No user is specified.

63
00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.080
We have to specify a user.

64
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.700
So I'm going to say David.

65
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.730
And then the IP address of the Rodda.

66
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:36.260
Now I can log in NY shock we still capturing if we search for S-sh now we can see S-sh traffic we can

67
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:44.750
see the encryption used in this case it's a mess a Schumacher Shaw one don't worry too much about that

68
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:49.840
at the moment that's discussed in more detail in the VPN section.

69
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.790
There are some key exchanges taking place Diffie Hellman keys are used here.

70
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.890
So we can see all the negotiation between the two devices.

71
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.330
But once that's taken place we won't be able to see the data.

72
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:10.120
Notice the data is encrypted so as an example I'll type show run

73
00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:16.510
is the fool running config

74
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.290
in shock we can't see the data.

75
00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:29.230
We just see encrypted output here.

76
00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:33.810
So a hacker would not be able to view the data.

77
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:40.100
The hacker would only know that there's an S-sh session from one device to the other.

78
00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:50.380
So in other words in this example 10 1 1 1 is 10 1 1 2 the source port number is this the destination

79
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.000
port number is 22.

80
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.650
In other words S-sh.

81
00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:57.020
Notice how that is different to a telnet session

82
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:05.690
in a telnet session.

83
00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.760
We can see all the data in clear text.

84
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:18.500
So it's much better to use S-sh and it's better to restrict access to your devices to the use of S-sh

85
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:26.000
putty is free software that you can download from the internet and it supports both telnet and S-sh

86
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.730
but uses S-sh by default.

87
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:36.800
So if you're on a Windows machine download puttee if you using a Mac or Linux machine is SH's built

88
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.440
into the operating system.

89
00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:46.350
If you are on a road or a switch you can simply use the S-sh client on the Cisco device.

90
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:58.780
So let's S-sh back from Rotto one to router to put in the password plugged in show IP S-sh we can see

91
00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.330
that the version of S-sh is version 2.

92
00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:11.040
Once again show S-sh we can see that a session has been started by user named David inconnection our

93
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:11.840
connection.

94
00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.300
We can see the encryption.

95
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:18.560
Yes 128 bit encryption and authentication is Schaal one.

96
00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:26.710
Shaw is a hashing algorithm similar to M.D five is ending corruption algorithm similar to days or triple

97
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:30.530
days but it's a lot better than those protocols.

98
00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:38.340
No S-sh version 1 server is running only version 2 is running and we have these connections to the Rodda

99
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:50.620
when I log out show S-sh we can see that no such connections are running once again in why Shawk

100
00:09:53.590 --> 00:10:01.720
everything is encrypted so we can see the encrypted packet but we can't see any data that makes up that

101
00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.620
encrypted packet.
