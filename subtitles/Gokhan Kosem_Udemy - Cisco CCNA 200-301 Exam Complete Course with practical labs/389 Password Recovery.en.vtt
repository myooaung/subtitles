00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:07.750
A simple search in a search engine such as Google for Siska possible recovery will show you documents

2
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:13.840
such as the following which give you step by step instructions for recovering passwords from various

3
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.460
devices.

4
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:24.720
Here's an example for the Cisco twenty nine hundred integrated services Rodda documents such as the

5
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.620
following.

6
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.140
We'll show you a step by step procedure for recovering the passwords.

7
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.740
So for example either switch off or shut down the router.

8
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.580
Remove the Compact Flash that is on the back of the router.

9
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:45.240
Here's an example of a twenty nine fifty one you can get more information about the backpedals slots

10
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:51.960
and connectors on the various routers once again from Cisco's Web site says an example shown here on

11
00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:01.110
a 29 01 where the compact flashes the 0 and 1 and that'll continue for various routers of different

12
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.770
descriptions.

13
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:11.340
So as an example for a 29:11 the Compact Flash is found here and here you need to remove the Compact

14
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:19.260
Flash as an example and then switch on the router once the rot is in from Mon mode reinsert the Compact

15
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:27.450
Flash and then type rage is 0 x 2 1 4 2 at the Roman prompt.

16
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.790
Now as part of this course you'll have access to the config of register software.

17
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.930
This allows you to see various options for the configuration register as an example if you set it to

18
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:53.810
2 1 4 2 as shown on the Cisco Web site that shows you that it ignores nv ram contents but six is certain.

19
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.030
In other words the third hexadecimal value.

20
00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.010
And if you remember a hex values for binary bits.

21
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.320
But but six is set on.

22
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.680
Which means ignore nv ram contents.

23
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.720
So the router will boot up but it will ignore any saved configuration.

24
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:21.800
You type reset to reboot the router so the Rotto will now reboot but ignore the saved configuration.

25
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.630
You need to type.

26
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:31.710
No or Control-C to skip the initial set up procedure then type enable at the root prompt and then type

27
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:42.110
config memory or copy startup config to running config and then you could change the password by typing

28
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:48.650
configure terminal enable secret and whatever password you want to configure.

29
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.380
You will need to know shut any interfaces that you want to use when the router boots.

30
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.350
All interfaces will be in the down state.

31
00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.060
When you copy a config from startup to running config so you need to manually shut them.

32
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:09.650
You should then use the config register command to set it back to the default register.

33
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.100
So config register is 0 x 2 1 0 2 as an example.

34
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.540
And then you need to save your config.

35
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:24.740
This document is great Shoji the full examples of what you're going to be doing rather than doing it

36
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:25.750
that way.

37
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.860
I'm going to simply demonstrate this.
