Welcome to this software defined networking and open flow introductory course.

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.500
My name is David Bumble and I'll be a presenter for this training in this course.

3
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.550
We are firstly going to answer the question what is software defined networking or SDM.

4
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:25.170
There are different definitions and it's often confusing to understand what SD and actually is.

5
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.610
You speak to three engineers and you get three different answers.

6
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:36.060
So I'm going to try and clarify this and explain different definitions of SD.

7
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.210
The next question we're going to answer is is this SD n stuff actually real.

8
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.870
Are people actually implementing Software Defined Networking.

9
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.130
Are they using open flow is open flow any city in the same thing.

10
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.570
So we'll tackle those questions and then I'm going to explain briefly what open SDM is and what open

11
00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.480
flow is.

12
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.700
And in my opinion no course is good enough if we don't have a demonstration of this actually being used

13
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.900
practically.

14
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.170
So I'm gonna demonstrate open flow switches integrated with a controller.

15
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:18.960
In this case the HP Van SD and controller running an application downloaded and installed from the HP

16
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:25.620
AppStore this course is an introduction to multiple courses that cover software defined networking and

17
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.920
open flow as we explain.

18
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.590
SD and in more detail you'll see that open flow in SD and our separate concepts and some implementations

19
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.920
of SD and do not use open flow at all.

20
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.890
Hopefully by the end of the short course you'll have a good understanding of what ISDN is and what open

21
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.970
flow is and then you'll be able to decide for yourself which other courses you'd be interested in taking.

22
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.800
I hope you'll take other courses that I've created that you'll enjoy the content and most importantly

23
00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.330
that you'll learn something new by taking these courses all the very best and let's get started.
