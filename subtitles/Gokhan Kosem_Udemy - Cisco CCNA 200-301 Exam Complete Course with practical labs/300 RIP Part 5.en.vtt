00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The default-information originate command

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
allows you to advertise a default route in RIP.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
At the moment on router 1 show ip route

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
doesn’t show a default route and the gateway of last resort is not set.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The same is true on router 2, gateway of last resort is not set

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
no default static route.

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:34.000
On router 3 I could advertise a default route into the RIP process

8
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
by using the command default-information originate.

9
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Now on router 2, the gateway of last resort has been set to router 3

10
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and notice a default route has been added to the routing table on router 1

11
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
the same thing is true.

12
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Now, this is useful if you connect to the Internet.

13
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So I’m going to connect router 3 to the Internet

14
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
in this case, I’m bridging the cloud to my local PC's network adapter

15
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and I’m going to configure F0/1 on router 3 with DHCP

16
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
so IP address DHCP I’ll no shut it

17
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
so what I should see is that I get allocated an IP address

18
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:39.000
through DHCP at the moment F0/1 hasn’t got an IP address assigned

19
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I see a message on my console showing me that this address was allocated

20
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
so show ip interface brief again

21
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
shows me that that IP address was allocated to the router

22
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
on the router now show ip route

23
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
shows me that this router also has a default route to this router

24
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
which is my Internet router.

25
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I'm going to enable ip domain-lookup

26
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and I’m going set the DNS server to Google in this example

27
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
so router 3 is able to ping Google

28
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
looks like my Internet isn't very good at the moment

29
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
but the DNS did resolve and I’m able to ping Google.

30
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
It’s actually used the Internet router as the DNS server in this example.

31
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000
On router 2 ip domain-lookup

32
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
ip name-server, this case we'll set it to Google.

33
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.000
show ip route we’ve got our default route, ping google.com.

34
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Now in this example, it’s not going to work

35
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
because my Internet router doesn’t know about these routes.

36
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
These routes are not being advertised into my local area network.

37
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I’m only running RIP on F0/0 the loopback interface is 0 and 1

38
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
RIP is not enabled on this interface.

39
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
So what I’ll do is go into the interface

40
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and enable NAT quickly

41
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
just to show you an example of RIP and NAT working together

42
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.000
it took a while there, F0/0 is inside

43
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:46.000
IP NAT inside source list access list 1 interface F0/1 overload

44
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
so in this example, I’m enabling PAT on the router

45
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
please refer to the NAT section for more detail

46
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
on how to set up NAT

47
00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000
so hopefully that will allow me to connect to the Internet now

48
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:10.000
which I can now do on router 2, because NAT has been enabled on router 1.

49
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
So router 2 can ping the Internet

50
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000
router 1 is receiving a default route through RIP

51
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.000
and can I ping Google, at the moment not, I need to enable IP domain-lookup

52
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:37.000
and I need to specify DNS server so ping google.com

53
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.000
the DNS query succeeded and I’m able to ping google.com

54
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:52.000
so in this example, I used the command default-information originate

55
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
to advertise a default route to all RIP routers in the topology.

56
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
I didn’t have to configure a default route on router 1 or router 2

57
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
they learned about the default route from router 3

58
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
through RIP because of this command.

59
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Additionally, in this example, I enabled NAT on this interface

60
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:19.000
because I’m not running RIP on this network which is a 192.168.1.0 network

61
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
RIP is only running on this interface and the loopbacks of router 3.
