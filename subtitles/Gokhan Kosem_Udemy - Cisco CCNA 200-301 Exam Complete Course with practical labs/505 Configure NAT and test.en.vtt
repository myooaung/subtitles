00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.840
In previous videos we can figure this typology we can forget NHS IP router configured spanning tree

2
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:14.220
we configured the GOP on the course switches and the Internet facing Rodda and we've done various things

3
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:20.470
to optimize the typology in this video I'm going to configure a network address translation on router

4
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:28.470
3 to enable devices in our Jeana's three topology to access the internet use router three router three

5
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.220
is configured with an IP address on fust.

6
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:41.730
Ethan it is 0 1 and the IP address is 1 2 1 6 8 1 1 24 router 3 has a default gateway of 1 2 1 6 8 1

7
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.260
2 5 4.

8
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:51.030
This is the internet facing Rodda in the cloud that router does not have the ability to run routing

9
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.980
protocols.

10
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.990
So I can't advertise the Ten Network running with ingenius 3 2 DAC router.

11
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.600
So to get this to work I'm simply going to enable that on router 3.

12
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.150
With this being the outside interface and this being the inside interface not to be correct with wording

13
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:17.760
we actually enabling port address translation so that multiple devices in our topology can be nattered

14
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.480
to the IP address on the interface.

15
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:28.890
So on first Ethan it is 0 1 I'm going to use the Kamani IP Nat outside to enable Nat on the interface

16
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.310
and make it to be the outside interface from a net point of view.

17
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.170
That takes a while to come up in June 3.

18
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.360
But after a while a should be able to configure this interface as the inside.

19
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.660
And there you go so fast.

20
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.420
Ethan it is 0 0 IP Nat in site.

21
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.720
So we've told the Rodda that this interfaces the outside interface.

22
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.660
This interface is the inside interface.

23
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:59.850
So now we need to configure Nat and we do that by tapping the command IP Nat insight.

24
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.740
I want a NAT devices on the inside network.

25
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.120
And in this case I want to net source IP addresses based on an access list which is going to be access

26
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:18.840
list one and began and then on to interface first Ethernet is 0 1 and we going to enable that by using

27
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.320
the overload keyword.

28
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:28.320
So the next step is to create an access list which is X-ists list one referenced over here in the net

29
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.520
command.

30
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.170
And I'm going to permit all devices in the 10 network

31
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:45.630
so show run pipe include a NAT shows me that we've got Nat configured on the inside interface that is

32
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:52.380
configured on the outside interface and we are overloading the outside interface not to be precise we

33
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.620
should do this show run interface first Ethan it's 0 0 and we can see that IP not inside is enabled

34
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:08.310
on that interface an IP net to outside is enabled on fast Ethernet 0 1 show IP that translations at

35
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.760
the moment there are no net translations.

36
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.800
So let's go on to Rotto one acting as PC one.

37
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.600
And let's see if we can ping Google dot com at the moment.

38
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:30.140
Notice please that it's trying to translate Google dot com using a broadcast and this takes a while

39
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.350
to time out.

40
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.310
The reason why is the Rhondda is doing a domain lookup.

41
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.460
Now that's not shown by default in the running config.

42
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:53.680
But if I type no IP domain look up and then try and ping Google dot com again.

43
00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:04.850
Notice the ping times are immediately if I use IP domain Look-Up I should specify my DNS server.

44
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.120
So IP names the.

45
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:14.420
And in this case I'll specify Google when I try and ping Google dot com.

46
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.690
In this case notice it works.

47
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:26.310
We got a reply from the Google DNS server and we were able to ping googled outcome Ratta once traffic

48
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.620
is being enacted by router 3.

49
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:36.450
So notice we can see the net translations has the connection to the Google DNS server and he has the

50
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:44.040
connection to Google this is the IP address of Rotto one on the inside interface.

51
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:51.980
And this is the netted IP address of rodder one which is the IP address of first East and it is 0 1

52
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.180
as shown over there.

53
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.310
I'll show these together

54
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:07.340
so D-bag IP that that's actually on the wrong rattus on all router three de-bug IP Nat and what I'll

55
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.720
do now is I will do a ping to Google dot com.

56
00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.920
And what we should see is you should see the net translations taking place and they you go notice source

57
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:26.050
IP address 10 1 10 11 the IP address was translated to 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 1 24.

58
00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:35.480
That's the IP address once again our first Ethernet is 0 1 on router 3 going to google dotcom the initial

59
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.070
ping timed out.

60
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:38.600
So we saw that there.

61
00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:47.480
But there's the second ping and there's the reply to the ping from Google destination IP address of

62
00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:55.640
1 2 1 6 8 1 1 24 he's translated back to standard one to 10 or 11 is forwarded through the network to

63
00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:02.150
route one show IP that translation shows me that at the moment there are no net translations they've

64
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.070
timed out.

65
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:09.000
So let's telnet to Google dot com on port 80.

66
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.450
You can see that it's connected.

67
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.160
So it's opening that connection.

68
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:20.210
And in the net translations you can see here is the DNS request to the DNS server and the reply.

69
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.340
And he has the connection to the Google server.

70
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:33.860
So show IP Nat translation shows me the DNS request and this is the connection to the web server.

71
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.090
In other words Google dot com on port 80.

72
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:44.090
You can see that we are currently connected to the Google server or press control see on the Rodda Precentor

73
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.810
we can see something happening in the not translations.

74
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:55.910
I use Control shift 6 x to jump back to the Rodda because it's keeping the connection open so disconnect

75
00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:04.330
my connection so we've successfully configured Nat in this network a lying rod a one to connect to Google.

76
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:14.630
Let's do the same on router to acting as PC to its own PC to IP name server will be Google paying.

77
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.020
She's another server.

78
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:24.750
Cisco dot com can see that the DNS query succeeded and we were able to ping Cisco dot com.

79
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.860
What about CNN.com.

80
00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.780
In this case the pings are being dropped by the server.

81
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.550
So let's try Yahoo.

82
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:41.870
Dot com we can see that the pings succeed.

83
00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:49.950
So we've successfully configured the entire network as well as configured Nat on router 3 and these

84
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:54.260
routers acting as PCs can now access devices on the Internet.
