00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.140
The quality of service assuring soaring guide is a really good guide to use for both study as well as

2
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.550
for real world applications.

3
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:15.770
It has as an example recommendations for classification and marking so as an example voice traffic should

4
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:26.360
use an IP precedents of 5 a per hop behavior or GHB which is similar in concept to DCP of E F and DSP

5
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.170
a 46 per hop behaviour essentially is a CLOs.

6
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:39.080
So what class of traffic Will traffic be put into and how will it be treated on a per hop behaviour.

7
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:45.890
In other words by each node in a network how will your Rodders and switches treat the traffic the physical

8
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.480
marking would be 46.

9
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:54.230
So that's the DCP and at least to your costs in your edit to the one queue head it would be set to 5

10
00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:02.240
and the NPL less experimental bits will be set to 5 as well called signalling protocol such as sub or

11
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:10.570
a 2 to 3 I use an IP presidents of three proper behavior would be either a f 31 or C S three and the

12
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.600
DCP would be either 26 or 24.

13
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:21.690
That's because there are differences in the way that phones mock traffic depending on how old they are

14
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:32.270
bulk data as an example would have an IP presidents of 1 per hop behaviour of a F eleven DCP of ten

15
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:41.720
and a cost experimental value of 1 the different ways to create classes depending on how close you are

16
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.720
to the edge of the network.

17
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:50.220
If you're at the edge of the network in other words you right here where your pieces and phones are

18
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.550
connecting to the network you may use multiple classes such as the quality of service baseline model

19
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.120
but in a lot of cases as you get closer and closer to the core.

20
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:09.310
So in a core empire less network as an example they'll end up only having four or five classes they

21
00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.340
will aggregate traffic classes into fewer classes as you get closer to the core of the network.
