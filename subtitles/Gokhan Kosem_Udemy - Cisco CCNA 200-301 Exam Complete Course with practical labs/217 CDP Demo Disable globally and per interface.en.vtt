00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So once again in this example

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
we can see that the device connected to router 3

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
is a Cisco 3750 switch with this IP address.

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This is the platform and this is the version of software

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
that the switch is  running.

6
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So from a security point of view

7
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
what you may wanna do is type no cdp run

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
which disables CDP on the entire router or switch.

9
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Now when I type sh cdp neighbors notice CDP is not enabled on the device.

10
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
On switch 2 sh cdp neighbors

11
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
still shows router 3 in  the list because of the timers.

12
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
If I type sh cdp enter

13
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I can see that CDP is sending updates every 60 seconds

14
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and we have a whole timer of a 180 seconds

15
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
so there are 2 things that you need to remember here

16
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
when you start up a device for the first time

17
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
it may take 60 seconds before the device appears in the list of neighbors.

18
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So don’t make the mistake that others have made

19
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
where they enabled an interface on a switch or a router

20
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and then use CDP to check if the neighboring devices connected

21
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and they see nothing and assume that there’s a problem on the link.

22
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Wait at least 60 seconds for the CDP updates to be sent

23
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
before you assume that there’s a problem.

24
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
It can take 60 seconds for a device appear in the list

25
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
when you use the command sh cdp neighbors

26
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
It can also take 180 seconds for entries to disappear.

27
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So we’ve disabled CDP on router 3

28
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
but it's showing up in the list

29
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
because it takes a while for these entries to be removed.

30
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Notice at the moment, that the whole time is 46 seconds

31
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.000
now 38, now 35 and that’s decrementing down from 180.

32
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
If we type sh cdp once again, notice the holdtime is 180 seconds.

33
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:27.000
this other values are being reset constantly through the CDP updates

34
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
but router 3 entry is decrementing

35
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and will now timeout in a few seconds

36
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
because of the 180 second timer

37
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
so there’s 1 second, there’s 0 seconds

38
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and now after while that entry will be removed from the local switch.

39
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Where other entries are constantly being reset.

40
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
So notice switch 4 was a 139 seconds but is now 175 seconds.

41
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
But router 3 has now been removed from the table

42
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
we've shown previously but it’s now not available in the CDP table.

43
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:21.000
So the commands no cdp run disable CDP globally on a device.

44
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
cdp run enables it

45
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
sh cdp neighbors

46
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
allows the device to start discovering neighbors

47
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and notice now we have router 3 back again on switch 2.

48
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
On router 3 we might want to keep CDP enabled globally
.

49
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
but then disable it

50
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
on the Internet facing interface.

51
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
So now we can type no cdp enable

52
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Previously, we were seeing the 3750 switch

53
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
connected on FatEthernet 0/1 and the switch was using FatEthernet 1/1

54
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
s cdp neighbor now still shows that entry

55
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
but our router is not advertising itself to that neighbor.

56
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000
So let’s look at details and telnet to the switch.

57
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000
I'll login shows cdp neighbors

58
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
notice it sees various physical Cisco routers

59
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
and it also sees router 3

60
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and what you’ll notice here is the whole time is also decrementing

61
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and will eventually time out

62
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000
because router 3 is not advertising itself to the Cisco switch.

63
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
I’ll use CTRL shift 6X to jump back to router 3

64
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
sh cdp neighbor

65
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Notice the core 3750, timeout is also decrementing.

66
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
So eventually, I won't bore you by making you wait

67
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
this amount of time, I'll speed up the video

68
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
but eventually, those 2 entries will disappear.

69
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
In other words, router 3 will no longer see the Cisco switch

70
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and the Cisco switch will no longer see router 3 in the list.

71
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
So sh cdp neighbors

72
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
notice we have 5 seconds now

73
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
on router 3 as shown on the Cisco switch

74
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:34.000
now it's set 0 second and now router 3 is no longer shown

75
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
in the list of available devices on the 3750

76
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
I’ll jump back to router 3, sh cdp neighbors

77
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Notice router 3 sees switch 2

78
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:53.000
but no longer sees the Cisco 3750 switch on F0/1

79
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and once again that’s because I disabled CDP on that interface

80
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
so I'll enable it again by typing cdp enable

81
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000
I have to do that on the interface so cdp enable

82
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.000
sh cdp neighbor I’ve just enabled CDP.

83
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:24.000
I’m starting to see other devices I can now see the 3750 switch on F0/1.

84
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Now the router is seeing itself

85
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and that’s because other switches in the topology that are non-Cisco switches

86
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
which are allowing CDP through.

87
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
So CDP is the Cisco propriety protocol

88
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
and maybe forwarded through other devices and hence the router can see itself.

89
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
So what about non-Cisco devices? Let's now discuss LLDP.
