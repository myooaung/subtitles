00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.680
This video we're going to discuss static routes.

2
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.560
I've been asked a number of times about to study grants.

3
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:24.360
Are you able for example to have a multiple study Grotz configured on a Rodda are you able to have multiple

4
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.720
default Rantz configured on a router.

5
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:34.290
Can you mix default Trotz and static Grotz what's the effect of all of the above.

6
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.770
In this example we can get to configure static routes on Rato one and to test connectivity to the loopback

7
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.630
of wrote a five we have a two router three and wrote a four in the typology and they configured with

8
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:56.830
different subnets rodder two is configured with IP address 10 1 1 2 on the interface Radi 3 is configured

9
00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:06.660
with 10 1 to 2 on the interface and a Foy's configured was 10 1 3 2 on this interface or Lenk.

10
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.400
So you just wrote a one.

11
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.450
What are we going to test.

12
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.910
Is connectivity to the loopback of route of 5.

13
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:22.490
So from road a one is it able to ping the loopback of wrote a five.

14
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:29.330
So after the moment when not paying the loop back out of 5 we get timeouts.

15
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:38.030
The router is not able to ping the loopback wrote a 5 show IP router shows us the writing table.

16
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:47.860
What youll notice is that it only contains connected and local Roths there's no route to 5.5 to 5.5

17
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.750
de-bug IP packet.

18
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:56.530
As an example will show us what happens when the Rodda tryst paying that address so I'm going to ping

19
00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.390
5.5.

20
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.270
5.5.

21
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.580
And repeat it once and let's see what the output looks like.

22
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.540
Notice unrideable the rodded doesn't know where to rock the packets.

23
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.320
And again that's because there's no route to the destination.

24
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.240
There's also no gateway of last resort set on the Rodda.

25
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.350
So it has no way to get to this IP address.

26
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.470
We could configure a route as follows.

27
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:38.110
So an exact match on the route and pointed to a train that wandered 1 to 2 which is routed to show IP

28
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.880
right now shows us that route in the rotting table.

29
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.160
Second the router not paying the loopback of wrote a 5.

30
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.540
And the answer is yes it can.

31
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.070
I'm going to disable IP domain look up here to speed up trace route.

32
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.270
So let's trace to the loop back of route of 5.

33
00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:06.170
Notice it's going via 10 1 1 2 which is routed to and then it gets to run a 5.

34
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:17.990
What happens if I configure a static route like this and pointed to two routers three which way will

35
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.970
the traffic go.

36
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.960
So let's have a look at the writing table.

37
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.930
Show IP wrocht shows us two entries in the writing table.

38
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.630
There are two ways to get to the loop back of route or five.

39
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:38.170
So if I trace to that loop back Notice it's still going via route to.

40
00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.270
In other words it's going to 10 1 1 2.

41
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:52.520
And the reason for that is because this entry is more specific than the sentry rodders when deciding

42
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.620
where to run traffic.

43
00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:00.430
Look at the longest match of a route this route is a 32 but match.

44
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.920
This is a 24 bit match.

45
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.530
So the traffic's going to go via train 1 1 to.

46
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:16.540
And we can prove that by doing a trace route if we remove this route from the writing table

47
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:31.840
and then do a trace again notice the trace route is going via 10 1 to 2 but that's because we only have

48
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.270
this route in the writing table.

49
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.220
If we created another static front like this

50
00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.110
via route a full

51
00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:55.660
which way with the traffic go so show IP route shows us the two entries we've got to slash 16 slash

52
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:56.650
24.

53
00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:06.270
So when we trace to route a five notice it's going via Rodda three because this is a longer match.

54
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.390
That is a longer match than this.

55
00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:16.340
So Rodda three is preferred rather than a full.

56
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.170
But again if we removed

57
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.540
that dropped from the writing table someone to remove the sentry

58
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.080
so remove the static ROFFT

59
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:44.540
Now when we look at the writing table we only have the sentry so traffic will go via 10 1 3 2.

60
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.180
In other words it's going to go via road for

61
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:55.810
if I add a more specific product of let's say slash 20 for

62
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.800
going via router three again

63
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:10.720
notice the traffic goes via Rotto three.

64
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.120
And if I use a more specific route such as this

65
00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.640
going via a router to rather

66
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:32.750
notice the traffic goes viral it to show IP route to shows us those routes they slashed 28 to rot is

67
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:39.170
more specific than a slash 24 route which is more specific than a slash 16 raht.

68
00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:46.260
So remember with static routes and this applies to other routing protocols as well more specific matches

69
00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:47.940
when.

70
00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:53.520
So what happens if we add a route like this

71
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:05.080
same mosque as rodded to configure it to go to rodders 3.

72
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.560
So show IP route.

73
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:16.670
Notice the difference in the writing table now weve got two entries for the same route.

74
00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:24.550
So when we trace to the loop back now notice its doing load balancing traffic is load balancing across

75
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:34.260
both parts and thats because weve got two equal entries in the running table.

76
00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:37.130
Its a show run include Robert

77
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:45.750
these two rats are going to be used for load balancing because they are the most specific and they are

78
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.440
the same length.

79
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:49.210
These two will be ignored.

80
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.380
But if we copy that and add an entry

81
00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:04.420
going to 10 1 3 2 2 Rotto for the writing table shows us three entries.

82
00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:08.770
Now if we trace to the loop back.

83
00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:14.310
Now notice its going to load balance across those three routes.

84
00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:20.660
You need to be careful with this because sometimes depending on the router the load balancing may actually

85
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:26.820
not be true but for CCMA level we assume that it load balances as follows.

86
00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:36.630
So show run pipe include dropped things to remember most specific entries when if there are multiple

87
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:43.170
entries with the same rot and same mosque such as these three the ratable load balance across those

88
00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:45.570
paths equally.

89
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:53.980
So in other words equal cost load balancing all load sharing enjoyed this video if it was a benefit

91
00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:00.430
I wish you all the very best.
