00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:07.560
In this video I'm going to show you how to configure a router on a stick or an external router that's

2
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.830
connected to allow you to switch that performs that into villaine rodding to allow devices in one line

3
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:21.300
to communicate with devices in another villaine the typology that we're going to build consists of two

4
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.500
devices.

5
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.490
PC one will configure with an IP address of 10 at one to two to one and the default gateway will be

6
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:38.610
Rotto one with 10 to 1 to 2 2 5 4 in land to pc 2 will be configured with an IP address of 10 to 1 to

7
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:49.710
3 to 1 slushed 24 default gateways router 1 IP address 10 1 2 3 2 5 4 in line 3.

8
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:57.330
So this router will use an 8 to 1 queue trunk to the switch and do the interview LAN rotting so that

9
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.270
a PC one can ping PC to.

10
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.260
In other words we are into Villiam writing between villaine too and we learnt three.

11
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:16.800
So I've started a new project called Track a Rodda into the workspace and grab an Ethernet switch as

12
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.360
well as TV PC devices.

13
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:32.950
Now when you start configure it to switch and delete all current interfaces that are all going to be

14
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.590
in VLAN 1 and are going to be configured as access ports.

15
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.640
So we want to start with a new switch configuration support one is going to be an access port in villain

16
00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:53.830
to port two is going to be an access port in violent three port three is going to be a trunk port and

17
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.820
we're going to configure the native villaine as the LAN one.

18
00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:04.120
So that's a switch configuration port one isn't beelined to port today and we land three access ports

19
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.360
port three is going to be an attitude of one queue trunk.

20
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:15.730
I can now configure the devices and connect them to the switch so fast.

21
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:22.310
Ethan it is 0 0 0 on our Rodda will be configured into villaine routing

22
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.230
so this host will configures 10 to 1 to 2 1 slushed 24 in violent to

23
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.190
the host we will configure as 12:57 in violent three

24
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.210
and the Rodda

25
00:02:48.970 --> 00:03:02.650
will be to five full in the relevant villans also configure villaine one as the native land on fast

26
00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.640
Ethernet 00 on the router.

27
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.140
Now you can obviously make the topology more pretty for lack of a better word.

28
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.700
I'm not going to do that for the sake of time.

29
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.480
So start the devices up

30
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.020
and open console ports to the devices.
