00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In this lab we'll start off with the simple topology of 2 routers

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
router 1 and router 2

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
what we'll do here, is configure router 2 as the DHCP server

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and we'll configure router 1 as the DHCP client in this topology.

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
No configuration has been done on this routers.

6
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
At the moment as an example, on router 2, sh ip int brief

7
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
shows me that all the interfaces are currently down

8
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
no IP addresses has been configured.

9
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So the first thing I’m gonna do is go on to the FastEthernet interface

10
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and configure an IP address of 10.1.1.2/24 mask.

11
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I'll no shut that interface and now I'll configure the router as the DHCP server.

12
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So to configure the DHCP server, the first thing you need to do is type ip dhcp

13
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
that gives you a range of options but the one that we're looking for is pool

14
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
so pool, and then we specify a name such as clients, as an example.

15
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
This is just the name, to uniquely identify the pool that you're creating

16
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and that’s because you can have multiple pools configured on a router.

17
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Network, we need to specify the network that devices will be allocated addresses from

18
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
now it's important that the IP address that DHCP requests are being received on.

19
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Which in this example a F0/0 be in the same subnet as the network.

20
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Otherwise the router is not gonna allocate addresses from the pool.

21
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So this interface is configured with an IP address of 10.1.1.2

22
00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and we are configuring a network of 10.1.1.0/24

23
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
there are many options available in the pool.

24
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
We’ve already configured the network and mask.

25
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Next option, you'll probably want to configure is default gateway or default router.

26
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I’m gonna set that to router 2.

27
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
You'd also want to specify options such as DNS server.

28
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
In this example, I'll configure the router as DNS server

29
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
but typically what your going to do here

30
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
is configure a real DNS server somewhere in your topology.

31
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
So I'll just configure a single DNS server being the local router.

32
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
You can specify how long addresses are allocated to hosts, the default is 1 day

33
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I’m gonna specify lease time of 7 days.

34
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Now for devices such as IP phones, you can specify different DHCP option codes.

35
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
150 is TFTP and I’m gonna specify an IP address of a TFTP server.

36
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Now in the real implementation, your IP telephones will get their configuration

37
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
typically from a Cisco Unified Communications Manager

38
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
or from a Cisco Unified Communications Manager's express router.

39
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
So this would be the IP address of the Cisco communications manager.

40
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
In our example once again, I’m just gonna set that to the local router.

41
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Now to stop conflicts, an allocation of addresses that belong to servers and routers

42
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Use the command   ip dhcp excluded-address

43
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
and you specify a range of addresses to exclude from allocation to devices.

44
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Now my router has an IP address of 10.1.1.2

45
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
I don’t want the router to allocate its own IP address to host devices.

46
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
So I’m going to set the exclusion range to include the router's IP address

47
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
and some extra IP addresses here, that would typically be determined

48
00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
by how many servers or other devices are going to have IP addresses statically configured.

49
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
sh run    will show me my configuration.

50
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
So it’s quite a simple config, I’ve got my exclusion range

51
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I’ve created a pool called clients.

52
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Clients will be allocated addresses in this IP address subnet.

53
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Default router is router 2, the local router.

54
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
DNS server is set to that and option 150 is set to that as well.

55
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Once again typically, this will be set to servers in your live network.

56
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
I’ve set the lease to 7 days, the default is 1 day.

57
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
show ip dhcp   gives me different options, including pool.

58
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
This can be useful because sometimes you can make a typing mistake

59
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
and you may exclude all of your addresses.

60
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
But notice here, total addresses is 254, lease addresses is 0

61
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
no addresses have been leased, address range is in this range.

62
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Let’s look at bindings, of any address has been allocated

63
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
at the moment no addresses has been allocated.

64
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000
So let’s go to the client

65
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
I’m gonna change the MAC address of this client, to something very simple

66
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
so that we can read it in the output

67
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000
so MAC address is gonna be A,B,C

68
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
IP address is gonna be set to DHCP

69
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
so the PC will request an IP address from the server

70
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
when I type no shut   show debug

71
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
lets run a debug so we can see what’s happening

72
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
debug ip dhcp server    and we have different options

73
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
I’m gonna go for packet, which shows me lots of detail.

74
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
So debug ip dhcp server packet    now when I hit no shut

75
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.000
we should start seeing requests from the client, to the DHCP server and there we go

76
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:05.000
we've got a DHCP discover message, received from the client on interface FastEthernet 0/0

77
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
The DHCP server will allocate an address without class information

78
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
we didn’t configure a name or class for this device.

79
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
The DHCP servers offering an address to the client, offering it this IP address

80
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:28.000
and then sending the reply to the MAC address of the PC that we configured, so that MAC address.

81
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
The client then requests that IP address from the DHCP server

82
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
DHCP server sents back an acknowledgement.

83
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:47.000
So sh ip int brief FastEthernet 0/0 on router 1

84
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
has been allocated to this address through DHCP

85
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000
sh ip route   the router has learnt about the gateway of last resort

86
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:05.000
because we've configured a default gateway or default router in the DHCP pool.

87
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
So router 1 has learnt about that network

88
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
and a static default router has been added to the routing table.

89
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
It’s a simple as that to configure a basic DHCP server on the Cisco router

90
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
and allocate addresses to client devices.

91
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
to actually view the messages sent between the client and the server.
