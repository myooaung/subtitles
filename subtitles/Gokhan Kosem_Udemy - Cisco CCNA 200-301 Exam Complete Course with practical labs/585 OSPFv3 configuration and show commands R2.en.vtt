00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.050
He has brought it to show IP IPTV six runt.

2
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.470
We haven't learnt about any Roth's.

3
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.060
We only have a No.

4
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.350
0 rout in the routing table.

5
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:19.620
So let's configure the running named first configure the loot back IP vs 6

6
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:38.030
address 2001 face to colon on column 1 slash 64 interface gigabit 0 0 IP vs 6 2001 column 1 colon colon

7
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.880
to slash 64 no shut the interface gigabit 0 1

8
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.600
and the site will be 2001.

9
00:00:50.600 --> 00:01:01.910
Colon 2 colon colon 1 and I'll no shut that interface show I vs 6 ranked some rorts have been added

10
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:12.050
to the writing table of this rota we can see a local interface rout of 2001 colon 1 colon colon to slash

11
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.040
128.

12
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:20.570
So that's the IP address configured on gigabit 00 we can see some directly connected networks such as

13
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.080
2001 colon to Colon colon 64.

14
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:30.530
That's this network but we don't have any 0 SPF rates in the routing table.

15
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:40.770
So show IP vs 6 right 0 SPF shows no 0 SPF rights in the writing table of router 2 so first thing I

16
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.550
Peavey 6 unit cost writing has to be enabled.

17
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:55.140
Now as soon as I've done that on this router show run pipe include IP vs 6 notice that that command

18
00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:04.080
has enabled IP vs 6 self which is Cisco express forwarding allowing quicker switching of traffic from

19
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.180
one interface to another.

20
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.060
Let's contrast that with Rider 3 which has no configuration on it

21
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:22.770
so show run pipe include my Peavey 6 this Rada has the command no IP vs success.

22
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:33.950
But if we enable IP vs 6 unit cost routing on the router and then do a show run pipe include IP v 6

23
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:34.750
again.

24
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:42.020
Notice IP vs success has been enabled by default on this router that may be different to other riders

25
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.990
and switches that you use in the real world.

26
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.510
So just check on your devices.

27
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.630
You want to use safe or Cisco express forwarding for quicker throughput of traffic.

28
00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:05.480
So on this rather IP vs 6 Radha 0 SPF 1 rather OSP for 1 Rada I.D. here will be configured as 2 2 2

29
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:16.250
2 and then we will go on to our gigabit 00 interface and enable 0 SPF on that interface in Area 1 and

30
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.380
we'll also do something on the loop back.

31
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.650
So the loop back will also belong to Area 1.

32
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:31.160
Notice please that a neighbor relationship has been established with this neighbor on gigabit 00.

33
00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:37.280
So rather 2 has formed a neighbor relationship with Rod one and a rod or one we can see something similar.

34
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:48.500
It's formed a neighbor relationship with Rod a 2 so in order to show IP vs 6 protocols Oh SPF has been

35
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.930
enabled on this rather with process I.D. one Rada I.D. 2 2 2 2.

36
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.330
These interfaces have been put into SPF.

37
00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:07.030
I forgot to put gigabit 0 1 into 0 SPF so let's do that here so show IP protocols again.

38
00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:18.350
Loop back to 0 gigabit 0 0 and 0 1 have been added 2 0 SPF we have one normal area which is Area 1 Rata

39
00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:25.820
I.D. this once again show IP vs 6 0 SPF and neighbor we have a neighbor relationship with this Rada

40
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:34.540
the neighbor relationship is full the neighboring router is a designated Rada on this side show IP the

41
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:42.430
6 0 SPF neighbor it has a neighbor relationship with to 2 which has a backup designated rather local

42
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:54.410
interfaces gigabit 0 0 on both sides show IP vs 6 route notice we see an 0 SPF right in the running

43
00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:02.780
table so we could do it this way show IP vs 6 wrapped 0 SPF 2 only see 0 SPF rates and that draw is

44
00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:12.350
showing in the routing table so we could not type ping and specify protocols such as IP vs 6 and ping

45
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:24.230
2001 colon face colon 1 colon colon 1 or we can just remove IP vs 6 and specify the address the rod

46
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:31.730
is intelligent enough to know that this is an IP vs 6 IP address so we don't have to specify IP vs 6

47
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:40.910
once again that crowd has been learnt through 0 SPF but notice it's via this address it's not using

48
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:48.850
this IP address as the next top the next top is a linked local address which is the address on router

49
00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:57.020
ones gigabit 00 interface so this link local address is seen as the next hop from Robert to his point

50
00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:03.500
of view the ISP if neighbor relationship is not established using IP vs 6 global unicorns addresses

51
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:11.270
they are established using link local addresses show IP vs 6 0 SPF database

52
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:21.200
we now have two riders in the 0 SPF database but rather one is the designated rata on the segment so

53
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:29.060
we now have IP connectivity between these two routers they can ping each others loop back and I made

54
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:41.030
a mistake earlier show IP vs 6 0 SPF protocol notice this interface was added to Area 1 instead of area

55
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:53.370
0 but 0 SPF still functions 0 SPF does not require area 0 if you only have a single area and that's

56
00:06:53.370 --> 00:07:03.650
true for SPF version 3 and 0 SPF version 2 so this command on gigabit 0 1 needs to be changed

57
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:13.290
so let's remove that and put that interface

58
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:28.070
into area 0 so now show IP protocol 0 SPF is enabled on the Rada but notice we have areas 0 as well

59
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:38.540
as area 1 so they are two normal areas configured one interfaces in area 0 2 interfaces are an area

60
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:45.230
1 So now let's can figure out a 3 and router 4 and get full connectivity between these routers.
