00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:15.270
This is one of multiple IP version 6 troubleshooting videos in this and network.

2
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:22.080
We've been told that a rotten one on the left cannot ping the loopback of a three.

3
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.380
The Rotto on the right.

4
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:31.130
So let's verify that now because this is IP version 6 rather than IP version 4.

5
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.450
Notice no IP version 4 rats exist in the writing table.

6
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:44.540
We need to do all our testing using IP version 6 something of ping the loopback of router 3 we get a

7
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.480
failure.

8
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:56.080
We are not able to paying the loopback of Rodda 3 let's do a trace route and see how far we get a case

9
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.070
so what do you think about to the south.

10
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.870
Put what's going on here.

11
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:09.310
Notice we told that the destination was not found inside the max hop count diameter.

12
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.410
So let's do that again.

13
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.600
Notice what's happening.

14
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.310
So where is the traffic going.

15
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.440
Now this is a good example of a routing loop.

16
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.150
So if we scroll up.

17
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.800
Notice what's happening.

18
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.860
Traffic goes to rodded too.

19
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:34.680
Then it goes to write a one then to write it to then to write a one back to route it to back to route

20
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.010
of one and so forth and so on.

21
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.650
So we have a loop taking place here.

22
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:49.020
So let's have a look at the writing table show IPV 6 Robert Rotto one has a default route to 2001 call

23
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:57.030
on one column column two which is routed to Hence the traffic is being sent to route it to.

24
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:06.310
But on route to show IPV 6 route can you see the problem here.

25
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.650
Post the video if you need to but see if you can find the problem.

26
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.410
OK so we have a static default route to Rato 3.

27
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.020
That looks OK.

28
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.810
There's a static route to the loop back of road one that also looks OK.

29
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.620
He has a static route to the loop back of Route 3 but that looks wrong.

30
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.600
Notice where it's pointing it's saying to get to the loop back of router 3.

31
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.200
We need to go via route 1.

32
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.930
So that's definitely not right and it's kind of redundant because we have this default route in the

33
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:43.970
writing table.

34
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.500
So show run piping clewed route.

35
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:59.130
We need to get rid of this route and either fix the next hop or simply remove it and rely on the default

36
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.440
route here.

37
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.940
So Ken wrote a one paying the loop back up to three.

38
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:19.870
OK the pings are still failing it's trace to that address the packet gets sent to brought it to you

39
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.520
but then goes nowhere else so it doesn't look like it gets any further based on that output.

40
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.190
So Ken wrote it to paying the loopback of wrote a three

41
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:42.880
yes it can Sarada to Pinga Lupica wrote a three but rather one can ping the Lubeck of rorted three on

42
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.180
a three let's do it.

43
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:53.170
De-bug and check if the traffic is actually getting to rodders 3 from Rotto 1 and we can see that it

44
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.590
is.

45
00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:01.750
So we can see that the pings are arriving at rodders 3 but it looks like the reply is not getting back

46
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.350
to route 1.

47
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:11.740
So router 3 received an echo request from 2001 color on one color in column one which is Route 1 destination

48
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.050
is the loop back of Route 3.

49
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.970
So the etca replace S..

50
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:18.070
But it's not getting back again.

51
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:25.360
So let's turn off debugging and that's to a debug IPV 6 packet.

52
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.420
Now in the real world you need to be very careful doing this.

53
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.470
I'm going to send a single packet.

54
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.780
And let's see what happens.

55
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.340
Again be very careful doing this in the real world.

56
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.580
You'll get a lot of output even in the small network.

57
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.630
If we don't turn off debugging we might get a lot of output on the console.

58
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.660
So the Debug.

59
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.500
I sent a single pain from wrote a one to registry.

60
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.770
We've got a destination look up for that.

61
00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:03.610
The Rodda sees that as a local network connected to the loopback So that looks good.

62
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:13.240
But notice here IPV six forward no router to destination 2001 Cullinan colon colon one source is the

63
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:22.450
loopback of Rodda 3 destination is the gigabit 00 interface of router 1.

64
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.330
And we told that there is no valid route.

65
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.980
So it doesn't look like a router 3 knows how to get back to Rotto one.

66
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.230
So show IPV six rocked.

67
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:40.180
Is there a raft in the writing table to get back to Router one.

68
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:50.790
And the answer is no we have this static route which would allow router 3 to ping the loopback of wrote

69
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.920
a one but it can't ping.

70
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.480
Two thousand and one.

71
00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:04.600
So what we need to do is add a steady crotched to Thousand and One cold on one cool and cold and zero

72
00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:11.430
slushed 64 and send that to Rodda to.

73
00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:12.960
Now let's do the ping again.

74
00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:17.450
Notice the pings succeeded.

75
00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.130
And without using the repeat command the pings now succeed.

76
00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:30.120
So we can get to the loopback of rota 3 and we can get to the physical interface of rodders free.

77
00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.210
So be careful with pings.

78
00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:39.720
This applies to both IP version 4 and IP version 6 just because I can send traffic to you doesn't mean

79
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.420
that you know how to send traffic back to me.

80
00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:48.050
Both sides need rots in the writing table to enable two way communication.

81
00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.590
Hope you enjoyed this video.
