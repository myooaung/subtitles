00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:08.920
In the previous video we configure port security on gigabit 00 by making the port an access port and

2
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.370
then enabling port security.

3
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.890
MAC address is dynamically learnt.

4
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:25.000
So this MAC address was dynamically learnt on port to Gigabit 00 and hence Shope port security shows

5
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
us that the address permitted on that port.

6
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.860
Is this MAC address.

7
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.110
It was done I meekly learnt and has been added to the database of permitted MAC addresses on the port

8
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.860
only one MAC address is allowed

9
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.650
on gigabit 00.

10
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:50.930
So Max schem accuracy's is one if a violation does take place the security action is to shut the port

11
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:51.550
down.

12
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.440
Now let's configure MAC addresses statically So let's configure port security on gigabit.

13
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.920
0 1 but do it manually.

14
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.460
So I'm going to use the commotions switch Port.

15
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.560
Port security specify a maximum.

16
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.840
The default is 1.

17
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.390
So I'll say one here.

18
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:23.960
And what you'll notice is the output is not shown because that is a default command on the interface.

19
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:34.640
But what we'll do now is type switch port Port Security MAC address and what I'll do is explicitly specify

20
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.460
the MAC address that's allowed.

21
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:43.230
And just to prove the point or specify a different MAC address of let's say three.

22
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:55.090
Now at the moment the MAC address on this router acting as our PC is thus.

23
00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.550
So it's a different MAC address the PC can still ping rather one because we haven't explicitly enabled

24
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.440
port security yet so we've configured what the MAC address is.

25
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.970
We've configured the maximum MAC addresses allowed.

26
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.890
I'll specify the action to take if there's a violation

27
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:26.620
notice we have protect restrict and shut down the default as we've seen is shut down now protect drops

28
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.680
packets with unknown source MAC addresses until you remove a sufficient number of secure MAC addresses

29
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.130
to drop below the maximum value.

30
00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.930
In other words we are dropping packets from unknown source MAC addresses.

31
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.630
But there's no logging at the moment only allowing one MAC address.

32
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.840
But as an example if you had specified a maximum MAC address of three and a fourth a device try to send

33
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.530
traffic that to devices traffic would be dropped restrict drops packets with unknown source MAC addresses

34
00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.960
until you remove a sufficient number of secure MAC addresses to drop below the maximum value.

35
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.410
So that's very much the same as protect.

36
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.610
But in addition it causes the security violation counted to increment.

37
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:17.470
In other words there's going to be the generation of log messages and counter's will increment shutdown

38
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.260
is the default which we've already seen.

39
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:28.600
And that puts the port into a disable mode and Saens and SMP trap notification if SMP is configured.

40
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:37.110
So I'll continue to use shutdown so that we can see the output configuration looks as follows.

41
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.630
Remember the MAC address of this device is a different MAC address.

42
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:42.730
It's thus.

43
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:50.650
But we are only permitting this MAC address but because we haven't globally enabled port security port

44
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.430
security is not active.

45
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.580
So we can use the commode to show port security at the moment.

46
00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.380
Port security is enabled on gigabit 00 but not on gigabit 0 1.

47
00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:11.510
We can also use the command do show interface status at the moment both gigabit 0 0 and 0 1.

48
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.080
Our connected support hasn't been shut down because of port security.

49
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:22.740
But now when we type which port Port Security we are actually enabling port security.

50
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:33.300
And once again we need to have this configured as an access port Conti's TTP to do show run interface

51
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.050
gigabit 0 1.

52
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.990
And while I was doing that notice we received a port security violation message.

53
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:50.190
We were told that there was an issue with this mac address ending in two on gigabit.

54
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:57.050
0 1 we have only permitted the MAC address ending in three maximum MAC addresses that would be permitted.

55
00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.720
One only one MAC addresses permitted in this case.

56
00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:08.720
When we look at the Comeau and do show interface status we can see that the port was disabled.

57
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.870
So show interface status is a command that shows us the status of the ports we can see this is connected

58
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:22.210
but this port has a disabled so show port security once again shows us once again that gigabit is 0

59
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.110
0 and 0 1 have a security action of shutdown.

60
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:34.380
But the only port that's currently shut down is port 0 1.

61
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.600
So show interface status shows us that this port is still connected.

62
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:45.990
The supporters area disabled and now this host can ping right of one because the port porters are disabled

63
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:54.080
show port security interface gigabit to 0 1.

64
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.890
We can see that port security is enabled on this port.

65
00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:02.620
It's currently shut down because of the mode being shut down.

66
00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:08.770
This is the last MAC address that violated the security policy on that interface.

67
00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:24.560
So on brought it to if we change the MAC address to the the MAC address expected by the switch it still

68
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.660
won't be able to ping because of the violation that took place.

69
00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:38.590
So we need to go into the port and shut it down and then no shut it.

70
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:44.480
And once that's done and the switch learns the correct MAC address

71
00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:52.530
the device should be able to ping.

72
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.540
So at the moment the MAC address hasn't been learnt

73
00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.360
just waiting for the interface to come up.

74
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.240
So show interface status.

75
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:09.420
Let's see what's going on interfaces connected.

76
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.890
And now the ping succeeds.

77
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:17.620
I was just too impatient and I needed to wait for spending tree and other protocols to sort themselves

78
00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:23.820
out but show port security interface gigabit 0 1.

79
00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:31.070
We can see port security is enabled violation mode shut down at the moment the port status is secure

80
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:36.200
and the interfaces up last MAC address that was seen was this on that port.

81
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.550
No security violations occurred.

82
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:43.540
Maximum MAC address is once again allowed as one total MAC address is seen as one.

83
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:51.410
One MAC address is being configured because we manually configured the MAC address on the switch.

84
00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:59.680
So if I save this configuration and the switch reboot the MAC address is stored in the saved configuration.

85
00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:06.600
So that's different to what we have on gigabit 00 here.

86
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:12.190
When the switch reboots it would simply learn the source MAC address from a frame received.

87
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:18.630
So the first device that connects will have its MAC address added to the database to show port security

88
00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.730
address as an example shows us the two addresses.

89
00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:27.430
This one was statically configured.

90
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.240
This one was dynamically learnt.

91
00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.240
So the MAC address on the interface was configured.

92
00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.070
This was done chemically learnt.

93
00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:42.390
Now the example on the right is where you explicitly allowing a specific MAC address onto the network.

94
00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:48.120
The example on the left is where you are restricting the number of MAC addresses permitted on a port

95
00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:49.650
on the left.

96
00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:56.730
You would stop a user connecting a hub as an example to the network and connecting multiple devices

97
00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:05.140
to the port whereas the example on the right is where we are limiting traffic to a specific MAC address.

98
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:12.780
The problem with this method is we are having to work out what the MAC addresses of the devices are

99
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.860
and then manually configuring those MAC addresses.

100
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.660
So let's look at another way of doing it.
