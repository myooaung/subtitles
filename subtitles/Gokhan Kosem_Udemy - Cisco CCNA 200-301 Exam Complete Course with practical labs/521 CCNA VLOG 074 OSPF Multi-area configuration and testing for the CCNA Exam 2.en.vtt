00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.230
This is one of multiple SPF videos.

2
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:19.380
I was asked to explain Oh SPF multiple areas and this is one of multiple videos helping explain how

3
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:28.190
SPF works when you have multiple areas configured so we've now configured rather one and rather two

4
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.870
rather one is once again only running.

5
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:33.300
Yeah.

6
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.910
GOP as shown here.

7
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.770
Brought it to is running multiple writing protocols so we are running both EAI GOP

8
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.470
and always P.F..

9
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:59.610
So let me just do that a sure run it's running both yea GOP as well as always P.F. this command redistributes

10
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:07.110
Oh SPF into each job he or translates if you like oh SPF into E.R. GOP in the same way that you would

11
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.950
translate French into English and it sets what's called the seed metric or beginning metric to try and

12
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.410
set an initial value for the root when it's redistributed.

13
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:27.840
That's because we have to translate or convert over SPF which only supports bandwidth into EAI GOP which

14
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.950
supports bandwidth and delay as part of its calculation okay.

15
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:44.680
So let's configure wrote a three I a three in this topology is a area border rather it has an interface

16
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:56.860
an area one and an interface in areas zero so hostname router 3 interface gigabit 00 no shut IP address

17
00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.320
10 1 2 2

18
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:15.420
select 24 mosque interface gigabit 0 1 no shut IP address 10 1 3 1 slash 24 interface loop back zero

19
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.950
IP address could ripple 3.

20
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.800
Now here's another question for you.

21
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.210
Can you run SPF without a backbone area.

22
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.420
Someone enable a P.F..

23
00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:37.690
I'm only gonna enable SPF on gigabit 00 in Area 1.

24
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.670
Will that work.

25
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.620
Notice neighbor relationship has gone to full.

26
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:53.270
So show IP SPF neighbor router 3 has a neighbor relationship with Robert 2 and we are receiving always

27
00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:03.490
preference what are called E2 grants or external runs from broader one and we can ping the loop back

28
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.430
of wrought one on rather one debug IP.

29
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:17.910
Icmp ping that loop back notice we see the echo replies sent from right one back to rather three.

30
00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.380
The traffic is definitely getting to write of one.

31
00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.300
So this is the thing to remember.

32
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.450
You can and this is not an exam answer.

33
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.630
This is a real world answer.

34
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.080
You can.

35
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:38.270
Not that you typically want to do it but technically you can run away SPF in an area that's not area

36
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:39.220
zero.

37
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:48.650
If this is the big if if you only have one area at the moment it works fine because we only have area

38
00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.770
one configured but as soon as we want to configure multiple areas we need to configure the backbone

39
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.500
area or area zero.

40
00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:11.680
So what we'll do now is enable 0 SPF on the loop back in area 0 and on gigabit 0 1.

41
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.800
We'll put both of those interfaces into area zero.

42
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:28.860
So now show IPO SPF interface brief the loop back and gigabit 0 1 are in area 0 gigabit.

43
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:35.520
0 0 is an area 1 so that's the configuration of router 3.

44
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:46.140
What you'll notice as well is Rado 1 running EAI GOP is learning about the loop back of rudder 3 because

45
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:55.500
router 3 is advertising the loop back to rudder to using a SPF and that's redistributed into EAI GOP

46
00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.030
and advertised to run a 1 Okay.

47
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.930
So we've configured router 3.

48
00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:11.850
Now let's configure rudder 4 which has a backbone rather so bypass the initial configuration dialog.

49
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:20.010
We don't want to configure the rudder that way host strata for interface gigabit 00 no shut IP address

50
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.210
10 1 3 2

51
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:35.760
so that's the IP address once again interface gigabit 0 1 IP address 10 1 4 1 no shut that credit loop

52
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.430
back.

53
00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:50.120
This is gonna have a slash 32 mosque so do show IP interface breach.

54
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:55.320
They are the IP addresses configured this road is fairly simple to configure.

55
00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:02.060
All we're going to do is configure OS SPF on all interfaces.

56
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:09.940
Using this command some simply to enable 0 SPF everywhere.

57
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:19.340
So show IP of SPF interface brief notice 0 SPF is running on all interfaces of the Rada.

58
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:25.410
Notice a neighbour relationship was formed to write a three says show IPO SPF neighbor.

59
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.670
We have a neighbour relationship to write a three show IP rort.

60
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.990
We are learning multiple types of OSP France.

61
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:39.110
We have got what are called intra area routes.

62
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.100
Those are rorts that exist in the local area.

63
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:47.860
In this case area zero we have what are called into area routes.

64
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:53.150
Those are routes that exist in a different area and then we have external rots.

65
00:06:53.150 --> 00:07:00.260
Those are routes that originated from a different writing protocol so show IP SPF database will show

66
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:01.900
us more details.

67
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:09.680
We have two routers at the moment configured in area zero rudder three and rudder four have interfaces

68
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.830
in area zero.

69
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:17.930
We have one designated rudder that's rudder three for this link.

70
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.460
We have type three routes.

71
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:28.700
These are summary link state advertisements or summary LSD so type 1 LSA is a Rada LSA type to LSD are

72
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:36.320
advertised by designated riders and advertise segments such as the segment 10 1 3 0.

73
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.690
They are type 2 LSD.

74
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:42.340
These are top 3 LSD or summery LSD.

75
00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:48.740
They advertise rots from different areas into 0 P.F..

76
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:52.270
We also have a type for LSA.

77
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:58.340
This is an LSA identifying the autonomous system border rather which is right too.

78
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.980
We don't see this in area 1.

79
00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:13.610
It's a sharpie or SPF database because that road exists in Area 1 but for other areas to get to the

80
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:23.380
ESB are a summary EPR advertisement is pumped in by the AP are so essentially right 3 is telling rather

81
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:29.710
for how to get to the autonomous system border rather and then we have what are called Type 5 LSD.

82
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:39.230
These are LSD that come from outside of our SPF so those rods come from EAI GOP and we can see them

83
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:46.320
in the running table as this and this the local Rada should be able to ping the loop back of right of

84
00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:54.450
one which it can we can see the debug shown on Route 1 so that's right for configured let's configure

85
00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.110
out of 5.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.590
