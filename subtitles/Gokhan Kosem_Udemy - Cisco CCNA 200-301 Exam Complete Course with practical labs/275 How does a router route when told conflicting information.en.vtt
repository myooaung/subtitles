00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Here’s an example to demonstrate this in more detail.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:14.000
If the San Jose router in this topology is advertising network 10.0.0.0/8

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
to the San Francisco router using RIP version 2

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
the San Francisco router will deem that the believability factor

5
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
or administrative distance of that route is 120.

6
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
If the same network was advertised by the New York router using EIGRP

7
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
the San Francisco router will allocate that route

8
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
a believability or admin distance of 90.

9
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
the San Francisco router will does install this route received

10
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
via EIGRP from the New York router into its local routing table

11
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and traffic received going to an IP address of 10.1.1.1 for example

12
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
will be routed to the New York router and not to the San Jose router.

13
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The same network is received from the different neighboring devices

14
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
via different routing protocols

15
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and administrative distance was used in this example as a tie breaker.

16
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The more believable routing protocol is EIGRP

17
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
the RIP route is not installed

18
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
in the local routing table on the San Francisco router.

19
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The EIGRP route is installed and traffic is routed

20
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
to New York to get to host in this network.

21
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
now the San Francisco router still has the RIP route

22
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
in its RIP database so if the EIGRP route was no longer available

23
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
the RIP route will be installed in the routing table

24
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and San Francisco would route the traffic to San Jose

25
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
to get to host devices in network 10.0.0.0

26
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
in other words, if this link went down for some reason

27
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and there was no connectivity between San Francisco

28
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and New York traffic will then be sent to San Jose

29
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
but if the link came back again the EIGRP route

30
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
that’s then advertised would supersede the RIP route

31
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and traffic will now be routed to New York.

32
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
So New York is the first choice

33
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and will be used if that neighbor is available

34
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and San Jose is the 2nd choice to get to the same network.
