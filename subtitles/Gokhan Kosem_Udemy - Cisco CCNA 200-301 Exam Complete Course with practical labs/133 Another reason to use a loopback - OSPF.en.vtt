00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:17.190
A previous blog I explained why you would use a loop interface and I gave you one reason.

2
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.630
Let's look at another reason.

3
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.910
Another reason why you want to use a look back is because writing protocols such as always use the loopback

4
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.890
to determine the ideas of routers in the network.

5
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.300
So these routers

6
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.940
show IP interface.

7
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:50.260
I've configured a loopback zero with this IP address and I've also configured the loop banks on each

8
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:58.130
router Sarada one is 1 and 2 1 6 8 1 2 1 router Tuesday or 2 rotisseries or treat.

9
00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.680
Now why is that important.

10
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.510
It's important for routing protocols.

11
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:09.860
So when we enable writing protocols such as SPF it selects a router ID for itself.

12
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:18.970
So I'm going to enable OSPF on all interfaces on the router and just simply put them in areas Zira.

13
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:33.190
So show IP SPF interface brief SPF is enabled on all interfaces on the router show IP SPF interface.

14
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.510
Notice show loopback is 0.

15
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:44.280
Has this IP address configured in area 0 but the router ID is 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 to 2.

16
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.670
In other words the Rodda ID selected is the highest IP address of any interface.

17
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.230
And if they are loop backs the loopback override the physical interfaces.

18
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.420
So the Rodda IDs are elected on the highest loopback address.

19
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.250
In this case 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 to 2.

20
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:08.620
Now that's important because in OSPF a router is identified by its Rodda ID it's kind of like your name.

21
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.820
So my name is David.

22
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.050
It would be terrible if my name changed everyday whenever there was a problem.

23
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.800
And that's the issue with Louise.

24
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.820
If you don't use a loopback interface and the Rotto I.D. was selected off a physical interface and that

25
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.590
interface when down the road the idea would change but it's consistent.

26
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:35.110
Notice on gigabit 0 1 the router ID is still 1 2 1 6 8 1 2 2.

27
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.590
So let's have a look at the problem.

28
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.750
Not a one.

29
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.110
We've got two IP addresses configured on physical interfaces and then we've got these loopback interfaces.

30
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.350
But what I'm going to do now is remove the loop back into faces of Route 1.

31
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.850
So show IP interface brief do that again.

32
00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.670
We only have IP addresses on the physical interfaces.

33
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:13.110
So now Rodda OSPF one network and I'll just enable all interfaces once again notice a neighbor relationship

34
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.080
has established.

35
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.170
We've actually got two.

36
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:24.480
But notice the neighbor ID is 1 2 1 6 8 1 to 2 ways on this side the neighbor I.D. is 10 that one to

37
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.100
two to one the highest IP address of a physical interface.

38
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:39.670
This loopback doesn't exist on route one so on router to show IP who is P.F. neighbor hibernation ship

39
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:47.030
is full and established tendered one to two to one right one show IP OSPF neighbor notice a difference.

40
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:54.890
Neighbor ID is 1 and 2 1 6 8 1 2 IP address on the interface that the neighbor is using it is tendered

41
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.130
one or two to two.

42
00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.110
And on this interface gigabit 00 extended one or two.

43
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.290
So the same neighbor ID the loopback.

44
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:12.620
And just to make sure that its not confusing at that here as well weve got the loopback configured on

45
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:13.340
rodded too.

46
00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:20.580
In addition to to the to the to the ATI brought it to now when we look at the neighbor relationship

47
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:26.070
with one neighbor ideas tend toward one or two to one that's this interface.

48
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:33.010
Gigabit is one the IP addresses and the physical interfaces are those on road a one.

49
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.330
So why is the wrong idea important.

50
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:43.140
Well when an interface goes down and the road is reputed the Rada ID will change and in certain cases

51
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:49.950
in a whisper if we specify the Rodda ID in commands one of those cases which you don't need to know

52
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.260
if DNA is a virtual lynx in this command.

53
00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:03.340
We are specifying the router ID of the remote router a virtual link allows us to create a virtual transit

54
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.290
across an area.

55
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:11.650
In this example of backbone areas on the left area one is in the middle an area two is on the right

56
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.630
area.

57
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:20.740
Two is separated from the backbone area by area one but a virtual link allows us to tunnel areas zero

58
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:27.460
across area one and full one of the requirements of always piaffe which states that all areas have to

59
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.630
be adjacent to areas zero.

60
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:40.230
Now the problem is you know typology at the moment and wrote a one show IP OSPF interface.

61
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.720
Notice the right of ID is tendered one to two to one.

62
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:51.200
So that's the route ID of the router and you can see that on both interfaces what I'm going to do however

63
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.450
is shut.

64
00:05:52.810 --> 00:06:04.460
The zero 0 1 down so currently show IP OSPF interface shows that this is the route ID if the router

65
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.610
rebooted the Rodda ID would change instead of rebooting the router.

66
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:16.250
I'm going to type clear IP CPF process and I'm going to clear all processes

67
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.460
so show IP OSPF interface.

68
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.350
In this case the right ID didn't change.

69
00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:31.650
So what I'll do is save the configuration and reboot the Rodda.

70
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.090
So why is that a problem.

71
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:39.710
If the interface that you're using was selected by the Rodda at the Rodda ID and you configured that

72
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:45.710
draw to ID and this command and the interface went down and the rotor rebooted this command would no

73
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.040
longer work because the Rodda Id had changed.

74
00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:55.010
Noticed Cisco Telli the router Id usually the highest IP address on the box or the highest loopback

75
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:56.370
address if one exists.

76
00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:03.300
The run ID is only calculated at boot time at any time when the process is restarted.

77
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.010
So what's the recommendation.

78
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.790
For OSPF specify a loopback address and then manually configure the Rodda ID.

79
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:17.710
So the Rondo's reboot show IP OSPF interface.

80
00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.790
Notice the router ID has changed.

81
00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:26.700
It's now 10.0 wondered wondered what that means if you're using a virtual link as an example the virtual

82
00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.860
link would break and your network would break.

83
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.710
OK that concludes this blog entry.

84
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.920
Thanks Pedro for the question.

85
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:38.310
Please feel free to send me questions and I'll do my best to answer all of them.

86
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:39.680
I'll see you tomorrow.

87
00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:40.740
All the very best.
