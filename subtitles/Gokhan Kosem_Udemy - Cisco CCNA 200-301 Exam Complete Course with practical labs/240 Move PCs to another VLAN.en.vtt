1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now at this moment PC 1 can ping PC 2

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and that’s because the user interfaces, in other words, F2/0 on VLAN 1

3
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and these ports are configured as trunk ports permitting all VLANs.

4
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So to prove that show vlan switch on router 1

5
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
what you’ll notice is that FastEthernet port 2/2 is in VLAN 1.

6
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
On router 2 show vlan-switch the same is true there’s the command

7
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
FastEthernet 2/2 this port is configured in VLAN 1.

8
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Looking at trunk ports so show int f2/1 switchport

9
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.000
This port 2/1 is configured as a trunk native VLAN is 1

10
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and all VLANs are permitted.

11
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Router 2 show int f2/1 switchport

12
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:19.000
native VLAN is 1 all VLANs are permitted same for 2/0

13
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
so trunk native VLAN is 1.

14
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
All VLANs are permitted.

15
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So what happens if we put this port into VLAN 2, the pings should start failing.

16
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
at the moment the pings are succeeding on PC 1

17
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:45.000
so int 2/2 switchport mode access switchport access vlan 2

18
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
notice immediately the pings start failing.

19
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:57.000
If I go on to router 2 interface 2/2 switch port mode access.

20
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So it’s an access port, switchport access vlan 2

21
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So I’ve just moved both these ports into VLAN 2

22
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and what should happen is our pings should start succeeding.

23
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Now let’s look at Spanning Tree.

24
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So show spanning-tree vlan 2

25
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.000
2/0 is forwarding on router 2, 2/1 is blocking on router 2

26
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
notice please the ping has started to succeed.

27
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Let’s see 2/2 is forwarding, now it takes time for Spanning Tree to converge

28
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
but what we could do is go on to that port

29
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and type spanning-tree portfast to allow it to converge quicker

30
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I’ll do the same on router 1.

31
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
So both this ports have been configured as Portfast ports

32
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
do sh run int f2/2

33
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Notice this port is configured in VLAN 2 and is a Portfast port.

34
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I can do something similar, sh run int f2/2 do show run rather.

35
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000
sh run int 2/2 this port is configured as a Portfast port in VLAN 2

36
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
but what I’ll do now is type switchport access vlan 3

37
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
pings should start failing which they do and then I’ll do the same on router 2

38
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
switchport access vlan 3 in other words, this port is in vlan 3 now

39
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and I’m gonna move this port into vlan 3

40
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
and as soon as I did that notice the ping started succeeding

41
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
because we told Spanning Tree to use Portfast

42
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
in other words to forward immediately.

43
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
So I can do something similar, I'll set them to VLAN 2

44
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
pings failed do it in the second switch and ping start succeeding.

45
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
So I’ve just shown you how to move ports from 1 VLAN to another

46
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and how to enable Spanning Tree Portfast on an EtherSwitch module

47
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
running within a Cisco IOS router within GNS3.
