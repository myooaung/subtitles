00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:08.050
Leased lines are an example of synchronous serial communication where one party provides the clocking

2
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:09.900
for the communication.

3
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:15.660
So in other words two devices will synchronize their clocks before data transmission takes place.

4
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:23.440
So they will align or synchronize those clocks and agree on parameters for data transfer including the

5
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:31.020
data interval between bits of data the Sea issue the issue or channel service unit data service unit

6
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:38.790
commonly referred to as the seas you provides the clocking and is the master for the communication the

7
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.800
right is acting as a slave and is receiving its clocking from the issue.

8
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:52.860
So essentially before communication can start the two devices have to align their clocks or agree on

9
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.170
the clock intervals to ensure that the data doesn't get corrupted.

10
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:05.680
So here we have the terms data communication equipment or DCP and data terminal equipment or DTV the

11
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:13.440
most in the communication is the C issue D issue and it's using its own internal clucking but the rudder

12
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:21.300
which is the data terminal equipment or DTV uses the external clocking received from the DCP and will

13
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:31.320
thus synchronize itself to the C issue D issue so the C issue D issue is the DC side of the connection

14
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.600
and the rudder is the DTV side of the connection.

15
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:44.070
So the DC which is the C issue D issue is providing clocking to the rudder which is the DTV and the

16
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:53.310
DC also terminates the connection from the carrier and a connection is then made from the C issue D

17
00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:01.140
issue to the rudder some terms to understand therefore is customer premises equipment or CPE.

18
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:08.460
This is the term that telcos or service providers use to refer to equipment that resides at the customer

19
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.270
site.

20
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.510
At the end of their connection.

21
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.710
So once again in this example the C issue D issues at the customer site.

22
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:24.240
The C issue D issue which is the DCP is connected in this example via a v 35 cable to the router and

23
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:33.180
is providing clucking to the router so the C issue D issue which is the DC physically controls the speed

24
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:40.380
and timing at which the router serial interfaces can send and receive but over the serial cable.

25
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:48.030
You don't have the ability to configure the speed of your serial connection that is set by the issue

26
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.420
DC and is generally set by the service provider on your behalf.

27
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.510
The serial cable once again connects the C issue to the right interface.
