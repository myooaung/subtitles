00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:06.940
One of the great things about history is you can have many devices as part of a typology and you can

2
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.700
access the consuls of every device.

3
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:18.340
So as an example Rodda one and Rodda too can be accessed directly through Janissary on my local PC.

4
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:27.450
However in the real world you probably going to want to telnet to devices because you don't want to

5
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.290
walk to the device and connect to the console.

6
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.480
That's not realistic.

7
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.860
If the devices are on the other side of the country or other side of the world so you're going to want

8
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.370
to use a protocol such as telnet to gain access to the remote devices.

9
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.410
Let's assume that router one is in one part of the network and brought it to is in a different part

10
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.200
of the network.

11
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.900
In this example all telnet from a one to router 2 let's see what happens by default.

12
00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:04.830
So telnet to 10 or 20 I'm told that password is required but none is set.

13
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:12.360
In most cases by default you cannot telnet to a router you have to do some configuration to allow telnet

14
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:24.270
sessions and to top quality the line Viti Y and specify a Viti y range from zero to a number that depends

15
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.620
on the device.

16
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:36.270
So in this Rodda the Viti y ranges from 0 to nine hundred and three which means you could have 904 simultaneous

17
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.070
virtual terminal lines or why lines on the router.

18
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.580
In other words 904 sessions could be made to the Rodda at the same time.

19
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:56.030
You'll often see in documentation that they'll create the Y lines 0 to 4 which gives you 5 D-y lines.

20
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.900
That's something from the old days.

21
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.300
But a lot of Cecka devices today support many more lines than that.

22
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:13.530
So as an example on the switch Viti Why 0 notice there's 5400 VQ lines on this virtual Iowa's vilayet

23
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.140
to switch.

24
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:22.990
And if I connect to this physical 30 750 and top line Viti Why is 0.

25
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.490
Notice this one has 16 Viti white lines.

26
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.950
So that really depends on the device.

27
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.070
This ios VLA to switch has one thousand and one D-y Why lines.

28
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:42.090
I'm going to specify log in and notice I'm told that to log in is disabled until the password is sent.

29
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.880
So once again if I telnet to the Rodda the telnet session is closed.

30
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:54.060
So I wrote it to let's add a password of Cisco and now try telling it to the Rodda notice I'm prompted

31
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.560
for a password.

32
00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:04.720
I want to enable I'm allowed in because this router has an enabled password but if no enable password

33
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.730
was set so let's disconnect if no enabled password was set.

34
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.060
No secret password was set.

35
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:22.970
Notice what happens telnet to the router and to my telnet password top enable and I cannot get to enable

36
00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.790
mode because no password is configured.

37
00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:34.490
You must configure either and enable password or a secret password secret being better to go to enable

38
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.170
mode through a telnet or S-sh session.

39
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:46.940
So I noticed the configuration that we did show run pipe begin V-twin in this case we enabled 5 Vicci

40
00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.000
y lines 0 to 4.

41
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:56.450
Were using a password on the line for those five lines the same password is used for all of them.

42
00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.890
You could specify different passwords for different Viti white lines if you wanted to.

43
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.160
But in this example we'll keep the password the same.

44
00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:12.710
Hence when I tell that from router 1 to 2 I need to put in the password on the line but to go to enable

45
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.960
mode I need to type the Enable secret password.

46
00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:27.530
Now again on the Viti y line similar to the console we could use the option log in a local which would

47
00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.840
use a local username and password database telnet back again.

48
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:43.950
It just now asked for the username and password of the user but in this case its failing.

49
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.310
So let's see what's going on.

50
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.410
Show run pipes include user no user account configure it.

51
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.010
So hence the authentication was failing.

52
00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:01.420
So I need to type user name whatever the username is and the password of that user.

53
00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:08.710
So now I can log in and then type and able to get a privileged mode.

54
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:17.170
So once again what do we do we created a user called davit with a relevant password.

55
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.190
Not a good idea to use passwords such as the following.

56
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.210
You should use secret.

57
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.430
So I should have done this.

58
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.980
Use the name David.

59
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.910
Secret Cisco.

60
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.510
Now I'm told I cannot have both a user password and a user secret.

61
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:39.130
Choose one or the other so do show run piping clewed user.

62
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:44.970
Notice the use and you still using a password rather than a secret.

63
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:53.950
So let's say No user name David and recreated with a secret and that's allowed now.

64
00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.420
Now it is previously the password was in clear text dush run pipe.

65
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:04.610
Include user the user name is now an empty five hash.

66
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.230
So it's much more secure.

67
00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:17.310
Notice the difference now however when I tell them that and put my username in and my password I still

68
00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.120
have to put in my enable password.

69
00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.110
But that's a secret password.

70
00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:33.170
And what I can do additionally specify privilege and give David full privileges rather than the use

71
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:38.480
of having to type the enabled password or secret password in this case.

72
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:46.100
So back then write a one tell it to write a T name is David falshood a Cisco notice I'm taken immediately

73
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:54.330
to privilege mode whereas previously I had to type enable and then put in the secret password.

74
00:06:54.360 --> 00:07:01.510
Now the biggest problem with Telnet is it's clear text so legs it back to route 1.

75
00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:12.340
Let's start doing a capture whya and capture the traffic received on this interface.

76
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.120
I remember we created a secret password.

77
00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:24.690
So on the router show run doesn't show us what that uses password is what happens when we telnet however

78
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.660
said telnet whose name is David.

79
00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.780
Password is Cisco straight to privilege mode.

80
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:42.630
Well search for telnet and let's look through the packets first.

81
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:51.210
Strolling along there is D A V I D asking for password.

82
00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:57.380
Now see I see we've just captured the user's password.

83
00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:03.820
If we follow the TZP stream I'll just copy that into notepad so you can see it clearly.

84
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:13.560
But what you're seeing here is the TCAP stream showing the user name and the password.

85
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:22.290
So the password is shown in clear text tellen allows you to capture passwords and other data off the

86
00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:22.980
wire.

87
00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.080
So it's not a great idea to use telnet.

88
00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:31.980
You may think it's good to use a secret password but be careful the secret password is hashed on the

89
00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:32.620
router.

90
00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:37.120
But when the data is sent across the wire it's in clear text.

91
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:44.810
So a hacker can capture the password so you should be using S-sh rather than telnet before each before

92
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:46.040
showing S-sh.

93
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:56.110
One last thing on telnet you can also set an exact timeout on your telnet sessions so that they get

94
00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:57.050
disconnected.

95
00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:03.610
If there's no activity for period of time in this example after five minutes the telnet session would

96
00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:08.020
be disconnected but you could specify another value if you wanted to.
