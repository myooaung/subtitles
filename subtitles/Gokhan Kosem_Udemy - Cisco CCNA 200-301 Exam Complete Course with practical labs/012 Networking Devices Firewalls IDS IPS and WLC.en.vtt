00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.090
What devices do we have here.

2
00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:11.160
This is a writer.

3
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.660
This is a Cisco 43 21 rotor.

4
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:19.570
I've chosen this road specifically why purchase this right specifically because it's available in Packet

5
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.800
Tracer.

6
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:29.550
This is a Cisco 35 66 switch again 35 60 switches are available in Packet Tracer.

7
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.950
You don't need to spend money buying all these devices.

8
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.160
I've done that for you.

9
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.270
Now obviously if you want to you could buy physical equipment.

10
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:43.150
It's nice in some ways to work with physical equipment but for the CCMA you don't have to use physical

11
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.550
equipment if you can afford it.

12
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.650
Just use packet tracer and I'll show you in a moment when I boot up this rider and the switch and compare

13
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.620
it to Packet Tracer you'll see it's very very similar.

14
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.370
This is an example of a 29 60 switch.

15
00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.220
What I like about these switches is they families.

16
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:06.700
So I have them on my desk here and it doesn't make a lot of noise and mess up the recordings but here

17
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.350
we've got two interesting devices.

18
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.200
They look very similar very similar to each other.

19
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:22.600
But what you'll notice and these are older devices is this is a Cisco AC 55 of 5 This is called a firewall

20
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:29.950
firewalls allow us to stop bad people getting into our network so we can restrict who can access our

21
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.150
network.

22
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.050
They use what are called firewall rules to permit or deny traffic.

23
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.080
This is a small little firewall typically used again in a small business.

24
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.890
The idea here is we can connect a bunch of devices directly to the firewall so it's acting like a switch.

25
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:53.000
In some ways but I could specify what's called the outside interface and the inside interface.

26
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.730
And I do not allow or this firewall does not allow traffic from the outside interface to the inside

27
00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:04.180
interface unless you explicitly allow it your home rider probably does something similar has a built

28
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.800
in Firewall your P.C. may be also running a firewall a software firewall directly on the P.C..

29
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.890
This is an example of a hardware dedicated firewall.

30
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.110
Now riders as mentioned often have firewall functionality but this is a dedicated firewall.

31
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.020
Now you could connect your internet directly to the firewall if you haven't Ethernet connection and

32
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:29.910
then to the rotor and then to the switch where you're inside devices or or your land is all you could

33
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.840
connect to the rudder and then have the firewall behind the rudder so you either have the firewall in

34
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:41.830
front of the router or behind the router in many cases you're going to have this behind the router because

35
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.960
your ISP may manage the rudder all you need a physical connection that's not Ethernet.

36
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.200
These devices typically only support Ethernet Ryder will support other types of technologies such as

37
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.610
a DSL or cable as an example.

38
00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.280
So the internet connects to the road it connects to the firewall which then connects to your switch

39
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.040
in your internal network.

40
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.910
Now he has another device looks very much the same but this is a wireless LAN controller.

41
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.390
Another small wireless LAN controller.

42
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.440
You'll notice the form factor looks exactly the same but it has different functionality.

43
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.650
This is used to manage access points.

44
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:23.860
If you've only got one access point it makes sense to manage the access point directly using what's

45
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.560
called an autonomous access point economists meaning that you don't need a wireless LAN controller to

46
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.400
manage it.

47
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:36.790
But if you've got 100 of these or 500 of these it's going to be a lot of work to manually configure

48
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.440
every one of those access points.

49
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.180
So rather than doing that you use what's called lightweight access points.

50
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.190
Some of these access points support both so they can either be lightweight or they can be autonomous.

51
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.980
Some of them have to be lightweight access points varies depending on which one you buy.

52
00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:00.250
But the idea is is if I had 100 of these or 500 of these they would register with the wireless LAN controller.

53
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.720
Now obviously this is a small wireless LAN controller so it's not going to support as many access points.

54
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:11.710
But the idea is if I have 100 access points they would connect to the wireless LAN controller.

55
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.460
And notice this doesn't have as many ports as as would be required.

56
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.240
The wireless LAN controller and the bigger ones even more so don't have so many interfaces.

57
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.970
They simply connect to switches so the access points connector switches the wireless LAN controller

58
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.920
connects to switches switches are there to provide lots of ports to connect to in the network.

59
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:36.640
So the whole idea here is the wireless LAN controller will manage the access points rather than manually

60
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.010
managing every one of the access points you manage them through the wireless LAN controller.

61
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.630
So the wireless LAN controller will manage let's say 100 500 access points depends on the controller.

62
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.590
Depends what it can support.

63
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.110
So once again here we've got a firewall.

64
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:51.790
This is an older firewall.

65
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.590
USA Today we have what are called next generation firewalls.

66
00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.050
They support features such as IP s or IBS.

67
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.550
Now intrusion detection.

68
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:06.250
Let me give you an analogy so that you won't forget what intrusion detection is an I.D. S is like a

69
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:13.810
dog what a dog can do is help protect you by warning you when there's an attack taking place.

70
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:20.800
Let's say you sleeping at night sleeping comfortably in bed the dog however sniffs that there's an attacker

71
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:27.180
so an intruder it sniffs that there's an intruder trying to break into your house.

72
00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.330
What does it do.

73
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.530
It box it warns you that there's an intruder.

74
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.230
It doesn't stop the attacker.

75
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:40.900
It warns you that there's an attacker and then you can do something to stop the attacker trying to break

76
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:41.920
into your house.

77
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:48.310
An intrusion detection system simply detects that there's a problem and then alerts you that there's

78
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.380
a problem and then you have to do something about it.

79
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:57.280
An intrusion prevention system can alert you that there's a problem but also block the attack so it

80
00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.040
can prevent the attack.

81
00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:04.870
So if someone breaks into your network remotely let's say a hacker it can see that there's malicious

82
00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.510
activity on the network and then it can block that attacker.

83
00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:14.320
So prevent that attacker from gaining access to your network intrusion detection systems typically set

84
00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:19.900
out of band of network traffic so the traffic is going past them but they're not in the flow of traffic

85
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:25.150
they're just getting copies of the traffic to see if there's a problem and intrusion prevention system

86
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.670
sits in line with the traffic.

87
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.960
The traffic is going through the eyepiece or intrusion prevention system.

88
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.970
When there's an attack it blocks it so the attacker can't get into your network.

89
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:41.080
So think of an I.D. S or an IP s as a dog.

90
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.070
Is it a small dog ideas.

91
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:47.200
If it isn't a very large dog eyepiece can go and attack the attacker.

92
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:51.370
Hopefully that analogy will help you never forget what an idea or IP SS.
