00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:07.470
If you don't have access to a point to point a serial connection at work just do a search in Google

2
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.010
or your favorite search engine for Cisco CSU D issue as an example and you'll find many pictures showing

3
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.370
you examples of setups using serial connections.

4
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.450
Here's a very good one.

5
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.100
It's an older picture showing a 17 20 Rada in the picture.

6
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.770
Here you can see the blue console cable connecting to the console port of the rudder.

7
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.510
You can see the power connection and what's important is to note the Ethernet connection.

8
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:42.600
This would connect to the up to a switch or another device in the local area network and very importantly

9
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.880
notice the V 35 cable.

10
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:52.080
So we have one end of the cable connected to the router and the other end is connected to the C issue

11
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.190
D issue.

12
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.680
This is an example of an external C issue issue and you can see it's connected to the telco network.

13
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.710
Now they use the term D Mark a D Mark is a demarcation point.

14
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.140
This is where responsibility changes.

15
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.710
So on one side of the D Mark or demarcation point any problems are the responsibility of the service

16
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.620
provider.

17
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.200
On the other side of the demarcation point any problems are yours.

18
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.870
If you managing the local area network so you would be responsible as an example for configuring your

19
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:32.100
router for making sure that the serial cable is connected correctly that the ethernet cable is connected

20
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.580
correctly that these devices are powered up and so forth but once you send traffic to the service provider

21
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.040
network that becomes the responsibility of the service provider.

22
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.610
Now these days they see issue.

23
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.420
The issue is often built in to the way an interface card or work.

24
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.570
This is an example of a week or one interface card that you would insert in a router.

25
00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.940
Notice this one is a T1 issue C issue so the C issue D issues internal to the rudder.

26
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:10.070
Here's another picture of the week card and here's another one showing it inserted into the rudder.

27
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:17.440
So once again here's an example of the C issue D issue bolting to the rudder here's another example

28
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.530
showing you the C issue.

29
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:26.830
The issue with a DTV cable connected to the router providing an internet connection.

30
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:34.180
Cisco also have images such as the following showing that a serial connection is connected to a card

31
00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.710
on the router which in turn connects you to the sea issue.

32
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:38.290
DC.
