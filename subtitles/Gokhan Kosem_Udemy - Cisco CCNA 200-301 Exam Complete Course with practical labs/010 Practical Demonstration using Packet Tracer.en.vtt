00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.010
Now analogies are okay but it's much better to demonstrate this practically using Packet Tracer.

2
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:16.840
So let's actually build a network together and I'll show you how clients and service can work together

3
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.650
and I'll show you that a client can also become a server.

4
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.920
You could have two laptops one providing a service to another laptop so the laptop can be a server in

5
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.840
some cases or it can be a client.

6
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.740
In other cases.

7
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:31.060
Okay.

8
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:39.160
So in packet trace I'm going to go to end devices and I'm going to select a server and add it to my

9
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.530
topology.

10
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.670
I'll select a traditional P.C. and add it to the topology.

11
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:52.870
Now these are symbols or representations of devices physically.

12
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.200
This is a server physically that's a laptop.

13
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.910
But logically that's what they look like.

14
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:05.940
These are once again just symbols in an application like Packet Tracer in networking we use network

15
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.200
diagrams to explain what a network looks like.

16
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.440
Another example would be here where I'm using an application called Genius 3.

17
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.420
So here's a Windows Server and here's a P.C..

18
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.070
Notice different symbols for different types of devices.

19
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.150
I could change the symbol if I wanted to.

20
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.960
So in this application I simply select a change symbol and then I could specify a nother type of symbol

21
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.080
to represent a device.

22
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:48.870
I notice there are many types of devices shown here but as an example I could say this is a server cluster.

23
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.020
If it was a cluster of service.

24
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:59.860
The point is is that a symbol is simply a logical representation for a physical device in Packet Tracer.

25
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:08.700
If I click on this server there's a physical representation of the server and then I could once again

26
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:15.930
change the symbol or icon used to represent that server

27
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.650
here's the physical representation of the P.C. notice.

28
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:23.950
Ethan it pulled right over there.

29
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.520
So again this is a logical representation of a device.

30
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.940
Now these two devices can communicate with each other.

31
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:39.860
We either need to communicate using a physical cable or we need to communicate using the air.

32
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:47.520
So what I'm going to do is select connections and I'll select what's called a crossover cable a crossover

33
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:56.280
cable allows two pieces to talk directly to each other in the old days we had to use what was called

34
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.730
a crossover cable to allow P.C. to talk to P.C..

35
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.530
Now today we don't have to do that.

36
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.440
I'll discuss order MDI X late in the course.

37
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.100
This used to be a problem in the old days it's not such a problem these days notice the interfaces have

38
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:20.880
gone green but in packet trace if I delete that cable and then use just a standard ethernet cable

39
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.150
notice the interface is down because Packet Tracer still expects you to use the right cable.

40
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:39.220
So once again I'll delete that cable and I'll select a cross over cable copper crossover cable and connect

41
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.510
fast ethernet on the P.C. to fast ethernet on the server.

42
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:45.360
So there you go.

43
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.650
I've built a network.

44
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.170
That's an example of a network.

45
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.440
It's a logical representation of a physical network.

46
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.760
OK.

47
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.760
But to allow these two devices to communicate with each other we need to have two things we need to

48
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.940
have an ethernet address or MAC address that's pre-built into network interface codes.

49
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.240
So a manufacturer will burn a MAC address onto a network interface code.

50
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.090
You can change MAC addresses but generally you don't have to.

51
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.600
They are globally unique.

52
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.970
There have been cases where there have been duplicate MAC addresses but in general that isn't a problem.

53
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.100
Every device has its own MAC address.

54
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:30.770
So if I look at this P.C. and go to config go to foster Ethernet zero.

55
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:37.670
Here is the MAC address of the P.C. you can see your mac address on a Windows computer as an example

56
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:46.590
by going to control panel network and Internet network and sharing center.

57
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.950
Have a look at your Adapter Settings.

58
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:57.430
So as an example this Wi-Fi network adapter has this MAC address.

59
00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.860
That's its physical address or MAC address.

60
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.450
You'll see something similar on an iPhone or other devices.

61
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:10.240
Every device that communicates on physical Ethernet or communicates on Wi-Fi is gonna have a mac address

62
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:18.190
we don't have to configure that again that's configured by default by the manufacturer on the server

63
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:26.290
first Ethernet zero notice she has the MAC address of the server but what I'll do is change that so

64
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.310
I'll change the MAC address.

65
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:34.120
This is a twelve digit number in hexadecimal.

66
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.460
Now I'll discuss hexadecimal and the details of this later in the course but for the moment just notice

67
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.800
there are 12 numbers there hexadecimal numbers.

68
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.700
So that's the MAC address now of the server.

69
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:57.720
On the P.C. I'll change the MAC address as well and I'll make this a bunch of ones so triple 0 1 followed

70
00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.180
by eight ones.

71
00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.380
Now again you don't have to change the MAC address.

72
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:08.540
I'm just doing that to make things simple now the second thing we need is an IP address typically in

73
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:15.290
networks a server which could be a home router we'll be allocating IP addresses to your pieces using

74
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.840
a protocol called Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol or DHEA P.

75
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:29.630
So D.H. C.P. is allocating IP addresses to your P.C. P.S. I can see that here by opening up a command

76
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:40.460
prompt and if I type IP config an IP address in this case IP version 4 is configured on my Windows laptop

77
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:49.610
so those windows laptop has received an IP address automatically from a DHB server or it could be configured

78
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:54.430
statically you can configure IP addresses statically in our little network.

79
00:06:54.440 --> 00:07:01.040
We don't have a router or another type of device so we have to manually configure the IP addresses.

80
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:08.570
So on this first P.C. I'm gonna give it an IP address of tendered wandered wandered 1 and a subnet mask

81
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:13.380
of 255 255 255 dot 0.

82
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:19.120
Don't worry too much about IP addresses for the moment just understand that we've figured a MAC address

83
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:22.370
you don't have to do that and I've configured an IP address.

84
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:26.840
You don't have to do that if you've got two Windows laptops they can automatically communicate with

85
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.750
one another here because of using Packet Tracer.

86
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:38.450
I'm configuring the IP addresses manually Okay so if I go a desktop and open up a command prompt I'll

87
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:42.250
make this a bit bigger and top the command IP config.

88
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.080
What you'll notice is this P.C. has an IP address.

89
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.020
I'll do something similar on the server.

90
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:57.480
Let's give the server ip address of 10 dot wondered one to two and a subnet mask of 2 4 5 2 4 5 2 4

91
00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.500
5 0.

92
00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:07.260
So on the P.C. now I can use a special application called Ping to verify connectivity to the server.

93
00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:11.400
Ping is basically sending a message saying hello are you there.

94
00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:16.350
And then the servers replying back yes I'm here and the IS SAYING HELLO ARE YOU THERE.

95
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:18.350
AND THE SERVER replies back yes I'm here.

96
00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:24.540
So basically it sends the he sends a message to the server saying Please reply if you're there and the

97
00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:30.090
server replies back saying Yes I'm here and it's used just to verify that the server is up is it there

98
00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:40.210
is it working is it turned on so on the P.C. I can use the command ping 10 1 1 2 and as you can see

99
00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:51.960
there we are getting a reply from 10 1 1 2 the pieces IP addresses this the servers IP address

100
00:08:56.270 --> 00:09:04.790
use the come on IP conflict to see it make this bigger is 10 1 1 2 Okay but that doesn't really prove

101
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:10.880
anything except that my P.C. can ping the server that I've got IP connectivity to the server I basically

102
00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:16.000
sent a message to the server saying Are you there and the server reply back saying Yes I'm here.

103
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:24.480
So this server is there but that doesn't really help us what we want to do is have a look at the services

104
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:32.130
running on the server and notice here are a whole bunch of services we've got HDP as an example we've

105
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:40.500
got DNS which is domain name system basically allows me to resolve domain names such as Google dot com

106
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:51.130
or Facebook dot com to an IP address we've got other types of services here like email FCP and various

107
00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:52.420
other services.

108
00:09:52.630 --> 00:10:02.050
So on the HP Service I'm going to leave this on that's the default on the P.C. if I close this command

109
00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:13.620
prompt down and open up a web browser and deletes bras using HDP Hypertext Transfer Protocol to the

110
00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.760
IP address of the server.

111
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:22.710
What you'll notice is a web page displays I can see a small Web page here which says hello world.

112
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:28.300
I can go back I can go look at an image page and he has a Cisco logo.

113
00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:31.930
Now that doesn't really do much but that's an example of a network.

114
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:37.290
We've got a client on the left a server on the right.

115
00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:44.430
The server is configured with the HP Service and it's serving a web page to the client when the client

116
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:46.650
requested the web page.

117
00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:58.740
If I turn the service off so I've turned it off now for HDP but it's on for HDP s HDP has once again

118
00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:06.840
just an encrypted version of hypertext transfer protocol which is used for web browsing.

119
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:17.210
I'll close this down open it up again try and go to HDP 10 dot wandered one dot too.

120
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:21.810
Now what will happen and it might take it a while is it will time out and there you go.

121
00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:28.230
Notice it says request timed out and that's because the server is no longer listening on port 80.

122
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:29.190
It's not listening.

123
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:32.190
So it just basically drops the traffic that you send to it.

124
00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:36.340
So view Senator request saying show me a web page on port 80.

125
00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:42.000
It just basically drops the request ignores what you what you're asking.

126
00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:49.620
If I go HDP s however notice we get to the web page because the server is listening on Port 443 now

127
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:57.740
which is the port number used for HDP s of enable HDP once again.

128
00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:03.930
And let's try and go to the server on port 80 and that's worked.

129
00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:09.990
So just to prove it because that wasn't very clear I'll open up a web browser again and manually type

130
00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:16.500
HDP tendered wandered 1 to 2 and notice the web page displays.

131
00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:21.810
Now another great thing about packet tracer is we've got the simulation mode.

132
00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:26.370
If I select a simulation mode I can actually see what's going on.

133
00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:33.390
So on the P.C. and I'll just move this around so we can see what's going on.

134
00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:42.210
I'm gonna click Go now and what you'll notice is a packet has been sent into the network.

135
00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:47.160
Now there's a lot of information here and I'll go through this in more detail when we talk about the

136
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.950
OSA model and the TCB IP model.

137
00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:57.210
But what I'd like you to see is we've got a mac address which is the MAC address of the P.C. sending

138
00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:03.060
traffic to the MAC address of the server and we've got an IP address which is the IP address of the

139
00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:10.830
P.C. going to the IP address of the server source IP addresses P.C. destination IP address is the server

140
00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:18.630
at least to here we've got an ether net had a source MAC addresses the P.C. destination MAC address

141
00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.580
is the server.

142
00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:26.740
Notice here we've got port 80 port 80 once again is the port number that the server is listening on.

143
00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:31.050
If we look at that in more detail and don't get scared by this.

144
00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:35.010
This is just an example of the kind of data that's sent into the network.

145
00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:35.660
Why shock.

146
00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:40.670
We'll show you this in more detail than this but this gives you an idea of what's going on.

147
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:47.970
Source MAC address is the P.C. destination MAC address is the server we've got source IP address P.C.

148
00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:54.770
destination ip addresses the server we're using IP version for here we're also using a protocol called

149
00:13:54.820 --> 00:14:00.900
TTP or transfer control protocol that basically just gives us reliability in a network transmission.

150
00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:06.800
So if you sent something to a server and it gets lost it'll be reset re transmitted.

151
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.150
So it gives us reliability.

152
00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.490
Destination Port number is 80.

153
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:21.770
So when we send that into the network that will be sent to the server and the server will receive that.

154
00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:27.990
And then what it will do is send something back to the P.C.

155
00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:43.480
so a packet gets sent back from the server to the P.C. with information.

156
00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:49.510
Notice the source port for the reverse traffic from the server to the P.C. is 80.

157
00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:55.140
Basically the client talks to serve on port 80 and then the server replies back from port 80 to a port

158
00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:59.510
number that your client has randomly decided to use.

159
00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:05.140
Now that's a lot of information and I'm hoping it's not too overwhelming the best thing you can do is

160
00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:11.830
install packet tracer and build a topology yourself and follow what I'm doing.

161
00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:16.330
There's no better way to learn than to do things yourself.

162
00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:18.940
One of my favorite analogies is riding a bicycle.

163
00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:21.190
I can talk about riding a bicycle.

164
00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:28.220
I can show you pictures videos etc but until you yourself ride a bicycle fall off a few times struggle

165
00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.570
a bit you'll never learn to ride a bicycle.

166
00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:35.830
Best way to learn is to just do it so bold as yourself and try it yourself.
