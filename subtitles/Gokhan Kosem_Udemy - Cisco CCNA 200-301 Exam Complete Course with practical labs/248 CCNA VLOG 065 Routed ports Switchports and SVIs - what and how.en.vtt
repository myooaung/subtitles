00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:17.250
This video I'm going to discuss of raftered ports on ethernet switches in this industry typology I have

2
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.050
to I was v layer 2 switches and an Iowa V router.

3
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.570
The devices have no configuration.

4
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.090
So they've just booted up and bypassed the initial configuration dialog on the router.

5
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.550
And let's start by configuring host names on the switches

6
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:54.630
and I'll configure a hostname on the router so no configuration has been done on these devices at all.

7
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.500
They're using the default configuration and I've simply changed the hostname.

8
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:07.670
So show CGP neighbors on switch one shows me that switch to is available on the gigabit 00 interface

9
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:16.820
CGP was advertising switch to with a name switch until I changed it on switched to shows CTP neighbor.

10
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.060
We can see switch one connected to keep it.

11
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.340
0 0 0.

12
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.590
We don't see the router on gigabit to 0 1 because a rod has interfaces are shut down by default.

13
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.410
Show interface.

14
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.280
Gigabit 00 switch port.

15
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.640
He has the command.

16
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.060
We can see that the interface is enabled as a switch port.

17
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:48.330
It's using dynamic orda DTP mode or dynamic trunking protocol mode.

18
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:56.870
The land that the port belongs to is Villon land one because it wasn't able to negotiate trunking with

19
00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.220
switch to.

20
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.010
There are no trunk's configured on the switch.

21
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.070
So show interface could give it to 00 such port.

22
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:10.760
We can see that it's a static access port negotiation of trunking is enabled but it hasn't negotiated

23
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:20.760
trunking with the other side the interface belongs to the land one on switch to we would see something

24
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.180
similar.

25
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.660
So show interface gigabit 00 switch port.

26
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.660
The interface is enabled as a switch port using dynamic order mode.

27
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:42.370
So when we look at the villans at the moment only the land one and the other default villans are configured

28
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.270
on the switches.

29
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:51.160
We're not going to worry about if the Diovan token ring in these videos what I could do is create a

30
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:59.360
switch to a virtual interface is vi you do that by using the interface the land command.

31
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.870
We can see that the interface has gone down.

32
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:09.360
But what I could do is configure an IP address on this interface and then shut it.

33
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:18.090
I could then also do something similar create an ace VI or switch to a virtual interface for a villain

34
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.600
one

35
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:30.750
and give the switch an IP address and no shut the VI interfaces come up on both sides.

36
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:39.690
So we should be able to ping switch to from switch one there's the ping again and we should be able

37
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.160
to ping switch one from switch to.

38
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:53.850
So the physical interface is a layer to interface gigabit to 0 0 is enabled as a switch port interface.

39
00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:00.070
It's a layer to interface it supports protocols such as spanning tree.

40
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:08.010
Notice this port is the root port on switch 2 and it's forwarding shows spending tree here shows that

41
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:16.560
gigabit 00 is the designated port on the switch and it's also forwarding protocols such as DGP and spending

42
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.550
tree run across switch ports or lead to ports.

43
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:32.980
But what I could do as an example on switch to is make the port a routed port by using the command no

44
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.400
switch port interfaces come up.

45
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.960
And now when we tap the C'mon show interface geek give it 0 0 or switch port.

46
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:49.250
Notice we told that the switch port has disabled Whereas on this side it's still enabled as a switch

47
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.950
port.

48
00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.540
And we can see the access feelin that the port belongs to.

49
00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.310
We'll also be able to see whether it becomes a trunk.

50
00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.970
But that's not true on the router port.

51
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:08.940
Another difference between a rotted port and a switch port is you can configure an IP address directly

52
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.200
on the interface.

53
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:19.950
Do show run interface gigabit 00 notice it's disabled as a switch port and an IP address has been configured

54
00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.580
directly on the interface.

55
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:32.420
Whereas if I try that here and try and configure an IP address it's not recognized.

56
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:37.490
So at this point all just change that IP address to make it consistent.

57
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.140
Because this is switch to.

58
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:50.070
But notice the IP address command is not available on this side because it's currently a switch port.

59
00:05:50.580 --> 00:06:00.380
But if I type a no switch port and then IP address notice I can configure the IP address on the interface

60
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:09.800
to show interface but 00 a switch port it is disabled as a switch port.

61
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:15.920
But I can pain switch to through that interface.

62
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:27.640
So shows spending tree notice spending tree is not enabled on gigabit 00 previously gigabit 00 was a

63
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.030
designated port.

64
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:38.980
But now it's not shown in the output because spending tree and dynamic trunk protocol do not run on

65
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.210
rodded ports.

66
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:50.560
Gigabit 00 does also not appear on the side show run interface but 00 shows us that an IP address is

67
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.130
configured on the interface.

68
00:06:52.480 --> 00:07:00.160
If I enable this port has a switch port and look at the running config of that interface again.

69
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:07.420
Notice the IP address has been removed and spending tree is running on that interface.

70
00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:19.090
Once again its interface Gieger but 00 no switch port IP address 10 1 to 2

71
00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:33.710
shows spending tree spending trees not running on gigabit 0 0 I should be able to ping switch one.

72
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:42.270
So show IP interface brief shows us that the interface has an IP address configured on it whereas this

73
00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:50.490
interface is a layer to interface and the FBI will switch to a virtual interface is used as the layer

74
00:07:50.490 --> 00:08:00.140
3 interface so Chauvelin brief notice can give it a 00 is not in the list of interfaces that belonged

75
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:03.220
to villaine one this interface.

76
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:13.660
Gigabit 0 1 is a layer to interface and belongs to the LAN one and has the as it's a layer 3 IP address.

77
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:24.860
So basically when you type no switch port you're turning that interface into a routed interface so it

78
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:27.630
acts like a router.

79
00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:38.790
So gigabit is 0 1 now is configure it as a routed interface and on a router we would do something very

80
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:39.360
similar.

81
00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:46.650
No shut the interface and configure an IP address directly on the interface and we should be able to

82
00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:53.310
ping switch to through that routed interface which we can.

83
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.650
We could also enable a routing protocol.

84
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:05.280
So Ali Nabl your job on all interfaces can do the same here.

85
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:17.970
Rodda your job p 1 and enable your job and all interfaces show IP your job interfaces to enabled and

86
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:19.020
all interfaces.

87
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.400
And a neighbor relationship has been established.

88
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:28.320
Show IP your GOP neighbor the neighbor relationship is established on the gigabit 0 1 interface not

89
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:41.090
on the SBI But once again if we changed gigabit 00 to a switch port and then enabled the GOP on this

90
00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:42.410
site.

91
00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:47.070
Notice the difference in the neighbor relationships.

92
00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:55.570
A show IPY GOP neighbor no neighbor relationship is established because I need to make this a switch

93
00:09:55.570 --> 00:10:01.020
port to put them back in the same subnet.

94
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:07.140
So let's check Ping's can wrote it to ping Rotto one at the moment.

95
00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:10.320
And that's probably because of spending tree.

96
00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:12.880
Notice that port is learning.

97
00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:20.490
So we've got to wait for spending tree to converge before the GOP can form a neighbor relationship.

98
00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:30.260
Rodded ports however don't use spending tree so they will converge quicker than a spending report will.

99
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:33.650
So the convergence has just taken place.

100
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.950
Your GOP neighbor relationship is established.

101
00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.670
So show I.P your job.

102
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:40.710
He never noticed the difference.

103
00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:48.710
This may be it which is switch one has been learnt on line one whereas the router has been learnt on

104
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:55.940
the gigabit 0 1 interface to show run interface Keiga bitches 0 0 and 0 1.

105
00:10:55.940 --> 00:11:04.040
Notice the difference switch port is enabled on gigabit 00 no switch port has been configured on gigabit.

106
00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:15.080
0 1 when ping from switch to switch one using the FBI interface but when we paying from switch to to

107
00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:23.210
Rotto one way using the physical interface Subrata ports are typically used between switches and routers

108
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:30.680
for example where a Rodek connection to the Internet switched of virtual interfaces and switch port

109
00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:38.060
interfaces are typically used in a campus environment where you need to tag multiple villans across

110
00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:46.370
an interface a routed port doesn't have the concept of villans they are no villans you don't run spending

111
00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:50.270
tree and you don't run DTP or domestic trunk protocol.

112
00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:55.660
The port is a routed port in the same way that you configure a routed port on a router.

113
00:11:56.030 --> 00:12:03.980
So again show IPTA GOP neighbor notice the difference in how they neighbor relationships are formed.

114
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:07.610
