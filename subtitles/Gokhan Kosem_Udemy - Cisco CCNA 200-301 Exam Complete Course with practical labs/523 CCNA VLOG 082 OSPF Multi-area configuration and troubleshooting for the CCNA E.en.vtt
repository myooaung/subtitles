00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.870
This is one of multiple videos discussing a multi area of SPF.

2
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.320
This is both a troubleshooting as well as an explanation of video.

3
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:27.590
We've been told in this topology that brought of one on the left is not able to ping Rada six on the

4
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:38.640
right rather one is running G.I. joe p So the command show IP protocols shows us that the only writing

5
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:50.240
protocol enabled on this Rada is EAI GOP on brought a 6 show IP protocols shows us that 0 SPF is enabled

6
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.510
on rota 6.

7
00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:06.030
We can also see that the router has a loop back address of 6 6 6 6 so quadruple 6 can write a 1 ping

8
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.150
that address and the answer is no pings or failing

9
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:23.600
all disable IP domain lock up to speed things up and let us to trace to that loop back after the moment

10
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.520
to the trace is going nowhere.

11
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:39.560
I'll do a debug IP package to see what happens and I'll ping with only one paying to that address so

12
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.480
ping six dot six 266.

13
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.060
Repeat.

14
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.340
1 and let's do that again.

15
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.740
And I'll turn off debugging notice here.

16
00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.080
Source one wondered wondered one pinging 66 at 66.

17
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:06.840
We're told that it's unreadable these other messages or even GOP messages.

18
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:16.080
The ping is unsuccessful to show IP round shows us that the vector network doesn't exist in the routing

19
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.140
table.

20
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:26.100
If we try and ping tendered one to five but one that also fails and sodas tendered one that five to

21
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.810
two.

22
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.350
So we can't paying this network all the loop back of wrought a six.

23
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.150
What about the loop back of wrought five.

24
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.290
So we able to ping the loop back around a five but not the loop back about a six.

25
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:49.540
And if we trace to tendered wondered five that one the trace fails immediately because the right doesn't

26
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:57.250
exist in the routing table tendered one dot 4.0 does exist in the routing table so we can paying tendered

27
00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.000
wondered for that one as well as tendered wondered forward to.

28
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.740
In other words we can get to this network.

29
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:13.480
Now again we are running EAI GOP on this router so these rorts have been redistributed from USPS into

30
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:22.780
EAI GOP let's look at right it too and see if wrote too can ping the loop back of Roorda 6.

31
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.400
It's not able to do that.

32
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.520
So show IP ranch.

33
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:37.600
We are not seeing that looped back in the routing table so let's have a look at what 5 Ken wrote a 5

34
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.520
paying the loop back of road 6.

35
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.860
The answer is it can.

36
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:51.940
So show IP wrote it's able to ping the loop back around a 6 the loop back exists as an OSP front in

37
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.130
the writing table of route of 5.

38
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.270
What about brought a 4

39
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.230
paying loop back of wrote a 6 that ping fails.

40
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:11.270
Show IP round back to loop packet doesn't exist in the writing table.

41
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:19.280
So let's have a look at route of 5 by using the command show IP protocols and tell me if you can see

42
00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.350
the problem by looking at this output.

43
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.000
What do you think is the problem when you look at the sound.

44
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.910
Put and to give you a hint.

45
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:36.810
I'll do the same command on en route for show IP protocols en route a full there's the output for a

46
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.490
for yes the output for road of 5.

47
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:48.010
What's the problem with this configuration okay.

48
00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:58.300
So notice the following its routing for areas of 1 and 2 the strata has interfaces in multiple areas

49
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:09.020
but doesn't have area 0 configured so show run Section 0 SPF shows us that the router is configured

50
00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.570
for area 1 and area 2 but is not configured for area 0.

51
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:27.600
Router 4 is configured for Area 1 it's a requirement in 0 SPF that area 0 be connected to other areas.

52
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:37.800
In other words this is configured as Area 1 This is configured as Area 2 but Area 2 is not adjacent

53
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.080
or bordering area 0.

54
00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.430
That's a problem if we look at router 3 over here.

55
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:57.780
Show IP protocols we can see that this Rada is configured as an area border router it has interfaces

56
00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:09.360
an area 0 and interfaces in Area 1 to show IP SPF interface brief shows us that gigabit 00 is configured

57
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:19.110
in area 0 gigabit 0 1 is configured in Area 1 so that looks good but rather 5 isn't configured in that

58
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:20.030
way.

59
00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.910
So show IP SPF interface brief.

60
00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:31.030
Notice it has interfaces in Area 1 and Area 2 but not in area 0.

61
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:42.330
That's why write a 1 campaign the loop back of route of 4 and the loop back of route of 5 but not the

62
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.730
loop back of road a 6 because

63
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:55.800
SPF is correctly configured with area 0 and Area 1 Over here.

64
00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:59.290
It works but here we have a problem.

65
00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:08.810
We need to create what's called a virtual link between Rider 3 and route of 5.

66
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:19.610
So we have to essentially pull or extend area 0 from Rider 3 to write a 5 to make road a 5 an area of

67
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:30.210
border rider so we will be essentially creating a tunnel where area 0 traverses a cross Area 1 2 write

68
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:38.520
a 5 area zero is going to be tunneled across Area 1 so that route of 5 becomes an area border rider

69
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:47.350
which means that area 2 is adjacent to area 0 that is required in 0 SPF.

70
00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:58.380
All areas have to be adjacent to area 0 when you have multiple SPF areas so show run section of SPF.

71
00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:02.970
We can see the configuration of Road 3.

72
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:12.550
Now when you create your virtual links you have to configure the other side using the Rada I.D. not

73
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:21.760
the IP address of the rota but the Rada I.D. So the command show IP SPF interface will show us the local

74
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:29.340
routers Rada I.D. So the right I.D. is 3D or tree to tree to tree.

75
00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:35.820
You can also use the command show IPO SPF and we'll be able to see that draw to I.D. So notice Rada

76
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:44.750
I.D. 3.0 3 2 3 2 3 on route 5 show IP 0 SPF.

77
00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:54.160
The right idea is 5.5 at 5.5 so background brought a 3 show run Section 0 SPF

78
00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:08.160
that's the configuration of SPF on Route 3 and that's the configuration of wrought a five some road

79
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.450
a three Roorda or SPF.

80
00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:14.520
One area one.

81
00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:24.970
This is the area that we are traversing the virtual link and the neighbors Roorda I.D. is 5 to 5 at

82
00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:26.650
5.5.

83
00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:30.610
Now there are options where you can set authentication and other options.

84
00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:31.670
I'm not going to do that.

85
00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:45.090
I'm simply going to create the virtual link so Roorda SPF 1 area 1 the virtual link and the right I.D.

86
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:50.200
that will connect to on this side is 3 to 3 2 or 3 2 or 3.

87
00:09:50.250 --> 00:10:00.050
So show IP or SPF neighbor you can see that a neighbor relationship was established using virtual link

88
00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:04.430
0 we can see that over here.

89
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:13.320
No election takes place on a virtual link show IP or SPF neighbor on the side we can see something similar

90
00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:22.530
a neighbor relationship has been formed from Brother 3 directly to RADA 5 through the 0 SPF virtual

91
00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:23.440
link.

92
00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:30.600
So logically it's as if these two riders rather three and Rod of five are connected to one another so

93
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:35.610
Ken wrote a three paying the loop back of wrote a six.

94
00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:42.330
Notice the raft is in the writing table so that looks better and notice a rather three can ping the

95
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.830
loot back of a a six.

96
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:55.240
And if we go back to write a one a one can now ping the loop back of wrought a six and when we do a

97
00:10:55.240 --> 00:11:06.850
trace notice it goes to Rod to Rod a three right a four rod of five and wrote a six.

98
00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:15.940
This tunnel is not like a Geo re tunnel it's a no SPF mechanism so traffic still goes via the physical

99
00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:24.310
links and you see every hop in the network which you wouldn't see if you were using Jari the virtual

100
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:28.770
link is simply used for SPF link advertisements.

101
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:34.080
So in other words to advertise Roth's so we've now solved the problem.

102
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:42.030
We've been able to configure the network to allow Rod one to ping brought us six let's have a look at

103
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:51.720
some more information on router 3 so show IP rot we are learning about that network as an into area

104
00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:53.280
network.

105
00:11:53.280 --> 00:12:00.440
It's coming from a separate area show IP SPF database for area zero.

106
00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:10.980
Notice we have wrought a two rather three and root of five in area zero rather five is shown as DNA.

107
00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:18.080
The neighbour relationship will not age so do not age this neighbour relationship because it's set through

108
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:28.120
a virtual link so we see rudder link states or LSA type one's net link states or LSA type 2s.

109
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:39.930
We see summary LSD or LSA type 3s we see something similar for Area 1 and we see external rots in the

110
00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:41.360
0 SPF database

111
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:53.910
so that was an example of how to configure or SPF of virtual links to solve a problem where you've got

112
00:12:53.970 --> 00:13:01.510
an area separated by a another area which is not area zero you know SPF.

113
00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:04.350
All areas have to touch the backbone area.

114
00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:06.550
In other words area zero.

115
00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:16.660
So here we are extending area zero across Area 1 to meet the OSP f design criteria.

116
00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:20.520
