1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
sh run int g0/0 as an example

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
shows me that encapsulation is been set to dot1q

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and the mode has been set to trunk.

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Now in this case, DTP or Dynamic Trunk Protocol is still enabled on the interface.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So I’m gonna go into the range of interfaces

6
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and type switchport no negotiate

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
That will disable DTP. So sh run int g0/0

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
shows me as an example that DTP ha been disabled

9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
that’s recommended and that I've statically configured the interface as a trunk.

10
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Something similar can be seen on the other interfaces are gigabit 0/1, 2 and 3.

11
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
sh int g0/0 switchport

12
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
shows me that the operational mode at the moment is trunking

13
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
it was manually configured as a trunk.

14
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
It was manually configured to use 802.1Q

15
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and that’s what it's using now. Negotiation of trunking is off.

16
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Previously the negotiation of trunking was on

17
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
even though I had configured the switchport as a trunk statically.

18
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So we’ve now disabled DTP on that port.

19
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So sh run int g0/0

20
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
these are the commands  that we’ve configured

21
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
so let’s do something similar on the other switches

22
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
on switch 2, switch 3 and switch 4, I'll configure the trunk interfaces first.

23
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
All these links between the witches are gonna be configured as trunks

24
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and then I'll configure the various ports on these switches.

25
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:55.000
so switch 2 conf t interface range g0/0 - 3

26
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
so 0/0, 0/1, 0/2 and 0/3 I'll paste those commands in.

27
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
That’s a configuration on switch 2, let’s look at switch 3.

28
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000
so switch 3 conf t int range g0/0

29
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
in this case it's only 0 and 1

30
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
which you'll gonna be configured as trunk ports

31
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000
paste the conf again as an example sh int g0/0 switchport

32
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
you can see as an example that it's configured as a trunk.

33
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Let’s have a look at switch 4

34
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
on switch 4 I need to configure gigabit 0/0 and gigabit 0/1.

35
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So enable conf t int range g0/0 to g0/1 paste the conf again.

36
00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:00.000
sh switch  sh int g0/0 switchport

37
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Port is configured as a trunk

38
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
it's operating as a trunk encapsulation is dot1q

39
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
it was configured to use dot1q

40
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and is using dot1q if DTP has been disabled.

41
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
All VLANs are allowed across the trunk.

42
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
So sh cdp neighbor

43
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000
we can see that on switch 4 we have enabled switch 1, switch 2 and router 2.

44
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Switch 1, switch 2 and router 2.

45
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
So all interfaces between switches have now being configured as the trunks.

46
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
I can now configure this port to NPM as an access port.

47
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So on switch 1, sh run int g1/0

48
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
it's configured with default config

49
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:57.000
so int g1/0 switchport mode access

50
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:05.000
switchport access vlan 1  do show run int g1/0

51
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
you can see that the command switchport access vlan 1

52
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
is not shown in the output because that’s a default command.

53
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Default commands don’t show by default in the output of the show run command.

54
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
But sh int g1/0 switchport

55
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.000
shows me that this port is an access port in VLAN 1

56
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
it’s been configured as an access port

57
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and is currently operating as an access port.

58
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Other negotiation of trunking is enabled on that port.

59
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
So I can go back on to the port and type switchport nonegotiate.

60
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:52.000
sh int g1/0 switchport  notice negotiation of trunking is off.

61
00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:00.000
As recommended, this port gigabit 1/0 is currently an access port in VLAn 1.

62
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
I need to do something similar on this interface to router 3

63
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
these devices NPM and the router are going to put

64
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
into the management VLAN for simplicity in this topology

65
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
you could put them in a separate VLAN

66
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
but because the NPM is gonna used to manage the devices using SNMP

67
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
and this router is the connection from the campus to the internet

68
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
I’m gonna leave this interface in VLAN 1.

69
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:39.000
so on switch 2 this interface gigabit 1/0 needs to be configured as an access port

70
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:47.000
so switchport mode access   switchport access vlan 1

71
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
switchport nonegotiate

72
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
sh int g1/0 switchport

73
00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000
gigabit 1/0 is enabled it’s been configured as a static access port

74
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
it's operating as a static access port.

75
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
The negotiation of access is off because we disabled DTP.

76
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
so the 2 core switches having configured

77
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
I now need to configure this interface in VLAN 10

78
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000
and this interface in VLAN 20 for my access PCs.

79
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Once again I’m using IOS routers to mimic host devices in this topology.

80
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:33.000
So on switch 3, this switch sh int g0/2 switchport

81
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
at the moment the port is enabled

82
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
but it's using dynamic auto as the administrative mode

83
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
so it’s going to dynamically negotiate

84
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
with the other side for trunking or as an access port.

85
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
At the moment the operational mode is static access

86
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
in other words it’s an access port in VLAN 1.

87
00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:05.000
So we wanna change that conf t int g0/2 switchport mode access

88
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
We wanna statically configure it as an access port

89
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.000
switchport access VLAN and in this case I want to specify that the VLAN is 10.

90
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
switchport nonegotiate

91
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.000
sh int g0/2 switchport

92
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000
so this port is now enabled as a static access port

93
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
it’s not negotiating, the current mode is static access

94
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
negotiation of trunking is off and the port is now in VLAN 10

95
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000
so we’ve move this interface from VLAN 1 to VLAN 10

96
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.000
we now need to do something similar on this port on switch 4.

97
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
So sh int g0/2 switchport

98
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
port is enabled administrative mode is dynamic auto

99
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
we're using DTP to do some negotiation

100
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
at the moment it's using static access as the operational mode

101
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.000
the VLAN that the port is in is VLAN 1, so access port in VLAN 1.

102
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
So int g0/2 switchport mode access

103
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:27.000
switchport access vlan in this case 20, switchport nonegotiate

104
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:34.000
sh int g0/2 switchport

105
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Port is enabled as a layer 2 interface.

106
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
It’s been manually configured as a static access port

107
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
and is operating as the static access port.

108
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.000
DTP is disabled, the port is now an access port in VLAN 20.

109
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000
So we have configured the core links between the switches as trunk ports.

110
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
This port is an access port in VLAN 1, so is this port

111
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
this port is an access port in VLAN 10

112
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
and this port is an access port in VLAN 20.
