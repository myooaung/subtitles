00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:09.120
So once again or if see 19:18 discusses IP addresses that are not readable on the Internet they are

2
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:18.760
three blocks of addresses one class a network 16 Class B networks and 256 class C networks.

3
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.950
You know the range of addresses once again.

4
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:29.310
And remember when you are sending traffic internally from an IP address such as 10.0 1.1 that one to

5
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.990
a web site such as Google dot com or Facebook does come your IP address has to be netted or network

6
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:43.320
address translated to a public IP address such as 15 at 1.1 one.

7
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:51.330
This is a public class A address and this is a private plus a address these addresses will not be accepted

8
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.230
by Internet service providers and therefore will not be routed onto the internet unless of course an

9
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:05.790
Internet service provider forgot to add an access list to blocking traffic from these networks.

10
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.800
So in this example my PC has an IP address of 10.0 deserted at six.

11
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.380
That is a private IP address which is not a ratable on the internet but I am able to ping yahoo dot

12
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:27.490
com which has a public IP address of 87 or 2 4 8 dot 122 dot 122.

13
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:34.980
And that's because my IP address is being netted or network address translated by my router when I send

14
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.140
traffic to the Internet.

15
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.470
Here's another example ping Google dot com.

16
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.560
The pings succeed because once again my IP address is being netted.

17
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.920
That is not covered in this video.

18
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.980
Please refer to other videos for explanations of a network address translation.

19
00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:01.830
But in brief MacT will translate one of these IP addresses to a publicly readable address when traversing

20
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:02.610
a router.

21
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:10.560
That's how I'm able to use a private IP address on my local PC but still be able to access devices on

22
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.800
the internet.

23
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:19.200
My address is being enacted when I traverse my local internet gateway which can be as simple as your

24
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:27.760
router at home which connects you to the Internet the next special IP address range is the IP version

25
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:36.760
for link local addresses or more formally dynamic configuration of IP version 4 link local addresses

26
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.970
as per RAFC 3 9 to 7.

27
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:47.930
Microsoft referred to this address order configuration method as automatic private IP address or API

28
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.550
P.A. So that's Microsoft's IP version for a link local addresses.

29
00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:03.100
Now this is used where a PC is configured for DHP or dynamic host configuration protocol but no DHP

30
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.840
servers are available.

31
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:12.850
So an IP address cannot be allocated via a DHP and therefore the PC automatically chooses an IP address

32
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.710
in the range 1 6 9 or 2 5 4 0 0.

33
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:25.450
This allows computers to use a link a local IP addresses for communication on a local segment.

34
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:34.960
Now in the really really old days of networking going back to Windows 3.1 if you wanted to PCs to communicate

35
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:43.360
you had to either allocate an address using DHP or you had to manually configure the IP addresses on

36
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.960
the PCs to communicate with each other these days.

37
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:55.180
That's not necessary because IP version 4 link local addresses will allow two computers to communicate

38
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.790
with each other when no DHP server is available.

39
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:05.560
So if you connected two PCs back to back using a cable they'd be able to communicate with each other

40
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.580
without the use of having to configure static IP addresses on those devices.

41
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:18.280
The PCs would simply use an IP address in this range and be able to communicate with each other hosts

42
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.620
randomly generate the host specific portion of the address.

43
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.520
This is a Class B address.

44
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:31.720
Notice the mosque to find 5.4 5.0 zero which indicates that the first two octets sees a network and

45
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.610
hosts will randomly choose the host specific portion of the address.

46
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:43.360
Once again this makes the lives of non-technical users a lot easier because they can simply connect

47
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:51.010
two devices together without the need of a DHP server allocating addresses the two PCs can immediately

48
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.790
communicate with one another.

49
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:59.470
The user doesn't have to configure ADHD be server or manually configure IP addresses on the PCs.

50
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:07.660
As long as the two PCs are connected via a cable or a local segment through a switch as an example they

51
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.420
can communicate using IP.

52
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:19.540
So a PC with IP address 1 6 9 to 5 for that one can communicate with another PC which for example chose

53
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:27.850
an IP address of 1 6 9 2 5 4 1 2 2 no manual configuration is required in this example I'm using consecutive

54
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:34.420
addresses but typically the addresses chosen by the hosts are random and won't be sequential like in

55
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:35.740
this example.

56
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.350
Be careful however with those address range.

57
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:39.780
It's not readable.

58
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:46.750
In other words the hosts can communicate on the local link but their traffic is non ratable those can

59
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:53.470
cause issues because users will be able to communicate with other devices on the local segment or local

60
00:05:53.470 --> 00:06:00.220
link but they will not be able to communicate with devices on the Internet or devices in a different

61
00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.510
subnet.

62
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:09.940
So if you type IP config on a PC for example and you see that the PC has an address in the range 169

63
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.090
are too far for Dot XRX.

64
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:22.210
That means the PC was not able to get an IP address via a DHP and dynamically allocated itself an IP

65
00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.790
version for link local address.

66
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:30.700
No DHP server was available and thus an IP address wasn't allocated to the device.

67
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:35.880
It simply chose an address from the 169 to 5:4 address range.
