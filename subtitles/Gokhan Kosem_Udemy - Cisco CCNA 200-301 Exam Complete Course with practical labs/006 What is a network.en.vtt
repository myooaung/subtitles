00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:17.320
Now if we're going to talk about networking we should really define what a network is.

2
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.170
So what is a network.

3
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.180
No I'm not talking about a social media network.

4
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:28.630
I'm not talking about your contacts let's say on Facebook or Linked In or Twitter or tick tock or whatever

5
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.020
your social media platform with choices.

6
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.940
We're not talking about a social media network.

7
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.940
In this case we're talking about a computer network.

8
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.340
So what is a computer network.

9
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.470
And he has a challenge.

10
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.190
I'm going to ask the robots what a computer network is.

11
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.310
See how much you understand by this definition.

12
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:57.290
Alexa what is a computer network a computer network is a digital telecommunications network for sharing

13
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:03.670
resources between nodes which are computing devices that use a common telecommunications technology.

14
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.890
Data transmission between nodes is supported over data links consisting of physical cable media such

15
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:17.390
as twisted pair of fiber optic cables or by wireless methods such as Wi-Fi microwave transmission or

16
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.970
free space optical communication OK so there's the course.

17
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:22.880
We finish now.

18
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.300
We all understand what computer networking is.

19
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.490
Yeah.

20
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.660
If only.

21
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.920
Now if you're a robot you may be able to understand everything about computer networking just by listening

22
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.410
to those two paragraphs.

23
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.540
But I think for us we need to spend quite a bit more time to really understand what a computer network

24
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.170
is and understand how computer networks work.

25
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.310
Let's start firstly with the why why do we have computer networks.

26
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.970
What's the whole point of the Internet.

27
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.790
What's the whole point of all this infrastructure that's been built around the world.

28
00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:04.060
And the big reason to have a network as per this definition is to share resources.

29
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:10.220
We want to share information or share some kind of resource with someone else.

30
00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.260
Now what is a resource in the old days.

31
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.590
A common example of a resource would be a printer.

32
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.080
If you had an office with 100 people in the office you could buy a printer for every workstation or

33
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.400
for every P.C..

34
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.460
And that's what they had to do before the days of networking.

35
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:35.260
They either had to have a printer for every computer or have no printers or what they had to do is do

36
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:42.970
something like this where they copy a file onto a floppy disk and then go over to the printing station

37
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.250
and then print it manually.

38
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.940
It's not cost effective to buy a printer for every workstation or for every person.

39
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:57.940
It makes much more sense to have a centralized resource in this case a printing resource and share that

40
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.800
resource amongst the people in the office.

41
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.910
So rather than having let's say 100 printers for 100 people you only let's say have 10 printers.

42
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:13.210
So you've reduced the cost by creating a shared resource a resource that can be shared by what are called

43
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.460
clients.

44
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:21.190
So we have client devices or pieces in this example that are sharing a resource in this case a printer.

45
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.960
Another example is file sharing.

46
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.020
This is very common.

47
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.400
I want to share a file with you.

48
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.220
So how do I do that.

49
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.130
Now in the old days the way to do that was to get a floppy disk like this.

50
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:40.360
The problem with these floppy disks is in the old days they're only supported one point for four megabytes.

51
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.050
It's not a very big drive but there you go really old example.

52
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.500
So they'd have to if they wanted to share a photograph or a file with someone else they'd have to copy

53
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.980
it to this floppy disk then walk using what we would call sneaky net.

54
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:04.150
So they'd firstly have to copy the photo or the file onto this disk then walk using sneaker net across

55
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.710
the office put it into the other computer and then access the file.

56
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.440
So that's how they would share a resource.

57
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.530
In this case a file or a photograph.

58
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.740
Now today we still use this kind of technology by using USP thumb drives.

59
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:25.450
So if I wanted to share a resource with you like a photograph or a file I could copy it onto this UCB

60
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.480
drive and then give it to you and then you'd copy it to your computer.

61
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:35.860
So sneaker net the original type of networking if you like is where a human being would take a resource

62
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.580
copy of file or a photograph onto this USP drive.

63
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.320
I'd walk to your computer and then give it to you and share the resource with you.

64
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.510
But that's not very effective.

65
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.830
It's not scalable doesn't work that well.

66
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.260
You let's be honest most humans would be too lazy to have to walk around the office to share files.

67
00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:03.160
It's much easier just to share files using a digital transmission mechanism or medium and they're different

68
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.650
types of digital transmission mechanisms.

69
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:06.880
Why are we doing this.

70
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:15.700
We are trying to share a resource between what in this definition is called a node and they define that

71
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.790
as a computing device.

72
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.260
So a node is a computing device.

73
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.340
And there are many types of computing devices.

74
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.020
We could have Windows laptops.

75
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.370
We could have Mac books.

76
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.920
We could have phones.

77
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.600
We could have servers.

78
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.950
Those are often the devices that most consumers will think about.

79
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.970
And I've mentioned printers already has another one.

80
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:41.500
But in networking we have specialized devices such as hubs switches routers and firewalls to name a

81
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.800
few.

82
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.940
So stepping back a second.

83
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.420
Why do we have a computer network.

84
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:52.330
We want to share resources which could be a printer could be a file could be a video.

85
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.740
So videos are very popular these days.

86
00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:02.020
You watching this video through a computer network I'm sharing this information with you using a data

87
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.480
link in the Wikipedia definition.

88
00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:11.770
They talk about a data link being a physical cable such as twisted paper fiber optic cables Wi-Fi or

89
00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.940
some type of data link where I'm sharing information with you.

90
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:21.360
So the big idea here is I'm sharing a resource with you and I need a way to get that to you.

91
00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:27.300
You need a device that can receive the resource we need some kind of transmission media which could

92
00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.930
be physical cables or it could be wireless.

93
00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:37.260
So the idea is rather than having to physically transport a file on a you as B Drive or in the very

94
00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:46.020
very old days using a floppy disk we use a cable or some kind of mechanism to transmit data from one

95
00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.500
device to another or from one device to many devices.
