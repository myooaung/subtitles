Many Cisco switches support Dynamic Trunking Protocol or DTP

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
this allows switches to dynamically negotiate the forming of trunks

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
DTP is a Cisco propriety protocol

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and hence other vendors don’t support it

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
a lot of switches have this configured by default

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
which means that they can  automatically negotiate

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
trunking with neighboring switches.

8
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It’s, however, best practice to disable DTP and use manual configuration

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
2 Cisco switches can dynamically through DTP negotiate to form a trunk

10
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and permit VLANs across the trunk automatically

11
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
it can also negotiate the protocol used such as the ISL or 802.1Q

12
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I’ll show you demonstration of DTP in a moment

13
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
but DTP supports 2 main modes, dynamic auto and dynamic desirable.

14
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Desirable means that the switch initiates trunking with the remote end.

15
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Auto means that it doesn’t initiate

16
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
but if the other side initiates the trunking, trunking will be formed.

17
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So as an example if you have 2 switches configured for dynamic desirable

18
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
a trunk will be formed between the 2 switches.

19
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
If 1 side is set up with dynamic desirable

20
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and the other side is using dynamic auto

21
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
trunking will be formed but if both sides

22
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
using dynamic auto neither side initiates the trunking.

23
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So the port becomes an access port.

24
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
It is better practice, however, to configure both sides manually

25
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
for trunking or configure both sides as access ports.

26
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000
DTP packets are sent using CLAN 1 when ISL is used.

27
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
When 8021.Q trunking is used, DTP packets are sent on the native VLAN

28
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
this is the case even if the native VLAN is cleared from the trunk

29
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
on ISL trunks, DTP packet are sent on VLAN 1

30
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
even if VLAN 1 is cleared from the trunk.
