00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.330
Now there's several ways that MAC addresses can be learnt.

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.980
The first aesthetic way you statically configure specific MAC addresses that are allowed or permitted

3
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.740
on a port any MAC address is that you don't specify or not allowed on the port.

4
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.210
The advantage with this method is that you have a lot of control but the disadvantage is that you have

5
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:28.900
to manually work out what the MAC addresses all of all your devices and then manually configure them.

6
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.800
You could also use dynamic learning where you specify how many MAC addresses are permitted on a port

7
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.250
and they are dynamically learnt.

8
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.450
So as an example you could say that only two MAC addresses are permitted on a port and the first two

9
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.570
MAC addresses that are learnt are permitted any subsequent MAC addresses are not permitted.

10
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.700
You would use this as an example to limit the MAC addresses permitted but not to which MAC addresses

11
00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:01.140
are permitted so you're limiting the number of MAC addresses and not a limiting based on specific MAC

12
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.200
addresses.

13
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.770
The thing to remember about dynamic learning is that when the switch is rebooted while the port goes

14
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.430
down the MAC addresses learnt are removed and new MAC addresses would then be permitted when the port

15
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.660
comes up again.

16
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:23.800
You could also specify a aging interval to allow MAC addresses to be forgotten after a period of time.

17
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.330
So if you had a situation where you had a hot desk or a boardroom you may only allow a certain number

18
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.070
of MAC addresses on a port but those MAC addresses can change over time.

19
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.080
You could also do a combination of static and dynamic learning where you explicitly permit certain MAC

20
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.110
addresses.

21
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.670
So as an example you could limit the number of MAC addresses on a port to 4 but only statically configured

22
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.630
to MAC addresses the remaining two MAC addresses can be dynamically learned.

23
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.590
The static at MAC addresses do not a jot but you could allow the dynamically learnt MAC addresses to

24
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:07.260
a jot stickie learning allows you to automatically add a learnt MAC address to the running configuration

25
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.190
of the switch.

26
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.380
So rather than statically configuring MAC addresses you could allow the switch to learn MAC addresses

27
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:20.220
and then add them to the configuration when you save your running configuration to start up configuration.

28
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.560
Those MAC addresses will be kept in nv ram and therefore won't be lost if the switch reboots.

29
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.500
So there are various options.

30
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.890
Remember port security is an initial way to implement security.

31
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.420
It allows you to limit the number of mac addresses permitted on a port and it allows you to specify

32
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.070
which MAC addresses are permitted on a port.

33
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.820
You have the option of just limiting two addresses on a port but not worrying what those MAC addresses

34
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:48.340
are.

35
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:55.410
That would stop a user bringing a access point or home router to work and plugging it into the network

36
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.490
and allowing the friends to access the network.

37
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:06.270
Or you could be strict and only allow specific MAC addresses on a port so a user can't connect to a

38
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.590
director's port and therefore have access to the director's view and.
