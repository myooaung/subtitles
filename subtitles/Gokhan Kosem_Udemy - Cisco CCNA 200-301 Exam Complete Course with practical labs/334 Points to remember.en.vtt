00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:08.490
Some points to remember clients adjust their time from what they hear from an A.P. server A.P. service

2
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.150
supply time to clients.

3
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:17.410
They don't adjust their time to the clients the clients adjust their time to the service and need to

4
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:24.580
be client server device such as Rhondda to in our example got time from an ATP service with synchronizing

5
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:33.960
two routers three and then provided time to Rato one a.p needs what is called a trusted clock source.

6
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.560
Ideally you would get this from a lower stratum device such as a domain controller in your network on

7
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.440
the server on the Internet in the lab.

8
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.200
We didn't have a a.p server that we were connecting to.

9
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:56.610
So I configured router 3 as an entity monster so that it trusted its own internal clock as the clock

10
00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.870
source.

11
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.660
Once again in the real world thats not ideal.

12
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:08.450
You should get your time from a better time source a strong arm level or stratum some of you may pronounce

13
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:18.190
it defines the quality of the time source the lower the number the better the time source a straw is

14
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:24.410
a device that has an atomic clock would guess clock radio clock.

15
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:32.560
In other words it's a very good reference for time a.p is quite simple to configure once again to set

16
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:39.880
up a server or stratum device you would use the C'mon A.P.M. to specify a loopback interface which is

17
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.290
much better than using a physical interface because look backs don't go down use the A.P. source loopback

18
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.980
is zero command to specify a server.

19
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.580
Use the command NDB server and specify the server.

20
00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:05.060
So the server command makes a product to a client the master command means that router 3 is the trusted

21
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.550
source of time.

22
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.990
Right.

23
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:16.070
Two however is also a server providing time to run one because Rotto one is pointing to rodded to Fort's

24
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.750
time.

25
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.800
So we didn't configure Rodek to as a server.

26
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.120
It was simply configured as a client

27
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.600
but it started providing time to write a one when Rodda one queried at.

28
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.050
It can also use its own clock as a backup if it loses connection to rodded 3.
