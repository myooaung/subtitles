00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:07.240
So class based where effect queuing ensures that traffic classes get fair bandwidth guarantees.

2
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:15.280
In other words you can guarantee a minimum bandwidth to a GDP a minimum bandwidth to FTB minimum bandwidth

3
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.540
to voice traffic video traffic and so on.

4
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.240
But there's no latency guarantees.

5
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.140
In other words there is no priority queue.

6
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:34.000
Class based waited for queuing is suitable only for data networks so Cisco developed low latency queuing

7
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.380
or low queue which to give you the full name is pretty key.

8
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.820
Class based waited for queuing.

9
00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.360
In other words it's class based.

10
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.300
Waited for queuing with an added priority queue.

11
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.440
So it takes the previous model of class based.

12
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:57.010
Waited for queuing and adds a queue with strict poverty for real time traffic.

13
00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:06.070
So the idea is as when packets arrive based on a class or classification mechanism that you decide traffic

14
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.550
is put into different classes.

15
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.030
Voice traffic is put into the priority queue and is proud to rise to over other traffic types if DP

16
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:25.020
HDP and other traffic types are put into their own classes with minimum bandwidth guarantees now to

17
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.540
ensure that the priority queue doesn't starve.

18
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:37.140
The other queues the priority queue has a minimum bandwidth guarantee but is also policed so it also

19
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.740
has a maximum bandwidth limit.

20
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:48.630
So when you specify the priority of the low latency party queue that is actually a minimum and maximum

21
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.320
which provides a minimum bandwidth guarantee for voice but also ensures that voice doesn't starve the

22
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.670
other traffic types.
