00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So let’s have a look at a difference in configuration.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So what happens if I type sh run | b vty.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
If I look at the startup config  I have the same configuration

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:27.000
but let’s change that so, line vty 0 10 login password cisco

5
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
sh run | b vty I can see my 5 VTY lines

6
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
0 4 plus an additional 6 VTY lines.

7
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
If I type sh start | b vty

8
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I only see my first 5 VTY lines with the command login.

9
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So let’s copy start to run and see how it merges the configuration.

10
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Well it removes config, overwrite it or replace it.

11
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:13.000
So sh run | b vty we still have the VTY config as configured.

12
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So the login command is still there, the password command is still there

13
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and the additional VTY lines are still there.

14
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Sh start | b vty, only has the first 4 VTY.

15
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
But now let’s make a change, lines line vty 0 10

16
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I’m gonna type no login, so sh run type begin vty notice we’ve use the command no login

17
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
which means no login credentials are required, but if we look at the startup config

18
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.000
we’ve got the login keyword, so this login keyword conflicts with this no login command.

19
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:09.000
copy, copy start run   sh run | b vty

20
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
so notice the difference now.

21
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
On the VTY lines, this command has been overwritten by the startup config

22
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
because previously in the running config

23
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
we had no login and then the startup config we had login.

24
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So no login was in conflict with login and that’s now been replaced

25
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
but the additional conflict hasn’t been removed.

26
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
So the startup config has been merged with the running config.

27
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Be careful doing merges of config, it can be confusing

28
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.000
to know what your result in configuration is.

29
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Now there’s another option called configure replace.

30
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:10.000
So now let see what happens if we replace, the config with the startup config.

31
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
So I'm gonna replace the running config with the startup config

32
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
notice we’ve told that configuration changes have been made.

33
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.000
So if I type sh run | b vty

34
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
the default login authentication has been added.

35
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
the configuration of all the lines have been replaced with the startup config.

36
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.000
So this is not a merge, this is the replacement of the running config with the startup config.

37
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
So just to reiterate, copy start run is a merge

38
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
configure replace startup config.

39
00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:04.000
configure replace nvram startup config is a replacement

40
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
of the running config with the startup config.

41
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
So be careful using copy start to run

42
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
because the result in configuration may not be what you expect it to be.

43
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:27.000
A copy runs start is a replacement always but a copy start to run is a merge

44
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
so a command that often preferred is configure replace

45
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
which replaces the running config with the startup config

46
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
the same could be used, so it configure replace

47
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
and you could  specify TFTP rather options

48
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000
so you could replace the running config with the configuration on a TFTP server.

49
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000
By default a copy from TFTP to run is a merge

50
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
in the similar way to when you make a configuration changes through the CLI

51
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
like we’ve been doing you are merging the configuration

52
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
in other words you're making changes to specific portions and the same is true

53
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
when you copy the config from startup to running config, be aware of the different options.
