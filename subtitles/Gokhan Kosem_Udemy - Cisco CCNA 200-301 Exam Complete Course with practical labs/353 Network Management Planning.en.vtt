00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:07.130
Before you rush out and deploy a network management system in a production environment think about network

2
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.060
management planning in a lab such as with Jeana's 3.

3
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.950
This is perhaps not as important but it's very important when doing this in the real world.

4
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.670
Network management planning includes translating business requirements into monitoring needs thresholds

5
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:33.300
and network performance monitor or A.P.M. configurations other things to consider with network management

6
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:40.470
planning include building and leveraging reports that meet the needs of the various stakeholders as

7
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:46.060
well as determining and monitoring scope and impact on the network.

8
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:54.150
And don't forget about the network topology having an impact on the actual monitoring system translating

9
00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:01.850
business requirements means doing things such as surveying key stakeholders and departments for their

10
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.900
monitoring and reporting needs.

11
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:10.790
It also means documenting goals for your network management system and this really needs to be stressed.

12
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.020
It's very important that you document the goals of your network management system.

13
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.400
Otherwise how do you determine if the network management system deployment has achieved what you set

14
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.920
out to be.

15
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.910
An organization may have the goal of increasing the availability of the network.

16
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:38.370
However if you don't document those goals and don't baseline your network before you deploy you a network

17
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.480
management system.

18
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.380
How will you determine if the network management system has had a positive effect on the network.

19
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.600
And what it was originally intended to do.

20
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.000
It's important that your goals be documented before you deploy.

21
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.110
And in addition make sure that you have a baseline of the network.

22
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.160
In other words you have an indication of what the network looks like in its current form.

23
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.660
Before you deploy the network management system if you don't do that how will you know three months

24
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.530
from today or six months from today.

25
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:21.190
Whether the metric management system has had a positive effect on the network and has accomplished what

26
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.250
it was originally intended to do.

27
00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.120
Key measures also include things like data granularity.

28
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.540
In other words how granular or detailed should the data be that you are collecting.

29
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.810
For example if you are looking at bandwidth utilization on an interface how often are you importing

30
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:41.870
that data.

31
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.110
Is it once every five minutes or once every five seconds.

32
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:52.240
If you only look at the bandwidth utilization of an interface every five minutes you may miss a spike

33
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.770
during that five minute interval.

34
00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:01.210
On the flip side if you are collecting data every second you may end up storing a very large amount

35
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.740
of data.

36
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:08.950
Another thing to keep in mind when translating business requirements into monitoring needs is data retention

37
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.060
data retention means.

38
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:17.260
How long are you going to keep the data that your network management system collected before it's either

39
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.810
deleted or summarized in other words.

40
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:28.110
How long are you going to keep detailed records of your network before it's deemed unnecessary to keep

41
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.060
that data.

42
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.460
Or at least that level of detail of the data or other things you're going to want to do in documenting

43
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:44.380
these monitoring needs is to define both the needs of the teams involved in projects and the thresholds.

44
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:51.230
Now what thresholds mean is the level at which you want to start seeing Arab states.

45
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:59.300
Paying more attention if an interface is running at 25 percent utilization and then goes up to 50 percent

46
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.620
utilization.

47
00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:07.640
You may not want to be notified of that but when it goes to 90 percent utilization you may want to be

48
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:14.750
informed that something's happened on your network so you need to decide the thresholds before you get

49
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.350
notified of possible problems on your network.

50
00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:24.410
This becomes important when you build your alerts and configure the different reports available and

51
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:32.060
NPM NPM of course has many options and settings that you can change based on your network as well as

52
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.790
your business requirements.
