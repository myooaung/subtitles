00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.050
I really want to welcome you to the CCNY course.

2
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:13.380
Thank you so much for investing your money and investing your time in my course.

3
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.260
I've taught hundreds of thousands of students and I'm confident that you'll learn something through

4
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.060
this course in this course.

5
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.230
There are a whole bunch of labs that you need to complete.

6
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.520
I want to make this course a very interactive.

7
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.830
So I'm gonna teach you some concepts some theoretical concepts but as quickly as possible I want to

8
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:38.430
get you hands on I want to get you working on equipment and the best way to do that is to use a Cisco

9
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.710
Packet Tracer labs.

10
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.820
I'm going to use standard labs but I'm also going to be using Packet Tracer assessment labs to assess

11
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:45.730
your knowledge.

12
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.010
I want to make sure that once you've completed a theory section you can actually do what you've learnt.

13
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.900
One of the best ways to learn is to actually do something.

14
00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:02.490
I love the saying You can listen to someone you can read about it but the best way to learn is to actually

15
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:03.460
do it.

16
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.340
So we're going to cover some theory but then we're going to practically assess your knowledge and make

17
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.890
sure that you understand what you've just watched and hopefully learnt.

18
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.910
Don't worry if you don't pass the first assessment that's fine that's normal.

19
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:23.280
That's actually good because it shows you that you need to go back and watch the videos again or read

20
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.240
a book and make sure that you understand a concept.

21
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.420
Make the mistakes during the assessments.

22
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.730
In this course rather than in the real exam.

23
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.390
This course contains Chris questions contains packet trace assessments contains a whole bunch of stuff

24
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.470
to make sure that you're ready to pass your exam so it's not just videos.

25
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.240
It's not just theory.

26
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.090
I want to make sure that you practically understand the technologies covered in the CCMA exam.

27
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:58.280
Let me warn you however to understand the technology you need to understand the theory of that technology.

28
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.380
So there's gonna be times when you struggling.

29
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.890
There's a whole bunch of theory that you have to get through.

30
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.140
So as an example you need to understand IP submitting to be able to practically subnet a network IP

31
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.570
submitting is one of those topics that a lot of people struggle with when you struggling when you're

32
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.500
feeling down.

33
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.620
Just remember that if you continue you'll get it you'll understand it and you'll be able to pass the

34
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.090
CCMA exam.

35
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.120
Don't let the theory topics hold you back.

36
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.860
Don't let the heavy theory.

37
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.210
If you're getting bored if you're getting tired if you're struggling take a break and then come back

38
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.450
and make sure that you conquer those mountains or those topics.

39
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.940
Make sure that you understand subnets and make sure that you understand topics such as access control

40
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:42.430
lists.

41
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.360
Don't let the theory stop you from reaching your goal.

42
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.710
It's initially difficult to understand a new technology or a new topic.

43
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:51.950
Breakthrough.

44
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.300
Make sure that you study and learn the technology so that you can then get to the practical portion

45
00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.300
and you can apply your knowledge.

46
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.520
We got a mixed theory and labs to make sure that it stays interesting to make sure that you understand

47
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.970
the concepts but also understand the practical application of the technologies.

48
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.160
Biggest thing I can say is don't give up.

49
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.570
Continue everyday studying makes sure that you reach your goals.
