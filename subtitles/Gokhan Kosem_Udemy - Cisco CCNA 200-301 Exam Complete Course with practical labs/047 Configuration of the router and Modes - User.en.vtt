00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:08.340
Want to secure as an example allows you to automatically lock down the router using Siska best practices

2
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.750
but you need to be very careful choosing that option because you could lock yourself out of your own

3
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:15.510
router.

4
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:22.530
The router then shows you a summary of what you've configured and looking at some of the configuration.

5
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:31.280
Notice we gave the router a name of our one we configured the Viti y lines used for telnet and S-sh

6
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.090
with a password of Cisco.

7
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:40.100
So the options that were chosen through the initial configuration dialog have now been converted into

8
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.930
Cisco IOS commands that can be applied on the router at the end of the menu.

9
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.590
We are prompted with three options.

10
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.740
Zero go to the Iowas command prompt without saving this configuration.

11
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.410
And that's what we want to do.

12
00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:04.220
1 return back to the set up with out saving this config to save this configuration to nv ram and exit

13
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:12.910
so we can choose 0 because we don't want to use the configuration from the initial configuration dialog.

14
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.340
We want to configure the router using Cisco Ioway commands you are told that you can to set up again

15
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.400
by using the set up command but we're not interested in doing that.

16
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.090
We're going to configure the router through the Selye commands.

17
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.070
So we're going to hit enter or press Return to get started on the CLIA.

18
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.410
And here we are.

19
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:40.700
You can see that we presented with a prompt and this is known as user mode.

20
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:49.320
Now as mentioned it's important that you get to know the various modes available on Cisco Rorrison switches.

21
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.470
The first mode is user mode.

22
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:59.070
Now the Cisco Iowas software is designed with a rock hill structure for various modes modes that you'll

23
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.560
encounter include user mode which we're discussing right now privileged mode which we'll talk about

24
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.490
in a moment as well as global configuration mode and other modes you can enter commands into the sea

25
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.750
a lie by typing or copying and pasting the commands through your terminal emulation software.

26
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:25.200
It's important that the right c'mon be topped in the right mood and the mood is indicated with a distinctive

27
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.480
prompt the term prompt is used because the system is prompting you to make an entry.

28
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.600
So by default every prompt begins with the device name which in this example would be Rodda because

29
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.560
we haven't configured the name of the device following the name.

30
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.380
The remainder of the prompt indicates the mode and in this case we are in user mode and we know that

31
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:53.700
because it has a greater than sign behind the name of the router as you enter commands Moat's can change.

32
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.960
So in a moment I'm going to show you how to type enable in user mode to go to privileged mode or enable

33
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.840
mode and you'll see that the prompt changes when you press enter or hit carriage return.

34
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.390
You're instructing the device to pass and execute the command that you've entered.

35
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:19.930
Now once again this mode is user mode and it only gives us a limited number of basic monitoring commands.

36
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.230
You can see the commands available in this mode by using question mark.

37
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.140
So when I use a question mark I can see the commands available in this mode.

38
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.570
Pressing enter will show me one additional line at a time.

39
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:39.840
Some show commands are available in this mode including show version which allows me to see the version

40
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.240
of operating system on the router.

41
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:48.360
It also allows me to see other information including the amount of RAM installed in the router which

42
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.700
interfaces are available on the router.

43
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:59.330
Amount of nv ram available and how much flash is installed in the router by typing it's a question mark

44
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:08.130
I'll be able to see which commands start with SH and I can use the tab key to complete a command.

45
00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:15.390
So if I type shows space question mark I'll be able to see the options available for the show command.

46
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.150
If I press spacebar it shows me additional options one page at a time.

47
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.900
Pressing enter once again shows me one additional line of options.

48
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:33.570
So if I type shows space the question mark for example I can see which commands start with show the

49
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.520
if I press enter.

50
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:43.480
At this point I'm told that I've entered an ambiguous command because there are multiple commands that

51
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.380
start with Chevvy.

52
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:55.260
I can then use the key combination control P Or simply use the up arrow key to see the previously typed

53
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.740
command all type E and press question mark again.

54
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:05.970
And now I can see that there's only one command option available which is show version.

55
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:12.240
If I press Enter at this point the rod accepts the command because that's the only option available

56
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:21.600
to me if I try and type commands that are only valid in other modes in this mode the Rato will reject

57
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.010
the command.

58
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:28.790
So as an example I'll type confetti which should be typed in privilege mode.

59
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:34.680
The router doesn't except the command conforte takes me to global configuration mode but requires me

60
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.880
to be in privileged mode when I type that command.

61
00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.200
So the router doesn't except the command.

62
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.580
It's a valid command but I'm in the wrong mode.

63
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:50.180
So the command is not accepted the hostname command is only valid in global configuration mode.

64
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:56.490
And once again if I try and type it in user mode the rod will reject the command.

65
00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.380
It's a valid command but I'm in the wrong mode.

66
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:06.800
So the router doesn't accept it before you can do any configuration on the router switch.

67
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:12.790
You need to go to enable mode or privileged mode and the way to do that is to type ECN.

68
00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.650
Or if I press tab the command is order completed to enable.

69
00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:23.100
And now I press Enter I'm taken to privilege mode or enable mode.

70
00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:28.880
Notice the prompt has changed from a greater than sign to a hash or pound sign.

71
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.710
Whichever term you prefer using.
