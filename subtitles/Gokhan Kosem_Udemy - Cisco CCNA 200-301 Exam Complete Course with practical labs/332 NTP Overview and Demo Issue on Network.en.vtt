00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:07.860
What time is it I'm sure you agree that time is of great importance in the real world.

2
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.500
And the same is true for networking.

3
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:18.900
If I asked you to have a meeting with me tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. one of the first questions is 9:00 AM

4
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.620
in which time zone I'm based in the UK but you may be based elsewhere.

5
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:32.040
So we're talking about 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time in the U.S. or Prep's Pacific time while we're talking

6
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:39.000
about 9:00 a.m. U.K. time time is also of great importance when troubleshooting networking in this example

7
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.540
I've got three routers Rato one Rohatyn wrote a three.

8
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:52.460
And as an example if I type confetti and then controls it or control the Z notice the time on this router

9
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:59.490
the log message is saying that the router was configured by the console but this router thinks it's

10
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.000
in the year 2030.

11
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:08.870
So it's done a bit of time travel the Shradha thinks that it's in the year 2002.

12
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.130
So it's stuck in the past.

13
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:19.390
I've got a router with the correct time in the UK but the wrong date the router thinks that it's based

14
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.540
in the future the throttle has the correct time currently in the UK.

15
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.440
This one doesn't.

16
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.680
This router however has the wrong date.

17
00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.260
And so does this router.

18
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.820
Now this becomes even more important when we are trying to troubleshoot an issue on the network.

19
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:50.770
In this example all the Nabl OSPF on Route 2 it's already enabled on the other routers in the network.

20
00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:04.270
So we can see that a relationship was formed in the year 2030 and according to this site a neighbor

21
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.800
relationship was formed in the year 2002.

22
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.100
It's going to be very difficult to troubleshoot any kind of issue taking place between the routers in

23
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:22.090
this network because the date and time is not synchronized on the roads.

24
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:29.670
Now you can manually configure time on the road as so I could use the clock command as an example and

25
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:37.420
set the time on the routers but that's not going to scale very well.

26
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.250
If I have many many roads and in addition clucks a drift.

27
00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:53.290
So we ideally want to ensure that all the clocks on all the devices are synchronized to an atomic clock

28
00:02:53.320 --> 00:03:01.930
some way the protocol used for synchronization of time is network time protocol or a.p at the moment

29
00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.790
defined type show a.p status on router 1.

30
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:13.870
We can see that a.p is not enabled a.p is not enabled by default on Cisco routers and switches you need

31
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.410
to configure the devices to talk to a time source.

32
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.110
Now in this example I don't have an atomic clock which I control my time from.

33
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.070
You can as an example get a.p from various servers on the Internet.

34
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.640
Here are some examples of anti-peace service available in the United Kingdom.

35
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:42.160
Just do a search in Google or your favorite search engine for various pieces available online for security

36
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:49.120
reasons you might prefer to get time from a local active directory server in your network rather than

37
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.740
directly off the Internet.

38
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:56.350
But in this network what we'll do is configurator three is a must to or what's called a stratum Rodda

39
00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.330
a.p has different levels.

40
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:09.640
The lower the number the closer you are to a atomic clock source serratus three you would use a command.

41
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.530
And I wouldn't do it right now because I want to set up some other values first that you specify a stratum

42
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.180
value for the router.

43
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.060
Once again the lower the number the closer you are to an atomic source.

44
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:33.310
A.p uses a hierarchy of straught DMs way a router or a device for stratum 3 would get its time from

45
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.430
a device with a lower number like one or two.

46
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:44.020
Time would then be pushed across the network to multiple devices from one level to another a.p is once

47
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:52.270
again used for clock synchronization between network devices or computer systems over a data network

48
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.490
such as the Internet or our little network in the example.

49
00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:04.990
It's been around for a long time so since the 1980s it uses UDP port or use a datagram protocol port

50
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:14.020
number 123 time can be sent using unicast broadcasts or multi costs.

51
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:21.400
He has a picture of a U.S. naval master clock which has a stream of zero.

52
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:29.450
In other words this is providing time to many of the devices using a whole Rockhill system stratum 0

53
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.020
devices provide.

54
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:38.300
Time to start them one which in turn provided to start them two three and so forth and so on stratum

55
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:46.820
0 devices of very high precision time devices that have atomic clocks GPS clocks or other radio clocks.

56
00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:54.740
They're known as reference clocks and a.p straught them one all synchronized to within a few microseconds

57
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.810
and teched to start them zero devices.

58
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:04.250
They're referred to as primary time servers and then time filters down to other devices.

59
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:11.060
So stratum two devices will carry stratum 1 and start them three will carry straught them to and that

60
00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.550
will continue up to the maximum of 15.
