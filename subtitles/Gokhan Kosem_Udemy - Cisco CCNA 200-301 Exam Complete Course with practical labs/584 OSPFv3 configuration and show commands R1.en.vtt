00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.010
These writers have just booted and don't have any configuration on them.

2
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.690
As an example here you can see that writer one is asking us to enter the initial configuration dialog

3
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.660
and I'm going to say no because I don't want to do that

4
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:30.900
this writer is a virtual IOW rod a running advanced Enterprise Services version 15 dot six so these

5
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.550
writers are essentially Iris v writers.

6
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:42.170
So first thing I'll do is configure a hostname note please that if I try and enable SPF

7
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.770
or rather SPF I'm told that my Peavey six writing is not enabled.

8
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.690
We need to do some initial configuration on these routers before we can enable SPF.

9
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:08.580
Version 3 and one of the obvious things we need to do is configure IP addresses so on the loop back

10
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.100
I'm going to configure an IP address like this.

11
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:30.280
And on gigabit 00 I'll configure an IP address as per the diagram such as this and no shut to the interface.

12
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.230
So do show IP not IP version 4 here.

13
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:41.160
Interface brief what you'll note shows that no IP addresses have been configured on this router.

14
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.750
In other words no IP version 4 addresses have been configured but show IP vs 6 interface brief shows

15
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:57.150
us that this interface gigabit 0 0 has this IP address as well as a link local IP address configured

16
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:07.620
and the same is true for the loop back address again IP vs 6 Rada or SPF of 1 shows us that IP vs 6

17
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:16.030
writing is not enabled on the router so the first thing we need to do is enable IP vs 6 unit cost routing.

18
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:26.280
Now we can configure a writing protocol and in this example we have EAI GOP network mobility or SPF

19
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:35.190
and rep but we'll configure the SPF with a process I.D. or SPF version 3 is once again very similar

20
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.780
to SPF version too.

21
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.970
So the process I.D. is a locally significant number on the broader note this message however is P.F.

22
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.470
version 3.

23
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.170
IP vs 6 could not pick a router I.D. Please configure it manually.

24
00:02:52.170 --> 00:03:00.750
So that's because we didn't configure an IP version for address so we now within the OS P.F. process

25
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:15.510
need to configure a router I.D. of a 32 but number so to show run pipe begin SPF.

26
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.810
This is the OSP version 3 configuration that we've done on the router

27
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.650
now at this point show IP vs 6 or SPF.

28
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:38.510
Interface brief shows that no interfaces have been added to the OSP version 3 process.

29
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:45.100
We need to go to each individual interface and type IP vs 6 0 SPF.

30
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.380
The process no in our example.

31
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.550
That's process idea 1.

32
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:58.080
We need to specify the area and the area that we're putting the interface into.

33
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:05.800
So in this example the loop back interface has been put into a SPF so the command show IP vs 6 0 SPF

34
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.670
interface brief.

35
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:13.030
Now shows us that the loop back interface has been added to the 0 SPF process.

36
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:23.460
Process ideas one area is 1 to form neighbor relationships with other routers and in this case write

37
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:33.570
a two will need to enable SPF on gigabit 0 0 on Route 1 So IP v 6 0 SPF process ideas one area that

38
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.290
will configure is 1.

39
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:45.320
So now show IP vs 6 0 SPF interface brief shows that both of those interfaces are added to a SPF.

40
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.100
A lot of the commands that you've used previously still apply here.

41
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.630
So show IP vs 6 protocols instead of show IP protocols.

42
00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:04.500
Shows us that we are running 0 SPF with this rather idea with these interfaces added to 0 SPF and a

43
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.370
single normal area.

44
00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.300
Other protocols also listed here like a neighbor discovery.

45
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.100
Show IP vs 6 0 SPF neighbor.

46
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.890
No neighbors at the moment show IP vs 6 round

47
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:32.010
so there's the command we have no 0 SPF rotten the running table because we haven't formed a neighbor

48
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:39.280
relationship with any other Rada show IP the 6 0 SPF.

49
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.970
Lot of options here but let's choose

50
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.590
database.

51
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:55.560
We have a very similar database output to what we have in 0 SPF version 2 or in other words IP version

52
00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.450
4.

53
00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:02.190
So as an example we have one router in the database at the moment.

54
00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:07.170
There are other LSA types which we won't talk about as part of the CCMA.

55
00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:17.900
But notice LSA type 8 is also listed in the database show IP vs 6 0 SPF enter so there's the command.

56
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:26.310
We're running a version 3 0 SPF process with number one router ideas 1.

57
00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:33.010
A lot of other information shown here including the areas configured in this case it's area 1 and 2

58
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.430
interfaces have been put into that area.

59
00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:43.880
The SPF algorithm has run once show IP vs 6 0 SPF interface instead of brief.

60
00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.770
So here's the command.

61
00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:50.520
And notice on the gigabit interface the link local addresses this.

62
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.680
It's a broadcast network type.

63
00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:56.640
In other words a election will take place.

64
00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:04.750
Route 1 is the designated router on this interface and it has this rudder I.D. which we configured manually.

65
00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:11.160
Notice that timers hollow timer is 10 seconds dead interval is 40 seconds.

66
00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.350
There is no backup designated rudder on this interface.

67
00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:21.930
So once again show IP vs 6 0 SPF neighbor shows us that there are no neighbor relationships formed on

68
00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:23.670
this network.

69
00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.950
So let's configure the other routers and form neighbor relationships and exchange rates between the

70
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:29.430
rudders.
