1
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.160
In this topology we have two routers and two pieces.

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.110
This is a newly configured topology.

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.740
The writers have just booted up and have no configuration.

4
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:23.280
So for example show IP interface brief on Route 1 shows that all interfaces are shut down and no IP

5
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.570
addresses are configured.

6
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.950
What I'll do is no shut interface serial to slash a zero.

7
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:39.070
The waiting to face on route one and I'll do something similar on brought it to write it to also has

8
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.720
no configuration so no shut

9
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:55.480
show IP interface brief as you can see the interfaces up on both sides

10
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:10.720
show interface serial to slash a zero but I'd like to point out is the encapsulation used which is HDL

11
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:19.890
LC by default on Cisco routers serial interfaces use HDL see as the encapsulation.

12
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.130
So what we could do is go into that interface and give the rod an IP address of say 10 to 1 or 2 to

13
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:37.210
1 and use a session 30 mosque or D something similar on a t IP address tended one to two to two

14
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:51.970
can write a 1 ping right to yes it can can write a 2 ping wrote a 1 yes it can show run interface serial

15
00:01:51.970 --> 00:02:01.000
to slash 0 all we had to do was no shut the interface we didn't have to configure an encapsulation we

16
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.130
didn't have to configure clock rate you only have to configure clock right if you're using a back to

17
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.720
back cable and your rudder is the DC side of the cable here.

18
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.790
Both sides of the DTV so we didn't have to configure a clock right.

19
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.520
Let's have a look at each DLC frames.

20
00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.290
So do why shock capture

21
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.250
on router ones serial interface

22
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.020
what we can see here is the protocol shown is slop

23
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.450
but notice we've got h see and then the Cisco slop protocol which is used for order configuration.

24
00:02:50.660 --> 00:03:01.180
Here we have a CTP message so Cisco HTC C is the encapsulation used at least to notice the protocol

25
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:09.410
is referenced as 2000 which is Cisco Discovery Protocol and we can see information about the device.

26
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:23.990
So rather 1 is a 37 25 and is using interface serial to slash 0 his Roddick to or so using serial interface

27
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.070
to slash 0

28
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.210
if we do a ping

29
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.970
we should see ICMP and there we go.

30
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.150
So ICMP

31
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.060
Adelaide to its once again HD you'll see.

32
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:53.970
So if we look at the actual frame the encapsulation type is HDR you'll see it's not Ethernet so on this

33
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.930
one interface we're using an HDL seeing caps relation.

34
00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:06.960
Notice the protocol reference is the famous x 0 x 800 which means IP version for at least three years

35
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.680
IP version 4.

36
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.030
You can see the source IP address and destination IP address in the packet

37
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.690
the protocol is ICMP you can see it's an echo.

38
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.520
He has the echo reply scrolling back to the top.

39
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.800
It's once again HD see there's the protocol type.

40
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.310
Source IP address is 10 1 1 2 going to 10 1 2 1.

41
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.470
And it's an echo.

42
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:36.360
Reply

43
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:48.270
So Cisco HD C or C HD LC has this protocol field denoting the Hialeah protocol.

44
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:59.950
That's IP vision for let's configure IP version 6 So IP vs 6 address 2001 colon colon 1 colon colon

45
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:09.060
one slash 64 on route to interface serial to slash zero IP vs 6 address.

46
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.260
2001 colon 1 colon colon 2 slash 64

47
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:33.440
ping 2001 colon 1 colon 2 ping succeeds in why shock capture we see the ICMP messages.

48
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.740
So this is the ping from Rada want to write it too.

49
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.850
Notice the protocol type 86 D.D..

50
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:48.130
It's a different protocol type to IP version for Cisco HDFC logic to run multiple Hialeah protocols

51
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.660
across the same link because of this protocol field.

52
00:05:52.840 --> 00:06:04.780
So once again there is IP version 6 and scrolling up here is IP version for and here is CTP all using

53
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.630
different protocol types.

54
00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:14.830
So the layer to encapsulation has referencing a higher layer protocol we would see something similar

55
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.110
on an Ethan at frame.

56
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:22.080
So on router 1 interface if 0 slash 0.

57
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:29.440
No shut IP address 10 1 1 1 2 4 5 2 4 5 2 4 5 0.

58
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:36.700
On the P.C. we'll give it an IP address of 10 to 1 2 1 but eleven with a mosque

59
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:51.400
and I'll set the gateway to 10 at 1 1 1 so paying tendered wandered wandered 1 P.S. camping wrote a

60
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.600
1 and if we started captcha on that interface.

61
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.660
So we're going to capture traffic on the road.

62
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:08.780
Notice the frame is Ethan a 2 let's send a ping again so there is ICMP packet.

63
00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:21.310
Notice the protocol type for IP vision for is 0 800 which is what we saw on the HTC frame so he has

64
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:22.180
HD you'll see.

65
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:30.330
Notice the protocol field so when you send packets across a to the shows you quite clearly that the

66
00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:37.380
layer to encapsulation changes but the high layer protocols are maintained or kept encapsulation used

67
00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:47.910
Chia is Ethan it to encapsulation used here is HTC encapsulation here would be Ethan to once again in

68
00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:55.840
this example so in order to interface if there is such zero no shut IP address tendered wondered.

69
00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:00.150
3 to 1 as an example.

70
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:11.260
P.S. 2 IP address tendered 1.0 three to twelve put the mosque in default gateway

71
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:25.160
paying 10 dot wonder to 3 to 1 that works only enable routing protocol here quickly to allow the writers

72
00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:32.770
to talk to each other and this will give us another protocol to capture in y shock

73
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:45.530
so enable a whisper from all interfaces started capture on this interface

74
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:54.210
so we have three wide shot captures going several interface face the seating at interface and the seats

75
00:08:54.210 --> 00:09:05.030
the net interface P.S. One should if SPF has converged be able to paying PCI to which it can.

76
00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:15.210
So the pings are succeeding let's have a look at the frame over here on the Internet segment so there's

77
00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:23.320
the frame you can see the Ethernet type is Ethernet to source MAC address destination MAC address which

78
00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:29.590
is the router protocol is IP vision for just to prove that that's a router

79
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:34.940
show interface zero slash 0

80
00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:42.170
notice the MAC address is c to a 1

81
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:56.860
3 f 8 0 0 0 0 which is correct so the P.C. sending the traffic to the local Rada using ethernet to.

82
00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:06.840
In other words Ethernet encapsulation at least 3 the source and destination on the TPC is on the HDL

83
00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.390
C capture

84
00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:20.470
there's the same IP addresses of the pieces at layer 3 but notice at layer two the encapsulation is

85
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:29.560
HDL C and there are no mac addresses MAC addresses are only used on Ethernet they're not used in HDL

86
00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:37.210
C HDL C links are point to point there's no need to have mac addresses anything that you send out of

87
00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:43.810
this interface is going to arrive on this interface and vice versa with Ethernet allows multiple devices

88
00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:53.480
to connect to the same segment so there's no need to have mac addresses in H2 you'll see it simply references

89
00:10:53.480 --> 00:11:03.660
the highlight of protocol and specifies that this is a unique cost packet What about on the side.

90
00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:09.620
So here's the ping source and destination IP addresses of the same.

91
00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:17.090
Notice however that it's Ethernet once again so Ethan at 2 in this case the source MAC address is Rod

92
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:33.480
to show interface fast ethernet zero slash a zero notice the MAC address C 2 0 2 3 F A 8 for zeros that's

93
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:42.090
the router talking to the P.C. in this case P.S. to the Ethernet type field specifies IP version for

94
00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:49.380
as the highlight protocol and he has IP packet and here's the ICMP information

95
00:11:52.660 --> 00:12:01.410
the encapsulation changes on every link MAC addresses are used on the Ethernet segments MAC addresses

96
00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:03.680
are not used in HD see.
