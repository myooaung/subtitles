00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:15.260
This is one of multiple videos discussing the troubleshooting of Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

2
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.320
or DHP in this typology.

3
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.850
I've got a U.S. visa router acting as a PC and in Iowa.

4
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.130
Virata acting as a DHP server.

5
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:34.140
I've also got a router that's simply doing routing from one subnet in the network to another.

6
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.220
We've been told that after the DHB client in the apology he's not receiving an IP address and we need

7
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.990
to troubleshoot the issue.

8
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:53.250
So let's look at what's going on what Casey has the client show IP interface brief the client is configured

9
00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:02.860
for DHP so gigabit 00 the interface used by the broader to connect to the network is currently up up.

10
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:09.740
In other words a layer 1 and layer two are working but no IP addresses assigned show run interface gigabit

11
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.610
00 shows us that the interface is configured for DHP.

12
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.680
But once again we are not getting an address assigned.

13
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:27.070
Let's have a look at it too which is doing interval and writing show IP interface brief we can see that

14
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.380
an IP address is configured on gigabit 00 as well as gigabit 0 1.

15
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.860
Let's have a look at the DHB server.

16
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.610
Show IP interface brief.

17
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.190
This is the IP address of the DHP server.

18
00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.590
Can the router paying the DHP server.

19
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:45.750
Yes it can.

20
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:53.520
So we can ping from the router to the DHP server show run interface but 00.

21
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.500
Notice this command IP help address.

22
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:04.690
So that looks that help address is configured to point to the DHP server Let's run a one shot capture

23
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.820
here to see if any DHP messages are being sent to the DHP server.

24
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.890
So I'm capturing on this link.

25
00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:24.510
What I'll do is shut and no shut the interface on the client to get it to request an IP address from

26
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:33.090
the DHP server that will allow us to see whether the DHP requests are getting to the DHP server.

27
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.180
So NY shock we're seeing a number of DHP messages of full to boot.

28
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:48.530
P we can see that the router is requesting an IP address on behalf of the client so he has the bootstrap

29
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:58.490
protocol discover a message client IP address is not configured the relay agent is routed to a show

30
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:08.120
IP interface brief the Rodda is receiving a DHP discover from the client on this interface and is then

31
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.740
forwarding that to the DHP server.

32
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.570
So we definitely getting DHP discover messages on this link.

33
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.620
Let's do a debug on the DHP service debug IP DHP server.

34
00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.840
And let's look at events

35
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.440
force the client to request an address again

36
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.800
OK so something's happening.

37
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.990
Let's stop debugging.

38
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.340
So we're getting a Discover from the client.

39
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.780
So it's definitely being received by the DHP server.

40
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.380
The server is receiving the Discover message but can you see what's wrong in the output.

41
00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.460
What's the problem.

42
00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.570
Let me give you another hint.

43
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.750
Show IP DHC P pool.

44
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.600
What's the problem.

45
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:13.430
Can you see the issue in the de-bunk and in the show command OK.

46
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.060
Notice this output we are told that the pool is empty.

47
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.580
Notice this is a problem with the addresses are located

48
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.790
the server is definitely receiving messages.

49
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.080
So we were receiving discovery messages.

50
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.310
There's one address pool available.

51
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.760
OK see if you can see the problem in the running can fake the Rodda.

52
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.350
What's the issue here.

53
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:52.650
That's IP DHP excluded address 10 1 1 1 to 10 1 1 255.

54
00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.490
We've excluded all the addresses from the DHP pool.

55
00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.890
So no IP addresses can be allocated to the client.

56
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:09.830
Show IP DHC pool we have a pool in this range but no addresses are available because we've excluded

57
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:15.220
them so let's remove the statement

58
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:29.390
and use the on IPD HGP excluded address 10 1 1 1 2 let's say 10 1 100 show run

59
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:40.870
extruded addresses are now in this range for the pool notice on the client an address is an assigned

60
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.360
address 101.

61
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:52.410
So show IP interface brief the client has been allocated an IP address and should hopefully at this

62
00:05:52.410 --> 00:06:00.000
point be able to ping the DHP server which it can be careful with the excluded addresses in the pool.

63
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.670
So show IP DHB P binding.

64
00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:11.050
We now have an address allocated to the client of IP DHP pool.

65
00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:22.200
One address is now least next address to allocate is 10 1 1 1 0 2 noticed previously that the current

66
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.150
index was set to 0.0 0.0.

67
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.840
In other words no addresses would be allocated to clients.

68
00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.780
But now the next address that will be allocated is 10 to 1 to 1 2 1 2 2.

69
00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:42.480
So if I change the MAC address on this client to something

70
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:51.850
like this and then shut the interface down and then no shut it.

71
00:06:52.070 --> 00:07:00.270
What we should see is that the index changes and there you go because the client has been allocated

72
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.670
at this address.

73
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.990
So the next available address is this one.

74
00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.270
So that was an example of how to troubleshoot DHP.

75
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:15.250
I hope you found the video useful if you did please like it please or since I've cried to my YouTube

76
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:15.950
channel.

77
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:17.800
I wish you all the very best.
