00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:27.710
In this lab you've been asked to configure DCP on right of one in this topology we have right of one

2
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.050
connected to switch one using gigabit zero slash or zero slash zero.

3
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:41.970
And this interface is configured in VLAN 1 P.S. 1 is configured in VLAN 10 and it's connected to this

4
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.550
interface on the switch.

5
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.790
P.S. 2 is in VLAN 20 and is connected to gigabit 1 0 3 on the switch.

6
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:58.440
You need to configure DCP on the router and exclude the first 10 IP addresses in each subnet from the

7
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:09.810
pool so exclude IP addresses tend not one to tendered one up to 10 dot 1 to 10 top 10 from poor with

8
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:17.400
the name VLAN 10 and addresses tendered one to 20 dot one up to 10 dot 1 between the top 10 from the

9
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.600
DHB pool reveal and 20.

10
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:29.370
So we need to create 2 DHB pools v lantern and V land 20 and exclude the first 10 IP addresses from

11
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:36.510
each of those pools the networks to use again are tendered wonder tendered 0 slash 24 and tendered one

12
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.930
to 22 etc slash 24.

13
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:45.570
The default gateways of these pieces should be set to switch 1 the DNS servers should be set to write

14
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:54.480
a 1 and we need to ensure that the pieces get IP addresses via DCP and are able to ping each other as

15
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.450
well as the loop back of right of one.

16
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.520
Are you able to complete this task.

17
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.230
There are a number of things that you need to configure here in addition to the DCP pool.

18
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:14.140
Are you up to completing this challenge download the attached packet trace a file and see if you can

19
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.990
do it yourself or otherwise watch the next video where I complete the slab.
