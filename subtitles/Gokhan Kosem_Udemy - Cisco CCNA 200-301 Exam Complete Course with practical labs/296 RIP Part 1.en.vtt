00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In this module, we're going to discuss the Routing Information Protocol or RIP

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
RIP is an example of a dynamic routing protocol

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.000
multiple routing protocols exist including EIGRP, OSPF, IS-IS, BGP

4
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
but in this module, we're going to focus on RIP.

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
RIP is one of the oldest routing protocols and is one of the simplest protocols

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
it does, however, have some major throwbacks

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
when compared to routing protocols such as EIGRP and OSPF

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
however, RIP is popular in small businesses

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
so if you work in SMB environments you may come across RIP

10
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
some limitations of RIP include that it determines the best path based on hop count.

11
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
EIGRP and OSPF are more powerful routing protocols

12
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and that they can use bandwidth as part of their routing calculation

13
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
RIP, however, simply uses a hop count to determine the best path to a destination.

14
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
RIP is also limited to 15 hops

15
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and allows load balancing of up to 4 equal cost paths by default.

16
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So in summary, RIP uses hop count to select the best path

17
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
allows for load balancing across equal paths

18
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
4 is the default but you can change that

19
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
it does not take bandwidth load or other metrics into account

20
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
when determining the best path, it simply looks at hop count.

21
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
RIP is an example of a distance vector routing protocol

22
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
please refer to the routing introductory videos

23
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
for a greater explanation of distance vector

24
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
versus advanced distance vector versus links state routing protocols.

25
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
One of the advantages of RIP. however. is that itâ€™s very easy to configure

26
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and in a small environment, you don't necessarily need

27
00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
the scale and power of EIGRP as a routing protocol.

28
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
RIP is often good enough in small businesses.
