00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.070
This is one of multiple SPF troubleshooting videos.

2
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:21.690
In this scenario we've been told that rider 1 is not able to pain brought a full let's test that Ken

3
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:31.920
wrote a paying the loot back brought a full answer is no show IP wrote We are receiving who is France.

4
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:38.320
So we are receiving a raft for the looped back of routed to we are receiving a raft for Network 10 1

5
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.370
2 0.

6
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:46.320
But we are not receiving other runs show IP or SPF neighbor confirms that we have a neighbour relationship

7
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:55.290
to brought it to so as an example we can ping the loop back of right to disable IP domain lookup to

8
00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:06.700
make trace raft complete quicker and let us see if we can trace to Rob for the trace in this example

9
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:14.390
will not leave the local Rada because we don't have a gateway of last resort and we don't have a specific

10
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.380
brought to quadruple full.

11
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.150
So the traces simply dropped at the local Rada.

12
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.250
Now what about trotted to show IP a whisper from neighbor rather to his neighbour relationship to RADA

13
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:35.120
a one but doesn't have a neighbour relationship to RADA a three can run it to ping router three.

14
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.550
Yes it can.

15
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.540
So it doesn't look like it's an IP connectivity problem.

16
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.400
It looks like it's something else Ken wrote a three ping right to yes it can show IP of SPF neighbor

17
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.510
rather three has a neighbour relationship to write a for but not to write it too so we definitely have

18
00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:06.420
a problem between wrote a tune a three so in it to show IP or SPF interface brief or SPF is enabled

19
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:16.880
on gigabit to 00 and gigabit 0 1 shows GDP neighbours shows us that rather a three is connected to gigabit

20
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:28.370
to 0 1 so SPF is enabled on that interface the local Rod is a designated Rata back on not a 3 show IP

21
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:38.800
SPF interface brief SPF is enabled on gigabit 00 and gigabit 0 1 we can see that crowd too is connected

22
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:48.150
to gigabit 0 1 so 0 SPF is enabled on this interface and the local Rada believes that it's the designated

23
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:58.370
Rada so we have to Rodders on the same segment thinking that they are the designated roads let's have

24
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:07.390
a look at the interface without brief so show IPO SPF interface gigabits 0 1 we can see the IP address

25
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.440
of the router.

26
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.500
The area is area zero router ideas this network top is broadcast.

27
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.340
Cost is 1.

28
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.620
There's no backup designated rudder on the segment.

29
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.960
We can see the hollow and other timers we can see a lot of other information here.

30
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.090
What about on this side.

31
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.770
So show IP SPF interface gigabit 0 1.

32
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.080
Can you spot the problem.

33
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:42.970
What's the problem between Roddick to and wrote a three here's a two.

34
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.860
He has wrought three.

35
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.540
What's the problem OK.

36
00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.950
Look at the timer's 4 0 SPF to form neighbor relationships.

37
00:03:51.980 --> 00:04:00.270
The timers must be the same the hollow timer on Ryder 3 is 30 seconds whereas it's 10 seconds on right

38
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.370
to dead interval on the side is 40 the side at 220.

39
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:13.410
Wait is 40 hundred and twenty reruns but it's five and five also have a look at the network type.

40
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.670
That's a broadcast.

41
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:21.550
This is a non broadcast if you want SPF routers to form a neighbor relationship.

42
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.050
The time is need to be the same.

43
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:34.200
Timers can be influenced by the network command Ethernet is a broadcast multi access environment not

44
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:42.310
a non broadcast environment that would be used for frame relay as an example.

45
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:51.900
So we need to set the 0 SPF network type to broadcast and notice as soon as I've done that neighbor

46
00:04:51.910 --> 00:05:00.560
relationships are formed if you look at the time is noticed the timers here are now the same

47
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.840
as Roger two.

48
00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.270
Time is a set the same show IP of SPF neighbors.

49
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:18.590
We have two neighbor relationships set back on right of one is rather one able to trace two could ripple

50
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:19.060
for.

51
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:20.490
Yes it is.

52
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.550
That looks a lot better.

53
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.070
So we can ping could ripple for as an example.

54
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.700
That was an SPF troubleshooting scenario.

55
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.470
Make sure that your time is all the same.

56
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:42.600
Check your network times no SPF it's important that the 0 SPF and network types be the same for CCMA.

57
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:48.530
There are some weird and wonderful implementations that you can have with over SPF but that's not important

58
00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.530
for CCMA check your network types.

59
00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.970
Check your timers ensure that they the same between Rodders.

60
00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.370
