00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:07.980
IP version 6 access lists in a similar way to IP version for access lists are applied to interfaces

2
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.470
either in an inbound or outbound direction.

3
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:20.100
You could apply a IP version 6 access list to a routing interface such as gigabit 00 or Serial 1 slash

4
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:29.210
0 but they can also be applied to switched virtual interfaces on a switch such as interface v land too.

5
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:36.510
Also remember that because of ships in the night IP version for an IP version 6 are independent of each

6
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.290
other.

7
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:45.540
So you could have both an IP version for inbound and outbound access list as well as an IP version 6

8
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.820
inbound and outbound access list on the same interface.

9
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:57.120
The IP version 4 access lists have no effect on IP version 6 packets and IP version 6 access lists have

10
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.990
no effect on IP version 4 packets in the same way as IP version 4 in IP version 6.

11
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:11.790
It makes sense to apply access lists on ingress rather than a grace interfaces to provide more security.

12
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:20.520
So on an Internet facing router you want an inbound access list denying traffic to the network and to

13
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.580
the router rather than an egg press interface where the writer is exposed to the Internet.

14
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:35.030
So rather deny before processing if required instead of processing packets and then dropping them.

15
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.910
It's less secure to use an outbound access list on a perimeter Rodders internal interface rather put

16
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:49.190
it on the external interface and block traffic before it's processed by the writers writing table when

17
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.510
traffic is leaving the internal or trusted network to go onto the Internet.

18
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.120
Apply it on the outbound interface.

19
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:04.940
So on Internet facing interface on a router traffic that arise from the Internet is processed ingress

20
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:12.950
or inbound traffic leaving the internal network to go to the Internet is processed outbound on that

21
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.280
Internet facing interface as always with access lists.

22
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:24.770
The hard part is determining how to filter traffic same applies to IP version for an IP version 6.

23
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:32.380
What are you going to permit and what are you going to deny generally you want to permit only certain

24
00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.730
protocols or certain applications and block everything else.

25
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:43.150
So in other words anything that is not permitted will be blocked and that's why by default on Cisco

26
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:51.610
devices there's a deny any any at the end of an access list so for both IP version 4 and IP version

27
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.570
6 there's an implied deny any any.

28
00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:03.190
So for IP version 6 we have deny IP vs 6 any any as the lost rule in an access list.

29
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.290
So unless you explicitly permit something it's going to be denied.

30
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:15.560
Now you can't simply copy your IP version for access lists and apply them to IP version 6 because you

31
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.830
have different protocols and you perhaps have different requirements for IP version 6 versus IP version

32
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:22.830
4.

33
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:30.920
It makes more sense to start with a brand new IP version 6 policy and only permit specific IP version

34
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:37.310
6 protocols rather than trying to copy your IP version for access list.

35
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:44.930
So you need to decide which IP version 6 packets and protocols are permitted into your network and which

36
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.810
protocols and packets are permitted out of your network.
