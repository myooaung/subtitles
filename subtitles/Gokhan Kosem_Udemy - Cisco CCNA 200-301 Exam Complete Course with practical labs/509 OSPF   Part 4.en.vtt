00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:10.330
The BTR will become the D.R. if the D.R. fails designated riders are chosen on a per segment basis.

2
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:17.750
So in this example on this Ethernet segment or two may be chosen as the designated Rada.

3
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:26.670
But on this segment between our for and our 7 of 4 may be chosen as the designated Rada on a per physical

4
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.200
segment basis a designated route is chosen.

5
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.790
So just because our fall is not a designated road on this segment does not mean that our 4 is not a

6
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.720
designated route on the segment every Ethan its segment requires the election and maintenance of a designated

7
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.800
Rada.

8
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.550
So from an update point of view if this link goes down or one is updating its designate Harada using

9
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:59.340
this multicast address 2 2 4 0 0 6 or 2 the designated Rada updates all of its neighbors on that segment

10
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.780
so are 3 or 6 or 5 and are 4.

11
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:11.910
Get the update about the change of 4 then floods that update to our 7 or 7 well then flood the update

12
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.060
to any neighbors that it may have not shown in this diagram.

13
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.780
The same with our 5 or 6 or 3 and so forth.

14
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.910
The update will be flooded out the topology just as in this example where all four received the update

15
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:32.310
from or two and then sends it to our 7 so just to sum up designated Rod is or D elected firstly based

16
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.140
on the highest priority.

17
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.220
The range is from 0 to 255.

18
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:46.740
The default value is 1 0 disables the ability for this rata to become a designated Rada or backup designated

19
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.120
wrote it.

20
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.840
If the properties are the same the Rada with the highest Rada I.D. will become the designated Rada.

21
00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:01.180
It's important to realize that pre-emption doesn't exist with designated as so in this example it's

22
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.240
a priority of wrote it to a set to 10 and the priority of Rada 5 was set to 5 and then the election

23
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.230
took place or two would become the designated Rada however.

24
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.600
However two went down four out of five would become the designated Rada.

25
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.490
And for instance or three would become the backup designated Rada.

26
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.820
Let's assume that the priorities of the other parties are set to 1 but rather 3 has the highest Rada

27
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:34.870
I.D. So Rada 3 becomes the designated Rada when R2 comes back again.

28
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.550
It will not become a designated Rada or backup designated Rada.

29
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.260
In other words it's not preemptive.

30
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.080
Because our 5 is already the designated Rada and all 3 is the backup designated Rada or two will just

31
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:56.280
accept that fact and will become known as a D or other or draw the depending which term you prefer.

32
00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.060
It will not try and pre-empt another election and try and become the designated Rada.

33
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:09.420
All other parties including our two will become D or others in a topology like this let's talk about

34
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:16.030
the shortest Baathist algorithm or SPF algorithm the SPF algorithm places each right at the root of

35
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:23.710
the tree and calculates the shortest path to each node using the Dykstra algorithm based on the cumulative

36
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.230
cost that is required to reach that destination.

37
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.310
So as an example a four out of one wants to get to a network behind rather two.

38
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.050
It's going to determine the best route based on the cost which uses a formula.

39
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.570
Tend to the eight divided by bandwidth.

40
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:46.150
So as an example this is a T1 link no one wants to send traffic throughout it too will it take this

41
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.610
T1 link or will it use the port via rod or three using a 10 meg and 10 make link.

42
00:03:52.630 --> 00:04:00.840
Now rip using hub count within the traffic directly to R2 but what would always be 50 OSB if by default

43
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.770
uses a reference bandwidth of 10 to the 8.

44
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:10.080
You can change this and you need to when you've got gig and 10 gig links of SPF has been around for

45
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.700
many years and in the early days there were no speeds such as gig 10 gig and so forth.

46
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.970
So today if you've got gig and 10 gig links you're going to want to change this reference bandwidth.

47
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.090
But for now let's assume that we're using the default.

48
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:30.280
So the cost of a link is tend to the eight divided by the bandwidth in bits per second a one kilohertz

49
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:37.750
per second equals 1000 bits per second one megabits per second is one million bits per second 10 megabits

50
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.310
per second is 10 million beats per second.

51
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:47.410
So the cost of a 10 megabits per second link is tend to the eight divided by 10 million which gives

52
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.850
you a cost of 10 using the same formula for a T1 link.

53
00:04:51.850 --> 00:05:00.430
So for this link between r 1 and RTD the cost extend to the 8 divided by 1 5 4 4 triple 0 which gives

54
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.020
you a cost of four.

55
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:10.390
So the cost using this link would be sixty for the cost if the traffic was sent via R2 would be as follows

56
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:18.470
tend to the 8 to about 10 million which is 10 but they are two lengths of 10 meg.

57
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.700
So the total cost is 20.

58
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.660
So the cost via the T1 is 64.

59
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:30.910
But the cost via the 10 meg links is 20 so 0 SPF is going to choose the link via R2 to send traffic

60
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:38.710
to all three because the cost is lower based on this formula tend to the 8 divided by bandwidth.

61
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:44.190
So the default formula used for costing is tend to the eight divided by bandwidth.

62
00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:50.080
Now you can change the reference bandwidth by using this command within the OSP if process order cost

63
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.810
reference bandwidth and then specifying a value in megabits per second.

64
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:56.190
The default is 100.

65
00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.690
In other words the reference bandwidth is 100 megabits per second 100 megabits per second has a cost

66
00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.710
an SPF of 1.

67
00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:09.520
If you change this to a thousand as an example a gigabit link would be seen as the reference bandwidth

68
00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:16.060
or if you change it to one hundred thousand one hundred gig link would be used as a reference bandwidth.

69
00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.960
You need to do this command on all routers where you have interfaces with bandwidth.

70
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.130
Greater than just Ethernet.

71
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.590
You can also change the cost on an interface.

72
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:32.890
So rather than 0 SPF calculating the cost of the link based on the bandwidth you can set the OSP off

73
00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:38.560
cost by tapping the command IP SPF cost and then specifying a value.

74
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:44.980
It's very important that the bandwidth statements on your radar interfaces be configured correctly because

75
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.550
that's what OSP deems the speed of the link to be.

76
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.870
The GOP does the same thing.

77
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:56.710
It uses bandwidth as part of the calculation when working out the shortest route to the destination.
