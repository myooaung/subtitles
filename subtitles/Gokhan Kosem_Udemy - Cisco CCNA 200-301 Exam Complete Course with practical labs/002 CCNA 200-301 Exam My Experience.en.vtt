00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.340
In this video I'm going to discuss my experiences taking the new Cisco CCN exam.

2
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.490
I took the exam on the day that it was released by Cisco and then published my thoughts to YouTube.

3
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.330
But I'm going to add that video to this course so that you also have that information.

4
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.300
I'll also give you some updates.

5
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.090
One of the questions that I've often been asked is how many questions are there in the exam.

6
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:35.260
And before we continue please note I have to be careful because of the Cisco NDA or non-disclosure agreement.

7
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.950
I'd love to tell you a lot more information about the exam but I have to be really careful because of

8
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:40.780
the NDA.

9
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:41.810
I will say this.

10
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.200
There are over 100 questions in the exam.

11
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.240
In other words there are many more questions than the previous release of the CCMA exam.

12
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.870
You have 120 minutes.

13
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.180
In other words you get about a minute per question.

14
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.800
You have to be really careful with your time management.

15
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.420
There are some other surprises in the exam with regards to simulations.

16
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.930
So I can't say too much but please note that there are differences compared to the previous version

17
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.270
of the exam.

18
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.640
I personally thought that the exam was easier.

19
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.940
It covered a breadth of topics but wasn't as difficult as the previous releases of CCMA.

20
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.330
Firstly because it doesn't cover as many topics and also because of the exam question types that in

21
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.950
the exam but I have to be careful saying more than that.

22
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.080
But let me tell you you still have to be well-prepared for the exam new topics such as wireless.

23
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.810
There's a greater emphasis on security and network automation of new topics that you need to make sure

24
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.010
that you understand and learn about.

25
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.770
We'll be covering those topics in this course.

26
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.500
So you'll have that information.

27
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.620
I've also added the blueprint or list of topics to the course.

28
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.800
So download that.

29
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.230
I highly recommend that you go through that before you take your exam.

30
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.580
This course will cover all the topics in the blueprint but it's well worth your time making sure that

31
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.720
before you take the exam that you understand all the topics on the outline or blueprint.

32
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.360
Okay.

33
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.290
So I'm going to cut to this video.

34
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.410
Hopefully it helps you.

35
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.650
I'm David Bumble and I've just passed the new Cisco CCN exam 200 dash THREE OR 1.

36
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.000
And in this video I'm going to give you some tips and tricks to help you in your preparation for the

37
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.450
new Cisco CCN 200 dash 3 or 1 exam.

38
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.370
Today I took both the Cisco CCMA as well as the Cisco definite exam.

39
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.130
Fortunately I passed both of them so really happy about that.

40
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.930
Some surprises however in this new exam.

41
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.590
Some stuff that I thought was really good.

42
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.410
Some stuff that I thought was strange some unexpected stuff.

43
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.150
I'll talk about that in this video so keep watching.

44
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.480
If you want to learn more about my experience taking the new Cisco CCMA exam

45
00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.830
now before we continue.

46
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.040

Let other people know about my experience of the Cisco CCMA exam.

50
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.710
Hopefully this will be of benefit to you and others hopefully you'll learn something.

51
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.050
Okay so let's get started.

52
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.450
Let me state this right in the beginning.

53
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.590
I felt that the exam was very balanced.

54
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.940
Covered a whole range of topics I think is a version one exam they call a CTA exam version one.

55
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.130
I thought it was a good exam.

56
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.750
However there were things that surprised me.

57
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:45.550
Things that I didn't expect to see in the exam but on the whole I thought it was a good exam.

58
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.140
I write a lot of quiz questions.

59
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:53.020
I've written exam questions for vendors before it's very difficult to write good exam questions.

60
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.880
It's much easier to answer any question than it is to write a question.

61
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.210
It's much easier to criticize a question than it is to create a question.

62
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:09.310
So I thought they did a great job a whole balance of various topics covered a wide range of topics in

63
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:16.910
their list of of topics that you need to know but some hints would be concentrate on the new stuff spent

64
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.490
time on the new stuff.

65
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:22.870
Don't get bogged down in trying to memorize huge amounts of commands.

66
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.850
So first step is learn the new stuff especially like wireless.

67
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:28.960
Make sure you understand wireless.

68
00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.840
Make sure that you understand security topics.

69
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.730
Now another tip.

70
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.800
What do you need to prepare.

71
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.970
Is packet Tracy enough and I would say definitely spend time using Packet Tracer.

72
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:39.780
So do you need.

73
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.670
Genius 3 Do you need viral.

74
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:43.720
Do you need even.

75
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.160
Do you need physical equipment.

76
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.420
I like those products.

77
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.820
I like the new viral.

78
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.860
I'll be creating a video on the new viral very soon.

79
00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.650
I've already got access to viral 2.0.

80
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:53.860
Great product.

81
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.180
I love genius 3 love even.

82
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.860
Those products are great.

83
00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.290
I really think you should use those products for CCP positions.

84
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.570
However I think packet traces enough if you can get access to physical equipment that always helps.

85
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:13.930
If you can get access to genie 3 or viral that's great as well because it'll have options that you won't

86
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:14.980
see and packet tracer.

87
00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.360
Okay so I think packet traces enough.

88
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.850
I don't think you need to invest in buying hardware even though I think it's recommended.

89
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.580
It's not a requirement.

90
00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.610
I don't think you have to buy viral.

91
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.800
However again I would suggest that you do that as soon as you can because packet Trace is great but

92
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.230
it's at this level and then viral genius 3 even G and physical equipment is at this level.

93
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.910
So if you want to really increase your knowledge if you really wanna increase your understanding I'd

94
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:48.670
recommend that you get those products but it's not required for the CCMA exam for my CS in a course

95
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.680
I'm going to concentrate exclusively on Packet Tracer labs.

96
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.720
So in the past I used to use junior 3 labs but a lot of people struggled with those labs.

97
00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.470
It's quite difficult to set up especially if you're new to Cisco so I'd recommend Packet Tracer.

98
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.950
Easy to setup official product from Cisco.

99
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:11.800
Brilliant simulation software allows you to simulate many many topics specifically for the CCMA.

100
00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:16.450
I would highly recommend Cisco packet tracer and that's what I'm going to base my course on.

101
00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:24.100
Now one of the best places to look if you preparing for a Cisco exam is the Cisco outline or Cisco details

102
00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:25.760
of the Exam.

103
00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.690
Exam is 120 minutes 200 dash 3 or 1.

104
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.310
This kind of stuff you know ready.

105
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:37.540
One of the first things I would do if I were you is have a look at the exam topics and I've downloaded

106
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:41.360
the exam topics here and this is where it got interesting.

107
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.400
Okay so let's start with one topic straight away EAI GOP.

108
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:55.870
There is no easy GOP and no V.P. now when preparing for the exam I highly recommend Wendell Odom's official

109
00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:56.550
cert guides.

110
00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:02.730
I strongly suggest that you buy these guides and you use them lots of good information in here.

111
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:08.440
I spent a bit of time going through these and I might have missed some stuff but even then I was quite

112
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.820
surprised by a few things.

113
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:19.170
Okay so in Wendell Odom's official cert guide he does mention EAI GOP in multiple places such as when

114
00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:24.590
you discuss metrics so I purchase both the physical books as well as the PDA.

115
00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:25.860
I like having both.

116
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:31.980
So in this example I'm looking at the PDA version so that I can share it much more easily in this video.

117
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:33.540
Notice he's got this table here.

118
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:37.060
He talks about the different types of writing calculations.

119
00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.570
Your job he calculates based on bandwidth and delay.

120
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:46.510
So even though my job he is not in the list of topics for the exam he actually covers it in the official

121
00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:47.780
said Guy.

122
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:53.860
So on the left I'm doing searches for my GOP and what you'll notice is there's a whole bunch of entries

123
00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:58.030
for each GOP such as administrative distance.

124
00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:02.200
Now it's difficult to understand administrative distance if the only writing protocol you're going to

125
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.220
talk about is oh SPF.

126
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:08.560
Here we have a table of the administer of distances for various writing protocols.

127
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:15.160
Notice we have both BGP and EAI GOP as well as ISIS.

128
00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:21.700
So don't just learn o SPF in isolation and just say I'm going to learn o SPF and ignore yay GOP ignore

129
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.770
BGP ignore ISIS.

130
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.530
Make sure that you understand administrative distances.

131
00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:32.980
Make sure that you understand that if ISIS advertises a right to you or SPF advertises the right to

132
00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:38.350
you and each GOP advertises the right to you and BGP advertises the right to you that you know which

133
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:41.110
route is going to be selected and why now.

134
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:45.970
I've previously created videos about this I've created quiz questions about this.

135
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:47.350
Have a look at this video.

136
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:56.170
An example where I explain why for instance o SPF is chosen b over EAI GOP or why rep is chosen over

137
00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.440
the GOP or over a SPF.

138
00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:03.790
When choosing the best route make sure that you know routes elections.

139
00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:09.020
You really need to understand the stuff for the CCMA exam so make sure that you know a D.

140
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:11.220
Don't just say I don't need to learn.

141
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:12.760
GOP.

142
00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:20.420
Make sure you understand it again while talking about the GOP I mentioned V.P. so doing a search for

143
00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.890
V.P..

144
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:26.540
There's a whole section here talking about veal and trucking protocol and he says before showing more

145
00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:33.260
configuration examples you need to know something about a Cisco protocol called V.P. and he discusses

146
00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.070
a whole bunch of stuff including V.P. mode.

147
00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:41.310
Transparent so it's not as if you can just ignore the DP.

148
00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:50.990
He discusses it in multiple places in his student guide and he says this book does not discuss V.P.

149
00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.960
as an end to itself for different reasons.

150
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:56.370
He says it's not currently in the blueprint.

151
00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.170
And additionally many enterprises choose to disable VTB.

152
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:02.830
However it still has an effect.

153
00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:10.310
My personal opinion is that I won't remove ETP from my new Cisco CCN course I'll reduce the amount of

154
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:15.470
information about it and reduce sort of some of the troubleshooting scenarios stuff like that.

155
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:21.610
But in my new course I will definitely cover VTB going back to the Cisco exam topics.

156
00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.590
Make sure that you know the new stuff.

157
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:27.960
Make sure that you spend time learning the new things.

158
00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:35.000
As an example make sure you know about controllers make sure that you know about Cisco DNA center and

159
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.040
wireless LAN controllers but also don't forget about traditional stuff like what's the difference between

160
00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.610
TTP and UDP.

161
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:45.340
What's the difference between other protocols so like HP versus DNS.

162
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:47.690
Do you actually understand how those protocols work.

163
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:49.480
Do you know what they're about.

164
00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:52.730
I mean all this stuff is covered in the outline.

165
00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:55.820
So I found that the exam covered a broad range of topics.

166
00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:59.530
I was surprised by some of the topics that are still asked in the exam.

167
00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:06.830
But when it comes to addressing and I missing it right now is submitting make sure that you know your

168
00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:07.380
subnet.

169
00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:16.910
If I give you an IP address and I say here's an IP address 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 30 slash 28.

170
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:22.670
Make sure that you know network first host Last Host and Broadcast address.

171
00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:25.720
Make sure that you know that information.

172
00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:33.960
Make sure that you know if you were given a writing table or a subheading diagram that you'd know where

173
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.910
devices on the network use tables.

174
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:43.850
I'm not a big fan of tables but I will be creating videos and publishing them on YouTube as well as

175
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:47.990
my course worth submitting tables to help you do the stuff quickly.

176
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:53.780
You've got to be able to look at a writing table you've got to be able to look at a network diagram

177
00:11:53.900 --> 00:12:01.140
you've got to be able to know where a host is so something is always important and it's still important.

178
00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:03.080
Big topics Wi-Fi.

179
00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:08.140
Make sure that you know Wi-Fi topics such as encryption.

180
00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:11.160
So what encryption protocols are used on wireless.

181
00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:16.260
Make sure that you understand the theory of wireless but make sure that you also understand how to configure

182
00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.600
stuff through the wireless LAN controller.

183
00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:22.860
Don't skip that section new section in the exam.

184
00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:27.870
Make sure that you spend time on wireless and topics such as virtualization as an example.

185
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:32.580
I mean that's not pure writing in switching but we've got this convergence of technologies so you need

186
00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.010
to understand virtualization as well.

187
00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:38.650
Traditional topics such as quality of service are also important.

188
00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:40.160
My exam was very balanced.

189
00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:45.920
A lot of topics from a whole range of areas for example routing.

190
00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.280
Do you understand how writing works.

191
00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:52.700
Do you understand a floating static ride vs. a raft such as default right.

192
00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.790
Or or a raft that was added by a writing protocol.

193
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:57.650
Do you understand.

194
00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:03.830
Oh SPF because SPF is the only main protocol in the CDC.

195
00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:07.390
Make sure that you understand who SPF really really well.

196
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:13.390
Make sure that you understand elections neighbor adjacencies different types of links.

197
00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:15.660
So here they mentioned point to point.

198
00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:21.270
If you enable a wispy F on a Ethernet interface what kind of network will it be if you enable it on

199
00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:22.410
a point to point link.

200
00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:23.550
What kind of link will it be.

201
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:27.630
And that's important because once again a lot of when technologies have been removed from the course.

202
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:32.920
BP has been removed from the course but yeah we've got a point to point link in SPF.

203
00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:37.050
So how would they test you about a point to point link if you don't have some kind of point to point

204
00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:39.890
link so SPF network type could be point to point.

205
00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:43.710
Which means you need a point to point link so don't just throw out all the old technologies and say

206
00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:50.430
I will not touch anything that has a HDL C or point to point type of connection.

207
00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:54.130
I personally will keep a little bit of that in my course.

208
00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:58.190
But you know it's not as big as it was previously.

209
00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:01.440
Okay big section is security fundamentals.

210
00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:04.710
I would spend a lot of time on security fundamentals.

211
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:06.450
It's 15 percent of the exam.

212
00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:10.070
Make sure that you understand VPN.

213
00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:17.050
Make sure that you understand wireless security protocols make sure that you know how to configure wireless

214
00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:22.070
LANs using WPA to using appreciate keys via the gooey.

215
00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:25.270
Make sure that you understand properly as an example.

216
00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:29.480
Do you know the difference between authentication authorization and accounting.

217
00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:32.190
So I would spend a lot of time on security fundamentals.

218
00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:36.770
Big part of the course now and then automation and program ability.

219
00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:41.160
This is where things are going so you would need to know like what is a northbound API.

220
00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:42.250
What's a southbound API.

221
00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:45.850
What protocols would be used on northbound southbound.

222
00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:49.410
My big advice would be make sure you understand what a controller is.

223
00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:54.190
I've discussed this stuff and I've created videos showing a bit of history if you're interested but

224
00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:57.750
I spoke about this stuff on this video many years ago.

225
00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:02.830
What's the difference between separation of control plane data plane.

226
00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:04.360
What is a management plane.

227
00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.910
So if you have a controller.

228
00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:13.630
Traditionally we have a device like a rider with the management plane the control plane and the forwarding

229
00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:19.440
plane or data plane within the device but with a controller we take the control plane out of the device

230
00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:21.420
we put it in a centralized controller.

231
00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:26.830
Now in the original open flow model the controller was the brain and the switches became dumb or the

232
00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:27.990
riders became dumb.

233
00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:32.730
That didn't work very well didn't scale so SPF kind of died a death that's in the past now.

234
00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:41.020
But the idea with a controller is we can have a controller that for instance controls some aspects of

235
00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:41.980
forwarding.

236
00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:49.990
So in Wendell's CCN a book he spends a lot of time on SD a lot of information on SDI.

237
00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:56.560
I don't know if it's necessary to note that detail but make sure that you understand what is an underlying

238
00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:56.980
network.

239
00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:01.270
Essentially physical devices rather than switches running traditional stuff.

240
00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:07.240
You can however get rid of spanning tree and run a layer 3 network has the Underlay.

241
00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.240
Then you run an overlay on top of it.

242
00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:14.020
Now it sounds all complicated but it's just traditional stuff that's got a new spin on it.

243
00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:17.440
I would say so in the old old days and we've done this for years.

244
00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:18.460
The internet.

245
00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:21.040
Think of the Internet as an underlay.

246
00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:25.200
It doesn't understand what's going across it necessarily.

247
00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:30.250
If we especially if we put it in a tunnel so let's go back even further in the old old days we had a

248
00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:35.040
traditional telephone network where the switches in the cloud were intelligent and the phones were dumb.

249
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:40.120
Then the intelligence was put on the phones and the using Skype as an example.

250
00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:47.660
And the networking core became dumb and we just simply made calls across the Internet using Skype.

251
00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:51.090
So the traditional telephony network was intelligent.

252
00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:56.230
It was replaced with an IP call that was essentially dumb it didn't understand all the applications

253
00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:57.280
going across it.

254
00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:03.340
And then we made calls across the Internet using Skype with intelligence in the endpoints or in the

255
00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:09.410
controllers which could be as an analogy call manage express or whatever controller we're using to set

256
00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:12.070
up the calls using IP devices.

257
00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:16.690
Now here in SDK we've got an underlay think of that kind of like the Internet.

258
00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:23.320
So we've got just switches routers they are dumb to a point and then we put an overlay on top of it.

259
00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.580
So we build a whole network on top of it using Vieques land.

260
00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:31.120
Now it sounds complicated it's just tunnels but the intelligence is that can automatically be built

261
00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:38.050
to apply policy so we can have a policy and an SD server so we could have a policy on a controller and

262
00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:41.490
then apply the policy to the overlay not to the Underlay.

263
00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:48.370
So rather than trying to manually configure access lists on individual devices we apply the policy and

264
00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:51.760
this is the whole idea with intent based networking.

265
00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:57.810
We apply a policy on the controller and then that's going to configure the devices with us overlay network.

266
00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:04.330
So from me to you there might be a 20 switches or 20 writers on the Internet as an example but when

267
00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:07.880
we set up a IP SAC tunnel logically it's a hop from me to you.

268
00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:11.960
Same kind of idea here we've got a whole bunch of physical devices as the Underlay.

269
00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.440
We put an overlay on top of it.

270
00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:16.540
Make sure you understand those concepts.

271
00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:23.400
Make sure that you understand rest but arrest in the definite exam there's obviously a lot more about

272
00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:23.720
that.

273
00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:29.430
Make sure that you understand the differences between Puppet Chef and sensible so answerable as an example

274
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:30.650
doesn't need an agent.

275
00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:33.130
It's an agent less implementation.

276
00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:38.760
So I've created a whole sensible course so I'll take some of that experience and knowledge and attitude

277
00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:44.820
my new CCN course make sure that you understand that with Ansel it's kind of like with python scripts

278
00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:49.590
I can just SS H to the devices and make configuration changes on them.

279
00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:54.750
But with puppet and chef now with puppet you can do some interesting things but the idea is you run

280
00:18:54.750 --> 00:19:04.440
an agent on the device and you don't use SS H to talk to the agent using HDP s using a web based protocol

281
00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.410
rather than traditional SSA.

282
00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:12.210
So the idea is as your control over your controlling device or your management device talks to the agent

283
00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:16.570
on the device that then configure the device but with sensible its agent less.

284
00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:22.020
We're not running an agent or special software on the Rogers and switches we are connecting directly

285
00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:23.900
to them from a server.

286
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:28.850
Make sure you can also interpret Jason encoded data.

287
00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:33.630
I was quite surprised by that one but yeah make sure you spend a bit of time on automation and program

288
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:37.770
ability but don't get stuck on this topic.

289
00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:39.090
It's a new topic in the exam.

290
00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:40.440
Don't get stuck on it.

291
00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:47.350
Notice security fundamentals has more information wars it is more important it's 15 percent IP services

292
00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:48.580
is 10 percent.

293
00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:55.860
Talking about traditional stuff like the HP DNS A.P. S&amp;P MP so isn't it.

294
00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:58.120
He's been run for years.

295
00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:03.240
Do you understand which underlying protocols are used by these upper layer protocols.

296
00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:06.840
So which protocol does S&amp;P use.

297
00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:12.020
Is it UDP is a TTP which protocol does SSA use TTP UDP.

298
00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:16.290
Make sure that you understand various protocols and the underlying protocols under them.

299
00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:18.380
So I mean I could list all of these topics.

300
00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:22.360
I mean my exam was very broad covered a whole bunch of topics.

301
00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:24.250
I think it was a very balanced exam.

302
00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.620
I think it was a good exam.

303
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:28.670
Okay so hopefully you've learned something.
