00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:08.560
On the Cisco ESEA server we need to go to network configuration and add a triple A client.

2
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:17.230
In other words we need to add the Cisco router we need to specify the host name of the router to call

3
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:24.650
the right one and then we need to specify the IP address of the router tendered wandered wandered to

4
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.470
a one the key that we used

5
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.060
was Cisco shown over here

6
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.260
so we need to specify Cisco as the key and we are going to authenticate.

7
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.730
In this example using tactics Cisco.

8
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.080
IOW there are other options such as radius but we'll use tax in this example.

9
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.130
And I'm going to click submit and apply to apply that configuration

10
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.740
once again under users.

11
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.200
We only have a user called admin.

12
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:17.460
So now let's test whether we can log back in to write a one as David so into David in the password notice

13
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:24.970
authentication has failed on the TAC hack server going to reports an activity we can look at failed

14
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:32.960
attempts and we can see here that we've got a failed attempt for David external database user invalid

15
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:44.570
or bad password logging is Mary using a Mary password Cisco I'll refresh the logged in failures and

16
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:56.800
notice Mary has failed but if we log in as admin Cisco the authentication passes and we are able to

17
00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:07.590
access the Rada show run pipe include user shows us that we have a user David and we use a Mary with

18
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:18.150
the relevant passwords but to the local username and password database is only used if the TAC server

19
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:31.350
is not available so as an example if I stop the tax service on the tax server and exit out of the router

20
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:42.870
and then log in as David I can access the broader so I can only use the local username and password

21
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.450
database if the TAC server is down.

22
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.380
If however the techniques server is up so I'll start the service again

23
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.010
if I try and log back in as David.

24
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:08.750
Notice authentication has failed and once again on the TAC server we can see that David failed the authentication.

25
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.130
I can however log back in as admin.

26
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.990
Now what's really nice about this is that you can create centralized user accounts so I could create

27
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.980
a user called user one set to their password

28
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.670
and click submit.

29
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:37.840
So when I look at the available users I now have a user called User 1 and without making any configuration

30
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:48.640
changes on the router we can log in as User 1 so that to use it doesn't exist in the local Rodda configuration

31
00:03:49.210 --> 00:04:00.160
but exists on the TAC server if I want to I can disable the user account so user 1 is now disabled back

32
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:08.810
on the router if we try and log in as User 1 authentication has failed and once again looking at the

33
00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:15.500
reports on the AC s server we can see failed attempts.

34
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:22.600
User 1 account is disabled so when they try to access this device Titi why 0.

35
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:31.950
In other words the console they log in has failed if they try to access that road remotely so they try

36
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:41.570
to tell it to the runner and log in as User 1 authentication has failed and refreshing the information

37
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:49.340
on the tech server we can see that user 1 has failed the authentication account is disabled and they

38
00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.590
try to access Titi why 98.

39
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:58.190
In other words one of the V wine lines on the strata we're getting a lot of central information from

40
00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.120
the ISIS server.

41
00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.990
What we can also do is enable some debugging

42
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:16.550
so Logan is admin and then we can use command such as debug X and I'll just enable all of it and debug

43
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.990
triple A

44
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:30.210
and in this case will enable the authentication so when they use it tries to access the router we can

45
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:36.740
see quite a bit of information so Triple A authentication log in the users trying to log in we using

46
00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.200
the default method.

47
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.510
Note on the V2 wine lines

48
00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:51.990
no authentication methods have been set it's inheriting the default method so default is being used

49
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.360
authentication start package created.

50
00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.720
We're trying to get a response from the user.

51
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.910
In this case the user took too long so let's try that again

52
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:13.540
I'll put in the user name of user 1 so we can see now it's asking for a password

53
00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:28.250
and notice the response failed the server 10 1 1 1 has rejected that user name so let's put some spaces

54
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:40.240
then log in with a admin user log and succeeded so in this case we received a response of POS authentication

55
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.240
succeeded so go through the full process again

56
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:58.720
Telnet to the Rada default list is being used we are asking for the user account so that's admin asking

57
00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.800
for the password

58
00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:10.150
authentication succeeded so we can see what's taking place in the background here Triple A authentication

59
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.980
is being used

60
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:22.290
the right is told by the triple A server to ask the user for the user name and then to ask them for

61
00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:29.660
the password and then to tell the user that they succeeded the authentication and can log in.

62
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:37.670
So that's an example of basic Triple A authentication on router 1 Now there two ways to set this up.

63
00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:43.080
We're using the older method at the moment because these riders don't support the newer method where

64
00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.460
we create a group.

65
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:51.030
So I'll show you that in a moment but before I do that I'll copy this configuration to rider t to show

66
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:55.340
you that we can create a central authentication server.

67
00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:06.650
At the moment we haven't configured brought it to on the AC a server so we can still log in as David

68
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.960
so under network configuration we need to create an entry for too.

69
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:21.970
So write it to tendered one to a two is the IP address of Rata show IP interface brief so there's the

70
00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:28.670
IP address key used is going to be Cisco and I'm going to click submit and apply.

71
00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:40.120
So that Rod has now been configured so try and log in as David authentication has failed.

72
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:44.730
Try and log in as admin authentication passes.

73
00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:54.250
We've now configured two routers with centralized authentication under the reports failed attempts we

74
00:08:54.250 --> 00:09:01.600
can see that David failed the authentication attempt on the second router so we seek information for

75
00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.550
both rather too and root a one.

76
00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:06.870
Let's configure out a three.

77
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:11.080
I'll take this configuration and pasting two rather three

78
00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:18.530
on rather three we can log in as David.

79
00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:24.910
So that works but we can't log in his admin because we still need to configure the ACA server

80
00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:32.090
so back on ISIS will add rather 3.

81
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:39.570
IP addresses tendered wandered 1 to 2 0 3 password or keys Cisco click submit.

82
00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:48.100
The rod is not configured so previously we couldn't log in as admin but now hopefully we should be able

83
00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.890
to let's try again.

84
00:09:52.850 --> 00:10:00.620
David failed the so admin so admin Cisco works

85
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:07.850
David Cisco doesn't work.

86
00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:15.040
Because the rod is not communicating with AC s but admin Cisco does.

87
00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:22.180
So we've now got three routers configured to communicate with an AC S. server.

88
00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:30.750
These writers are using an older version of IOW they're using version 12 that 4 and that version doesn't

89
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:37.740
support tactics so groups which is the new way of doing things and is what you need to know for the

90
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:38.250
exam.
