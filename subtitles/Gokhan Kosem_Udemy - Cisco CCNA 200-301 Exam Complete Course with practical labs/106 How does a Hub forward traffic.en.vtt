00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
MAC addresses are once again, 48 bits in length

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
but rather than showing MAC addresses as 48 bit values

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000
in this demonstrations I’m gonna represent MAC addresses

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
by letter such as A, B, C and D and I’m doing that just for simplicity sake.

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So what is a hub do with received traffic.

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So in this example, let's assume that A is sending traffic to C.

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So the source address of the frame is A and the destination address of the frame is C.

8
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
A sends that frame to the hub what will a hub do with the frame?

9
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
now because a hub is a multi port repeater in other words it's simply a repeater

10
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
with multiple ports and it has no understanding of the traffic it receives

11
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
it will simply amplify the signal and send the traffic or frames out of all ports.

12
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So it literally receives a frame, amplifies it

13
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and sends it out of all other ports except the port on which it was received.

14
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
so every device in this topology will receive the frame sent from A to C.

15
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
so once again A is sending a frame to C

16
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
but all devices except A have received the frame.

17
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The network interface cards or NICs of B and D will receive the frame

18
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and read the destination MAC address, they will see in this example

19
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
that the destination MAC address is C and therefore the frame is not destined

20
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
to themselves and the Network Interface Cards will therefore drop the frame.

21
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
So the frames sent to D and B will be dropped

22
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
by the Network Interface Cards or NICs of those PCs

23
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Host c however will accept the frame because the frame is destined to it.

24
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So the Network Interface Card or NIC on PC C will read the destination MAC address

25
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and we'll see that the destination MAC address of the frame is at self

26
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and it will therefore received the frame, strip the Layer 2 headers

27
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and pass the packet to the higher layer protocols on the machine

28
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
in other words if this is an IPv4 packet it will send

29
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
the packet to the IPv4 process running on the machine for further processing

30
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Now let's assume that A ping C, so it requires return traffic

31
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
so C replies with the frame with source Mac address being C

32
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and the destination MAC address being A.

33
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
C sends that frame to the hub and what does the hub do with the frame?

34
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Now once again a hub is simply a multi port repeater

35
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and it will therefore just amplify the signal
2:37 -0> 2:40

36
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
without understanding of the data in the frames.

37
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
So the frame is sent to both D and B

38
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
which drop a frame because the destination MAC address is not themselves

39
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
A will accept the frame because it destined to it, it will then strip the layer 2

40
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
headers and send the data to higher layer protocols for further processing.

41
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So A and C are communicating with one another but it’s important to realize

42
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
that the hub is a physical layer device that is simply a multi port repeater

43
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and will therefore amplify frames out of all interfaces.

44
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
So B and D will see all the frames sent between A and C.

45
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Physically this topology is a star topology but logically it doesn’t work that way.

46
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
The physical topology of a hub is a star but logically it's a bus.

47
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
It’s very important to realize that there’s a difference

48
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
between a physical and logical topology in networks.

49
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
The way the network is physically cabled

50
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
isn’t necessarily the way the network is going to operate.

51
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
It is important to remember that when a device sends traffic in a hub environment

52
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.000
all devices receive a frame, that's exactly the way it works in 10base2 or 10base5.

53
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.000
A hub operates in the same way is 10base2 because when A sends a frame

54
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.000
unto the network all devices receive the frame in the same way as 10base2.

55
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Just like in 10base2 environment when there's a collision on the network

56
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
it will affect all devices in the network.

57
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
This is a single collision domain.

58
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
A collision anywhere will cause devices to back off, send a jamming signal

59
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and then attempt to transmit again.

60
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
As you increase the number of devices in a hub environment

61
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
the number of collisions increases and your network throughput goes down.

62
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
In addition broadcast are received by everyone as this is a single broadcast domain.

63
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
A broadcast sent by B is received by everyone.

64
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
It’s a single broadcast domain because all devices need to process broadcast

65
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
sent by every other device in the network.

66
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Broadcast traffic will flood through the entire network

67
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and interrupt the CPU of every device which is obviously not ideal.

68
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
From a bandwidth point of view this maybe 10baseT

69
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:16.000
where 10 means 10 Mbps but its 10 Mbps shared between all devices.

70
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
So assuming that we have 10 Mbps like we do in this example.

71
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And they are four devices in the network with a maximum utilization of 30%

72
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
that means that each device only gets 0.75 Mbps throughput

73
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:40.000
its not 10 Mbps dedicated its 10 Mbps shared between all the devices.

74
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Once again because it's shared you need to divide the bandwidth

75
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
by the number of devices in a shared Ethernet environment.

76
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And because you’re not generally getting more than 30 to 40% utilization

77
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
because of collisions on the network you need to multiply that

78
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
by 30%, 30% being a conservative value.

79
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:08.000
So your bandwidth is 10 divided by 4*30% which equates to 0.75 Mbps

80
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
which is obviously not very good.
