00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So what happens when we set 1 side to manual trunking

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
so int g0/0 switchport mode trunk

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
notice we have to specify an encapsulation

4
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
so switchport trunk encapsulation sot1q switchport mode trunk

5
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So I’ve manually configured switch 1 to use trunking

6
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
so sh int g0/0 switchport

7
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
so this side is configured as a trunk

8
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and is operating as a trunk using 802.1Q

9
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
on this switch sh interface trunk

10
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
notice it's negotiated to use trunking with 802.1Q

11
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
so its currently trunking even though this side was configured for auto.

12
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So sh int g0/0 switchport

13
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
This was configured to use DTP or dynamic auto mode

14
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
but it became a trunk because the switch on the left was configured as a trunk.

15
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
So if you configure 1 side manually

16
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
the other side will automatically be configured as a trunk when DTP is used

17
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
when this side is configured as an access port

18
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
so sh int g0/0 switchport

19
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Notice it was statically configured as an access port

20
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and is operating as an access port.

21
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Negotiation of trunking is off on this side

22
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
it’s dynamically configured to use auto

23
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
but the operational mode has become static access.

24
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So if 1 side is configured as a trunk statically and the other side is configured

25
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
to use  either dynamic auto or dynamic desirable a trunk will be formed

26
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
but if 1 side is statically configured as an access port.

27
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
The DTP side will become an access port.

28
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So the switch can dynamically be configured with the right mode.

29
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
you can have a problem where 1 side is configured as access

30
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and 1 side is configured as a trunk port

31
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
so you need to either manually configure both sides as a trunk

32
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
or manually configure both sides as access or use DTP.

33
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000
The recommendation is that you manually configure both sides and turn off DTP

34
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000
So what we will do is do something like this on gigabit 0/0

35
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
we’ve configured the encapsulation as dot1q, it’s an access port

36
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
but to configure trunking, we type switchport mode trunk

37
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and we would type switchport nonegotiate to disable DTP.

38
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
So this is the recommended configuration.

39
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Set your encapsulation to dot1q

40
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000
set the mode to trunking manually or statically and disable DTP

41
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Now we have to do that on both sides.

42
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So on this side, we will do something similar

43
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
sh int g0/0 trunk

44
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
notice gigabit 0/0 is configured as a trunk

45
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
it’s configured manually or statically, so the mode is on.

46
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
It’s currently trunking with the native VLAN set to 1.
