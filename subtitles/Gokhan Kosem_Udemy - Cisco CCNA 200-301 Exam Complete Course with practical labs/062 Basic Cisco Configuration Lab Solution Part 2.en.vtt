00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:20.800
We now need to configure the first five telnet lines and use a line password of Cisco on the Telnet

2
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.700
lines.

3
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:31.390
So at the moment if I try and Telnet to write it to I get connection closed by foreign host show run

4
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.670
shows us the key why lines.

5
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.840
By default we have a zero to 4.

6
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:49.080
In other words the first five Viti wine lines so line V2 wine 0 to 4 log in means that we need to configure

7
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.730
a password on the line.

8
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.430
And in this example it's going to be Cisco.

9
00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:03.440
So we need to configure that password per our instructions on write it to line V2 y 0 to 4.

10
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:12.030
Now a lot of Cisco devices have more than 5 Viti y lines but that's often what you asked to configure

11
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.500
in CCMA exam scenarios.

12
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.470
So that's what we'll do here offset to the password to Cisco.

13
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:30.700
So now that that's done can we Telnet to it 2 and notice we can be prompted for our line password once

14
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.220
we enter that we're in user mode.

15
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:40.360
And then when we type enable we need to enter our secret password which is Cisco ONE TWO THREE notice

16
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:47.500
I can now configure write it to tab exit I'm back on rudder one on rudder two.

17
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.050
Can I Telnet to write one.

18
00:01:50.170 --> 00:02:00.530
Yes I can and I can go to privilege mode to enable mode and go back to rudder to so I've successfully

19
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:07.680
made sure that I can tell it from one rudder to the other I now need to configure a console password

20
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:18.880
of Cisco and test that it works so at the moment when I connect to the console of the router and press

21
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.220
center I'm immediately in user mode

22
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:36.110
but if I type a line and in this case specify console 0 and use the command log in and specify positive

23
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:45.590
Cisco I'll be prompted to enter a password on the console and notice there you go when I try and connect

24
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.320
to the console I need to enter the positive Cisco then

25
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.990
Cisco ONE TWO THREE TO GET TO privilege mode.

26
00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:08.470
So again a rather t note password at the moment press Enter or Return and I'm straight in to use a mode

27
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:19.520
but if I configure the console with a password of Cisco

28
00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:31.280
and press Enter now I have to enter a positive Cisco to get to use a mode and then Cisco ONE TWO THREE

29
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:40.790
TO GET TO privilege mode now we're not told to do it but as a best practice I suggest that you save

30
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:49.650
your configuration in the exam if you're not explicitly told not to do it then do it.

31
00:03:50.240 --> 00:04:00.190
So unless they tell you not to save your configuration as a lost step use the command copy running config

32
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:09.600
thought up config to save your configuration that's the exam way of doing it for the real world unlike

33
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:18.630
the old command W R which saves the configuration immediately without prompting you to confirm it the

34
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:26.670
command is also a lot shorter so I prefer this command for labs or for the real world but for the exam

35
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:34.500
remember copy running config startup config so we've successfully completed to this lab How did you

36
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.860
do when you tried the lab.

37
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.900
Were you able to complete it.

38
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.710
Did you learn something.

39
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.490
Remember to keep practicing.

40
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.240
Keep trying.

41
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.680
That's the best way to learn.
