1
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:15.970
So to configure a port on the switch as a trunk port supporting Cisco IP phones you would do the following.

2
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.050
So the on a switch.

3
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:29.040
In this case the U.S. 500 I'm going to top the C'mon show the LAN switch to see villans as you can see

4
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:36.240
here we've got a default Thielen and we've got our voice the which is Bil'in to all interfaces are currently

5
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.760
in the native land.

6
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:45.040
In other words the default Bil'in So going into global configuration mode I can dub a command interface.

7
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:54.360
Range is zero slash one slash one up to three and then I can type the command switchboard.

8
00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:04.480
Trunk encapsulation and then specify an encapsulation in the past we may have chosen ISIL or editor

9
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:04.930
or one.

10
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.200
Q Cisco IP phones only support one key.

11
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:16.500
So we get to specify one key that I'm going to say switchboard mode trunk to force these ports to trunk

12
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:28.070
and then switch port trunk native LAN one then I'm going to type switchboard with voice Villon and in

13
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:36.800
our case it's Violante tapping the command do show run interface if 0 1 slash 1 will chimey the running

14
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.870
configuration of that specific port.

15
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.380
I remember default commands don't show up in the running config so you won't necessarily see all the

16
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.110
commands we've just typed because some of them are they by default but as you can see here the port

17
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.250
is trunking and the voice Thielen is violent.

18
00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.040
The problem here is that all the lands will be allowed across the sport which could potentially cause

19
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.900
that issue where broad costs affect the processing of Cisco IP phones.

20
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.110
So we should manually prune the stronger.

21
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:16.610
So I'm going to topic the on Switchfoot trunk allowed Villon and then I'm going to specify the villains

22
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:23.110
that are allowed on certain switches you might only need to specify the voice Villon but in the U.S.

23
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:31.400
500 I'm going to specify all the default villans Plus the voice villaine now topping the come on Dushka

24
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:38.480
run and the specific interface shows me that I'm only allowing the Native Land Bill and one on Ethernet

25
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:45.850
Berlanti which is my voice villain and the other default villans supported on Cisco switches.

26
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:53.820
So once again to show villans switch will allow me to see those default the lens one is the default

27
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:54.890
to Ethernet.

28
00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.600
And then we have the villains for FDDI and Token Ring.

29
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.520
So that's all you can figure an interface to support trunking.

30
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.340
It's no longer recommended.

31
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.840
But if you have an older switch you may need to configure it in this way.

32
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:17.970
Last Yakutat the command show interface if 0 1 slash 1 switchboard I notice you can see here that the

33
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.510
Minister of is trunk the operational mode at the moment is trunk and kept selection has dropped one

34
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.530
key.

35
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.520
The native land is villaine one which is the default.

36
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:34.920
The villains enabled across this interface all one to one thousand two to 1005 the active villains at

37
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:44.440
the moment of the lens one into the voice the line is the Leonti the recommended way to implement IP

38
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.220
phones in a network infrastructure is to use a multiple the land access ports.

39
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:56.740
In this example we are configuring the port on the switch as an excess port but still configuring TV

40
00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.130
lands on that port.

41
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:04.330
The phone will be in the voice Fillon and the PC will be in the data villaine tagged frame's will be

42
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.570
sent to the phone.

43
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:13.240
So edited are one keyframes are still used even though this is an access port untagged frames are sent

44
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.640
to the PC.

45
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:21.520
Now this flies in the face of what you learnt in the CC and a course in the CC and a course we learnt

46
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:29.020
then an access port belongs to a single villain that is not the case in the scenario in this scenario.

47
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.870
The access port has to villans configured on it.

48
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.690
Now there are multiple advantages to this method of implementation.

49
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:45.120
The first one is that a multivalent access port can be configured as a secure port unlike the previous

50
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.920
example where we configured the port as a trunk.

51
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.900
The voice of an ID can also be discovered through CTP or L-L DP.

52
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.270
So the manual configuration of villans on the phone is not required.

53
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.180
It also allows for scalability from an IP addressing point of view.

54
00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:08.410
The issue that you may encounter in the real world is that if a glossy address has been allocated to

55
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:15.700
your PCs and let's say using 80 percent of your addresses say 80 percent of the IP addresses and that

56
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:23.250
subnet have been allocated to physical devices like PCs and now you Ed Cisco IP phones to the mix.

57
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:29.230
You're essentially doubling the amount of devices that you only have 20 percent of the IP addresses

58
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.970
remaining in that subnet.

59
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:37.040
So you cannot put the phones and the PC in the same subnet without redoing your IP addressing.

60
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:43.300
However if you put your phones into a separate subnet that doesnt affect the IP addressing of the PCs

61
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:51.500
so you allocate a separate subnet for IP phones and the IP subnet allocated to the PCs is left alone.

62
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:58.700
Theres also a logical separation of voice and data traffic because the phones on a separate subnet to

63
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:05.750
the PCs it's easier to implement quality of service it's easier to implement your access lists and it's

64
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.720
easier to implement security.

65
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:14.630
So that's a major advantage to separating the phones in the PCs into separate subnets two devices can

66
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:19.400
also be connected to a single port on the switch which minimizes cabling.

67
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:25.570
Your PC is physically connected to the phone which is physically connected to the switch across a single

68
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:26.710
cable.

69
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:34.570
However logically the phone and the PC on separate cables because they are indifferent to the lens.

70
00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:41.500
But physically you saving on cabling the multiple Bil'in access port implementation tends to be the

71
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:48.900
most common in the real world and is the recommended way to implement IP phones to configure a multiple

72
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.990
Bil'in access port on an interface.

73
00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:59.370
Do the following so on you see 500 or an off switch are going to top the C'mon show Villon switch to

74
00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:04.690
see the villans configured at the moment we have Bil'in one configured on ports.

75
00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:13.670
If it is 0 1 0 up to if 0 1 slash 8 no interfaces on the voice Villon I can also do the come on show

76
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:22.250
run interface if 0 1 slash 1 to show you the configuration on the interface as you can see are just

77
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:27.210
defaulted the configuration all ports are in excess VLAN 1.

78
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:34.930
So going into a global config mode and tapping the on interface range if 0 1 0 1 2 3.

79
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:40.280
In other words we are going to configure the three ports that have IP phones connected to them.

80
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:48.320
I cannot type the command switch port mode access making these ports access ports which is the default

81
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:59.280
then I can pop the command switchboard and voice Bil'in and switchboard access the LAN one now topping

82
00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:06.200
the command show run interface 0 1 slash 1 shows me that that interface has been configured with a voice

83
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:07.100
VLAN.

84
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:14.850
We don't see the native land or the data then all the access to the LAN because villain 1 is the default

85
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:20.130
LAN and default configurations don't show up in the running config.

86
00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:29.930
But topping the command show interface of 0 1 Section 1 switchboard allows me to see the voice and data

87
00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:31.500
we learn more clearly.

88
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:40.400
So on the interface it's been configured as a static access port and is acting as a static access port.

89
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:48.010
The access to the plan is villaine one the default and notice the voice feelin is villaine too.

90
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:53.940
So even though the operational mode is steady access in other words this is acting as an access port.

91
00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:59.530
We are allowing beelined one in two across this port.

92
00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:04.400
The fourth way to implement IP phones is to use a 2.1.

93
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:12.320
Now it is two to p frames use the three boats in the edit to the one queue header to allow for the prioritization

94
00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.170
of voice traffic over data traffic.

95
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:20.390
There are three beds in an editor or one key header called the costs or loss of service.

96
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:23.120
Let's talk more about these later.

97
00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:30.590
Essentially editor 1 p allows for the mocking of voice traffic with a value of five in the course feel

98
00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:36.870
allowing the switch to see voice traffic has higher priority than data traffic.

99
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:44.490
Now with a single villain access port using editor 1 p the interface is in a single the LAN.

100
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:53.960
So both the phone and the PC are in the land too but the phone is going to send tagged frames to the

101
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.250
switch.

102
00:09:55.250 --> 00:10:01.980
Now because this is a standard access port the phone uses a special the land number in the edit to the

103
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:08.090
one key header to allow for the use of a through one keyframes.

104
00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:15.610
Now just to recap from the CCMA course a standard Ethan at frame as a source and destination feel a

105
00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:22.170
little Isa time the data and then a frame check sequence when edited or one cue is used.

106
00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:28.790
A tag is inserted between the source and destination address and the length and ether taught field.

107
00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:38.200
That tag consists of four bytes 16 bits is the tag protocol identifier and then the remaining 16 bits

108
00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:42.900
consist of the priority code point or priority field.

109
00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:52.900
The canonical format indicator and the villain ID now editor 1 p specifies the meaning of the priority

110
00:10:52.900 --> 00:11:01.430
field or class of service or Crossfield the property code point field is three bits in length.

111
00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:10.120
In other words the binary values are from triple 0 to triple 1 and decimal values is 0 to 7.

112
00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:16.390
The high priority value the more important the traffic and thus voice will have a binary value of 1

113
00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:20.870
0 1 or the equivalent decimal value or 5.

114
00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:30.100
So the phone is sending a two to one keyframes to the switch on an access port with the cost field or

115
00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:33.750
priority code point field set to 5.

116
00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:38.670
In other words it's sending an edit to the one frame to the switch.

117
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:46.750
Now just to reiterate terminology an editor or one cue header is inserted in the Ethan at frame which

118
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:48.190
looks as follows.

119
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:57.970
Edit 2 to 1 p denotes the meaning or values of the already feel or Crossfield the value specified here

120
00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:02.170
form part of the recommendations of Ada to the one P..

121
00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:10.540
So once again Ed. 1 p specifies the different classes or values of the priority field in an attitude

122
00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:11.800
or one queue header.

123
00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:19.320
The phone is setting the value of the cost field to 5 when sending framed to the switch.

124
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:25.220
The switch therefore knows that traffic from the phone has a higher priority than traffic from the PC.

125
00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:29.190
Now that explains how one can be used for quality of service.

126
00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.370
But in this example this is an access port.

127
00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:33.970
In other words it's not a trunk port.

128
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:35.400
It's an access port.

129
00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:42.360
Only one villain has been configured on those Port Vila and so when sending traffic to the switch a

130
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:49.440
villain number has to be specified by the phone and a villain number used in this case is a villain.

131
00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:57.690
The switch therefore knows that when it receives an editor the one Q frame with the villain number set

132
00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:05.570
to zero that the phone still belongs to the villain configured on this port as the access villain.

133
00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:14.170
So all traffic from the phone and the PC reside in the Leonti the phone is not in a separate Bil'in

134
00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:17.730
to the PC they both belong to be Leonti.

135
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:26.810
Thus the use of the special Bil'in of zero when sending editor or one keyframes to the switch on this

136
00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.600
access port.

137
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:34.820
So to configure EDOT 2 to 1 p on an access port you need to do the following.

138
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:38.440
So before configuring the switch or the U.S. 500.

139
00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:41.430
Let's have a look at our plans.

140
00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:49.600
So as you can see here all interfaces on the default end of the line one once again show run interface

141
00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:56.750
if zero once one shows us that the interface has a default configuration on it.

142
00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:06.160
Going into global config mode typing interface the range if 0 1 stash 1 2 3 the interfaces that have

143
00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:14.680
iPhones connected to them I can type the command switch Ford mode access so these ports are not going

144
00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:24.980
to be configured as trunk's they configure it as access ports switch port and voice the LAN dot one

145
00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:30.290
p to specify the use of dot one on these ports.

146
00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:41.070
Switch port access the land to noticed we are not specifying a voice feel the up to we are specifying

147
00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:43.310
an Access Villano of T.

148
00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:51.720
So once again show run interface if 0 1 once one shows me that this part is in the land too.

149
00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:58.790
It's an access port but we are using edited a one p on this interface.

150
00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:07.610
The phones will transmit traffic to the switch as tag frames using billons zero in the real an identifier.

151
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:12.100
Both the phone and the PC are in the land too.

152
00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:20.450
That concludes Part 1 of our discussion of the Cisco on the phone startup process.

153
00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:27.560
We discussed how an IP phone obtains power how Villani information is provided to the phone using CTP
