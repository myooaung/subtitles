00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
show ip protocols

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
shows me the time is used by RIP

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
so by default, its sends update every 30 seconds.

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Routes are invalid after 180 seconds, the hold down timer is a 180 seconds

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and routes are flushed after 240 seconds.

6
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Now you can change the timers

7
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
so under router rip you can specify different timers

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
for instance the interval between updates

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
the invalid timer you could change to another value

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
hold down timer to another value and the flushed timer to another value.

11
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
so show ip protocols

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:53.000
these values are different to other routers which you're using the defaults

13
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
so notice there are the defaults 31.81.80.240

14
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
where's here you've made it 10 seconds 200, 200 and 250

15
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
show ip route

16
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I'll clear the routing table, I still receive my routes

17
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and in this example, I can still ping google.com from router 1

18
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
now it's recommended that you don’t change the timers on your routers

19
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
unless you have good reason to do that

20
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and in that case make them the same, don’t have different timers in your network.
