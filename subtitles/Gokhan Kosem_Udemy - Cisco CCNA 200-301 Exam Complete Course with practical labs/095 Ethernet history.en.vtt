00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So a quick recap of the OSI model.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
At layer 1 we have the physical layer, physicals specification like Rj-45

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
are defined at this layer, option such as cables specifications, voltage

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and other physical parametera are defined at the physical layer.

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
At layer 2 we have the data link layer and this is where Mac address is reside.

6
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I’m going to explain Mac addresses in more detail in a moment.

7
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
At layer 3 we have IP addresses and this is where routing takes place

8
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
routers reside at this layer and addresses such as IPv4 or IPv6 exist at layer 3.

9
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
At layer 4 we have protocol such as TCP and UDP

10
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
now some of this information was covered in the OSI model videos

11
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
but here I'm gonna look at some of the layers in more detail.

12
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So Ethernet was born in the 1970's which for a lot of us

13
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
seems like a really long time ago.

14
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Robert Metcalfe was one of the people involved in Ethernet development.

15
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
he also started the company called 3Com in 1979 which is subsequently

16
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
been purchase by Hewlett-Packard,  what's important to understand is that Ethernet

17
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and networking is very young when compared to telephony environments.

18
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone system many, many years ago

19
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
long before the advent of Ethernet.

20
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I’m gonna give you a brief history lesson but it's worthwhile knowing

21
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
some of the history of the Ethernet because it explaines

22
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
how we've got to where we are today, it also explains some of the concepts

23
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
which are still relevant in today’s networks.

24
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Now in the original Ethernet implementation.

25
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The network architecture that was use was a bus topology.

26
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
In a bus topology, each devices connected to a single cable

27
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and the clients therefore share a communication line or bus.

28
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
This is similar in concept to what we use to have in telephony environment

29
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
which was called a telephone party line, where a single cable

30
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
was used to provide telephone services to remote areas.

31
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
In that example you would have a single cable and multiple telephones

32
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
would hang off the so called party line, now before you made a call

33
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
in those days you have to listen to hear if anyone else was speaking.

34
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
So before you made a call you would pick up your handset and listen

35
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and make sure that no one else was using the line.

36
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
When someone made a call to that telephone line

37
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
all telephones connected to the party line would ring.

38
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And the same thing happens in an Ethernet environment when using a bus topology.

39
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.000
When traffic is sent on that cable it is received by all devices connected to the bus.

40
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000
This is the shared infrastructure and it means that when any device on that network

41
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
sends traffic all other devices connected to the same cable will receive the traffic.

42
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
When a device wants to speak or communicate it needs to ensure that no other device

43
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
speaking, otherwise collision can occur.

44
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
In some of the original implementations of Ethernet, we had what was called

45
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
10 base5 also called thicknet and it had a maximum segment size of 500 meters.

46
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
There was also another physical implementation known as 10base2

47
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
also called thinnet this had a maximum distance of 185 meters.

48
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
This early implementations of Ethernet use a bus topology which means

49
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
that when a device on the cable sends a signal all devices

50
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
connected to that cable will receive the signal.

51
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000
So now let’s discuss one of the implementations 10base2 which will hopefully help you

52
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:47.000
understand the reasons why we do things in Ethernet today.

53
00:03:47.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Basically because of historical reasons, certain things are done in the certain way.

54
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.000
So 10base2 use coaxial cable or coax cable it had a maximum speed of 10mbps

55
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:18.000
the 10 in 10base2 indicates a speed of 10mbps, 2 indicates a maximum segment length

56
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000
of 185 meters, and the word base indicates baseband rather than broadband.

57
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Now what is the difference between baseband and broadband

58
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.000
now baseband only allows for a single signal to traverse the wire at any given time.

59
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
The signal uses all the frequencies.

60
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Broadband on the other hand which in some cases

61
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
is used for cable television also uses coaxial cable.

62
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Broadband allows for multiple signals to be sent across the wire at any given time.

63
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
If you had a cable television service which only allowed you to receive

64
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
a single television station that wouldn’t be a very good service.

65
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Broadband on the other hands allows for multiple signals

66
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
to be sent across a single coaxial cable at any given time.

67
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.000
So once again broadband television uses coaxial cable which is similar to the

68
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
coaxial cable that was use in the early Ethernet implementations.
