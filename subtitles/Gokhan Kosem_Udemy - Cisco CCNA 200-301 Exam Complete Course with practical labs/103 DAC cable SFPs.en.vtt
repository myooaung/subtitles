00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Another copper cable you may come across is a direct attachment cable or DAC cable.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This cable comes in various lense up to 15 meters

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
users copper Twinax and has SFPs on each end.

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
An SFP or Small form-factor Pluggable is a hot pluggable transceiver

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and may support various media type such as fiber or copper.

6
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
thus replaces GBIC or Gigabit Interface Converters

7
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and the one showing here is an enhanced small foam pluggable or SFP+

8
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that supports data rates up to 10 Gbps.

9
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So a DAC cable is inserted into an SFP+ slot

10
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and allows for a 10 Gbps connection between 2 devices.

11
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Other SFPs or SFP+s will support fiber

12
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
that can go to the greater lengths.

13
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
But this cable allows for 10 Gigabit copper connectivity

14
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
between 2 devices over a short distance such as 7 meters.
