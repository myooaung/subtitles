00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
At the moment in this topology switch 2 is the root

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and we can prove that by using sh spanning-tree

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and notice the local switch is the root for VLAN 1 in the topology.

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
No other VLANs have been enabled

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
so the only Ethernet VLAN existing at the moment is VLAN 1

6
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and all ports are VLAN 1 on all the switches.

7
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
When looking at the BPDUs

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
we can see that the switch is advertising a root path cost of 0

9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and the bridge ID and root identifier are the same.

10
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
On switch 1 when we capture traffic here

11
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
it's advertising a root path cost of 4

12
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and you can see that the bridge identifier is different to the root identifier

13
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So on switch 1, let’s change the spanning-tree vlan 1 root

14
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
so I'll change the switch to become the root and in this case, it’ll be the primary root

15
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
that will drop the priority of the switch.

16
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
previously the switch was using a default priority

17
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
which we can see in the Wireshark capture

18
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
it was 32768 + the VLAN number but now sh spanning-tree

19
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
shows us that the switch priority has been reduced

20
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
to a value lower than any current root bridge.

21
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So the switches now become the root of the Spanning Tree topology.

22
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Bridge MAC address and root MAC address is the same.

23
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So these are our first Wireshark capture

24
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and if I scroll down to the latest advertisements.

25
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Notice the root path cost is 0.

26
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Bridge ID and root identifier are the same, the priorities have been reduced.

27
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So this switch is root with the lower priority.

28
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
You can see that the bridge priority is 24576

29
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
extended system ID is 1 bacause this is VLAN 1

30
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and the MAC address of the switch is set to the following.

31
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So once again, if we look at the Wireshark capture

32
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
this is capture 114 at the moment.

33
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Previously the root identifier and bridge identifier were different.

34
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Now, what about switch 2 previously this switch was the root.

35
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000
So notice on capture 1, this switch previously had the root path cost of 0

36
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
but scrolling down through the captures

37
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
you can now see that it has a root path cost of 4.

38
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Its local bridge identifier has a higher priority.

39
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
So this switch is no longer the Spanning Tree root.

40
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Previously on the switch 3, this was the root port.

41
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
So here's the output you can see that gigabit 0/0

42
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
was the root port on switch 3.

43
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
What is it now? So sh spanning-tree

44
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
notice gigabit 0/1 is the root port at the moment.

45
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
so previously on switch 3 this was the root port

46
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
but the root port is now changed to this port

47
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
because this switch is now the Spanning Tree root.

48
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
the path cost using this link is 4

49
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
where's now the path cost using this link would be 4 + 4

50
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
in other words 8 to get to the root bridge.

51
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Spanning tree topologies can dynamically change

52
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.000
so as an example, if on switch 3 has shut down gigabit 0/1

53
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and type sh spanning-tree

54
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000
What we can see now is that gigabit 0/0 is now the root port

55
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
as this port is no longer available.

56
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:08.000
If I no shut that interface and type sh spanning-tree

57
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and see the interface is coming up.

58
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.000
What you can see now is that gigabit 0/1 has become the root port once again

59
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
where's this port is now blocking to stop a Spanning Tree loop.
