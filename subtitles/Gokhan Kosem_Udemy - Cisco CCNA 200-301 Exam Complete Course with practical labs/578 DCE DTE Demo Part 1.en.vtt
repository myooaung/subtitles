00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:05.670
In this example I've got three physical rod is connected as follows.

2
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:13.680
Rotto one is connected via serial one slash 0 to Rodda two on cereal One solution is zero.

3
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.940
These two rhodos 1841 Cecka Radhe Radhe.

4
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.770
One is connected to a 17:21 using serial zeros.

5
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.050
Zero is zero.

6
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.900
They're using back to back serial cables.

7
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.910
One of the first things you want to do when checking your cabling in a back to back lab environment

8
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:42.580
like this is using the command show controllers serial and then choosing your interface.

9
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.390
So serial 0 1 0.

10
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.380
Now this come on gives you a lot of output.

11
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.690
You can ignore all of it except the piece that we're interested in over here the shows us that this

12
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.540
interface is a DTV interface.

13
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.400
It's a 35 cable connected to the Rodda.

14
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.550
Clocks are currently detected

15
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.170
on serial 0 slushes 0 0.

16
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.770
So here's the command.

17
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.730
This interface is a DC 35 cable with a clock rate to configure it.

18
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.960
So let's pipe both of those and include 35

19
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.550
is the one interface and there's the other interface.

20
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.070
So notice serial 1 slash is 0 0 is a DTV cable.

21
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:48.490
So in other words the DTV son or the cable is connected to this interface but a DC cable is connected

22
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:55.580
to this interface so we'd need to do the clock rate on serial 0 slash is zero on the local router.

23
00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:04.550
But on this interface the clock rate would be configured on the other side so the router to show controllers

24
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:16.510
serial is 0 1 0 and in the output here you can see that it's a v 35 interface with a clock right now

25
00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.840
on the DC side.

26
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:27.400
So interface serial 0 1 0 0 0 you need to specify the clock rate of the interface.

27
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.470
Now this in the real world would be set by your service provider.

28
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:39.820
So the telco or PC and provider that you are using which could be AT&amp;T or one of those providers pitch

29
00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:46.950
here because it's a back to back cable we need to set the relevant clock rate and you know some of the

30
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.220
clock rates that we could set some of them seem to face dependent so as an example I'll set the clock

31
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.130
rate to 64 kilobits per second.

32
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.700
This command is in bits per second.

33
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.570
So be careful.

34
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.770
The speed of that command is in bits per second.

35
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.360
Now the router doesn't know the actual speed of an interface.

36
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:18.970
So if we come on do show run interface serial 0 1 0 we can see the clock rate but show interface serial

37
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.730
1 slash is zero

38
00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:32.310
shows us that this router believes that its physical interface speed is 1.5 four megabits per second.

39
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.430
So in other words T1.

40
00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:41.900
So its important that you set the bandwidth statement correctly for your serial interfaces.

41
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:48.560
It's not unlike Internet where the interface knows at what speed it's sending traffic and receiving

42
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.500
traffic.

43
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.020
You have to actually configure it so should do show run interface.

44
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.130
Cereal is 0 1 0.

45
00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.720
Shows us the clock rate and the bandwidth.

46
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.540
They should obviously match ones in kilobits per second.

47
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.120
Ones in bits per second.

48
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.570
Now the clock rate command is only valid on a DC interface.

49
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:21.450
So on this site on serial 0 1 0 that interface connected to reality too good a DTV cable.

50
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:29.850
So if we use the command clock rate 64 thousand noticed we told that the command only applies to DC

51
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:35.970
interfaces so you can set the clock rate but you have to set the bandwidth of the interface to match

52
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.880
the clock rate that's been configured.

53
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.300
So once again that's typically done by your service provider or DC.

54
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:54.670
In this example because the DC is on the router so it's configured on that interface.

55
00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:02.490
We need to configure the clock rate on the DC side of the back to about cable but to specify the bandwidth

56
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.190
on both sides.

57
00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:11.090
So bandwidth is configured on the side bandwidth and clock rate are configured on that site on this

58
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.790
interface.

59
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:21.090
This is the DC and once again we can see that by tapping show controllers serial zero slash there is

60
00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:33.510
zero and what you can see in that output of that command is the DCC the clock rate set here is to make.

61
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.360
So we need to configure that right.

62
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:41.120
And let's just assume in our example that we're going to set at 256 kilobits per second.

63
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:49.580
So we need to set back to 56 K and then set the clock rate to fifty six thousand.

64
00:05:49.960 --> 00:06:02.100
So show interface serial 0 0 noticed the bandwidth is 56 kilobits per second make sure that the band

65
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:08.510
with statement is configured correctly as per the clock rate this command actually sets the physical

66
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.680
speed of the interface.

67
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:18.200
This command tells routing protocols like a whisper funny-I GOP what the speed of the interface is highly.

68
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:24.790
Running protocols don't query the clock rate because that may be set by an external DCD device.

69
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:30.930
So on a one sure SCDP neighbor we can see a neighbor or two on this.

70
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:41.490
A local interface that is in 1841 and it's using Sariel one slash Zira the 17:21 is connected to a local

71
00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.500
Saral interface using Sariel one.

72
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:52.120
So there should be cereal one and the side is the DTG.

73
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:59.470
So some things to remember the defaulting cancellation on a serial interface on a Cisco router is HGL

74
00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.850
see which we can see over there.

75
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:10.110
You set the clock rate on the DC side keep alive lives a sent every ten seconds to check that the interfaces

76
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:19.410
up Chessie to the neighbor who says shows me that I made a mistake in the diagram should be routed to

77
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:27.620
as shown over there so Ratatouille is connected to the 1841 router.

78
00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:28.870
Here it is.

79
00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:39.790
So show CGP neighbor is connected to a number of devices but thats the one that we interested in it's

80
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:45.760
several interfaces connected to the serial interface of the 1841 router.

81
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.490
So what I'll do is configure an IP address while we hear

82
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:56.770
with the relevant mosque and let's do the same on this route and then we will do some tests.

83
00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:07.640
So IP address tend to add 1 to 1 to 1 on the first serial interface and then on serial interface serial

84
00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:16.020
0 1 0 and then on the other end to face 1 9 10 1 to 2 to 1.

85
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:28.580
So hopefully at this point it should be able to ping the 17:21 which it can and then on the second 1841

86
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:41.520
Radha get an IP address on and it should be able to ping 10 1 1 1 rather 10 1 on 1 which it can do is

87
00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:43.630
running between those two routers.

88
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:48.390
The relationship has come up show show IP is P.F. neighbor.

89
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.760
See the full relationship has taken place.

90
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.660
Notice the full relationship.

91
00:08:53.660 --> 00:09:01.030
The shows as a dash because it's a point to point link in this example using HTL see once again show

92
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:03.970
interface serials 0 0 0

93
00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:15.090
0 0 1 0 notice encapsulation has a deal see on the 17:21

94
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:24.260
router SPF 1 network and now enable OSPF and all interfaces

95
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:30.190
can see the relationship here is come up.

96
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:40.490
So the 17:21 should be able to ping the router show IP who is PEF neighbor.

97
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:50.090
We can see two full relationships are established and now the 17:21 campaign the second 1841 Rodda.
