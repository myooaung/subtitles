00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:07.300
You may come across different cereal when interface cards as an example you may come across a week one

2
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:13.390
t or when interface card one t which allows for one serial cable.

3
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:22.620
Or you may come across a week to t which allows two serial connections using smart serial cables.

4
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.420
You may also come across different types of serial when network interface cards or name cards such as

5
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.240
a name 1 T or NUM two T or NUM 40.

6
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.770
Here's an example of a name to T.

7
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:43.160
There are two smart serial connections on the SIM card which you would insert in a router such as this

8
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.240
example.

9
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:51.200
So a two port serial name would be inserted into num slot on the router and in this example it would

10
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.420
provide you two serial connections so weak once again is a Wayne interface card.

11
00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:03.620
A weak one t allows for a single connection and a quick to t would allow you to have two serial connections

12
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.740
using that single weak card.

13
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:14.960
So in this example the right on the left is using a single Wick one T and A V 35 serial cable would

14
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.630
be connected to the wick one t using this part of the connection and the other part of the connection

15
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:27.350
would be connected to the C issue D issue the right on the left using a wick to T.

16
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.900
So this part of the connection would be connected to the wick to t and this part of the connection would

17
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.620
be connected to the C issue DC.

18
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.630
This is an example once again of a V 35 cable.
