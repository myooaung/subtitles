00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:08.130
A link state request requesting full LSA information from the neighboring Rada the neighboring Rada

2
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.370
will send what's called a linked state update which is a packet that contains links that advertisements

3
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.050
and as mentioned is typically sent in response to a linked state request.

4
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.660
This contains detailed information about the link state database rather than just an overview of it

5
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.190
which was contained in the database description links state acknowledgements acknowledge or confirm

6
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.990
receipt of the link state update.

7
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:40.380
Message an autonomous system is a grouping of rorters under common administrative domain.

8
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:47.150
So let's assume that the rot is contained within the blue portion or running of SPF within a single

9
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.530
autonomous system.

10
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.290
They may be connecting to other orders under another administer of domain or another company's control

11
00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.590
that is running up for example o SPF is an IGP Ontario Gateway Protocol.

12
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.260
In other words it's used within an autonomous system so within your organization you may have multiple

13
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:13.500
routers running SDF within the same autonomous system for scalability OSP if networks are broken up

14
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.940
into areas.

15
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.930
Now there's debate about this but Cisco would recommend never more than 50 routers within a single SDF

16
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.940
area.

17
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.750
In your studies in the future you may come across different figures but that's a good rule of thumb

18
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:36.870
to use 0 SPF uses a hierarchical model in that you always have a SPF area 0 when you have more than

19
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.430
one area.

20
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.480
It is possible to run a SPF in another area.

21
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.220
Let's say Area 1.

22
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.050
But that's only true if you have a single area.

23
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:54.180
If you've got multiple areas you have to have area zero which is known as the backbone area all traffic

24
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.550
from one area to area one to another area.

25
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.020
Let's say Area 2 will traverse the backbone so what you do is you break up your network into multiple

26
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:11.820
areas following the physical topology with the view to optimize summarization and reduce routine table

27
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.360
updates and links state advertisements.

28
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.170
Certain types of LSA can be contained within an area so the flooding of LSA is throughout the network

29
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:30.240
is stopped by breaking up the network into multiple areas routers that border the backbone area and

30
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:39.930
another area are known as Area border routers or a B Rs the 3 rod is highlighted here or a bypass because

31
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.990
they have one interface in area zero and another interface in another area.

32
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:55.740
One of the advantages of AP RS is that they allow for summarization of routes if aerial 1 contains ruts

33
00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.610
10 1 1 0 up to 10 1 100 0 and an area 2.

34
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.410
We have need to extend to 1 0 up to 10 to 100 0.

35
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.500
An area 3 10 3 1 0 up to 10 3 100 0.

36
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:20.090
Those routes can be summarized on a Rs so you could say these 100 rods will be summarized as a single

37
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.830
rod on this ADR so slash 60 lost is used.

38
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.380
To summarize these hundred drops the same could be done yeah.

39
00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.490
10 to 00 such 16 is a summary of these ruts.

40
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.640
And lastly 10 3 0 0.

41
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.800
That 16 is a summary of these rocks.

42
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.510
This does require careful planning and good IP design.

43
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.510
This Rada is known as an autonomous system Bodo Rada or ACR.

44
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.850
It borders two autonomous systems.

45
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.790
In this case we've got rip on the left hand side and 0 SDF on the right hand side.

46
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:06.150
Even if all of these rowdies including the rip Rada were within your organization this Rada would still

47
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:12.930
be known as an ISP or because its connecting one routing process up to another writing process.

48
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.760
In this case of SPF.

49
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.860
So from an O SPF point of view this is an autonomous system.

50
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:29.890
Order Roorda these six riders all have interfaces within area zero and therefore known as backbone routers.

51
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:38.340
When traffic is sent from one area to another area it has to traverse the backbone to reach the destination.

52
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:45.720
So these three rafters in the backbone are used to allow the traffic to flow from area one to Area 2

53
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:54.610
0 SPF once again requires a good design with all areas connecting to the backbone area as traffic flows

54
00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:02.140
from one area to another area through the backbone area these highlighted roads are known as internal

55
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:11.200
routers they are internal to their specific areas ISP for orders use hellos to form neighbor relationships

56
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:19.760
or adjacencies the hello protocol once again establishes and maintains neighbor relationships by ensuring

57
00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.260
bi directional.

58
00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:28.430
In other words two way communication between neighbors bi directional communication occurs when a rider

59
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.480
recognizes itself listed in the hello packet received from a neighbor.

60
00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:41.060
Others are sent using multicast address 2 2 4 0 0 5 and contain the following information for neighbor

61
00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.430
relationships to be formed.

62
00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:48.900
It's important to remember that certain parameters have to match on both riders.

63
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:57.580
Now the first field containing a hello is the router I.D. a router I.D. identifies the specific router

64
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:06.830
and is used in various scenarios in SPF including the election of a designated Raptor or backup designated

65
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:16.000
Rata a router I.D. is chosen per router based on the highest IP address of any configured interface.

66
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:23.630
When SPF is enabled on the router or on the highest loop back interface active on the router when 0

67
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:32.030
SPF is enabled or it can be manually specified using the Rada I.D. command so to demonstrate that you

68
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:39.800
have a rod Rado 1 show off the interface brief will show me the relevant interfaces on the strata and

69
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.410
what I'm going to do is I'm going to shut down all the interfaces and show you that OSP is not able

70
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:50.390
to select a router I.D. If the interfaces are all shut down

71
00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:05.880
so show IP interface brief again shows me that all of my interfaces are administratively shut down global

72
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:16.580
config mode topping the command Rada in this case 0 SPF and a protest I.D. will allow me to enable a

73
00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:26.330
if on this router the process I.D. allows for the differentiation of multiple OSP if instances running

74
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:32.680
on the same Rata that can become important in multiple protocol label switching environments or NPL

75
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:40.100
place environments for this course you'll only run a single Oh SPF process on a router but note multiple

76
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:48.830
processes can be enabled on our audit now notice what the road is says no Ruda I.D..

77
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:57.190
Oh SPF process one failed to allocate a unique Rada I.D. and therefore cannot start topping.

78
00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:07.840
Come on do show IP protocol shows that the routing protocol in use is 0 SPF 1 but the Rada I.D. is 0

79
00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.090
0 0 0.

80
00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:21.550
0 SPF is not running correctly on this route to show IP interface brief lets enable this interface so

81
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:23.020
interface is 0 0.

82
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:25.300
No shut.

83
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:31.950
So what I'll do is I'll remove SPF and then I'll rename below SPF

84
00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:48.660
notice there's no complaint to show IP protocols shows me that the Rada I.D. is 10 1 1 1 to show of

85
00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:55.630
the interface brief shows me that this IP address has become the Rada I.D..

86
00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:03.570
The reason why is the Rada I.D. is chosen based on the highest IP address of any active interface.

87
00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:06.220
When their writing process is enabled.

88
00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:09.400
So if I enabled for instance these two interfaces

89
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:26.170
as follows and then top to command do show IP interface brief

90
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:36.360
you'll see that these interfaces the first Ethan interface and the two serial interfaces are up up do

91
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:47.510
show IP protocols schools shows that the Rada I.D. is 10 1 1 1 I've just changed the encapsulation back

92
00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:52.060
to its default so I still see and the interfaces come up again.

93
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:59.900
But what I'd like you to see is that the Rada I.D. still remains as 10 1 1 1 and I can do that command

94
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:12.790
again to show IP protocols notice the Rada I.D. 10 1 1 1 I can do this Come on clear IP 0 SPF process

95
00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:17.390
to clear the 0 SPF process and let's see if that makes any difference.

96
00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:30.590
So show IP protocol and as you can see the Rada I.D. remains the same but if I removed I was P.F. and

97
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:32.390
then rename old or SPF

98
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:46.980
noticed the Rada ideas changed to 10 1 5 1 So what the Rada has done is it looked for the highest IP

99
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.750
address on any active interface.

100
00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:59.010
When 0 SPF was enabled this time when 0 SPF was enabled 10 1 5 1 was the highest IP address on any active

101
00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:04.020
physical interface so it was chosen as the Rada I.D..

102
00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:12.020
Now what happens if we enable the loop back you'll notice the loop back has the lowest IP address one

103
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:24.150
is far lower than 10 so no shot that you show IP protocol you can see the Rada I.D. stole 10 1 5 1 0

104
00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:25.460
do it again.

105
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:34.560
Right I.D. is still 10 1 5 1 but if I remove 0 SPF and then re enable it

106
00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:40.540
notice the Rada ideas now quadruple 1

107
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:54.860
so the rule again 0 SPF Rada I.D. is chosen based on the highest IP address of any physical interface

108
00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:59.090
that is active when the SPF process is enabled.

109
00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:07.520
But if there is a loop back that is active the loop back overrides the physical interfaces and the loop

110
00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:15.620
back is used as the Rada I.D. loop ex have the advantage that they never go down unless manually shut

111
00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:16.530
down.

112
00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:19.790
This has multiple advantages including stability.

113
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:26.840
If my Rada I.D. was originally 10 1 1 1 and the right to reloaded assuming that there were no loop backs

114
00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:31.240
enabled the Rada idea would have changed to 10 1 5 1.

115
00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:37.040
So the Rada I.D. number could have changed but with the loop back the Rada I.D. would remain as quadruple

116
00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.090
1.

117
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:43.100
As long as there were no other loop ex configured on the strata so it doesn't matter what the physical

118
00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:52.340
interfaces or safety it recommended to set the Rada I.D. manually using this command and set it to a

119
00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:54.550
relevant loop back.

120
00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:59.420
In this case I'm just going to set it to some arbitrary value to show you that you can set it to 1 9

121
00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:10.730
2 1 6 8 1 not 1 which is not an IP address on my local rata to show IP protocol allows me to see that

122
00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:14.680
the Rada I.D. is 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 1.

123
00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:20.660
Now it's recommended practice to set the Rada I.D. to one of the loot banks on your Rada.

124
00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.600
So I'm going to set the Rada I.D. to quadruple 1

125
00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.480
as you can see yeah.

126
00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:37.120
The Rada ideas changed to quadruple 1 the hello packet then contains the hello and did intervals which

127
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:43.570
must be the same on both rowdies is otherwise an adjacency or neighbour relationship will not be formed.

128
00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:48.490
It then contains the list of neighbours that the rotten knows about.

129
00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:49.960
That's our rotten nose.

130
00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:56.790
If there's two way communication because it recognises itself in the list of neighbours that it receives

131
00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:04.210
in the hello packet it then contains the area I.D. which must also match on both fraud as it then contains

132
00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:10.850
a rod of property which can be used in designated route and backup designated Rada elections.

133
00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:18.350
It then contains the designated Rada or D or IP address backup designate Rada or DDR IP address.

134
00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:23.310
We're going to talk more about designated routers and backup designated routers in a moment.

135
00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.250
It then contains the authentication password.

136
00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:32.370
Now there are various ways to set up authentication including clear text and Indy five hashing.

137
00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.510
We'll talk more about those later.

138
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.670
The authentication password needs to be the same.

139
00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:40.290
Otherwise the relationship will not be formed.

140
00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:44.630
And then lastly the stub area flag needs to be the same.

141
00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:50.860
The step area flag denotes whether this is a stub area or a normal area.

142
00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:54.310
We'll talk more about stub areas once again in later slides.
