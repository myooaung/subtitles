00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:08.010
The configuration register is a 16 bit number once again that resides in the nv ram of a router.

2
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:16.050
It affects Rodda behavior the least significant bits of the configuration register are called the boot

3
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:23.580
field and this determines how the router locates Cisco Iowas software the configuration register is

4
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.470
16 bits in size but is displayed once again in hexadecimal.

5
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:36.360
You'll have access to the configuration register software which is part of the score's and this allows

6
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.470
you to see the various options of the binary bits that make up the configuration register the default

7
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.640
value of the configuration register is once again 0 0 2 1 0 2.

8
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.370
We can see that there are 16 bits that make up the configuration register the least significant but

9
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.060
but zero.

10
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.090
And that goes up to 15.

11
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.170
So this first number in hexadecimal is the most significant.

12
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:13.020
This last two contains the least significant four bits which is the boot field.

13
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:22.070
We can configure the configuration register as follows through the Cisco IOS but you can change the

14
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:31.160
valleys so as an example if you want to set the speed of the console to 1 1 5 200 bits per second rather

15
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:37.660
than the default of 9600 bits per second you could configure the configuration register as follows.

16
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.290
Sending it back to default the speed is not changed back to 9600 bits per second.

17
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.010
If you change it to 2 1 4 to.

18
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.970
That means that but 6 is set which means ignore nv ram.

19
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:04.670
That means that the router will boot up and not to load the startup config which is very useful when

20
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.460
doing Ponsford recovery.

21
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:10.340
There are various other options here.

22
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.100
You can also look at the Cisco documentation

23
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.270
which shows the what the configuration register values mean.

24
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:31.090
So if you want to see this on a web page there's an example of 0 x 2 1 4 2 which means ignore nonvolatile

25
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.780
RAM.

26
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.700
So it ignores the configuration and the speed is set to 9600 bits per second.

27
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.580
But otherwise you can use the software which you get as part of the course.

28
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.220
If you want to see what various options are.

29
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.700
So once again if we change the speed to 11 5 200.

30
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.310
Notice these bits are set.

31
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:59.940
But 12 but 11 but 5 and put one.

32
00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.350
If we change the speed to 9200

33
00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.330
noticed other values are set but 12 and this example is not set.

34
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.310
But if I check that option.

35
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.530
Notice the speed of the console port is changed for the CCN a course.

36
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:25.610
The values that you want to know are 2 1 0 2 which means normal boot.

37
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.700
If we change it to 2 1 0 0 0 that means that the router is going to boot into run monitor mode.

38
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.630
To 140 means by postes startup configuration

39
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:49.690
and to 1 is 0 1 means boot into boot mode is supported on older Cisco routers.

40
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.400
They had a mini Iowas called aurochs boot.

41
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.470
Modern routers don't have that.

42
00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:02.840
A value of 2 1 0 1 means that the ratable boot up using the first operating system in Flash.
