00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:15.640
Is this is one of multiple videos discussing layer 3 switching in a previous video I showed you how

2
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.990
to configure a switch with the last three functionality.

3
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:29.020
So I showed you how to enable IP routing on a switch to allow that switch to rot between one villain

4
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.060
and another.

5
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:38.160
We also configured two routers to act as PCs and we were able to ping from one router to another.

6
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:46.760
What I'll do now is extend the typology by bringing some Daka PCs.

7
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.920
These are essentially lightweight PCs that allow us to boot up Linux very quickly.

8
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.270
So what I'll do on the first PC

9
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.500
is configure it in a fourth villaine

10
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:17.460
so I'll give it an IP address of 10 1 for one and a default gateway of 10 1 4 2 5 4 losses set to the

11
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:31.310
DNS server to 10 1 4 2 5 4 I click safe all connect the PC to get it to 0 to on the switch.

12
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.940
So these two ports are in violent two and three.

13
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:45.590
And what we'll do now is configure the port in villaine for I'll start up the Daka PC and open up a

14
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:46.670
console to it.

15
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:54.260
So here's the console life config shows us the IP address of the PC.

16
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.030
One of the advantages of Daka is that it boots up extremely quickly.

17
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.620
So it was almost an instant pood.

18
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.990
Now the PC can't ping the switch because we need to configure the switch.

19
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.440
So at the moment pings are failing.

20
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.900
So go into the switch and have a look at the interfaces configured to show IP interface brief.

21
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:28.470
Notice we don't have a layer 3 interface in violent for we need to configure the IP address on the switch

22
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.160
to allow that PC to paying out a villain for.

23
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:42.950
We also need to configure villaine for and put the interface into villain for TV land for show veel

24
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.220
and brief.

25
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:51.100
We've now created a villain for and it's been added to the villain database.

26
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.160
That however does not create the VI or virtual switched interface.

27
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:04.960
We need to type interface a villain for to create the SVOD and configure the IP address on the switch.

28
00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.540
So show IP interface brief.

29
00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.870
The FBI has created IP addresses assigned but the interface is down.

30
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:28.110
So we need to know shut it show up the interface brief again allows us to see the interface but it's

31
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:38.730
currently down because no interfaces have been allocated to that villain so we need to put this interface

32
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:48.870
into Villon for the switchboard access the landfall.

33
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:55.780
Now when we use the command show IP interface brief we should see that the interface comes up that may

34
00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:05.480
not happen immediately but after a while we should see that that interface comes up assuming that gigabit

35
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:16.470
0 to is in the right to reveal and which it is and assuming that that interfaces up up which it is noticed

36
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:26.480
now Villon landfall was up set back on the PC previously the PC couldn't paying its default gateway

37
00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:38.030
but now it can and hopefully it will be able to ping Rodda to which it can and we can prove that by

38
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.120
looking at Rodda too.

39
00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:52.130
I'm currently running a debug so show debug on Rodda to shows that IP ICMP debugging is enabled so we

40
00:04:52.130 --> 00:05:01.400
should be able to ping wrote to and see the debugs which we do.

41
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:09.460
We should also be able to ping brought a one which we can once again this PC has an IP address of 10

42
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.230
one for one on the road at acting's PC two.

43
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.120
We should be able to paying that PC which we can.

44
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:28.870
So we've now enabled three lands on the slave three switch I'll configure a full thing to face and connect

45
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:38.350
it to the second Daka PC I'll change the IP address of that PC

46
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:49.460
to 10 to 1 5 to 1 default gateways 10 1 5 2 4 4.

47
00:05:50.070 --> 00:06:01.760
And they'll set the DNS server to tend to add 1.5 to 2 5 4 clicks safe start up the PC open up a console

48
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.440
to get PCs booted.

49
00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:18.040
So I have config IP addresses 10 1 5 1 PC will not be able to ping the first PC on the left until we've

50
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:27.700
configured the switch so configured the switch while leaving that ping going in the background.

51
00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:38.620
So first thing we need to do is configure a V line so convert the villain 5 in this case so show V line

52
00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.160
brief the line 5 is created.

53
00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.600
PC can still not paying the other PC yet.

54
00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:55.750
Because we have to put the interface into the right v line gigabit.

55
00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.590
0 3 is currently in villaine one.

56
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:12.670
So interface gigabit to 0 3 switch port access a villain 5 show interface give to 0 3 switch port the

57
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.100
port is now in the land 5.

58
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:22.730
But the PC can still not paying PC 1 because we have to create a switched virtual interface.

59
00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:27.950
We have a switch to a virtual interface for villaine for but not for Wii land 5.

60
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:43.740
So interface villaine 5 IP address 10 1 5 2 5 4 0 no shut it interface villaine 5 is come up show spending

61
00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:49.560
tree ports are forwarding and pings are starting to succeed.

62
00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:56.630
So a PC to ping PC one.

63
00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:07.260
So I've now got four interfaces on the slave three switch configured into villaine routing I've configured

64
00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:11.730
the villans and configured into villans rotting on the switch.

65
00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:15.090
In other words it's acting as a layer 3 switch.

66
00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:17.560
That's because the IP writing is enabled.

67
00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:23.520
If I disable IP routing on the switch the pings will fail.

68
00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:27.920
Notice the sequence numbers at forty nine meant stop.

69
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.020
They define enable IP routing.

70
00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:34.060
Notice the pings start succeeding once again.

71
00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:41.970
You need to have IP rodding enabled on a switch to allow it to do interval and routing as well as to

72
00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:45.020
allow it to support rodding protocols.

73
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:50.400
So that was an example of how to configure a laya 3 switch into VLAN routing.

74
00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.720
I hope you found the video useful if it's been of benefit to you.

76
00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.430
I wish you all the very best.
