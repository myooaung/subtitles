00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Some terms that you will need to understand with regards to routing protocols

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000
include Autonomous System, Interior Gateway Protocol or Internal Gateway Protocol

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
eExterior Gateway Protocol or External Gateway Protocol.

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The first term AS or Autonomous System is a  grouping of networks

5
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
under a single administrative domain

6
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
in other words, the routers within an autonomous system

7
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000
such as AS 1 are under the control of a group of people or a company

8
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
as an example, this autonomous system on the left could be Coke's Autonomous  System

9
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
this autonomous system could be Pepsi’s Autonomous  System

10
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
it's very unlikely that Coke are going to allow Pepsi to manage their network

11
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
or that Pepsi are going to allow Coke to manage their network.

12
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
They are separate autonomous systems under different people's control

13
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
or different administrative control or under a different companies control

14
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
routers in the Coke AS are under the control of Coca-Cola  Employees

15
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
rather than Pepsi Employees, this is a separate Autonomous System

16
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
various interior or Internal Gateway Protocols or IGPs

17
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
can be used within an Autonomous System

18
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
example would include RIP, EIGRP, OSPF and ISIS.

19
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
EGPs or Exterior Gateway Protocols are used between Autonomous Systems.

20
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.000
The EGP that’s in used today between autonomous system is BGP or Border Gateway
Protocol.

21
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So if this autonomous system was a Company that needed to connect to the Internet

22
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
they would connect to their ISP or Internet Service Provider using BGP

23
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
within the Autonomous System, they may be using OSPF

24
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
as the Interior Gateway Protocol but BGP is the protocol used

25
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
between their Autonomous Systems and the ISP

26
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
they will be learning about Internet routes through BGP.

27
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Now only very large companies generally run BGP

28
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and receive routes from their ISP using BGP.

29
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
however, ISP’s which  carry routes of customers in the Internet run BGP.

30
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
So we may have an ISP on the left-hand side

31
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and an ISP on the right-hand side

32
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and they would be running BGP between them.

33
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
internally in their Autonomous Systems

34
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
or AS's they may be running  different routing protocols.

35
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
so as an example, OSPF could be used in autonomous system 1

36
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and ISIS could be used in Autonomous System 2.

37
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Each ISP determines which routing protocol to use internally

38
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
but they connect to one another using BGP.

39
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Now autonomous systems are registered numbers

40
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
in a similar way to IP addresses on the Internet.

41
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
You can't just use any autonomous system when connecting to the Internet.

42
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
so before you connect to the Internet using BGP

43
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
you would register an Autonomous System number.

44
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
There are private Autonomous System numbers that can be used without registration

45
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
so within an Autonomous System you could use a private AS number

46
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
or you could use any other number as long as you're not connecting to the Internet

47
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
but as soon as you connect to the Internet

48
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
you will need to use a publicly registered Autonomous System number

49
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
or an Autonomous System number allocated to you by your ISP.

50
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Now this wouldn’t apply to you if you're using static routes

51
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:10.000
or once again if a private Autonomous System number has been allocated to you by your
ISP

52
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
but for very large networks or if you want to create your own Internet Service
Provider

53
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
the Autonomous System number that you use will need to be registered.
