1
00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:09.650
So exit out of the telnet session from Route 3 1 to rotisserie and we can see some translations taking

2
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:16.790
place show IP net translation we can see up to net translations in the table which will Time-Out off

3
00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.240
to a period of time.

4
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:31.230
Wrote A for last exit of the telnet session Currently we've got those two net translation increase.

5
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.710
Let's do a why shock capture someone kept showing the outside interface.

6
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.740
And in this case let's look at what's arriving at rodders 3.

7
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.630
So what's arriving on that port.

8
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:57.540
I'm going to full to this for telnet and on router 1 or Telenet to rotisserie where you can see the

9
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:07.580
telnet data so some telnet to negotiation taking place and we being prompted for a password.

10
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.100
So we see this in the Why Shock capture.

11
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:22.860
What I'll do is Antropov sort of Siska and log in and you can see see I see oh there's the Cisco loggin

12
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.840
password.

13
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:32.090
But what's important to notice is the traffic is coming from a source of 8 to 1 1 1 going to 8 1 1 2.

14
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.990
So it looks like all appears like the traffic is coming from this host going to this host.

15
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.930
Whereas in actual fact the traffic is coming from our one.

16
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.620
But in the wide shot capture we can see that all the communication is between 8 1 1 2 and 8 1 1 1.

17
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.780
So in this example the rotatory prompt is being sent from rotatory to Route 1.

18
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:05.470
Let's stop that capture and have a look at it on the site so I'll have a look at it on the switch.

19
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.640
So on this part of the network here

20
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:20.130
we'll do a full telnet once again and I'll exit out of the telnet session notice this was still part

21
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.890
of the same telnet session.

22
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:36.520
But notice now the address is from 10 1 1 1 2 8 1 1 2 his e x y t.

23
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.050
And then we have the session closed.

24
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:48.390
So in this example the traffic is from this IP address as the source to this IP address is the destination.

25
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.450
But when it's on this interface it's changed to a 2 1 1 1.

26
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.440
So that's an example of that in real time.

27
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.830
Let's do it with two devices.

28
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.930
I'll do the caption now on the side but have to telnet sessions going at the same time

29
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:22.620
so telnet wrote a one telnet to the rotisserie and router for telnet to rotisserie.

30
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.100
No it isn't all the output.

31
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.110
You only see 8 1 1 1 communicating with 8 1 1 2.

32
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:37.810
You don't see that the communication is actually from Rotto 1 and rockfall in all the output it looks

33
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.050
like it's the same two devices communicating with each other.

34
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:50.870
Whereas in actual fact there are multiple devices communicating here and not just a single source device

35
00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.480
talking to a single destination device.

36
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.990
Now you can see that by looking at the port numbers.

37
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.160
So for this session the port number is 1 9 2 0 7.

38
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.250
That's part of the same session 1 9 2 0 7.

39
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:13.920
But notice here it's a different session number 3 2 4 5 7 3 2 4 5 7.

40
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:23.370
If we look at the net translations show IP net translation we can see the actual port numbers used by

41
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:33.030
the devices in the sessions so 3 2 4 5 7 scrolling down 19 to 7.

42
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.790
So this is the first device 10 1 1 1 and yes the second one 10 1 1 4.
