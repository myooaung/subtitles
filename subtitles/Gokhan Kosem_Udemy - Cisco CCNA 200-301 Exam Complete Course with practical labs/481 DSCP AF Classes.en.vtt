1
00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.180
So in DCP we are marking at least three.

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.980
We're using the type of service field in an IP version for header for example but only six bits of the

3
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.920
header are used when the six bits are set to zeros.

4
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:24.600
That's known as best effort class elect a value still exist so as an example if it's set to this that's

5
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.720
IP precedence or one or class selector one.

6
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.510
But in addition they have what are called assured forwarding classes.

7
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.390
We have a shared forwarding class of one should forwarding class to three and four.

8
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:46.530
So we have these new classes should forwarding Class 1 two 3 and 4.

9
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.470
This number indicates the first three binary bits in the type of service field but assured forwarding

10
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.270
classes have numbers such as 0 1 2

11
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.190
and 3.

12
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.400
So should forwarding Class 1 actually has three values.

13
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:27.860
There's a f 1 1 F 1 2 and a f 1 3 so the first 3 binary bits gives you your class so a f 1.

14
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:35.270
The second two binary bits gives you the second number and this is known as the drop a probability.

15
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.850
How probable is it that your traffic will be dropped within class a f 1.

16
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:47.240
The higher the number the more likely of your traffic being dropped within this class.

17
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.600
When this congestion and you've set up the right mechanisms this traffic will be dropped first then

18
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.280
this traffic and then that traffic within a should forwarding class to you.

19
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.040
We also have a f to 1 a f to two and a half to three.

20
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.300
The same is true for Class 3 and class for the higher the first number.

21
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:16.970
The more important your traffic but the higher the second number within a class such as a f 1 1 or f

22
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.070
1 2 F 1 3.

23
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.050
The less important your traffic the more likely that it will be dropped.
