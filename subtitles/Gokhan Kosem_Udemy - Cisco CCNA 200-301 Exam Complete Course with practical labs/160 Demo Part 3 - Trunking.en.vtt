1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
To set up communication between switch 1 and switch 2

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
these ports needs to be configured as a trunk port

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I’m also gonna configure this port as trunk port

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
so that we can capture traffic

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and see the encapsulated frames between the switches.

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Starting with switch 1 the first thing I’m gonna do is to make everything static

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
so switchport mode access on gigabit 0/0

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and then switchport nonegotiate to disable DTP to something similar

9
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
on gigabit 0/1  switchport mode access switchport nonegotiate.

10
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
do sh run

11
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:55.000
so this port 0/0 is configured as an access port in VLAN 1 DTP is disabled.

12
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Gigabit 0/1 is configured as an access port in VLAN 2, DTP is disabled.

13
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So we now need to configure ports 2 and 3 as trunk ports and disable DTP

14
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
so int g0/2 switchport mode trunk

15
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and it’s gonna fail as you can see there

16
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
because we have to type switchport trunk encapsulation

17
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and in this example we'll use dot1q

18
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and then switchport mode trunk to make it a trunk port.

19
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
A trunk port allows multiple VLANs to traverse that port

20
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
switchport nonegotiate let’s do something similar

21
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
on port 3 set the encapsulation to dot1q

22
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000
set the mode to trunk, disabled DTP and then I'll no shut those 2 ports.

23
00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:03.000
So sh int g0/2 switchport

24
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
This command shows us that gigabit 0/2 is enabled as a layer 2 interface

25
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
it's been administratively  configured as a trunk

26
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and it's operating as a trunk.

27
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
The encapsulation used is dot1q that how it was configured

28
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and that’s how it’s operating.

29
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
DTP has been disabled.

30
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
The native VLAN or untagged VLAN on this link is VLAN 1.

31
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
All VLANs are allowed across the trunk.

32
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
now we can also use the command show interfaces trunk

33
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
that shows us a nice summary of information

34
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
so port 2 and port 3 have been manually configured for trunking using 802.1Q

35
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
they are currently trunking the native VLAN as VLAN 1.

36
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
VLANs 1 to 4094 are permitted on those ports

37
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
the VLANs allowed and active in the management domain are VLANs 1 to 2.

38
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000
VLANs in the Spanning Tree forwarding states on g0/2 is 1 and 2 and on 3 is 2.

39
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
So we’ve configured switch 1 with this port being access ports.

40
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:25.000
currently, this PC is in VLAN 2 and this PC is in VLAN 1

41
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
now can router 1 ping router 2 and router 3

42
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and can routing 2 ping any of these routers?

43
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:42.000
So can router 1 turn off debugging here, ping 10.1.1.3, yes, it can.

44
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Can I ping 10.1.1.4 yes it can.

45
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000
This port allows VLAN 1 to traverse it using the untagged VLAN.

46
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
so the frame goes across this link as untagged frame

47
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
goes across this link as untagged frame

48
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and then goes across this 2 links as untagged.

49
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
switch 2 hasn’t been configured for VLANs it's using a default config

50
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
so sh vlan brief on the switch

51
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
shows that only VLAN 1 exist on switch 2

52
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
so let’s put PC 4 into VLAN 2

53
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
and let’s see if PC 4 and PC 2 can ping each other.

54
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Turn off debugging on router 2 acting as our PC

55
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
sh ip int brief

56
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
This PC has an IP address of 10.1.2.2

57
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
So I'll give this one an IP address of 10.1.2.4

58
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000
it’s currently configured with this IP address so let’s change that.

59
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:56.000
10.1.2.4 ping 10.1.2.2 what you’ll notice is the pings failed.

60
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Router 2 and router 4 cannot ping each other

61
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and the question is why?

62
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Why can’t they ping one another?

63
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Well the first problem is, we haven’t configured VLAN 2 on this switch

64
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
switch 2 and we haven’t put this port into VLAN 2.

65
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
So on switch 2

66
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
I’m gonna set it to vtp mode transparent

67
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
so that we have to manually configure everything.

68
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
I'm gonna create VLAN 2

69
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
but notice please even though you create the VLAN

70
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
no ports are put into that VLAN by default.

71
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
So sh int g0/1 switchport

72
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000
that’s this interface here, shows me that that port is in VLAN 1.

73
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
So what I need to do is go to that port.

74
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000
switchport mode access to ensure that it's an access port, that is a default.

75
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
switchport access vlan 2

76
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
switchport nonegotiate

77
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
we'll turn off all auto negotiations

78
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
so that we have to manually configure everything

79
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
and then explain how it works.

80
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
So sh int g0/1 switchport

81
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
This port gigabit 0/1 is enabled

82
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
which using static access administrative mode

83
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and it's operating a static access port, it's in VLAN 2 at the moment.

84
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
So will PC 2 be able to ping PC 4?

85
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
let's do the ping again

86
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
ping fails from router 4 to router 2

87
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and it also fails in the reverse direction.

88
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
These 2 are not able to ping each other.

89
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Let’s disable this port and force the traffic to go through the hub

90
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
and then do a Wireshark capture to see what’s going on.
