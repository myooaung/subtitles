00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.840
This is one of multiple videos discussing a three switching in a previous video I showed you how to

2
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.530
configure the switch into villans rotting.

3
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.520
I demonstrated how to configure multiple interfaces in different villans and then enable layer 3 functionality

4
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.810
on the switch to allow it to rot from one villain to another.

5
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.640
Another function of a 3 switch is to run routing protocols.

6
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:45.580
So in this example what I'll do is connect the two switches together on gigabit one slushes zero and

7
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.940
will enable a rotting protocol between these two switches.

8
00:00:49.990 --> 00:01:02.880
In addition I'll bring up the PC into the topology and in this example we'll put the PC into a separate

9
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:11.660
V LAN what also do is make the ports between the switches routed ports rather than switch ports.

10
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.440
So this link will act as a routed link.

11
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:25.240
In other words least three link rather than a lead to link all start up the additional switch and all

12
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:32.980
configure the third PC with an IP address.

13
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:43.890
And let's say the 1 9 2 1 6 8 0 subnet and click save and I'll start that PC up I'll open up a console

14
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.490
to the new switch.

15
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.400
As well as the new PC.

16
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.810
So the second switch will take a while to boot.

17
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.440
Wallet's booting I'll configure the first switch in the topology

18
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.640
so on the first switch interface gigabit one slashes.

19
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.700
I'm going to use the kimonos switch port to make this a routed port.

20
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:22.190
The interface has come up now because the other switch has booted all configure an IP address on this

21
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.870
port in the 10 1 10 0 0 range.

22
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:36.060
So notice now show IP interface brief does port X differently to the other ports to port.

23
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.210
So we have the IP address shown directly on the interface

24
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:54.090
on the second switch hostname switch to Gigabit zero one needs to be configured as a routed port

25
00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.020
so interface gigabit.

26
00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:07.430
Once slashes zero no switch port IP address tendered one that tended to

27
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.930
pain tended one to 10 to up 1 which is switch 1.

28
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:27.230
So switch to pings which one show the land brief switch to currently only has field one or create another

29
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:37.060
villain let's say the last 20 or let's create one called movieland 192 and then I'll create an s vi

30
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:50.610
of what I need to reconfigure this PC with a default gateway of 1 9 2 1 6 8 0 1 so IP address 1 on 2

31
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.770
1 6 8 0 1 slushed 24.

32
00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.550
And I need to know shut that is vi.

33
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.430
So show IP interface brief.

34
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:14.880
We've now got the IP address configured on an S-5 192 but we need to put the physical interface into

35
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:24.130
that LAN so show IP interface brief as vi is configured.

36
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:33.350
The interface has been configured in Villano a hundred ninety two and we can prove that by doing show

37
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:39.530
interface which 00 a switch port it belongs to a hundred ninety two.

38
00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:54.240
So show IP interface brief interface has now come up CPC PC 3 now should be able to ping switch to which

39
00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:03.430
it can but these PCs over here will not be able to ping this PC and vice versa until we enable a routing

40
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:18.000
protocol between the switches so on switch one enable the GOP and simply enable it on all interfaces

41
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:28.510
and disable automatic summarization I'll do something very similar on switch to enable UI.

42
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:34.570
GOP needs to be an autonomous system 100 in other words the same autonomous system as the other router

43
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.670
and disable order summarization.

44
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.860
We can see that a neighbor relationship is established.

45
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:51.060
So switch to has an inside job the neighbor relationship with switch one switch to should have learnt

46
00:05:51.150 --> 00:06:00.360
about routes from switch one which it has learnt about network 10 1 2 0 3 0 4 0 and 5 0 which are the

47
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:09.930
subnets on these Villani interfaces we can see that by using the command show IP interface brief notice

48
00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:17.930
the IP addresses on the sci's they were advertised through the GOP and switched to has learnt that.

49
00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:28.000
So in this typology now PC three should now be able to ping PC to as an example to his PC three Kennet

50
00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.480
paying $10 1.5 to one.

51
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.050
Yes it can.

52
00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.550
What about PC 1 which is 10 1 to 1.

53
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.210
Yes it can.

54
00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:42.350
To a trace route to 10 1 to 1.

55
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:50.800
What we should see is that it hits switch to which it does then it should hit switch 1 which it does

56
00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:57.500
and then it should get to the destination which is PC 1 which it does.

57
00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:03.070
So that's an example of how you configure layer 3 switches with routing protocols to allow Roths to

58
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:06.850
be advertised from one layer 3 switch to another.

59
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:13.570
