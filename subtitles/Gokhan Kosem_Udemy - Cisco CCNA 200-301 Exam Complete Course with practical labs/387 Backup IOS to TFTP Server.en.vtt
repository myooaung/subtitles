00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:06.550
So let's back up the operating system of the router to a TFT B server which I've got running on my local

2
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:17.750
PC I'm using the free solar wings TFT P server and it's configured to use C TFT route on my Windows

3
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:25.850
PC for storing of files at the moment I don't have any router operating system stored in that directory.

4
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.340
So let's back up this rodders operating system to that directory.

5
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:42.860
So log in I mean privilege mode show flash shows me that I have two files in Flash because it's just

6
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:50.680
a backup of the operating system stored in flash which I'll overwrite in a separate video.

7
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.230
But let's copy this operating system to the TFT server.

8
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.690
Some recommended best practices before doing that is make sure that you have connectivity to the server

9
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:10.770
and verify that the TFT server has enough disk space or sufficient disk space to receive the file.

10
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.340
So I risk files are often very small.

11
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.000
This is about 15 meg.

12
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:26.590
I have 8 gig available on this harddrive so I'm good for space IP config shows me that this server has

13
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.370
an IP address of 1 2 1 6 8 1 199.

14
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.870
It also has a secondary IP address which we won't use in this video.

15
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.250
So this is the IP address of the TFT server.

16
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.610
Can the router ping the TFT server.

17
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.340
Yes it can.

18
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:51.970
So now let's copy a file from flash to the TFT server.

19
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.660
So Source fallen flesh.

20
00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:03.140
That's one way of doing it but you would need to remember what your fall in flashes so do the show Flesch

21
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.510
come on first and then copy the filename to the TFT server.

22
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:17.720
All you can do it this way where you say copy flash and then press question mark and that will give

23
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:27.680
you various options so I'm going to type see for this file name and press tab and then burn because

24
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.850
that's the form we want to copy to the server.

25
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.280
So either method will work.

26
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:42.370
You can either just type copy flash TGP and then paste the file name in or you can say copy flash colon

27
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.940
question mark which will give you a list of files to copy.

28
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.820
Precentor IP address of t have to be server 1 2 1 6 8 1 1 9.

29
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.430
What do we want to call the file on the to be server.

30
00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.110
I'm going to leave it at the default.

31
00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:07.830
We can see that the router has connected to the BE server and the file is being copied.

32
00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.330
When our refresh windows we can see the file size increasing.

33
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.010
So it's being copied to the TFT server.

34
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.790
Each one of these exclamation marks indicates that part of the file has been successfully copied to

35
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:24.970
the TFT server.

36
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:34.340
Solutions winds to be surveys showing us that the file is being put into the Directory C TFT route with

37
00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.130
the relevant file name.

38
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.280
We can see the date and time that the file is being copied.

39
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.170
So it's fairly late at the moment here in the UK while I'm doing this for here.

40
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.700
We can now see that the fault was successfully copied.

41
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.080
So we've got a complete message.

42
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.480
The rodders is also telling us that so many bytes were copied in this amount of time and we could see

43
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.570
the file in the directory on the TIF to be server.

44
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.440
So that's how you copy a file from flash to the TVT be server.

45
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:14.560
In this case we copied this operating system which is operating system being used by the router and

46
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.380
we could see that by using the show version command.

47
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.950
This is a system image file that's being used.

48
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.990
And that's the file that we backed up to the TFT server.

49
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:32.100
It's a good practice to backup your operating systems to a be server or FCP server.

50
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.660
The problem with TFT p is that there is no authentication and there's no encryption.

51
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:43.320
So you may want to use other mechanisms that are more secure like secure copy to backup the operating

52
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.020
systems and configurations of your devices.
