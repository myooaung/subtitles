WEBVTT
1
00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:11.250
So again protocol at Layer 4 is TTP which Layer 7 protocol is used.

2
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:16.100
Notice destination port is 80 80 is HDP.

3
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:29.150
Notice we've got what's called a destination port we could search in Google for port numbers and let's

4
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:38.800
go to the eye on a Web site which is the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority and if we search for 80

5
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.440
in that list you can see that HP port 80 is world wide web.

6
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.810
A GDP.

7
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:56.400
Now some protocols such as DNS or domain name server or domain name system as it's sometimes called

8
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.350
uses both DCP and UDP HDP generally uses TTP because we want reliability.

9
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:14.160
So again Layer 3 protocol is IP version 4 Layer 4 protocol is TTP we are indicating the application

10
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.110
that we want to send the data to by the port number.

11
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.930
Think of it as follows The server is running multiple services and I want you to see these services

12
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.510
and look at the protocols going to the services.

13
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.080
So under services we've got an HP server.

14
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.330
We've also got a TFT P server.

15
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.850
We've got an FTB server and email server and various other servers.

16
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.940
Where should the data go.

17
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.260
It needs to go to the right application.

18
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.930
You're not going to open up a MP 3 music file in a word processor.

19
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.000
It's not going to work.

20
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.730
Word opens word processing files an application such as a music application gets used to open music

21
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:00.560
files.

22
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.760
So you need the right application or right service to work with the right data.

23
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:14.070
So again you use a port number to send the ATP traffic to the HP server you use a port number like 53

24
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.290
to send traffic to a DNS server.

25
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:25.430
You use Port 21 to send it to FCP server or service sixty nine to a TFT IP service.

26
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.380
You have one physical server running different processes or different applications and you want to send

27
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.420
the data to the correct service or correct server application.

28
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.130
Those applications listen on a specific port number.

29
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:48.750
So the HDP server listens and port 80 the NDP server will listen on Port 21 TFT people listen on Port

30
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.440
69.

31
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:58.130
So this is indicating to the server that this data needs to go to the application listening on port

32
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.650
80 and you can see the HBP request.

33
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:11.030
So packet gets sent to the server the server because it's listening on that port will receive the data

34
00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.740
and send it to the relevant application.

35
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.360
What you'll also notice here is the source port is 1025.

36
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.790
So let's talk about port numbers and a bit more detail.

37
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:29.840
A server service will listen on what's called a well known port number but when you initiate a session

38
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:38.090
to a well-known port number such as 80 you will use what's called a femoral or random port number.

39
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:47.460
Now going back to the Iona we told that service names are assigned on a first come first serve basis

40
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:54.060
as documented in this or if sea service names and port numbers are used to distinguish between services

41
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.420
that run over transport protocols such as TCB UDP and others.

42
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.980
This is the important part.

43
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:11.640
These port numbers in the range 0 to 1023 are signed as system port numbers so 80 is in that range.

44
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.940
We have what's called a user port numbers in this range and then we have what are called dynamic or

45
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.060
private port numbers also called ephemeral port numbers.

46
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.400
Again people use different terms.

47
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.280
Is it a router.

48
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.560
Is it a router.

49
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.830
Is it a highway or a motorway.

50
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.200
Is it a sneaker.

51
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.290
Is it a trainer or in South Africa.

52
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.980
Is it a tacky tacky as a word that comes from Afrikaans.

53
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.800
But we use that as the English word in South Africa.

54
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.630
So is it a tacky.

55
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.550
Is it a trainer.

56
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:42.880
Like in the UK.

57
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.500
Was it a sneaker in the USA.

58
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:51.990
Different terms used by different people but dynamic or random port numbers or private port numbers

59
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.460
or ephemeral port numbers are dynamically or randomly used.

60
00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:04.920
Now you'll notice packet traces actually using a port number in this range 1025 is the source port number

61
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.200
things change over time if I do a search in Google for a femoral port numbers

62
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.590
on Wikipedia.

63
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:24.030
You can read more detail about how the eye honor recommends those port numbers for dynamic or private

64
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.740
ports.

65
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:32.380
But many Linux kernels use this range BSD used this range.

66
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.810
Windows XP used this range by default.

67
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.120
So 1025 not 1024 Vista.

68
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.150
Windows 7 2008.

69
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:51.330
You use the AI on a range Windows 2003 used this range basically different operating systems used different

70
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:58.950
ranges and then we told all versions of Windows since Windows 2000 to allow you to specify a custom

71
00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:05.370
range in that range 1025 to sixty five thousand five hundred and thirty five.

72
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:11.220
You can also see that Windows allows you to customize this so you can specify a custom range.

73
00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:17.220
The moral of the story is servers and for the CCMA you need to worry about some of the well-known port

74
00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:25.150
numbers 80 HDP 21 f DP 69 TFT P and there's a few others.

75
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.440
23 is telnet.

76
00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.510
22 is SS H.

77
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:38.320
No the well-known protocols HDP s as an example is 443 you'll get to know the protocols as you work

78
00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.390
with networks.

79
00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:44.650
But for the exam study the well-known port numbers and well-known protocols.

80
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:50.990
So here we can see the pieces using this source port number going to the server.

81
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:56.980
However what you'll notice and let's show that in the PD you is that the port numbers get swapped round

82
00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.070
when the server replies.

83
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.670
So this is the inbound PD.

84
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.950
This is the PD you from the P.C. to the server.

85
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:12.420
Source mac addresses the P.C. source IP addresses the P.C. source port number is 1025.

86
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:18.730
But for the reply that gets reversed round source MAC address is the server.

87
00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:25.810
Destination is the P.C. source IP addresses the server destination is the P.C. source port number is

88
00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:26.450
80.

89
00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.150
Destination Port number is 1025.

90
00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:35.200
So basically for our communication MAC addresses get swapped round IP addresses get swapped round and

91
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.780
port numbers get swapped round.

92
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:43.300
So if you talk from your P.C. to my server and port 80 I'll reply from port 80 to the port number that

93
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:44.800
you've chosen.

94
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:50.230
The reason why the PRC will choose dynamic port numbers is if you open up two sessions to my server

95
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:56.510
your first session may use port number 1025 and your second session may use port number one thousand

96
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:57.470
twenty six.

97
00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:01.830
They should be randomize but often they're not and that's why hackers can often guess what port number

98
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:06.000
is going to be used next by application but there you go.

99
00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:13.540
That's an example of layer to layer 3 layer for and layer 7.

100
00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:21.570
If we look in the OSA model here they don't show Layer 7 as the protocol here but that's actually the

101
00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:25.900
protocol used in the TPP IP protocol stack.

102
00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:31.050
Again TTP IP model originally 4 layers we now have 5 layers.

103
00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:35.730
So we group layer 5 6 and 7 together as the application.

104
00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:41.270
But we talk about Layer 7 because of the history with the OSA model.

105
00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.820
Okay so that was quite detailed.

106
00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:49.230
I'm hoping that helps you understand a bit about port numbers protocol numbers Ethernet types and so

107
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:49.880
forth.

108
00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.500
In the next video I'm going to show you another protocol.

109
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:59.910
Let's use email and let's say FCP spend some time however going through this yourself having a look

110
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.020
at the different protocols.
