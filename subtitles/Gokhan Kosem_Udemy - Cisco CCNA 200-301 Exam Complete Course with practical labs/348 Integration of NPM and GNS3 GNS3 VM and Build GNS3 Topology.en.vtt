1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:10.310
Not to do the integration with three on my VM and this is my NPM am I'm going to change the network

2
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.720
adapter to use the VM net.

3
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:25.670
One host only on my physical machine I have to VM net adapters a VM to one and VM net 8.

4
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:34.070
Previously my virtual machine was bridged to the physical adapter but to allow it to be controlled by

5
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:40.020
Jeana's three I'm going to change it to VM net one host only.

6
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:50.810
I'm also going to change firewall settings and turn off the firewall so that I can ping the virtual

7
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:57.770
machine from my genius three routers that will just make it easier in the lab to do testing.

8
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:07.140
What I also need to do is shut down the virtual machine so that genius 3 can control it.

9
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.920
So once again shut the machine down.

10
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:20.700
I've gone to network adapter settings and set it to to use host only and I've disabled the firewall

11
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:29.790
what I'll do now is take a snapshot so that I can revert to it if there are any problems.

12
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.530
So NPM installed.

13
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:42.460
I did that quickly and made a mistake so I'll go to VM snapped shut manager and change the name to NPM

14
00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.380
installed.

15
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:55.290
So now let's configure genius 3 and do the integration so I'm going to start up Jinny's 3 in Windows.

16
00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:04.800
In this case because I am using the genus 3 VM it boots up so you can see my VM is booting up.

17
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:12.270
It's now successfully booted up and Jeana's 3 then tells me I can create a project someone a cold US

18
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.380
PM one

19
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.940
not to integrate the NPM virtual machine with Jinnah's 3.

20
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.200
I need to go to Edit Preferences ingenius 3 and I'm going to select the VM way the AMS because I am

21
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.200
using VM workstation rather than virtual box.

22
00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:42.230
How a new and in the VM list I can see my NPM virtual machine.

23
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:52.800
I'm going to click Finish and now I'm going to click Edit go to network and check this option allow

24
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.010
genius 3 to use any configured VM adapter.

25
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.200
I'm going to leave other settings at.

26
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.550
They defaults and click OK and click OK.

27
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:13.960
So what I have now done is integrated NPM with Jeana's 3 and I can build a topology consisting of rodders

28
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.100
and NPM in the next few videos.

29
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.730
I'm going to show you how to integrate Jeana's 3 and NPM.

30
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:31.870
Now in this example I'm using the genius 3 VM because it's the recommended way of running GNAS 3 It

31
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:32.780
also makes sense.

32
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:40.810
In the example because I'm running NPM on the Windows 7 VM within a VM workstation.

33
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:49.870
So I've got both NPM running in Windows and Jeannie's three running within the genus 3 VM within a VM

34
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:58.970
workstation the initial topology that we're going to build consists of three routers connected via serial

35
00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:06.680
interfaces and will advertise routes between these routers using your GOP will also configure an out

36
00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:16.190
of band management network and connect NPM to the out-of-band ethernet network to allow them to manage

37
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.680
to the routers so to bolt our genius 3 topology.

38
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.210
I'm going to drag three routers to the workspace

39
00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.980
as well as drag an Ethernet switch to the workspace.

40
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.080
And I'm going to run these into genius 3 VM

41
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:48.420
I'll cable up the road is using the serial interfaces

42
00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:07.440
so you connect the rajahs via serial interfaces all zoomin and let's view the interface labels.

43
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:18.330
Serial zero is connected to serial zero on route to serial zero and Rotto one is connected to serial

44
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:29.800
0 2 0 0 0 1 he's connected to serial 0 0 on router 3 will also connect first.

45
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:36.640
Ethan it interfaces on each it to the Ethernet switch.

46
00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:49.280
This is going to be used for our management network.

47
00:05:49.320 --> 00:06:02.090
So there are interfaces on the switch and interfaces on the road as well now bring NPM into the topology

48
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:14.940
and I'm going to connect that via the Ethan an interface to port 4 on the Ethan it switch.

49
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:21.390
So this allows NPM to manage the rod is using the out-of-band Management Network.

50
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:28.370
I'll configure the rods with IP addresses on the serial interfaces first and enable routing and then

51
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:30.740
configure the management interface.
