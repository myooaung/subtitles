00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.320
To start Kibby says Look server.

2
00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:11.650
Just click staunched Clarice's looks like you would any of the windows application.

3
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:18.930
In this case I want to continue using the trial so I'm going to click PLO's Now notice under display.

4
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:25.500
There are various options display one up to 24.

5
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:34.530
I'm going to leave it as display 00 the default but notice in the OR IF see we have what are called

6
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.550
facilities and severity values.

7
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:44.790
So facilities and severity values are not normative but often used are described in the following tables

8
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:52.180
for information purposes only facility values must be in the range 0 to 23 inclusive.

9
00:00:52.200 --> 00:01:00.310
This allows you to filter your slug messages says an example kernel messages could use numerical code

10
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:09.620
0 mail systems could use to use a little message as one if DP 11 and so forth and so on.

11
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:17.640
So if you were collecting syslog messages from many devices you may want to filter your slug messages

12
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.570
based on a facility.

13
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.200
For now I'm just going to set it at the default.

14
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:34.010
Now on this PC I'm using an IP address of 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 1 0 8 and the router is configured with an IP

15
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.300
address of 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 2 5 4 I've connected it to fast.

16
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.340
Ethan at 1 slushes 0 on this router.

17
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.220
So in Rotto 1 interface if one slashes 0.

18
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:56.780
So I'm going to specify an IP address of 1 2 1 6 8 1 2 5 4 the default gateway as configured on the

19
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.590
PC.

20
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.750
Now that overlaps with an IP address used to connect to the outside world.

21
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.110
So shut that interface down.

22
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:19.870
Get back to if one slushed Sarah configure the IP address kenned ping the server at the moment.

23
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.850
Not that I forget the obvious.

24
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.300
Yes I did.

25
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:34.900
So interface if one slashes zero in shut try again I can ping the server now.

26
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:44.240
On the PC ping 1 on 2 1 6 8 1 2 5 4 Kennet ping wrote a loop back.

27
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.930
Yes it can.

28
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:56.640
So this server can paying the Lubeck of Ratatouille which is being advertised through SPF I'll remove

29
00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.980
this link for now because we are not using the cloud.

30
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.670
So my metric looks as follows.

31
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.390
I've got my sis looks server and my two routers.

32
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.290
So now it's configfs Aslaug.
