00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:08.250
Now taking virtualization a step further you as a small medium business don't have the buying capacity

2
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:18.000
of a huge company such as Wal-Mart or Target large companies spending large amounts of money can negotiate

3
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.380
prices that small medium businesses cannot.

4
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:29.340
And that's not only true for retailing it's also true for service companies such as Amazon Microsoft

5
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:37.380
and Google can buy hardware a lot cheaper than small medium businesses or enterprises can.

6
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.220
In the past Amazon was buying so much hardware but not utilizing it all the time but buying it in preparation

7
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:54.030
for the demand that they would have for sales at Amazon dot com that they started selling time on their

8
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.150
hardware.

9
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.910
And this is where cloud computing started.

10
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:04.270
Amazon allow you to leverage their physical infrastructure to run virtual machines.

11
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.920
Amazon isn't your only choice today we also have Microsoft Azure as well as Google Cloud.

12
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.000
But all of these work on a similar premise.

13
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.240
You can run

14
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:25.590
servers on their infrastructure at prices that are much lower than you could buy.

15
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:32.700
In other words if you wanted to run a small virtual machine you can actually run it for free on Amazon

16
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.990
today or you can run it at such a low price that it makes more sense to run your infrastructure in the

17
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.660
cloud rather than trying to buy hardware and maintained that hardware.

18
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:53.820
If you're buying servers you need to provide power cooling and other resources to maintain those servers.

19
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.660
So why not just run your servers in the cloud.

20
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.500
Amazon already have that infrastructure in place.

21
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.540
So do Microsoft and Google.

22
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:10.680
They are paying so much less than you for hardware such as CPE use and disk space that it makes more

23
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.550
sense for you to just leverage their hardware.

24
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:22.590
That's what companies such as Dropbox and many others do they have in the past or currently run on top

25
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.930
of Amazon.

26
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:32.070
So in other words when you store files in Dropbox those files are stored on Amazon's storage and are

27
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.620
processed by Amazon servers.

28
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:42.870
Dropbox has recently changed that but a lot of startups like Dropbox use Amazon to provide the infrastructure

29
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.880
to their businesses and the whole idea here is cost.

30
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:54.100
You can spin up virtual machines very quickly and you can pay for the demand.

31
00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.350
So in other words if there's a spike in traffic you simply pay for the extra resources that you're using.

32
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:07.710
You don't have to try and buy physical servers get them shipped physically install them rack them power

33
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:16.260
them and so forth you can on the fly use the resources available in the cloud so in this example I'll

34
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.090
sign into Amazon

35
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.200
and what I can do here as an example is launch a virtual machine which they say will take less than

36
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.620
a minute.

37
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.300
So I could call this test 1 2 3

38
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:43.630
I can decide which operating system I want to use as an example I'll select Ubuntu click Next I'm gonna

39
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:53.590
go for a T2 micro server so I can see the amount of CPR you RAM and storage that to the server has noticed

40
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.290
this is going to run free click Next

41
00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:07.020
I need to download a key pair to access that server but notice I can not create the instance and it's

42
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:13.770
as simple as that for me to create a server and then I can connect to that server remotely and manage

43
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:14.850
it.

44
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:22.140
Notice I didn't have to purchase any hardware I didn't have to wait for the hardware to be shipped.

45
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:29.010
I didn't have to rack the server I didn't have to power up the server I didn't have to configure a network

46
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.920
I didn't have to configure storage I didn't have to install an operating system I didn't have to install

47
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.110
applications.

48
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.400
Those are all immediately available to me in a matter of minutes.

49
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:54.380
It's as simple as that to start up a virtual machine on Amazon so notice in this example I've got a

50
00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.190
virtual machine running called Test one two three.

51
00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:04.130
It's currently initializing but I've also got other servers running on Amazon.

52
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.510
I can manage these servers remotely so I can shut them down I can power them up.

53
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:16.180
So as an example here I've got USA 1 Live Labs dot com.

54
00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:24.030
So the server USA 1 Live Labs 3 dot com is actually running on an Amazon server.

55
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:30.080
I'm not told that to my test one two three surveys completed and in a moment I'll be able to connect

56
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.120
to that server.

57
00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:40.310
But in this example I had my Live Labs server previously configured and as an example I could log in

58
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:46.760
to that live lab server and in this example I can connect to a remote lab

59
00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:59.310
which is a physical switch running locally here in the UK but I'm actually connecting to this physical

60
00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:09.280
switch via my Amazon virtual machine running in the USA rather than me trying to setup a physical server

61
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.390
like I did here and I would have to install the physical server power it up and so forth.

62
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:21.820
Then I would install the host operating system which in this case is E6 I and then I have to install

63
00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:29.000
my guest operating system and install the applications on that I can simply spin up a server on Amazon

64
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.130
and connect to it remotely.

65
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.540
The server is once again running in the USA.

66
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.000
I'm based in the UK but that's the advantage of cloud computing.

67
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.850
It doesn't necessarily matter where that server is based.

68
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.150
It's somewhere in the cloud.

69
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.490
I don't know physically where that server is located.

70
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.080
It's somewhere in the mid-west of the USA.

71
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:58.520
I'm in the UK but I can simply connect to it like I would connect it to any other server on the Internet.

72
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.660
Once again that's the power of cloud computing and the cloud.

73
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:09.410
It's very quick and easy to spin up devices and leverage the infrastructure of cloud providers such

74
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.650
as Amazon Microsoft Azure and Google.
