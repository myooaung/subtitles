00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.280
Now if you want to use tracking technology you need to buy the right switches.

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.500
So essentially you need to buy the right product for the feature that you want.

3
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.370
As mentioned Cisco have supported stacking for a long time such as such as the 30 750 have supported

4
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.430
stock wise for many years.

5
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:28.400
Yes some examples flex stock was introduced in 2010 flex stock plus was introduced in 2013.

6
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:36.970
The switches that support flex stock all the 29 60 s and 29 60 x 4 flex stack plus you need a 20 960

7
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:44.850
X or 29 60 x are the speed of a single stock link in both directions using full duplex is 10 gigabits

8
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.960
per second for Flex stack and 20 gigabits per second for Flex stack plus the maximum number of switches

9
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.550
supported in one stack is four for Flex stack and eight for Flex stack plus in the real world.

10
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.970
Have a look on the Cisco documentation and the data sheets for any switch that you want to buy to ensure

11
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.420
that it supports the speeds and capabilities that you need.

12
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:17.880
Now chassis aggregation is another Cisco technology which allows you to make multiple switches operate

13
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.080
as a single switch from a big picture perspective.

14
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.970
In a lot of cases such stacking is used after the access layer whereas chassis aggregation is used for

15
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.890
more powerful switches used in the distribution and core layers.

16
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.270
So in summary chassis aggregation is used for high end switches.

17
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.390
As an example chassis based switches used in the distribution and core layers of campus networks.

18
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.050
It does not require special hardware adapters but rather uses ethernet interfaces on switches it typically

19
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.450
aggregates only two switches.

20
00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.440
It's more complex to configure but provides more options now from a big picture point of view chassis

21
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:09.720
aggregation is the same as switch stacking multiple switches act as one switch which gives you both

22
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.650
availability and design advantages.

23
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:20.200
However one of the big reasons for chassis based aggregation is high availability designs technology

24
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.540
such as Cisco virtual switching system or VNS is supported on the Cisco sixty five hundred and sixty

25
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.900
eight hundred series switches.

26
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.970
Have a look on Cisco's website for more details but he has a quick overview.

27
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.490
Now even if you're not using chassis aggregation you need high availability in the core and distribution

28
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.580
layer of your network as discussed.

29
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:51.000
One of the reasons for having multiple switches in the distribution or core layer is to provide redundancy

30
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.520
in case one of those switches goes down.

31
00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:01.770
So we use technology such as H.S. IP spanning tree and others to provide better redundancy and better

32
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.350
scalability.

33
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.990
However the downside is cost.

34
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.440
You need additional switches and it's also more complex to configure.

35
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.810
You need to think about where you put your spending tree roots as well as your HS IP active Rodders.

36
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:25.110
Now chassis based switch typically has multiple line cords one or more supervisor modules and one or

37
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.660
more power supplies.

38
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.550
For redundancy you want redundant power supplies you want redundant supervisors and you want multiple

39
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.800
line cords in your chassis.

40
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.890
The idea with supervisor modules is if one of the supervisors goes down the other one can take over

41
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:47.790
the management of the switch a supervisor module is essentially the brain for the chassis based switch.

42
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.610
If you lose your supervisor the switch will have no brain hence you have redundant supervisor modules

43
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.260
in your switch.

44
00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.660
You have redundant power supplies in case there's a problem with one of the power suppliers and in addition

45
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:06.090
you'll have multiple connections from your access layer to multiple line cards using link aggregation

46
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:13.140
to ensure that if one of the line cards goes down the network can continue functioning using the redundant

47
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.260
line card and with the chassis based aggregation.

48
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:22.800
What we're doing is taking multiple chassis based switches and using either related to a lay through

49
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:31.320
ether channel between multiple chassis beats switches to provide better redundancy and better throughput

50
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.430
to the distribution core of the network.

51
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:42.090
I've discussed that and a lot of detail in the campus videos that make up this course.

52
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:47.730
What we can do is take that a step further and instead of using link aggregation between the chassis

53
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:54.930
based switches with spanning tree and HS or P we make the chassis based switches appear to be a single

54
00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:02.620
switch in the model on the left the two switches are independent of one another they run their own Mac

55
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.170
address tables they run their own instance of spending tree.

56
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.920
They essentially act totally independently of one another.

57
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.690
You configure two separate switches in this example and you configure them independently of each other

58
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:23.620
with an aggregated chassis environment however the switches appear to be one switch to the rest of the

59
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.770
network.

60
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:31.600
You can have multiple physical ports going to different physical switches but you can aggregate them

61
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:39.580
together using multi chassis ether channel because logically a one has two physical connections to the

62
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:46.780
same switch even though physically it's two physical connections two different switches and the different

63
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.570
ways to implement this.

64
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:55.690
We can use multi chassis ether channel but use an active standby control plane where one of the pairs

65
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:59.860
acts as the switch for the control plane protocols.

66
00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:05.250
So one of the switches is in control of spending tree VTB ether channel up and running protocols.

67
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:12.250
But to take advantage of the forwarding power of the supervisor modules on both switches we have active

68
00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.710
active data planes.

69
00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:20.290
We're late to forwarding and layer 3 forwarding is done by both switches the switches synchronize their

70
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:26.740
MAC address tables and running tables to support to this there's a single switch management plane however.

71
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:34.060
In other words you manage both switches on the active switch when you change the config of the active

72
00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.560
switch.

73
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:39.830
That configuration is synchronized automatically with the standby switch.

74
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:46.570
Now you could take this a step further where you have an aggregated virtual switch and an aggregated

75
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:47.950
Access Switch.

76
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.060
Physically we've got two switches in the distribution layer.

77
00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:59.950
But by using chassis aggregation and they appear to be one switch add to the access layer we have four

78
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:05.440
physical switches but they appear to be a single virtual switch.

79
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:12.310
And then we can run eight physical ports in a single ether channel between the distribution layer and

80
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:13.630
access layer.

81
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:20.230
And in that case we don't need spanning tree because even though physically we have six switches virtually

82
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:25.440
we only have two switches with one virtual cable between them.

83
00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:31.990
As always there are caveats and things to be aware of when doing this but that's the ultimate vision

84
00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:36.550
of Link Aggregation with chassis aggregation and switch stacking.

85
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:42.190
You're aggregating your physical distribution switches into one virtual switch and you are stacking

86
00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.010
your access layer switches into one virtual switch.

87
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:52.270
The simplifies the network because you don't have to worry about optimizing spanning tree and optimizing

88
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:53.460
H.S. IP.

89
00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:58.300
There's no need for HAARP because we have one virtual aggregated switch.

90
00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:01.310
We would still run spending tree in case there are problems.

91
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:06.580
But from a spending tree point of view both of these ports are falling because there's only one logical

92
00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.460
cable between the two switches.

93
00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:13.990
It really simplifies the management and configuration of a campus network.

94
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:22.630
So in summary stacking technologies and chassis aggregation technologies allow you to simplify the management

95
00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:27.890
and configuration as well as the forwarding of traffic in an Ethernet network.
