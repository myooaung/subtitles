1
00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.640
So he has our sample network.

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:11.520
We have brought a one with IP address 10 1 1 1 on first Ethan and 0 0 10 1 2 1 1 Serial 1 slash 0 which

3
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:19.650
is connected to our 2 or 2 is configured with 10 1 2 2 on Serial 1 slash 0 and 10 1 3 1 on Serial 1

4
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:27.580
slash 1 or 3 is configured with 10 1 3 2 on Serial 1 slash 0 and 10 1 4 1.

5
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:35.790
On first Ethan it's 0 0 or 1 and all three are connected via another serial link and all configured

6
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.070
with addresses 10 1 5 1 on r 1 and 10 1 5 2 on 3.

7
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:49.170
Please note that the links feed of the serial links have been set to 128 kilobytes per second so on

8
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:58.160
Rado 1 show run interface Serial 1 select 0 will allow us to see the configuration in C it's got an

9
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.480
IP address and the bandwidth has been configured two hundred twenty eight kilobytes per second

10
00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:13.640
the same information can be viewed on Serial 1 Select one IP address with bandwidth show IP protocols

11
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:22.100
will allow me to see that no routing protocols have been enabled on this Rada so going to global configuration

12
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:31.200
mode I can now enable respect by copying the command Rata 0 SPF and specifying a process I.D..

13
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.700
Once again this process I.D. is local to the Rada and does not have to be the same on all of the routers

14
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:45.680
it's on Rado 1 I'm going to specify one topping the command to show IP protocols will allow me to see

15
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:53.960
which routing protocols I enable and as you can see here oh SPF is enabled with process IP 1 and the

16
00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:05.130
Rada is set to 10 1 5 1 however topping the command to show IP OSP it interfaces will allow me to see

17
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.940
that 0 SPF is not enabled on any interfaces on the Rada 0 SPF will not form neighbor relationships and

18
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.570
will not exchange rates for neighbor relationships to be established and for rods to be advertised you

19
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:26.630
need to type the command network and then specify a network so I could specify ten dot 1 don't want

20
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:35.200
of 1 the IP address of the foster Ethan at 0 0 interface and then I can specify a wildcard mosque.

21
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.890
This is an inverse mosque similar to an access list with zero in binary means match and one in binary

22
00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:42.730
means ignore.

23
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.530
So this is an exact match on that IP address.

24
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.660
Oh SPF will only be enabled on Fost Ethan at 0 0.

25
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.890
You then need to specify an area and in this case I'm going to specify area zero.

26
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:08.370
The area can be specified as a decimal value in this range all inducted decimal IP address format.

27
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.240
We're just going to specify the area as area zero.

28
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:21.270
Now topping the come on do show IP OSP if interface allows me to see that 0 SPF is enabled on Fost Ethan

29
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:27.650
at 0 0 the IP address on that interface is 10 1 1 1 slash 24.

30
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.960
And the area that that interface is being put into is air is zero.

31
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:40.950
You can see once again that the process ideas 1 the router ideas 10 1 5 1 and the network type is broadcast

32
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:49.080
because Foss Ethan at 0 0 is Ethan it always being SPF will see this as a broadcast media.

33
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.690
The cost is 1.

34
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.920
Once again referring back to the OSP formula 100 make link will have a cost of 1.

35
00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.660
Notice the property is set to 1 which is the default.

36
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:07.560
There is no designated road on this network the hello interval is 10 seconds the date interval is 40

37
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.490
seconds.

38
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:16.190
So a lot of information can be gathered just through the single command topping the command again notice

39
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:26.270
we have become the designated Radha our Radha ideas 10 1 5 1 and the designated Radha IP is 10 1 5 1.

40
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.100
In other words it's us.

41
00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.210
Notice the interface ip address is 10 1 1 1 which is the IP address on this.

42
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:39.800
Ethan it interface on Ethan it as explained Rodders will go through an election to determine the designated

43
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:46.940
Radha and Beckett designate who wrote it and that election has now taken place with our local Rada becoming

44
00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.780
the designated Rada because there is no other Rada on this segment.

45
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:58.010
So we are the defacto designated Rada always SPF however has not been enabled on the serial once left

46
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.060
zero interface and cereal once less one interface.

47
00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.660
So let's do that now.

48
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:10.390
I can top that come on network don't one or two to one the IP address of serial 1 slash 0.

49
00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:19.460
Once again put in my wildcard mask once again put in my area now stopping the come on show IP SPF interface

50
00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:26.930
allows me to see that oh SPF is enabled on cereal one select zero as well as fast Ethan at zero slash

51
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:33.470
zero hitting spacebar shows me that oh SPF is not enabled on any other interfaces.

52
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:45.650
So once again network Ten dot 1 5 1 wildcard mask and our area will enable 0 SPF on the serial 1 slash

53
00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:57.040
1 interface show IP SPF interface shows me that oh SPF is now enabled on 0 1 slash 1 0 1 slept 0 as

54
00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:06.510
well as Fost Ethan it 06 0 thing that come on again allows me to see information relating to the serial

55
00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:07.950
interfaces.

56
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:15.390
Notice that on both serial interfaces the process idea is one as you would expect the Rada idea is 10

57
00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:23.490
1 5 1 as you would expect the network type however is point to point out SPF is intelligent enough to

58
00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:29.430
realize that this is a point to point link and thus the OSP if time is set to point to point.

59
00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:36.380
Notice the cost is 7 8 1 which is the cost of one hundred twenty eight kilohertz per second link.

60
00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.370
Once again the hollow interval is 10 seconds.

61
00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:46.640
The date interval is 40 seconds but what you won't see here is designated Rada and backup designated

62
00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:47.590
Rada.

63
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:53.430
There is no need for an election on a point to point link because there are only two Rod is communicating

64
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:54.450
with each other.

65
00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:59.310
So no election has taken place but just to give you the full syntax of commands.

66
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.610
Control Zed show IP OSP.

67
00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:08.650
Interface shows me the interfaces that OSP is enabled on.

68
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:15.910
Show IP protocols will allow me to see the writing protocols enabled on this Rada and as you can see.

69
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:22.660
Yeah OSP if one has been enabled the Rada ideas for the local road is 10 1 5 1.

70
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:27.920
The number of areas configured on this routing is 1 with 1 normal area.

71
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.470
No stub areas and no not so stubby areas.

72
00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:35.780
Stubborn not so stubby areas or special tops of O's.

73
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:41.420
If areas used to reduce the number of rocks in the routing table the maximum number of paths that we

74
00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.280
will load balance across by default is 4.

75
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.810
But that could be changed to 16.

76
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:53.480
We are opting for the following networks 10 1 1 1 10 1 2 1 10 1 5 1.

77
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:59.420
Notice the mosques we have specified the individual IP addresses.

78
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:06.050
When we entered the network command the reference bandwidth is 100 megabits per second which is the

79
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:07.340
default.

80
00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:10.590
The administrative distance of 0 SPF is 110.

81
00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:19.190
Topping the command show IP route shows me that I only have directly connected ruts in my writing table.

82
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:24.210
The reason why is we have not enabled SPF 1 rout at 2 and root at 3.

83
00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:29.730
So we are not receiving rots from either of those Rod I can top that.

84
00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:37.630
Come on show IPO SPF which gives me a lot of information relating to the OSP process running on this

85
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:38.650
Rada.

86
00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:44.000
Once again process one is being enabled the Rada ideas 10 1 5 1.

87
00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:51.970
We can see timers and statistics like this for instance initial SPF schedule delay 5000 milliseconds

88
00:08:52.600 --> 00:09:00.610
the Rada will wait 5 seconds before running the SPF algorithm when notified of a network going down

89
00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:04.210
or a new network that's been added to the topology.

90
00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:11.740
The idea of this is to allow the network to stabilize before running the OSP algorithm notice the minimum

91
00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:17.930
hold time between two consecutive SPF algorithm calculations is 10 seconds.

92
00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:23.440
So in other words we will not run the SPF algorithm continuously.

93
00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:32.230
There is a gap of 10 seconds between calculations we can see that the backbone area Zero has been enabled

94
00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:37.290
in this Rada and three interfaces have been put into this area.

95
00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:41.640
No authentication has been enabled on this area and we lost.

96
00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:50.510
Executed the SPF algorithm about five minutes ago and it executed three times so let's enable OSB from

97
00:09:50.520 --> 00:10:00.090
Ra to t and see how the output changes in order to show IP interface brief will allow me to see the

98
00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:01.770
interfaces configured on this rather.
