00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:08.040
Not ICMP version 6 also includes neighbor discovery protocol messages and the two of interest here are

2
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:16.620
rodders solicitation ORUs and Rodda advertisement or a so Rodda solicitation message is sent to all

3
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.130
IP version 6 rodders.

4
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.840
In other words if a zero or to cold on Colan t rodders on the local segment we'll be subscribed to that

5
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:32.490
multicast address and they will reply back with Rodda advertisements.

6
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.920
So run advertisements are sent by Rawdon's and include information such as the link local IP version

7
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.200
6 address of the router and the local segment round as advertised themselves using multicast address

8
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.100
FFM 0 to Colon colon one which is all devices on the local segment.

9
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:59.460
Just as an example will boot up and send a message to F-0 to Colon colon to to ask all Rodders to identify

10
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.770
themselves.

11
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.880
The rodders will then reply back with a link a local address Rawdon's.

12
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.980
Also send unsolicited Rodda advertisement messages.

13
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:18.210
So on a periodic basis they will advertise the details on the IP version 6 link and they send that again

14
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.660
to F-F 0 2 Kahlon column 1.

15
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:28.660
Now by leveraging maybe discovery protocol erotic solicitation and erotic advertisement messages hostes

16
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.310
can discover which subnet they belong to.

17
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:41.030
So Rondo's by using slack can advertise the local Prefect's and linked to hosts on the local segment.

18
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.270
So let's have a look at that.

19
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.970
Practically.
