This is one of multiple videos discussing SPF designated Rada and back of the designated Rada elections.

2
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:23.220
Have a look at this segment connected to this layer to switch which Rada will become the designated

3
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.050
Rada.

4
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:31.910
Will it be Rada one with this IP address 10 1 1 1 priority 100 or will it be right at 2 using the default

5
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.170
priority an IP address 10 1 1 2.

6
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:43.270
Or will it be rather 3 with a party of 20 IP addresses 10 1 1 3 or will it be write a 4 with a party

7
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:51.760
of 0 IP address 10 1 1 4 which Rada will become the designated Rada on this segment.

8
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.450
What do you think.

9
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.690
So let's see if you can answer some additional questions.

10
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.000
What is the default priority in 0 SPF.

11
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.400
What happens when a Rada has a property of zero.

12
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.310
Is it highest or lowest priority.

13
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.350
That makes it hard to win an election.

14
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.890
Is property even used.

15
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.970
Is it highest or lowest IP address.

16
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:22.460
In this topology of shut down all the interfaces on the switch and what I'll do now is enable them so

17
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:29.470
that all right interfaces come up at the same time and an election is held.

18
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.210
So here's Rada for sure.

19
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:43.350
IP SPF interface gigabit Foster Ethan 00 we can see that this Rada has a party of 0.

20
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:51.350
Its state is your other neighbor relationships are being established so show IP of SPF neighbor we have

21
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.760
a serial interface which we can ignore for this discussion.

22
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.230
That's this interface here.

23
00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:05.150
We are concentrating on the Ethernet segment so we can see the properties of the neighbors right if

24
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.370
one has a property of 100.

25
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.250
It's become the designated router it to has a party of one.

26
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.610
It's become a deal or other route a 3 has a party of 20.

27
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:28.180
It's become the BTR and once again on the local Rada Foster Ethan at 0 0.

28
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:35.610
It's become a D or other so the first criteria for determining who the designated Rada is on a segment

29
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.130
is priority highest priority wins default.

30
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.300
Property is one when the property is set to zero.

31
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:51.580
The Rada will not become a designated Rada or a backup designated Rada hope you enjoyed this video.
