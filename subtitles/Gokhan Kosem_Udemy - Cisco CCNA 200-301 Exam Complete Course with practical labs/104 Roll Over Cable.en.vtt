A rollover cable is a special cable used to connect

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
to the consoles of networking devices.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It allows you to connect from the serial port on your PC or laptop

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
to the console of a router or switch.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So if you've got a serial port or COM port on your PC

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
you can connect directly to the console of a router or switch using a rollover cable.

7
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
However a lot of modern day PC's don’t have serial ports

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
so you’ll need to get a USB to serial port converter

9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
which has a USB connection on 1 side and a DB9 male connector on the other side.

10
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This would allow you to connect DB9 female console cable to your PC

11
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
with either a Rj-45 connector on the other side or another DB9 connector.

12
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Most Cisco switches and routers use an Rj-745 connector

13
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
but you may come across some devices from other vendors such as HP

14
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that use a DB9 connector for the console port.

15
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
So a DB9 serial would connect to your PC and either an Rj-45 or DB9 serial

16
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
would be connected to the console of the networking device that you want to configure

17
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
in a rollover cable all pins are inverted or rolled over.

18
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So pin 1 is connected to pin 8, pin 2 is connected to pin 7, 3 to 6

19
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and so forth and so on until you get to pin 8 which is connected to pin 1.

20
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
You could use a standard Cat5 or Cat6 cable as a rollover cable

21
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and then just change the pin outs on the ends from straight through to rollover but

22
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
typically this is not required as most networking devices are ship with console cables.

23
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
This video has explained a lot about Ethernet and data flows, in the next video

24
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
we'll look at how traffic is forwarded by hubs, bridges, switches, and routers.
