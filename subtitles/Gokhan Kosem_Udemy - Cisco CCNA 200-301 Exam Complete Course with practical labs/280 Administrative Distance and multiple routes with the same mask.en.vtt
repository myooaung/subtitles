00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
However if we go back to the previous example

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
note that in this case OSPF and RIP are advertising

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
the same route network 10.0.0.0/8 is advertised

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
by both New York and San Jose and thus administrative distance is chosen

5
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
because the same route can’t be put twice into the routing table.

6
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The router has to choose the best route

7
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and in this case, administrative distance is used

8
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
as the tie breaker between OSPF and RIP.

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So in summary administrative distance is only used

10
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
if multiple routing protocols are trying to put the same route

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
into the Routing Information Base or RIP also called the routing table

12
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
In this example once again the 3 routes

13
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
are seen as 3 separate and distinct routes.

14
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
All 3 routes are put into the routing table

15
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and the routing decision is based on longest match or best match.

16
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So network 10.1.1.0/27 has the longest match

17
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
so it’s deemed to be the best route.

18
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Traffic is forwarded to router 1

19
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
even though RIP has a higher administrative distance when compared to OSPF.
