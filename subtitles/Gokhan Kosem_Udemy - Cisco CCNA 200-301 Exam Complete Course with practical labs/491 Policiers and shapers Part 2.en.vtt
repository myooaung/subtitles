00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.350
So where would you use polices and where would you use shapers.

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.130
Polices are generally used as ingress tools.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.070
In other words the traffic has dropped before it's processed so that you don't waste valuable resources.

4
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.590
If a package is going to be dropped anyway you might as well drop it on the ingress or incoming interface

5
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.370
of a rider so that you don't waste valuable bandwidth and you cycles to move it from one interface to

6
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.490
another to a running lookup and so forth and then drop the packet.

7
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.690
Polices can be used on aggress to control the amount of traffic sent out of an interface but are generally

8
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:44.490
used to enforce a traffic policy on ingress as an example your service provider may have an ingress

9
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.270
police to ensure that you don't send too much traffic as an example you could have paid for 100 megabits

10
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.750
per second.

11
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.140
Internet link but the physical interface that connects you to your service provider could be Gigabit

12
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.930
Ethernet so to ensure that you don't transmit more than 100 megabits per second the service provider

13
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:11.760
on the ingress interface on the ISP side will implement a police to drop traffic that exceeds 100 megabits

14
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.760
per second when traffic is exceeded.

15
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.880
The police can either drop the traffic or remake the traffic.

16
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:28.470
The disadvantage of a police is that stopping traffic which results in TTP resets TTP is designed to

17
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.760
re transmit traffic that's been dropped.

18
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.200
So when a police is dropping a lot of traffic it causes a lot of TTP re transmissions or re sends polices

19
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.560
don't introduce chatter or delay because they simply drop the packet.

20
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:48.210
They don't delay it with shapers introduced delay and Jetta by slowing down packets or buffering them

21
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.750
for a period of time before transmitting them.

22
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.090
Shapers are a lot gentler than polices so generally they are deployed between an enterprise customer

23
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:05.000
and the service provider to ensure that you don't exceed the contracted rate again using the example

24
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.060
of a customer connected to a service provider via a gigabit interface.

25
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.820
The customer will slow itself down under the 100 megabits per second threshold to ensure that it doesn't

26
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:23.780
send traffic to the service provider who will simply drop the traffic shapers result in fewer TCB re

27
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.910
transmissions because they're not dropping the traffic they are delaying it or slowing the traffic down.

28
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:38.810
So in summary policing drops or remarks it doesn't buffer it causes TTP read transmissions it doesn't

29
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:46.790
introduce G2 and delay shapers don't drop traffic they delay the traffic but that can result in additional

30
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.380
delay or jitter shaping is a lot gentler on traffic.

31
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.360
Policing is very harsh causes re transmissions.
