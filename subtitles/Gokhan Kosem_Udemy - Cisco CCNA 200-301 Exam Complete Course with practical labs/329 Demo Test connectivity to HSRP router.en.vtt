00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:10.600
See has a one acting as P.S. One paying tendered one tend of to fight for it's the device that we're

2
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:18.120
going to configure is its default gateway alternate debugging and use the command show IP rot.

3
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:24.250
Notice the Rada has no gateway of last resort set and has no static ruts.

4
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:31.240
Now we need to configure the device with a default gateway or static default Grant writing is currently

5
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:38.950
enabled on this Rada so I need to use the command ip route and specify a static default grant of tendered

6
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.620
one to attend or to fight for.

7
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:51.530
So now show ip route shows us that to the gateway of last resort is tendered wonder tender to fly for

8
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:59.600
which is the Age's IP router and we have a static default Grant configured here is P.S. too.

9
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:10.650
So let us do something different on P.C. to see he has rather to acting as P.C. to enable show IP round.

10
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:19.370
Now what I'm gonna do is type no IP routing this will disable riding on this router so when I use the

11
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.510
Come on show IP run.

12
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.440
Now notice we don't see the ruts that we saw previously.

13
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:33.090
Now when you disable IP riding on a router you need to use the command IP default gateway and not to

14
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:42.190
the command ip route and specify static rot on Route 1 one I configured a static default route because

15
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.200
routing is enabled on this route.

16
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.680
We can see as an example of routing table.

17
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:54.170
But on this device because routing is disabled I need to use the IP default gateway command.

18
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.870
And in this case the default gateway is the H.S. IP router on VLAN 20.

19
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.920
So can it ping the H.S. IP rata on VLAN 20.

20
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.130
Yes it can.

21
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.210
Can it ping of one tenth of one to ten or eleven.

22
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.710
This IP address yes it can.

23
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.360
Can Rata 1 ping tendered 1 or twenty dot twelve.

24
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:27.020
In other words this IP address which is the IP address of router 2 Yes it can.

25
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:35.960
Now we can prove that the pings are working by doing debug IP ICMP again and then running the ping and

26
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.770
notice we see the output so I'll move it up a bit.

27
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.900
And then you can see the echo replies being sent so pings are working between rudder 1 and Rod 2.
