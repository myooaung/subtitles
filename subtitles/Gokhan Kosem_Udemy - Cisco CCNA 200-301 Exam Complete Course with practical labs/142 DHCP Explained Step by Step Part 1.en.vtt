00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.330
You probably using it right now is

2
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.040
don't deny it.

3
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.350
You probably using DHEA P..

4
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:25.950
If you're watching this video whether it's on a device like this notice using DHEA P to connect to the

5
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.120
Internet or perhaps on a computer.

6
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.900
Modern networks rely very heavily on DHEA.

7
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.840
For example if you go to Starbucks or a coffee shop or you go to the airport it's very unlikely that

8
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.370
you're going to be walking around saying what's the I.P. address that I should be using.

9
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.860
Which IP address should I configure my device as very unlikely that you're going to be doing that.

10
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.620
And the reason for that is IP addresses are more often than not dynamically allocated especially to

11
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.420
client devices.

12
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:05.010
So here's an example of some client devices client devices could be pieces could be Internet of Things

13
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.820
devices such as these could be phones Servers typically have IP addresses configured statically because

14
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.250
you need to connect to that server.

15
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.990
So as an example if you go to Facebook dot com or some other Web site that domain name needs to be resolved

16
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.930
to an IP address and you need to connect to a specific IP address or range of IP addresses and they

17
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:35.520
are statically defined but more often than not client devices are automatically configured or dynamically

18
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.120
configured because it's too much work to manually configure these devices.

19
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.170
I mean when was the last time you manually configured your phone with an IP address.

20
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.360
Most of us probably have never done that or only in exceptional circumstances with Internet of Things

21
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.190
devices such as these lights or devices like cameras.

22
00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:04.080
It doesn't make sense to manually configure IP addresses so as an example here's a IP camera.

23
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.940
I'm probably not going to configure this device statically.

24
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:15.960
I'm going to let it dynamically be configured now DHB or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is once

25
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.050
again a fundamental building block in networks today.

26
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.230
Okay but how does DCP actually work.

27
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.400
Do you know the messages sent between what's called a client and a server.

28
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.280
Do you know how they work in this video.

29
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.890
I'm gonna show you practically how to configure and use HP.

30
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.270
I've got a network here.

31
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.590
I'm going to demonstrate the HP using a router which I'll configure as a DHB server.

32
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:51.540
This is a Cisco wrote it but the same principles apply whether you configuring a home router or some

33
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.550
other kind of device as your DSP server.

34
00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:00.450
I've got a Windows P.C. and I've got a Linux P.C. that are going to get IP addresses from the router

35
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.400
and I'm gonna run wire shock in this topology to show you how DHB actually works.

36
00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.310
So rather than just talking about it I'm going to demonstrate it.

37
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.500
Here's an example of someone just talking about what the HP is rather than practically demonstrating

38
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.330
it.

39
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:27.210
Alexa what is DHEA P in computer networking the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol D.H..

40
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:34.690
The network application protocol used by devices THC P clients to obtain configuration information for

41
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.820
operation in an Internet protocol network okay.

42
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.600
Not sure if you understood any of that but there you go.

43
00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.510
There's a so-called definition of DHEA.

44
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.960
It's gonna make a lot more sense however if I show you this practically.

45
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.930
Now she did mention some terms there.

46
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.110
So let's look at some of those on this iPhone.

47
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.300
If I go to Settings go to my Wi-Fi network.

48
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.740
So in this example it's ABC 1 Top 5 gigahertz.

49
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:09.880
Go and look at the information I can see firstly that the address has been allocated automatically rather

50
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.400
than manually boot P is the predecessor to DCP.

51
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.850
It wouldn't worry about that.

52
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:22.510
Two main ways to configure IP addresses dynamically or automatically if you prefer that term or statically

53
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.580
where you manually configure the IP address on the device notice we have an IP address.

54
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.120
In this example it's 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 eleven.

55
00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.620
We have a subnet mask 255 255 255 0.

56
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:45.200
We have a router 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 2 49 that is also known as the default gateway or the way to get to the

57
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.170
Internet.

58
00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.880
So for a lot of people they don't understand necessarily the technical terms here.

59
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.190
They just want Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi equates to Internet.

60
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.190
So that's obviously not the same thing.

61
00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.520
Wi-Fi is the way that we connect to a network using wireless technologies.

62
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.940
The Internet is a totally different concept and I won't discuss that right now.

63
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:12.080
But basically the broader or the default gateway is the way that you get typically to the Internet notice

64
00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:18.350
we've got this option renew lease D.A. cheap IP addresses are typically only allocated for a period

65
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:25.580
of time when you configure the DHB server you as the administrator decide how long a lease is so you

66
00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.960
can say the loss for three days or for a week.

67
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:34.580
You typically don't want to allocate IP addresses permanently even though you can in certain cases because

68
00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.860
devices change as an example when you go to Starbucks you're not gonna be there permanently you're only

69
00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:47.390
going there for a period of time a DHB pool or scope typically only consists of a range of IP addresses

70
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:53.530
so they may be only terms of 50 IP addresses in the pool or in the scope as people come and go.

71
00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:59.720
We want to reuse those IP addresses so we only want to allocate them for a period of time at Starbucks

72
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.760
or other places they may reduce that interval to a much smaller period of time.

73
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.000
So that addresses are reused more often.

74
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.690
Notice this option configured DNS automatic or manual.

75
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:18.840
In this example the DNS server is the local router 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 249 that could be configured as 8 8

76
00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.270
8 8 8 8 8.

77
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:27.150
That's a Google DNS server quite a famous one that once again is configured by the DHB administrator.

78
00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:33.930
So that's an example of DHEA p on a client a phone.

79
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:42.950
We have many devices that use DHEA p i o t or Internet of Things devices such as these typically don't

80
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:47.420
get configured statically or manually it's too much work to configure it manually.

81
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.260
You're gonna want to do it dynamically.

82
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:55.870
This device as an example gives me a indication of the air quality in this room.

83
00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:04.940
So my iPhone using IP is connecting to the information from that device so that I can see how good the

84
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.230
air quality is in the room.

85
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:13.890
I can talk to an Alexa Alexa start CCN a quiz.

86
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.830
Welcome to David bongos CCMA quiz.

87
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:21.500
I will ask you twenty four questions try to get as many right as you can.

88
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.210
Just say the number with the answer.

89
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.830
Let's begin.

90
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:29.260
Question 1 which of the following directions does T.P..

91
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.020
Okay let's play again soon.

92
00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:40.400
So that device has been allocated an IP address by DCP that's connecting through Wi-Fi no physical ethernet

93
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.640
cables yet to the Internet.

94
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.530
So going to the default gateway.

95
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:46.200
Okay.

96
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:52.490
So without further ado I'm gonna show you practically how to configure DHEA P now and show you how it

97
00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:54.560
actually works.

98
00:07:54.560 --> 00:08:00.050
Okay so in this topology I've turned off the windows P.C. and the linux host I want to configure the

99
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:05.750
right of first and then once I've configured the right I want to run y shock on this link so that you

100
00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:15.650
can see the DHEA message so you can see the entire thing happening I guess he hits the to show IPD HP

101
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:24.890
let's look at some options binding at the moment there are no bindings we haven't configured an address

102
00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:34.240
pull yet an address pull in subscript terminology is very similar to a scope on say Windows or a another

103
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:40.940
platform I'm basically gonna create a pool of addresses and I'm gonna give it a name let's call it P.C..

104
00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:50.060
This could be any name I'm gonna specify the network that is gonna be allocated and the subnet mask.

105
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:56.710
Now don't worry if you aren't used to Cisco commands similar kind of principles apply no matter what

106
00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.180
device you're working on.

107
00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:59.360
He I've got a home right.

108
00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.230
This is a Beatty home router.

109
00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:06.300
I'm based in the UK so British Telecom is my service provider.

110
00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:09.610
This is the device that connects me to the Internet.

111
00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:17.880
If I go to advance settings here on this device make this a bit bigger and go to home network and go

112
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.590
to it IP addresses.

113
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:26.820
What you'll see here is this is the IP address of the router so that would typically be my default gateway

114
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:32.340
if I connected to the wireless network or Wi-Fi network on this device.

115
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:40.410
There's the subnet mask the DHB server is enabled and I've manually configured a range of addresses

116
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:47.150
and I've specified the least time so last time in this case is three days.

117
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:52.200
Typically a host will try and renew its IP address halfway through the least time.

118
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:59.310
So that's an example on a home router in this example a British Telecom router on Cisco right as you

119
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:05.450
typically are going to use the CLIA or command line interface to configure the devices so the network

120
00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:15.110
is once again this network that's similar in concept to specifying a range of addresses the way Cisco

121
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:21.600
could do it is you specify the network and then you specify what's called an exclusion range of addresses

122
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.020
that you want to exclude.

123
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:28.350
So typically you're going to want to exclude the routers IP address from the pool and perhaps other

124
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:30.640
network devices that you've got.

125
00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:30.880
Okay.

126
00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:35.730
So default gateway or default rather will be the local rider.

127
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.560
That's the IP address of the local rider.

128
00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:42.860
I'll specify the DNS server as the local rider as well.

129
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:48.810
Now I know that IP address because I've configured this rider to use this IP address.

130
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:56.430
So I've basically configured show run shows me the configuration of the Cisco rider I've configured

131
00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:59.920
the Cisco rider with a DHB pull.

132
00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:01.460
This is the network.

133
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.540
This is the default rider or default gateway.

134
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:10.920
This is the DNS server very similar to this being the IP address of my B.T. rider.

135
00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:15.850
This is the subnet mask that's being used and these are the addresses that are being allocated.

136
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.780
Now I haven't specified a least time I could do that.

137
00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:23.700
So IPD HP pool P.C. many options are available here.

138
00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:30.870
Many commands can be configured so I could specify lease and then specified number of days if I wanted

139
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:32.910
to or specify infinite.

140
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:37.060
Be careful with infinite because you could use up your pool of addresses.

141
00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:44.220
So I'll just specify this time of one day I could specify a domain name as an example of let's say that.

142
00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.960
So David bumbled dot com.

143
00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:56.130
If I go back one step I could say IPD HP excluded addresses and let's exclude the router from the address

144
00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:57.210
pool.

145
00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:05.330
So on the right to show IPD HP pool I have configured a pool of addresses the pools name is P.C..

146
00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:09.850
Total addresses in the pool is this.

147
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.220
This is the addresses in the address pool.

148
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:19.840
No addresses have been the least at the moment show run once again shows us that IP addresses in this

149
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:26.520
range will be allocated but this one won't default wrote a DNS of a domain name.

150
00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:32.500
Okay so let's start y Ashok on the link between the switch and the router.

151
00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.680
So why Sugar's running.

152
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:44.770
I can see various protocols here you can see as an example CTP spanning tree a bunch of protocols but

153
00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:48.380
I'm gonna filter for the HP because I only want to see the HP messages.

154
00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.770
Okay what I'll do is start the windows host first.

155
00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:58.050
So this Windows piece is actually running as a virtual machine in my topology.

156
00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:59.610
I'm running on a Mac here.

157
00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:07.030
Genius 3 is a way for me to virtualize networks and I'm virtualizing a network of a Cisco rod a switch

158
00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.790
a linux host and a Windows P.C..

159
00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:20.210
So P.C. has booted up a logging I'm going to start a CRM deep prompt

160
00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:30.620
and I'll make this bigger so that it's easier to read so IP config.

161
00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:39.050
And I'm thinking Linux there should be IP conflict not I have config So IP config notice I can see domain

162
00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:45.390
name I can see IP address that was allocated I can see subnet mask default gateway.

163
00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:51.050
Now the reason this piece he used that address and not 10 1 1 1 is because that address was allocated

164
00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:57.080
previously and it's just trying to get to the same IP address so IP address has been allocated I can

165
00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:02.060
use the common IP config slash all to see more information.

166
00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:08.210
So scrolling up again there's the command this is the hostname.

167
00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:13.570
Now notice it's called M.S. age 110 that becomes important when we look at the why shock capture is

168
00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:20.900
the domain name we can see the MAC address of the P.C. so this is the MAC address burnt into the network

169
00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:29.340
interface call it I could see that as an example by going to control panel network and Internet view

170
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:34.650
network status look at my network interface card.

171
00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:41.430
Notice if I click on details I'll be able to see the physical IP address and IP address information

172
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:44.220
in a similar way to using IP config.

173
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:55.010
I can also see when I go to properties that I'm using DHB obtain IP address automatically obtain DNS

174
00:14:55.160 --> 00:15:01.100
server information automatically and using the IP conflict slash all command.

175
00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.940
I can see IP address subnet mask.

176
00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:10.310
Notice default gateway and DNS server information shown in the output here.
