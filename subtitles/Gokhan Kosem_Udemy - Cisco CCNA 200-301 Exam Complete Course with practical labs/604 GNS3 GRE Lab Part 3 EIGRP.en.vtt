00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.740
So Ken wrote one ping Roorda five sipping tendered one to two to two

2
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.580
at the moment.

3
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.250
The pings are failing so let's do a trace right to tendered Wanda to the T.

4
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.600
So we get to tendered Wandered Wandered T which is right at 2:00 and then things seem to stop working

5
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:29.650
let's do a debug IP ICMP and try and ping router five again

6
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:39.510
nothing seems to be happening so let's check on right to what the IP writing table looks like.

7
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.780
We can see network for that wandered wandered 0.

8
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.130
We can.

9
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.850
In other words this network we can see Network Ten that wonder 3.0.

10
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.450
In other words this network we can see Network Ten dot wondered 1.0.

11
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.220
In other words this network we have a default trust to write a three.

12
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.850
But remember that rudder three doesn't have visibility of this network.

13
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.010
If rudder two forwards that traffic to write three it's going to go nowhere.

14
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.190
So what we need to do is we need to run a routing protocol on rudder two and rudder four so that this

15
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:19.370
network is advertised to rudder to through the tunnel so that rudder to forwards traffic to rudder 5

16
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.290
through the tunnel or via rudder for so we should enable that some kind of writing protocol.

17
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:32.610
I'm gonna enable EAI GOP to keep it simple the network that I will enable is Network 10.

18
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.790
So in other words I'm not going to enable you GOP on the surreal interface it's going to be enabled

19
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:47.960
on the first Ethernet and tunnel interfaces only disable or to summarization to show IP GOP interfaces

20
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:55.430
shows me that my job is running on fast Ethan at 0 0 and the total interface it's not running on the

21
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.120
serial interface on the.

22
00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.330
We can do something similar.

23
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.060
So right at your job he 100 network tendered 0 deterrent at zero.

24
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.830
No.

25
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.770
Or the summary.

26
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.310
And notice as soon as I did that a neighbor relationship was established to neighbor tendered wonder

27
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.790
treatment one precinct was made of DI enabled note order summary to that neighbor.

28
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:29.300
So once again show IPO GOP interfaces shows that E.R. job is enabled on Foster Ethan at 0 0 as well

29
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.730
as the tunnel interface show IP.

30
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.950
Yeah.

31
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.840
GOP neighbors we can see an easy job.

32
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.850
He neighbor tended wandered 3 to 1 directly connected through tunnels 0.

33
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.240
The point is and forgive the pun.

34
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.680
This is a point to point link so logically Rider 2 and ride a 4 are directly connected to each other

35
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.480
and each GOP sees them as directly connected neighbors.

36
00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:07.560
So in order to show IP wrote we now see a route to ten dot wonder 2.0 slash 24 via tunnel zero.

37
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:15.850
This was learnt through the GOP from neighbor tendered wonder or to run it to now has visibility of

38
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.970
this network.

39
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:23.880
So can write a 1 ping root of 5.

40
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:30.830
There was a slight timeout but notice the ping now succeeds and we can see the output in the debug.

41
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:40.130
We received an echo reply on Radio 5 just to make the point debug IP ICMP or ping from router 1 once

42
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.030
again.

43
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.730
And notice the ping succeeds.

44
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:43.780
We can see the output.

45
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:51.770
So we've now successfully configured a jury tunnel from router 2 to 3 out of 4 and run a 1 can ping

46
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.510
root of 5.

47
00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.570
But remember router 3 has no visibility of the networks.

48
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:08.890
Rider 3 only sees network 4 dot wandered wandered 0 a network for that wonder 2.0 it has no visibility

49
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:17.560
of this network 10 1 1 0 or this network 10 1 2 0 so let's look at some of the show commands available

50
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.670
for Jari tunnels and do some additional y shock captures.
