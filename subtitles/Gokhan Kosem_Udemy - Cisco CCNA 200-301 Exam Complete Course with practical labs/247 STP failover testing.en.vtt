1
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.610
Now to improve spanning tree performance we want to make these ports.

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.310
Point to Point spanning tree ports.

3
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:13.330
Point to Point Spanish three ports converge a lot quicker when using rapid spanning tree.

4
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:24.410
At the moment on our switches such as Switch three we can see that the ports are shared ports they're

5
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:33.560
going to take a lot longer to converge so interface of range gigabit 0 0 to 1 spanning tree link type

6
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.500
point two point.

7
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.920
This will allow spanning tree to converge a lot quicker.

8
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.990
Notice the ports on our point to point links.

9
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.360
That's typically determined by the speed and duplex.

10
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.570
At the moment these switches in the lab are set to alter negotiate speed and duplex.

11
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.050
You might want to hard code some of those options.

12
00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:07.510
If a port is set to full duplex it will become a point to point port in spanning tree.

13
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:17.650
As you can see here for VLAN 10 gigabit 0 0 and 0 1 point to point links but gigabit 0 2 is a shared

14
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:27.900
link show interface gigabit 0 2 shows me that we are using or 2 duplex or 2 speed negotiation in a physical

15
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.830
network.

16
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:39.370
We may want to hard code speed and duplex or when it negotiates to use full duplex the porch will become

17
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.450
a point to point link between genius 3.

18
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:53.800
It's not negotiating that so I want to manually set the port type two point two point in spanning tree.

19
00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:01.850
So let's do the same on all the switches so switch for shows spanning tree VLAN 20 as an example can

20
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:13.690
see the ports a shared interface range gigabit 0 0 to 1 on the uplinks spanning tree link type point

21
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.350
two point shows spanning tree v land 20.

22
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.850
Notice those ports in our point to point.

23
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.520
Let's do it on the core switches as well.

24
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:35.100
So at the moment shows spanning tree v land 1 all my ports have a type of shed including the link aggregation

25
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:51.580
so interface range gigabit 00 to 3 spanning tree link type point to point shows spanning tree v land

26
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.320
one as an example.

27
00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:02.170
Ports are still showing as shared on some of the ports gigabit 1 0 is the link to the host.

28
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.570
That's a K port.

29
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.900
Channel is showing up a shared cell going to the port channel

30
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:19.400
and lets configure that as a span entry point to point link show spanning tree v land 1 all ports are

31
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.150
now point to point on the core.

32
00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.260
So these links all point to point.

33
00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:31.080
We'll do the same on switch to so interface range gigabit.

34
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.120
0 0 2 3 spanning tree link type.

35
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.970
Point to Point interface port.

36
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.180
Channel 1.

37
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:51.960
Make it point to point shows spanning tree v land 1 or ports are point to point this port is still shared

38
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.140
so I could make that a point to point link.

39
00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:02.950
But for the moment I'm going to leave that as it is because we can enable port Fost on these links to

40
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:10.070
increase the throughput of spending through convergence on those ports shows spanning tree v land and

41
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:16.070
10 billion.

42
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.770
Now let's test some of the convergence.

43
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:25.530
I'm going to send a continuous ping from P.S. 1 so row 1 pretending to be our P.S. to the course switch

44
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.420
and let's see how good the convergence is so on write a 1

45
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:41.600
ping tendered 1 to 10 at 1 ping succeeds but I can repeat to the ping let's say ten thousand times before

46
00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.740
a presenter on switch three so the switch here

47
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.240
shows spanning tree big land 10.

48
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.190
We can see that the root port is gigabit 0 0.

49
00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:05.860
This port is an alternate port so we'll stop the ping constantly interface gigabit 00 shut it.

50
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.690
Notice we've lost a ping.

51
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.330
We're losing a few pings here.

52
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.490
So the convergence is taking a while one of the things we can do to speed up convergence

53
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.890
is change.

54
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.300
This port.

55
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.740
Notice the state is learning gigabit.

56
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.990
0 1 has gone forwarding already.

57
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:33.570
But notice this port is still learning because it's a shared port it's going to take longer to converge.

58
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.410
So took a while for that port to converge.

59
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.920
Could take like 30 seconds for it to converge.

60
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:47.810
So point to point lengths converge very quickly as an example when I shutter this port down this port

61
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.620
very quickly went to the forwarding state.

62
00:05:52.640 --> 00:06:03.030
If I'm no shut that port again shows spanning tree Vila and 10 you can see that port is already forwarding

63
00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.370
so very quickly this port went to forwarding and this port went to blocking.

64
00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:16.420
But the problem is the port to the host is blocking because this is a shared port so shared ports go

65
00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:23.530
through the normal spanning three times of blocking listening learning forwarding so it's going to take

66
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.030
it a while for the port to start forwarding notice.

67
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:31.010
We're learning now and then after a period of time it starts forwarding.

68
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:39.970
So if you don't have a switch connected to this port you can improve the convergence of that port by

69
00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:47.740
making it a spending tree port Fost port so I can specify port first here.

70
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:55.910
Notice we warned that this should only be enabled on ports where we don't have switches connected so

71
00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:02.860
we shouldn't have hubs or switches or other devices that can cause loops in the network on these ports.

72
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:12.630
So our pings are continuing shows spanning TV Land 10:00 shows me that the port of the shared port.

73
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:24.120
But now when I go into gigabit 0 0 and shut the port down port is gone down no notice gigabit 0 1 is

74
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:24.960
already forwarding

75
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.250
it's taking a while because I put it looks like I put the command on the wrong port.

76
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.530
So let's have a look again at the config

77
00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:43.790
I incorrectly configured port Fost on gigabit 00.

78
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.070
So let's fix that problem.

79
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:55.510
Interface gigabit 00 no spanning tree port Fost edge to show run interface gigabit 00 no shut the port

80
00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:04.210
now and then let's go on to gigabit 0 to a top spanning tree port Fost and see if I did this right now.

81
00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:11.500
So do show interface gigabit 0 to this port is now a port first port or what's called an airport which

82
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.020
is correct to show run gigabit 00.

83
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:20.520
That shouldn't be a port for support and it's not and neither should gigabit 0 1.

84
00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:25.700
So that looks better to show spanning tree v land 10.

85
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:26.710
Notice the difference.

86
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:30.230
This is now a shared edge port that looks a lot better.

87
00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:37.510
Let's do the ping again at the moment gigabit 00 is the route port so interface gigabit 00.

88
00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:38.620
Shut the port down.

89
00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:47.130
Let's see if we lose as many pings and as you've noticed they we only lost a single ping so I'll break

90
00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:48.720
that ping.

91
00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:55.650
We lost one ping we lost this lost one when I broke the ping but we only lost a single ping when the

92
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:56.580
interface went down.

93
00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:59.670
So that's a lot better than we had previously.

94
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:04.550
So do show spanning tree V Line 10.

95
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.770
Notice gigabit 1 slash 0 is the route port.

96
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:14.830
I'll send 100 pings now and let's no shut the interface.

97
00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:22.940
Make that a thousand shows banning tree VLAN 10.

98
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:29.240
What you'll notice once again is it dropped a single ping over there and it immediately reverted to

99
00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:32.720
port one being the route port.

100
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.790
So what's the moral of the story.

101
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:37.860
These links need to be point to point links.

102
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.220
This link needs to be a port first port.

103
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.840
In other words a large port.

104
00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:52.910
Compare that to switch for on switch for this as a shared port so it's going to take a lot longer for

105
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:53.840
this to converge

106
00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:57.320
on this switch.

107
00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:02.210
We want to go in gigabit 0 2 and Type spending 3 port fast

108
00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:14.260
and now when we type show spending TV Land 20 notice it's a shared edge port and we could do something

109
00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:27.110
similar now en route to aisle paying ten to one to 20 to 1 and repeat that thousand times again gone

110
00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:38.040
to gigabit 00 start the ping and I'll shutter the port down notice we lost one ping.

111
00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:48.590
So do shows spanning tree v land 20 in this example forwarding port is now this port.

112
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:59.410
It's the route port this port is the edge port to the ping again on those shut gigabit 00 now gigabit

113
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.230
00 is the route port and it's already forwarding

114
00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:12.600
the convergence is a lot better than we had previously we didn't even lose a ping in this example.

115
00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:16.580
So let's do that process again to a ping.

116
00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:25.390
Shut the port down you've lost a ping but only one all no shut to the port

117
00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:38.100
just to quick I'll shut it down again to ping again port is shut no shut it shows spending tree V Line

118
00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:51.040
to show spending tree v lan 10 or 20 in this example gigabit 00 is the route port gigabit 0 is the alternate

119
00:11:51.040 --> 00:12:00.650
port gigabit 0 2 is a shared edge port so once again to optimize spanning tree make all ports point

120
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:08.960
to point links between you such as make your ports to your edge devices spanning tree port Fost or edge

121
00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:14.180
ports as it's called in the industry so Cisco term is Port fast.

122
00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:19.520
Other vendors will call these edge ports and we could do the same on these two ports here.

123
00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:30.020
So the last thing we need to do is on such one go on two gigabit one slash 0 and type spending tree

124
00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:45.210
port fust and then do the same on switch to interface gigabit Wan slash zero spending tree port Fost

125
00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:55.690
show spanning tree v land one gigabit one slash zero is an edge port on such two shows spanning tree

126
00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:09.610
villain one on such one notice this is an HD port here so we've optimized spanning tree by making all

127
00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:10.380
of these ports.

128
00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:20.830
Point to Point links in spanning tree these ports are edge ports and these two ports are bonded in a

129
00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:23.650
link aggregation or ether channel.

130
00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:28.000
So once again on switch one show spanning tree v land one.

131
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:35.620
Notice this is a port channel and it's a point to point to link spanning tree has been optimized.

132
00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:41.950
Now that we've optimized layer 2 We need to look at layer 3 functionality and specifically the default

133
00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:45.020
gateways of devices in the topology.

134
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:51.310
We also need to think about routing how are we going to root from these devices onto the Internet.

135
00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:53.310
So we'll cover that in subsequent videos.
