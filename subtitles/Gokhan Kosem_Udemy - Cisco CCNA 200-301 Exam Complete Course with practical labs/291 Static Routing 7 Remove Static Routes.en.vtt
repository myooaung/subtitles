00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So how do you get rid of static routes?

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
in this example the command show run

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
will show me the static routes configured on the router and there they are.

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
A quick way of doing will be to type show run | include ip route

5
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and once again there are around 3 static routes

6
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
the command show ip route

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
shows me that I have 3 static routes in the routing table

8
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
so what I could do to remove the static route

9
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
is use the word no in front and then copy and paste the static route

10
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and now when I use the command do show ip route

11
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
we'll notice I only have 2 static routes in the routing table.

12
00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So do sh run | include ip route

13
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I only have 2 static routes now

14
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
put no in front and paste the static routing

15
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
no and do the 3rd static route.

16
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So now when I use the command do sh run | include ip route

17
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
no routes are shown and the command sh ip route

18
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
shows me that there are no static routes in the configuration.

19
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Now a quicker way of doing that is to copy the static routes into notepad

20
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
so notepad or another text that it can be very useful

21
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I'll press CTRL-H and I’m going to replace IP route with no IP route

22
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and then CTRL-A to select all the text, CTRL-C to copy it

23
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and then I’m going to paste that back into the router.

24
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:03.000
So I’ve removed all those static routes by using notepad to speed things up

25
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
notepad can be very useful

26
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and this just one example of using notepad to speed things up.
