00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:06.460
It's good practice to back up your Ioway see images especially as your network grows.

2
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.840
You're going to want to have a central place to back up and store your Aiwass images and configuration

3
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.590
files.

4
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:21.220
So it's good practice to back up your Iowas files to a central tief server or server.

5
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:28.620
This is useful for example if an Iowa image gets accidentally deleted will be raised or becomes corrupted

6
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.600
you're going to want to be able to restore your iOS from A to B server.

7
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:42.090
So good practice to copy from the flash to a TFT server and have that available if you need to restore

8
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:50.010
an image or perhaps when you upgrade a router you encounter issues and may need to downgrade back to

9
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.350
an older version of operating system.

10
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:58.050
So good practice to have your Ioway see images backed up to a central location.

11
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.250
Now what about Iris images.

12
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.990
They have these cryptic names that may be difficult initially to understand.

13
00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:11.190
So in looking at an image the first part of such a see twenty nine hundred is the platform.

14
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:18.660
This is an image for a twenty nine hundred Cisco Rodda the universal canine option means that this image

15
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.090
is universal.

16
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.150
So it's a single image set that includes the IP base security unified communications and data feature

17
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.270
sets.

18
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.860
Each router is activated for an IP based feature set.

19
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.340
However other feature sets you'll need to activate those features by loading a license onto the router

20
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.000
and we'll discuss that in a separate video.

21
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:47.390
So in this example the platform is a Cisco twenty nine hundred series integrated services router.

22
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:55.890
The third part in Zayd or M.Z. indicates where the image runs and if the file is compressed in this

23
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.450
example the image is run in RAM.

24
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:08.030
So M indicates runs in RAM and Z or Zed indicates a compressed image digitally signed Cisco Aiwa images

25
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:15.430
identified by a three character extension in the image name stands for digitally signed software.

26
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:25.580
Pos stands for production or special development image so p in the name indicates that it's a production

27
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.140
image that is approved for general release.

28
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:38.340
A s indicates a special image that is development software and should only be used in special circumstances.

29
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:45.860
The indicates the key version that is used to digitally sign the image key version is identified by

30
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.430
an alphanumeric character such as A B C..

31
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:58.790
The fifth part 15:2 hyphen for Dot M 1 indicates the software version number and the final part burn

32
00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.880
is the file extension.

33
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.100
This indicates that the file is a binary executable file.

34
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.260
Just be aware that the Cisco Iowas naming conventions do change.

35
00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.580
The best place to look for information is on the Cisco Web site.

36
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:23.630
For example on the Cisco software downloads help and if a q page you'll find a lot of information for

37
00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:30.180
example the Cisco Iowas software release naming convention is explained so in this example we have a

38
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:38.040
major release of told that one the maintenance release enterprise designator six build of the release

39
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.210
and first rebeled of release date.

40
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:48.000
Have a look at documents such as the following for instructions on how to download software and how

41
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.110
to discover more information about the different options available with regards to the Cisco Ioway s.
