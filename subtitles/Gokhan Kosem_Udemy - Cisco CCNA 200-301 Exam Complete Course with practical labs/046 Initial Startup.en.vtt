00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now that my PC is connected to the console port of a Cisco router

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
let’s have a look at the initial startup

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
now some tips, if you don’t get any output on the screen of your PC

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
when you connect to the Cisco router or switch, check your cabling

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
so make sure that your cables are connected properly

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
make sure that the power is connected to the Cisco router switch correctly

7
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:33.000
make sure that the console cable is connected to the console port and not to another port

8
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Make sure that you’ve turn the router on.

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So as an example you need to push the power on switch on a router

10
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
typically low end switches don’t have a power on button

11
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
so its simply connect the power cable to the switch and would boot up

12
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
but on the router, typically you need to turn the router on of connecting power.

13
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So now let’s watch the startup process on this router.

14
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The first thing I'm going to do is reboot the router by using the reload command.

15
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I don’t wanna to save any configuration on this router because

16
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I want you to see what a router looks like, when it boots up with no configuration.

17
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So I’m gonna say no for saving the config and I'll hit enter to confirm

18
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
that I want to proceed with the reload.

19
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
We can now see that the reload was requested, so if you're connected

20
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
to the console of a router and turned on the router.

21
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
You would see something similar to this on your screen from a router that just booted up.

22
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
What you can see in the output, in this example is that

23
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
the router has 131072 kilobytes of memory.

24
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:57.000
If we take that and divide by 1024, we can see that it gives us a value of 128 mega of RAM

25
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
which doesn’t seem much when compared to the gigabytes of RAM in PC's today.

26
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
This is a 2801 router and you can see that over here.

27
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
the router is decompressing the image, so it's booting up the image

28
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
in the output we can see which IOS software the router is using

29
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000
we can see the version and we can see that this is 2801 router software.

30
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
We can see once again that this is a Cisco 2801 router

31
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
we can see how much RAM has been installed in the router

32
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000
now you need to add these 2 values together and when divided by 1024

33
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
we can work out the Megs of RAM installed in the router.

34
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000
The value showing here are in kilobytes, so you need to divide by 1024

35
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
to convert it into megabytes, so in this example

36
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
the router has a 128 meg of RAM and this is a 2801 router.

37
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000
In this example the router has 2 Ethernet interfaces and 2 serial interfaces.

38
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
You can also see the amount of flash installed in the router.

39
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So in this example we’ve got 62592 kilobytes of flash available.

40
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000
you can also see the amount of NVRAM available which is very, very small in comparison

41
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000
there’s only 191 kilobytes of NVRAM available.

42
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Now in this example the router is trying to boot with the configuration

43
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
found on a TFTP server, so it's sending out a broadcast looking for a TFTP server

44
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000
that has a network config file or Cisco net.cfg file available.

45
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
this is actually been around for many years and was called slarp

46
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.000
what the routers trying to do essentially is trying find the config on a TFTP server

47
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and then boot up with that configuration.

48
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
We’re not interested in using that at the moment, in this example

49
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
there is no TFTP server available on the network with those configuration files.

50
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
The next thing that displays is the initial configuration dialogue.

51
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Now as mentioned most Cisco engineers will not use the initial configuration dialogue.

52
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
I’m just gonna show it to you now so you can see what’s its all about

53
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000
but in the real world it’s unlikely that you going to use this for most deployments.

54
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
so in this example I’m gonna say yes and notice we're told

55
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
that we can use question mark for help at any time.

56
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Control c will break out of the initial configuration dialogue.

57
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
So it’s worth remembering that control c

58
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
allows you to abort this configuration dialogue at any prompt.

59
00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.000
The word in square brackets is the default, so if you just hit enter at any prompt

60
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
that’s the option that’s gonna be selected.

61
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
I’m gonna answer no for basic management set up

62
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
but say yes to see the interfaces available.

63
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
I can now see an interface list.

64
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
So we can now see as an example

65
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
that the router got an IP address on its serial interface.

66
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
we didn’t configure that, notice the method selected is slarp

67
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000
the router try to connect via its serial interface to a TFTP server

68
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
to get an initial configuration that however timed out in our example.

69
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
I'll give a router a name such as R1 in this example

70
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
now we're going to discuss passwords in more detail later.

71
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
There are different types of passwords but for now let’s just give

72
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
the router a secret password and enable password of Cisco 1.

73
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
In brief, a secret password is encrypted and should be used and enable password

74
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:09.000
is shown in clear text in the running and saved configuration of a Cisco device

75
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
and generally shouldn’t be used in today’s environments.

76
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:20.000
We’ll talk more about passwords and how to secure your devices in another video.

77
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
VTY lines are used for telnet and SSH connections

78
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
so we can set up virtual terminal passwords here

79
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
I'll give the router a password of cisco, obviously in this example

80
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
I’m using very simple passwords, in the real world

81
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
you would use much better passwords than a password of cisco, I hope.

82
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Let’s say no to configuring SNMP network management, Simple Network Management Protocol

83
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
or SNMP can be used by central management stations for the management

84
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
of multiple network devices as well as gathering statistics

85
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:06.000
of CPU, utilization, network interface utilization and others statistic.

86
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
I’m gonna saying no to the configuration of IP

87
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
in this example I’m gonna say no to CLNS which is a protocol

88
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
that you probably won't encounter unless you're running a router protocols

89
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:26.000
such as ISIS I'll also say no to bridging, we don’t wanna turn this router into a bridge.

90
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Now in this example the router has an old ISDN interface

91
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
so their are various options that allows to configure the ISDN

92
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.000
but in today’s world ISDN is not typically used, so we gonna skip all the options here.

93
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
So well just go with the defaults showing here

94
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
but we won't worry about configuring ISDN at all in these videos.

95
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.000
We're then prompted if we wanna configure the first FastEthernet interface on the router.

96
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
What I want you to see is that the router is prompting you with multiple questions

97
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000
to help you configure the device and depending on how your answers the various questions.

98
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
The router will prompt you for more information

99
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
on how to configure various options on the device.
