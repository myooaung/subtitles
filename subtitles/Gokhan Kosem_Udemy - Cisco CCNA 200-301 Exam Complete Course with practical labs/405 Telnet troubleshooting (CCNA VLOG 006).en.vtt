00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:16.120
This is one of multiple videos that help you troubleshoot CCN scenarios in preparation for the shishya

2
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.290
exam.

3
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.690
We're going to look at how to troubleshoot multiple issues with TELLEMENT in this network.

4
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:29.180
So let's get started on Reddit one telnet to the Lupica brought it to you.

5
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.750
We told that Ponsford is required but none is sent.

6
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.580
So we're able to telnet to the road.

7
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:46.740
But then it's immediately disconnecting us some router to show run pipes begin to V-twin on the y line.

8
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:53.590
We've got a command called a log in log in means that the Etiwanda line requires a password.

9
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.160
Notice we told that postes what is required but none is set.

10
00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.800
So pulse needs to be configured on the Etiwanda lines

11
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.360
so password.

12
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.680
Cisco.

13
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.120
Let's try again telnet from a one to two.

14
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.450
We now get a postes would prompt.

15
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:20.970
And if you put the password in correctly we can log in second problem when we try to go to enable mode.

16
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.830
We told that not possible to set so show run.

17
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.960
What you'll notice in the output is that there is no enabled password

18
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.100
so show run include enable no output.

19
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:50.530
What about secret no secret password configured so enable and we could set a secret or an enabled password.

20
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.830
Let's set secrets because that's better.

21
00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:00.420
So we'll just call the Cisco when we type and able now we prompted for a password and we can log to

22
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.580
the Rodda So let's test that again.

23
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.070
Back on Route 1.

24
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.540
Tell that to rodded too can log in and we can go to enable mode.

25
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.770
So we've solved the problem on router too.

26
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.170
What about router 3.

27
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.460
Telnet to the loopback of rotisserie we told that the connection is refused by the remotest.

28
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.370
Can we ping that loop back.

29
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.230
Yes we can.

30
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.010
So this is not an IP connectivity problem.

31
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.410
This is something else.

32
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.740
On router 3 show run pipe begin Vicci wine.

33
00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.870
Now these pump commands may not work in the exam so just type show run and then scroll down to the end

34
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.140
of the config to see the Viti white configuration.

35
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.750
So you might have to do a show run and press baseball all the way down until you see the video why Conficker.

36
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.300
Can you see the problem notice here.

37
00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:08.370
Transport input S-sh we are using telnet but the lines have been restricted to only using S-sh which

38
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.550
is better in the real world.

39
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:17.900
But here we want to be able to telnet so we could specify all which would allow all protocols.

40
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.840
But from a security point of view we may want to enable only S-sh and Tonette.

41
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:37.470
So show run pipe began Viti Why so both Telenet and S-sh are allowed on the Viti one line.

42
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:45.170
Once again let's see if we can telnet we are able to log interactive 3.

43
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.680
So we solved the problem on rotatory.

44
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.050
Now what about Route 1.

45
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:57.960
Can we told that to rot a one size connection is refused can be paying out of one.

46
00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.780
Yes we can.

47
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.520
So we need to get back to Route 1.

48
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.450
Let's have a look at the configuration I'm going to scroll through the config.

49
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.710
See if you can find the problem.

50
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:17.340
So there's the IP address on the loopback.

51
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.460
Can you see a problem notice this access.

52
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:28.950
Close one in an access list is being applied to the BT one lines and scrolling up through the config

53
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:39.900
it's only permitting the loopback of Rhoda to when you telnet it using the outgoing interface as the

54
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.060
source of the Talmud connection.

55
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:49.020
Now we could specify source interfaces and try and use the loopback as the source but for CCMA that's

56
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.310
not required.

57
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:57.420
What we want to do on CCMA is either remove this access list or edit to the access list to permit specific

58
00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.030
devices in the topology.

59
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:13.200
So for this blog all I'll do is remove the access KLOS so show run pipe begin to you why the access

60
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.450
clause has been removed.

61
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:16.550
Tone it back.

62
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.670
Still not working.

63
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:19.840
What's the problem.

64
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.240
Notice Sheir transport input.

65
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:32.970
None so line Vitti Wazira for transport input Tonette and perhaps S-sh.

66
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.640
Now we've got the same problem we had previously pulser required but none sent.

67
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:46.930
So when I type log in we have to specify a password and then we want to specify and enabled password

68
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.240
or secret password.

69
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.410
So now we can log in.

70
00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.680
So we've sold to multiple problems in this typology.

71
00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.520
Make sure that you understand what's required on a Viti y line.

72
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:11.040
As an example on this router I'll now change it to say log in a local rather than just a log in.

73
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:21.780
Notice the problem now telnet to Rodda to notice I made another mistake.

74
00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:28.110
I was actually working on Rotto one so you need to be careful which is you working on.

75
00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.910
So let's get out of here.

76
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.540
That's rather one exit out of here.

77
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:34.920
I'm back wrote it to No.

78
00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.350
So Tonette back to write a one.

79
00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:45.130
It's asking for a username so I'll trust Cisco to also have Cisco.

80
00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.250
That's not going to work because I don't have a username configured.

81
00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:51.360
So just to reiterate

82
00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:02.310
on a one we used the command log in local So this password has no effect.

83
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:08.430
We have to specify a local user name just to prove the point.

84
00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:23.080
I'll say no password Cisco and go back to the Viti when so there's no password on the Etiwanda line.

85
00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:27.460
I'm back on router to telnet back to Route 1.

86
00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:33.860
Notice it's asking for a username password on the Viti while line is irrelevant when you use log and

87
00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:49.660
local so comfy username David password Cisco log in now as David and I can log in.

88
00:07:49.670 --> 00:08:00.180
The reason I can go to privilege mode because we have an enable password configured on the router notice

89
00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:01.910
enabled password Cisco.

90
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:12.540
We could change that by saying username David privilege and specify 15 to give David full privileges

91
00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:14.690
to the Rodda.

92
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:15.630
Notice the difference now.

93
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:24.190
When I telnet to the router and log in I'm taken immediately to privilege mode and that's because

94
00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:33.050
we specified the privilege of the user as 15.

95
00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:34.640
This is bad practice.

96
00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:40.940
You should use a secret so there are some troubleshooting tips on how to troubleshoot telnet.

97
00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:42.310
Thank you for watching.
