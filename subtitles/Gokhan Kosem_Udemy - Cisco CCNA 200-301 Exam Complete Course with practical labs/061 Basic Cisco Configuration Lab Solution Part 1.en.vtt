00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.160
In this lab we told that we need to power on the devices and then configure them.

2
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.120
Per these instructions something to click on Write a one when I click on see a lie I'm told that the

3
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.650
device needs to be powered on

4
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.710
so I'm going to power on the device and go back to see a lie.

5
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.290
And as you can see here the device is booting

6
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.700
I'll do something similar with writer to turn it on and then go to see a line.

7
00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:04.180
The device is also booting up to this point when a Cisco router boots up for the first time a system

8
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.730
configuration dialog is displayed.

9
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:07.960
We don't want to use that.

10
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:16.050
So I'm going to type no and press enter to bypass the initial configuration dialog.

11
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:25.330
The initial configuration dialog is a wizard that allows you to configure basic settings on Cisco devices.

12
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.370
We don't want to do that at the moment I'm in user mode.

13
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.950
I'm going to type enable to go to privilege mode and then type confetti to go to global configuration

14
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:44.810
mode so enable configured terminal or confetti takes me to global configuration.

15
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:52.210
Now these devices have names right a one and write it to the prompts show Rhoda.

16
00:01:52.210 --> 00:02:00.680
So the first thing I'm going to do is configure the router as writer 1 and as I write it to in the exam

17
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.370
it'll be very clear whether you need to change the device names of the devices.

18
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:13.440
But one of the first things you're going to want to do is configure the Device name now that we've configured

19
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.760
the host names.

20
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:23.790
The next step is to configure IP addresses as shown in the diagram show IP interface brief shows us

21
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.290
the interfaces on the devices.

22
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:36.450
This interface needs to be configured with this IP address ten dot wandered wandered one slash 24 now

23
00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.230
before we can figure the IP address.

24
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.530
Notice of the interface is shut down.

25
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.970
Cisco riders by default have their interfaces shut down.

26
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.670
So you need to go into interface gigabit zero slash zero slash zero and use the command.

27
00:02:51.670 --> 00:03:00.120
No shutdown or no shut to enable the interface or bring the interface up on the side.

28
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.690
We can see something similar.

29
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.920
Show IP interface brief notice of this interface is shut down.

30
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.830
Now what you'll notice is I'm using abbreviated commands.

31
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.870
So rather than typing configure terminal I'll often just type confetti and rather than typing interface

32
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.090
gigabit 0 slash 0 slash 0.

33
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:38.350
What I'll do is type int gig 0 slash 0 slash 0 or I'll type int g and press tab to get gigabit and then

34
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:46.960
top the rest of the command use a command like no shut rather than no shut down to enable an interface

35
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.780
get used to typing abbreviated commands.

36
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.150
It's going to save you a lot of time.

37
00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:05.940
So at the moment both these interfaces are up up but no IP address is configured on the interface so

38
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:15.450
interface gigabit 0 slash 0 slash 0 IP address is going to be 10 1 1 1 and then we need to specify a

39
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.010
subnet mask.

40
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.900
Now 255 is the decimal equivalent of eight binary ones.

41
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.100
We are told to use 24 binary ones here.

42
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:34.990
So it's eight plus eight plus eight which is 24 binary ones.

43
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:43.980
So as an example show run interface gigabit zero slash zero slash zero on a real router shows us the

44
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:51.480
configuration of that interface but that doesn't work on packet tracer so I'll use the command show

45
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.650
run.

46
00:04:52.650 --> 00:05:01.950
So there's the configuration of gigabit 0 slash zero slash zero show IP interface gigabit zero slash

47
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:08.850
zero slash zero shows us the IP address in this notation.

48
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.460
So that's a nice way to check that you've done it right.

49
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:23.590
On the side interface gigabit to zero slash zero slash a zero IP address 10 1 1 2 subnet mask slash

50
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:36.290
24 show IP interface gigabit zero slash zero slash zero this command shows us the IP address of the

51
00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:49.130
device after the moment show OP only shows the local IP address in the OP cache of the device but hopefully

52
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:54.290
at this point I'll be able to ping Radha to which I can.

53
00:05:54.290 --> 00:06:03.980
The first ping is lost because the writer needs to do an OP for the mac address of Radha to so show

54
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:14.060
up now shows us that the local writer Radha one has learnt the MAC address of wrote it to that's associated

55
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:25.790
with this IP address on the side show up thus Radha has learnt the MAC address of Radha one so paying

56
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:35.170
10 1 1 1 writer 2 can ping write a 1 so we've successfully configured IP addresses as shown in the diagram

57
00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:42.880
and the writers can ping each other now we need to configure and enable password of Cisco notice on

58
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:50.290
Route 1 when I log into the console no password is required and when I type enable note password is

59
00:06:50.290 --> 00:07:00.020
required we want to change that by using the command enable password Cisco.

60
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:10.690
So now when I type exit and log back in and type enable notice I'm asked for the enabled password if

61
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:18.850
I type disable and then enable again I'm asked for the privilege or enable password to get into the

62
00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:25.010
right to notice the password is shown in clear text in the running config.

63
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:33.940
In other words anyone can see what the password is and that's why we asked to encrypt the enabled password

64
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:42.440
before I do that I'll configure and enabled password on write it to on write it to when I type enable

65
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:49.420
to go from user mode to privilege mode or enable mode I'm not asked for a password so enable password

66
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:58.900
Cisco exit out of the router type enable now I have to enter the password password is shown in clear

67
00:07:58.900 --> 00:07:59.920
text.

68
00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.580
So now let's encrypt the enabled password

69
00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:15.590
on Route 1 we use the command service password encryption show run.

70
00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.330
Notice the password is now encrypted.

71
00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:25.620
This is a very weak password that stops people watching over your shoulder from learning what the password

72
00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:32.920
is so after the moment password is in clear text service password encryption

73
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:46.250
show run password is now encrypted we then asked to configure a secret password of Cisco ONE TWO THREE.

74
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:55.510
SO quantity enable and for this command we need to use secret specify the password as Cisco ONE TWO

75
00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:56.970
THREE.

76
00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:05.880
SO show run shows us that we have both and enable password configured as well as a secret password.

77
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:13.970
Notice the secret password is using empty five hashing by default so you don't have to try and encrypt

78
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.130
that it's done automatically.

79
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:26.740
When I type in able now I have to enter the secret password secret passwords override enable passwords.

80
00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:32.710
So on the side I'll set the secret password exit out of the router.

81
00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:37.200
And when I log back in again I need to enter the secret password.
