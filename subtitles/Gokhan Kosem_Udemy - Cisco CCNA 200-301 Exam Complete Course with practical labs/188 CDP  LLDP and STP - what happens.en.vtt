1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now on switch 1, sh spanning-tree vlan 1

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
shows me that gigabit 0/1, 2 and 3 are blocking

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
so spanning tree are blocking those ports

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
but when I use the command show cdp neighbors

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I do see my neighboring switches even though those ports are blocked.

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So management traffic such as CDP, VTP, DTP, LLDP

7
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and others are not blocked through Spanning Tree.

8
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
In this example, show lldp neighbor shows me

9
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
that I have a neighboring switch

10
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
switch 2 connected to gigabit 0/0 as well as to gigabit 0/1.

11
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Gigabit 0/1 is blocking in Spanning Tree

12
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
but I'm still receiving those LLDP messages on that blocking port.

13
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Now I donâ€™t see switch 3 and switch 4 in LLDP

14
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
because these 2 switches are not running LLDP

15
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
but if I went to switch 3 as an example

16
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and enabled Link Layer Discovery Protocol

17
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I should see that switch become available as a neighbor and there you go.

18
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Switch 3 is available as neighbor on gigabit 0/2

19
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
even though Spanning Tree is blocking on that port.

20
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
By the same token going to switch 4

21
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:44.000
enable lldp go on to switch 1 show lldp neighbor

22
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I can see switch 4 as an LLDP neighbor

23
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I can also see that switch as a CDP neighbor.

24
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
CDP is enabled by default

25
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
LLDP is not but both those protocol are received on a Spanning Tree

26
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
blocking port so even though this port once again are blocking.

27
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
LLDP and CDP are received on that port as well as transmitted.

28
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So back on switch 2

29
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
sh cdp neighbor

30
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I can still see switch 1 as a CDP neighbor and as an LLDP neighbor

31
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
even though this port is blocking in Spanning Tree

32
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
so management traffic such as LLDP and CDP is transmitted

33
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and received on blocking ports or to use industry standard term

34
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
on ports that are discarding.
