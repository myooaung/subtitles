00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:16.900
This is one of multiple videos demonstrating how to troubleshoot issues in preparation for the CCMA

2
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.270
exam.

3
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:29.180
In this example we've been told that P.S. One is not able to ping P.S. to so let's verify that can P.S.

4
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.090
1 ping.

5
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:37.820
P.S. to notice the U and the Dutch telling us that it's unreachable you means that the traffic is being

6
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.860
sent to a router and the router doesn't know where to forward the traffic.

7
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.110
Let's have a look at the writing table on this router acting as our P.S. notice in the output we have

8
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.420
a default gateway configured so can the PCI paying the default gateway.

9
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.080
Yes it can.

10
00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.290
So P.S. one is able to ping rather one in this topology I'm using Cisco.

11
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.680
IOW v routers in genius 3.

12
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:11.000
So rather than trying to set up a physical P.C. I'm simply using Cisco Iowa's v images to act as our

13
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.270
pieces.

14
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.200
So on a one let's have a look.

15
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.540
Show IP front no rights are being lent to a writing protocol.

16
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:28.130
We only see local and connected ruts on the road to show IP protocols.

17
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:36.640
OSP has been enabled as a writing protocol on Route 1 one a routing protocol would be required to allow

18
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:44.050
rider 1 to write traffic to this remote network so Rider 2 would have to inform rider 1 about that network

19
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.500
using a routing protocol of some description.

20
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:58.030
And in this example it's always P.F. on route to show IP protocols or SPF is enabled on this rather

21
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.640
show ip route.

22
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.690
It's not learning any rules however from road one either.

23
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:11.250
So looking at this output are you able to see the problem.

24
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.650
This output should allow you to see where the problem is in this network.

25
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.000
So have you spotted the issue.

26
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:30.460
Rado 1 has this photo I.D. route to has this roto I.D. the Rada I.D. All the same on both riders in

27
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.730
0 SPF Rada I.D. have to be unique.

28
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:42.460
So show run pipe section who is P.F. in the output we can see that the Rondo I.D. has been configured

29
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:49.030
to one dot wondered wondered one show run pipe section of SPF.

30
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.430
The same thing is being configured on route a to so en route to

31
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:05.990
let's configure the rota ideas quadruple to notice we not getting any output when we make changes.

32
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.440
And that's because I disabled logging to the console.

33
00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.780
So let me enable logging and enable logging.

34
00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:15.390
This site

35
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.740
lets see if we get any output.

36
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:34.350
So show IPO SPF neighbor or the neighbor relationship has been established on the site show IP SPF.

37
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.800
Neighbor neighbor relationship has been established.

38
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:44.330
So what I'll do just to show you the problem is I'll set it back to RADA idea of 1 and notice we're

39
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:55.810
told that we need to clear the SPF process so clear IP SPF 1 process

40
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:05.100
notice the neighbor relationship has gone down and notice me being told that there's a duplicate Rada

41
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.610
I.D. and we see that on both sides.

42
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:16.930
So I purposely disabled logging to the console so that you wouldn't see that so before I fix it.

43
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.390
This is what the configuration looks like at the moment.

44
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:25.780
Rada I.D. is set to wandered wandered wandered 1.

45
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.420
So what we should do is change that to quadruple to

46
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.700
in this case we didn't have to reset to the process because the neighbour relationship hadn't been established

47
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.050
yet.

48
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.110
Notice now the relationship has gone full.

49
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:53.500
So we changed the configuration from this to this.

50
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.310
Only difference is Rada is being changed.

51
00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.560
Show IP SPF.

52
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:01.660
NEIGHBOUR.

53
00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:09.810
NEIGHBOUR relationship is established on the side neighbour relationship has been established.

54
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.650
If you see outputs like this it makes it easy to find where the problem is.

55
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.170
You may not have it that easy in the exam as an example.

56
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:20.950
You may have to discover where the problem is.

57
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.640
Like I've done here Sir Ken P.S. one ping.

58
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.830
P.S. 2 Yes it can let's trace T.

59
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.490
P.S. to notice that trace succeeds.

60
00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.510
So we've successfully fixed the issue in this network.

61
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.400
