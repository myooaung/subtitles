00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now rather than configuring switch 2 manually

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I’ve created the script that accomplishes the same thing

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
so type enable conf t change the hostname to switch 2

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.000
shutdown any unused interfaces, so gigabit 1/1 - 3 gigabit 2/0 - 3

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
gigabit 3/0 - 3,  will change the mode to transparent

6
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and then configure the VLANs on the switch,

7
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
so I'll simply copy that config, go to the console of switch 2

8
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
so IOSvL2-2 this switch and then I'll paste that conf again

9
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
interfaces have gone down

10
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
so as you can see the hostname of the switch has changed previously

11
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
it was called switch but now it's switch 2

12
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
sh vlan brief

13
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
shows me VLAN 10 and 20, sh vtp status

14
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
shows me that this switch is configured in transparent mode.

15
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
sh ip int brief

16
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
shows me that all unused interfaces have been shut down

17
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
sh run will allow me to see that full config of the switch.

18
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
So as an example, here you can see the VLANs that were configured.

19
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
You can see that ports have been shut down.

20
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
What I didn’t do on the previous switch is save the config

21
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
so let’s save the config on both the switches before we go any further.

22
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So on switch 1 I'll save the config and on switch 2 I’ll save it

23
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
you can see that the configuration was compressed

24
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and has been saved successfully.

25
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
So sh startup config

26
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
shows me the configuration that we saved.

27
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
As you can see here sh startup

28
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and were using so many bytes out of so many bytes.

29
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Last configuration change was made on the 5th of July.

30
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Now for switch 3 what do we need to configure here?

31
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Well, we need to change the switch name

32
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
we need to shut down any unused interfaces.

33
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Under this switch we are only using interfaces gigabit 0/0, 0/1 and 0/2

34
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000
so gigabit 0/3 is not being used so that interface can be shut down

35
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and then any other interfaces on the switch can be shut.

36
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Now to get the idea just to confirm the interfaces on the switch

37
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
so sh ip int brief shows me the various interfaces.

38
00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000
So the only interfaces that we need are 00, 01 and 02 those 3 interfaces.

39
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
All other interfaces on the switch can be shutdown

40
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and that’s what we're going to do through this config.

41
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
I’m also gonna enable the switches are transparent switch

42
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and configure VLANs 10 and 20.

43
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
so let’s paste that config in type end

44
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and then I’ll save the config

45
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
now for CCNA you would be expected

46
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
to know the full command copy running config

47
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
startup-config and then present it to save the configuration

48
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
to the startup-config but for the real world

49
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
wr is the old command that saves a lot of time

50
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and it doesn’t prompt you to specify where you wanna save the file

51
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
it simply saves it to the startup-config

52
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
so that’s a lot quicker and hence we're using that here.

53
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
So we’ve configured switch 3, let's configure switch 4, switch over here.

54
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
So this would be exactly the same as switch 3

55
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
same interfaces gigabit 0/0 0/1 and 0/2 will be used

56
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
all other interfaces will be shutdown

57
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and we'll configured VLAN 10 and 20

58
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
on that switch, now you might say that

59
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
you don’t actually need VLAN 10 on this switch

60
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
because we only have host in VLAN 20 connected to the switch

61
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
and that would be correct.

62
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
But I’m gonna keep the VLANs consistent on all my switches

63
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
because we may wanna add a host in VLAN 10 to the switch

64
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and a host in VLAN 20 to the switch.

65
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
so copy the config go to the console of switch 4

66
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000
so notice 4 and then paste it in

67
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
CTRL Z or CTRL Z save the config.

68
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
so we've configured the links on the switches

69
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
configured the names of the switches

70
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
we now need to configure the routers, so on route 1

71
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and I'll just do this manually because it will be quick.

72
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Router 1 has just booted

73
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
and we’ve got the initial system configuration dialogue

74
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
asking us whether we want to enter that

75
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
I’m gonna say no, I’m gonna manually configure the router

76
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
so I don’t want to go through the initial configuration dialogue

77
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
in this example, I press return to continue

78
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
I can see various interfaces are coming up.

79
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:39.000
So type enable conf t int f0/0 now before I configure interfaces.

80
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
notice when I type do sh ip int brief on the router

81
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
router interfaces are administratively down by default

82
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
unlike switch interfaces, so I don't need to disable interfaces

83
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
what I need to do is enable the interface.

84
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
before I enable the interface

85
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
I'll configure the IP address of this router.

86
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
so I'll configure this 10.1.10.11

87
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:10.000
with the subnet mask of /24 and then I'll no shut the interface of the router.

88
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
I'll also need to configure the name.

89
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
So I’m just gonna configure that as router 1

90
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and then save the config

91
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
So all I’ve done is no shut the interface

92
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and configure an IP address on Fast Ethernet 0/0 on router 1.

93
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
On route 2 we'll do something similar.

94
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.000
so we'll bypass the initial configuration dialogue, press enter to continue

95
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:45.000
type en type conf t

96
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
change the name of this router to R2

97
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
go on to the FastEthernet interface no shut it

98
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and give it an IP address of 10.1.20.12 and /24 masks.

99
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:08.000
sh ip int brief that IP address is configured and the interfaces up up.

100
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Save the config.

101
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:17.000
The last device to configure initially is router 3 here it is

102
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
it’s already been configured with the host names.

103
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Interface brief, interfaces all shutdown

104
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
so on FastEthernet 0/0

105
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
I’m going to no shut it

106
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:40.000
and in this case, I'll give it an IP address of 10.1.100.253

107
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
we'll use 254 for HSRP later.

108
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:53.000
So I'll configure an IP address on this interface of 10.1.100.253

109
00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:01.000
So that’s an IP address of router 3 on FastEthernet 0/0 interface is up.

110
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Go to the F0/1 interface that interface is currently down

111
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
and hasn’t got an IP address assigned to it.

112
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
So rather than configuring the IP address manually

113
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
I’m gonna type ip address dhcp

114
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.000
so that it gets an IP address from my local physical network

115
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
and when I no shut the interface

116
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000
what we should see in a moment is that it gets an IP address through DHCP.

117
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000
At the moment we still waiting for an address to be assigned but there you go

118
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:45.000
this address 192.168.1.128 has been assigned via DHCP to router 3.

119
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
So sh ip int brief once again

120
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
notice IP address is configured on this interface.

121
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
That was allocated via my local DHCP server

122
00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
which is actually my DSL router here at home.

123
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
I’ll save the config, so we have an IP address configured on F0/0

124
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
and we have an IP address configured on F0/1.

125
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
What I haven’t done is configure IP addresses on these switches

126
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
so let’s do that.
