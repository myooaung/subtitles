00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In the real world, you would never plug a hub between 2 switches

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
because it will degrade your network dramatically.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
In this example, we’ve only got the hub in the topology

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
so that we can capture traffic using Wireshark

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
you generally have a direct link between the 2 switches as shown here.

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
In our topology, I've shut that force down

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
to force all traffic to go via the hub

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
so that we can see what’s taking place

9
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
if I enable this port Spanning Tree will block one of these ports

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
so we won’t be able to see the traffic.

11
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So at the moment PC 1 can ping PC 3

12
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
PC 2 can ping PC 4 but they can't ping each other.

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So let’s setup switch 1 as our Inter-VLAN router.

14
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So on switch 1 sh ip int brief

15
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
at the moment we have an IP address configured on VLAN 1 and VLAN 2.

16
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Now router 1 and router 3

17
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
are still using the IP addressing of VLAN 1 which is bad practice

18
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
we can see that so on router 1 sh ip int brief

19
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
notice the IP address of this device is 10.1.1.1

20
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
so I'll change that to put it into VLAN 11, so IP 10.1.11.1

21
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Just good practice you could keep those IP addresses

22
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
but it will get confusing when you set up a management VLAN.

23
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
So I'll just configure it correctly at this point

24
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
On router 3 currently the IP address is 10.1.1.3

25
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:54.000
so I'll change that to 10.1.11.3 and set up the default gateway 10.1.11.254

26
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and then we need to configure VLAN 11 on switch 1

27
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
so interface VLAN 11, IP address 10.1.11.254

28
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I showed that SVI or Switch Virtual Interfaces is up which it is.

29
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So can router 1 ping router 3?

30
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Just do a test, ping 10.1.11.3 yes, it can.

31
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Can it ping router 2?

32
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
router 2 using this IP address 10.1.2.2 yes, it can.

33
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Can it ping router 4 acting as PC 2?

34
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
So that’s 2.4

35
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Let’s just do some troubleshooting

36
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
so first thing to confirm is, let’s check the interface

37
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:59.000
that interface looks right, let's ping 11.1

38
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
why is the ping not working?

39
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
it’s probably because I haven't set up a default gateway on router 4.

40
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Let’s confirm that sh ip route

41
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
there are no default gateways configured, so I'll turn off the IP routing.

42
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Before I configure the default gateway

43
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
let me show you a test that we can do to prove what’s happening.

44
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
So on router 1, I’m pinging router 4

45
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and this debug, debug ip icmp shows us that the traffic hits router 4

46
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
but it’s not getting back.

47
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
So we can see that the traffic traverses

48
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
the network gets here but doesn’t get back again

49
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and that allows me to see that

50
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
it’s because my default gateway is not configured.

51
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000
So IP default gateway 10.1.2.254 on router 4 because it’s in VLAN 2.

52
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
So once again.

53
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
This device is in VLAN 11.

54
00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.000
This device is in VLAN 11, these 2 devices are on VLAN 2.

55
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
So can router 1 ping router 4? Yes, it can.

56
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
So let’s have a look at the 802.1Q frames sent.

57
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Here’s router 1 pinging router 4

58
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and let’s look at the ICMP

59
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:26.000
what you’ll notice is the messages from 10.1.11.1 to 10.1.2.1

60
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
are actually being sent on VLAN 2

61
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and the return traffic is being sent on VLAN 2

62
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and that’s because the traffic is being sent from router 1 to switch 1

63
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
and switch 1 has already doing the Inter-VLAN routing

64
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000
and then forwarding the traffic to switch 2 on VLAN 2

65
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000
so it’s already changing the VLAN information to the VLAN 2

66
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
when forwarding it to the other switch.

67
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000
when the traffic goes from router 4 to router 1

68
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
the traffic it's sent here is an untagged frame

69
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
and then here it's tag as VLAN 2

70
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
when it hits the switch which is acting as the default gateway

71
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
it has the Inter-VLAN routing and then forwards it out of its port

72
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000
because it’s in VLAN 11 and the traffic is going to the device in VLAN 11.

73
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
So hence here we don’t actually see the tagged frames

74
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:34.000
but we can see that by adding a router on a stick to do the Inter-VLAN routing.

75
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
So what I’ll do is remove the Inter-VLAN routing on switch 1

76
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
and configure this device as the routing device in the topology

77
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:51.000
and then what we should see is we should see the tag frames hit this router

78
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and then the tagging will be changed.
