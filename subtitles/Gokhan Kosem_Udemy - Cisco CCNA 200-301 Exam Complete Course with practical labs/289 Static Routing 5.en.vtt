1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So router 1 can ping the loopback of router 3

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
but notice the ping was sent from 10.1.1.1 to router 3.

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
With ping you can specify the source interface of a ping

4
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
so I could say loopback 0 or specify the source IP address.

5
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So let’s specify loopback 0

6
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
in other words, pings are being sent from the loopback of router 1 to router 3

7
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
but the pings are failing because router 3 is receiving a ping

8
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
from an IP address of 1.1.1.1

9
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
sh run int loopback0

10
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
this router has this IP address configured on loopback0

11
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and we are telling the router to ping the loopback of router 3

12
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
using the IP address as configured on loopback 0.

13
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We can see that in the debug on router3

14
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
does router 3 have that route in its routing table?

15
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The answer is no, so debug ip packet do the ping again

16
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
what we can see is that it’s unroutable.

17
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Router 3 doesn’t know how to get back to 1.1.1.1

18
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
so we need to configure the loopback of router 1 on router 3

19
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and this is the problem

20
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
how many routes do you need to configure

21
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
on this routers to allow for full communication?

22
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
A lot of static routes need to be configured

23
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
to allow full connectivity between these routers.

24
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So sh run | include route on router 3

25
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
shows me that I have 1 static route configured.

26
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So I need to configure another static route 1.1.1.1

27
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and that’s available from router 3 points of view via 10.1.2.1

28
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
from router 3 points of view to get to this loopback

29
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
it needs to forward traffic via this IP address.

30
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:30.000
However, the ping is still failing, we can see a message on router 3

31
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
saying that it receives a message from 10.1.2.1

32
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
stating that this address is unreachable.

33
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
So in other words

34
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
router 1 is sending traffic from this loopback interface

35
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
to this loopback interface

36
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and it gets successfully to router 3.

37
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Router 3 tries to route it back to router 2

38
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
but router 2 is saying host unreachable.

39
00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
In other words, router 2 doesn’t have a route to 1.1.1.1

40
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
which as we can see in the routing table isn’t there.

41
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
So we have to configure a static route

42
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:16.000
on router 2 to the loopback of router 1 via 10.1.1.1

43
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
does the ping work now? Yes, it does.

44
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
so ping succeeds from the loopback of router 1

45
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
to the loopback of router 3 because router 2 now knows

46
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
about the loopback of router 3 as well as the loopback of router 1.

47
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Are we finished?

48
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.000
show ip route, so router 1 kind of looks right

49
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
let’s do a show run, show run | include route

50
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Router 1 has 3 static routes in the routing table.

51
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
1 for this network, 1 for this network and 1 for this network

52
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
so that looks good. Router 2 show ip route

53
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
router 2 only has a static route to the loopback of router 1

54
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and loopback of router 3 which is correct for the network shown in the diagram.

55
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
What about router 3? show ip route

56
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
it has a static route to the loopback of router 1

57
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
it has a static route to 10.1.1.0

58
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
but it doesn’t have a static route to the loopback of router 2

59
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
I'll just turn off debugging

60
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and then try and ping the loopback of router 2

61
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
what you’ll notice is the pings fail.

62
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
So what I need to do is configure a route

63
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000
to the loopback of router 2 via the next hop 10.1.2.1

64
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
so router 3 can now ping the loopback of router 2

65
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
it can ping the loopback of router 1 that’s good

66
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
router 1 can ping the loopback of router 2

67
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
and the loopback of router 3 I'll turn debugging off on router 2

68
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.000
it can ping the loopback of router 1 and the loopback of router 3.

69
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
now I did add some extra networks

70
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
show ip route on router 1

71
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:25.000
shows me that I added 10.1.10.0 as well as 1.1.1.2

72
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
so can router 2 ping 1.1.1.2 and the answer is no

73
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
in the routing table of router 2

74
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000
I only have a static route to 1.1.1.1

75
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:48.000
so I would need to add another route for 1.1.1.2

76
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:56.000
so I could type IP route 1.1.1.2/32 mask 10.1.1.1

77
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
and now I’ll be able to ping 1.1.1.2

78
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000
now do I have to use explicit mask as per

79
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:17.000
the subnets configured on interfaces and the answer is no.

80
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000
I could as an example remove this static route

81
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and change that to something like this

82
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:41.000
so in other words, I’m going to match 10.1.1.1.0

83
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000
and anything in that range is going to be forwarded to 10.1.2.1

84
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
so ping 1.1.1.1 that works and 1.1.1.2 also works

85
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
you need to be careful however doing that

86
00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
because this doesn’t just match those 2 networks

87
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
it matches anything in the range 1.1.1.0

88
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
but in this case based on our topology, I can do that

89
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
router 1 also has this additional network that I added

90
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:24.000
so I need to configure that network as well on router 2

91
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
as well as I'll just copy this to make it easier, as well as router 3

92
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:36.000
and you need to be careful doing copying and pasting like I’ve just done

93
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
because that should be 2.1 on this router.

94
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:49.000
So ping 10.1.10.1 ping works ping 10.1.10.1

95
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000
which is the loopback to IP address configured on router 1.

96
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
So here’s the problem, we configured a very small network

97
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.000
but we configured 3 static routes on router 1

98
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
we've configured 4 static routes on router 2

99
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:19.000
and we've configured 4 static routes on router 3

100
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
that’s 11 routes just to get this network working

101
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
it would have been told if I hadn’t use a summary route on router 3

102
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
that's a lot of work for very small network

103
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
and that’s 1 of the problems with static routes, it’s a lot of work

104
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
to configure this routes and you the person that has to configure them.

105
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Dynamic routing protocols allow routes to be automatically learned

106
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
and adjusted so the work is shifted from your shoulders to the routers.

107
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
The routing protocols do the heavy lifting

108
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
rather than you having to do all this manual configuration.
