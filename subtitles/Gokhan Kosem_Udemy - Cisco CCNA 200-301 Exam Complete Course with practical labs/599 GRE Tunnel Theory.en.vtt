In this video we're going to discuss generic rotting encapsulation tunneling or GRC tunneling in its

2
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:15.270
most basic form a GOP tunnel is a point to point tunnel that allows you to transport multiple Hialeah

3
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:23.250
protocols such as IP version 4 IP version 6 as well as older protocols such as IP X and others across

4
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.230
a point to point tunnel.

5
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.770
It's important to remember that GRC does not provide authentication and encryption.

6
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:38.090
It provides a point to point connection between two routers that emulates or looks like a point to point

7
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.580
tunnel or point to point serial link.

8
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:47.150
Another advantage of GOP is the support for multicast routing protocols in the past.

9
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:55.560
What was often done is that GOP tunnels were encapsulated inside IP SEC tunnels for encryption and authentication

10
00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.280
so GOP would provide a simple point to point link that emulates or looks like a serial link but because

11
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:09.210
it provides no encryption and no authentication that Jerry tunnel would then be put inside an IP SEC

12
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.540
tunnel to provide the encryption and authentication before going any further I want to point out that

13
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.630
you have access to some features of the VPN config generator as part of your course.

14
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.030
One of the VPN config generator options is to set up a GOP tunnel.

15
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:32.790
The software allows you very easily to create the configuration required for a point to point jury tunnel

16
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:41.150
so as an example by clicking on the show result button the configuration is automatically generated

17
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.650
for two routers.

18
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:50.340
He has wrought a too and he has wrought a 1 you could simply copy and paste that configuration into

19
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.950
your routers to setup a GOP tunnel.
