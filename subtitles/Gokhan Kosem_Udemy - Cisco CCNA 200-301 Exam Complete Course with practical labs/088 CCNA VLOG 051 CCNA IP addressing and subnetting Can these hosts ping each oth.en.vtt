00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.950
This is one of multiple videos discussing IP submitting.

2
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.410
I've received numerous questions with regards to my P submitting and I'm going to try and answer a lot

3
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.550
of them through these videos.

4
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.260
So here's a question for you.

5
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.810
Well p.s. one on the left.

6
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:33.860
Be able to ping P.S. 200 right in this typology P.S. on the left is configured with an IP address of

7
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.320
10 to 1 to 2 4 5 dot 1 slash is 17.

8
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.210
And the PC on the right is configured with an IP address of 10 to one.

9
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:51.950
Dr. 1:28 talk to slash 17 in the apology I'm using Cisco routers instead of Windows PCs.

10
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.320
As it's important for you to learn the Cisco CLID it's important for you to learn commands available

11
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.320
on Cisco devices.

12
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:08.290
So show IP interface brief shows me the IP address configured on the gigabit 00 interface of the router

13
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:19.790
show IP interface brief shows me the IP address configured on gigabit 00 of this router show run interface

14
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:29.180
gigabit 00 shows me the configuration of the IP address and we can see that over here as well and show

15
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:38.810
IP interface gigabit 00 shows us the configuration of router 2 and same on the side show IP interface

16
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:47.420
gigabit 00 that's the IP address of router one acting as one he has the IP address of rodder to acting

17
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.700
as PC too.

18
00:01:49.010 --> 00:02:00.600
So will these two routers acting as PCs be able to ping each other so paying $10 to wonder too far 5.1

19
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.560
right.

20
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:09.220
To is able to ping rodded one we can actually see that in real time by using a de-bug IP ICMP command

21
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.530
that de-bug allows us to see my sim traffic in real time.

22
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:23.520
I see the protocol used by ping in this example I'll send a single ping to rot of one ping succeeds

23
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:34.390
and we can see that echo reply was sent back to Rodda to with a source IP address of 10 1 2 4 5 1 destination

24
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.880
IP address of 10 to 1 1 2 8 2 2.

25
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.490
So how do we know that they were in the same subnet.

26
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:50.470
Show run interface gigabit 00 show run interface gigabit to 0 0.

27
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.780
You need to look at a network and host portions to.

28
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.830
Five means that the first octet is a network.

29
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.330
Two four five means that the second octet is a network here.

30
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.030
However we've got 128 in the network portion.

31
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.910
So it becomes a little bit more tricky to work out host and network portions.

32
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.800
So let's try that out.

33
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.960
Together 10 that one is fairly simple.

34
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.820
That's the network portion.

35
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:29.350
However 128 in binary equals 1 followed by seven binary zeros.

36
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.560
Just put a space here to make it easier to read.

37
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.040
Obviously that space doesn't exist.

38
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.330
But I'll just do that for clarity of reading.

39
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.690
So this is the IP address portion.

40
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:49.060
And this is the mosque a binary one in the mosque indicates that that portion is part of the network

41
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.250
zeroes in the mosque indicates that this is host portion.

42
00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:01.900
So in this example the network portion of the address equals ten not one in decimal.

43
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:12.360
And then the first binary but in the third octet if we look at the address here tendered one network

44
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.970
portion based on that that's the same as what we've got over here.

45
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:26.600
But in the third octet we've got 255 255 in binary is eight binary ones.

46
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.320
And again I'll put a space check just for clarity.

47
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.640
The mosque he calls 1:28.

48
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:44.990
So in this example the network portion is the first but which is the same as 128.

49
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:52.190
So if you look at the address here 10 dot one dot first binary boaties network and the same is true

50
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.760
here.

51
00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.110
10.0 one plus first binary but no third octet is network.

52
00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.480
The rest of the address is the host portion.

53
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:11.530
So I'll write it up fully 10 dot one dot 255 and one in binary equates to 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0.

54
00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:23.020
That's 10 dot seven binary zeros and one binary one that's 1 dot 8 PENDREY ones.

55
00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:34.430
Followed by seven hundred zeros and a binary one.

56
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:40.560
So that is the address in binary half tender 1 2 4 5 to 1.

57
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:46.680
And if we look at the mosque we've got 8 binary ones in the first octet.

58
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:55.330
So the first octet is network second octet is also network.

59
00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:05.280
But in the third octet we have one binary one followed by seven binary zeros.

60
00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.240
So this portion is the network portion.

61
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.000
This portion is the host portion

62
00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:18.960
so blue is host

63
00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.380
red is network portion.

64
00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:37.450
If we look at the other address used in the network which is tendered 1 128 to

65
00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:46.810
the host portion is different but the network portion is the same.

66
00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:53.020
So these two devices even though they have different hoost portions are still in the same subnet.

67
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.280
Based on that information there.

68
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.180
So they are in the same subnet

69
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.080
and hence the device on the right.

70
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:10.790
Can paying the device on the left Ping's succeed and we can see the debug output on the screen.

71
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:18.010
So I hope you found this video useful if he did please like it and please subscribe to my YouTube channel.

72
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.680
I wish you all the very best.
