00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Unshielded Twisted Pair or UTP is a set of 4 pairs of wires with each wire

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in a pair being twisted around the other to prevent electromagnetic interference.

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
As an example notice here, we have a twisted pair.

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
4 pairs make up the UTP used in Ethernet.

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Each wire has a color coded plastic insulation

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and the wires are inside and outer jacket.

7
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
In an Ethernet environment the wires connected to RJ-45 connector as shown here.

8
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The advantage of UTP or Untwisted Pair, is it's the less expenses and easier to install

9
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
than other cabling implementation such as shielded twisted pair or coaxial cable.

10
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:44.000
There are various categories of UTP which wie'll talk about in a moment.

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The maximum distance is a 100 meters without the use of the signal regeneration device

12
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
such as a hub or switch, so this is the type of cabling you'll probably encounter

13
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
many, many times in your networking career, UTP uses RJ-45 connectors.

14
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000
So let’s talk about the pin positions on an RJ-45 connector.

15
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
There are 2 main implementations which are T568A and T568B

16
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and there's a slight difference with the pairing of cablings in each implementation,

17
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
TIA/EIA-568 was develop to define standards for telecommunications cabling systems

18
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
EIA is the  Electronic Industries Alliance and is a standard base organization.

19
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.000
TIA/EIA-568C attempts to define structured cabling standard.

20
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
So the difference between A and B is the pairing of cabling.

21
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Notice in A white green stripe and green solid are connected to pins 1 and 2

22
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
whereas in B white orange stripe and solid orange are connected to 1 and 2.

23
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So there are several differences between the cabling

24
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
of orange and green in 568A and 568B.

25
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Now this will make no difference as both configurations

26
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
wire the pin straight through.

27
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
In other words pin 1 goes to pin 1 onn both sides of the cable

28
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
pin 2 goes to pin 2 and so forth and so on.

29
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.000
So notice on pin 1 its white green in 568A but it's white orange in 568B.

30
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The most popular implementation tends to be B, but it will make no difference

31
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
which one is use as long as both sides are connected straight through.

32
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Now you could purchase pre-made cables or you may decide to cramp your own cables.

33
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Pre-made cables tend to be more expensive but have the advantage that they’ve been

34
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
tested as well as the advantage that you don’t have to make them yourself.

35
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Cramping cables yourself is cheaper

36
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and you can make your cables for the length that you require.

37
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
When cramping your own cables you need to separate each individual colored wire

38
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
in the right order and then stick each colored wire

39
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
into the appropriate slot on the RJ-45 connector.

40
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
You then use the cramping tool to cramp the wire and finally don’t forget

41
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
to make sure that you test your cable to ensure that you've cramp it correctly.

42
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
The straight through cable is a type of twisted pair copper cable

43
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
which you're going to find very often in Local Area Network or LANs.

44
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
In a standard straight through cable each pin of the connector on one end

45
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
is connected to the corresponding pin on the other connector.

46
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
In other words pin 1 on the MDI device, in this case a PC

47
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
is connected to pin 1 on an MDIX device which in this case is a hub.

48
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Pin 2 connects to pin 2, pin 3 to pin 3 and so forth and so on.

49
00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.000
MDI or Media Independent Interface is an Ethernet port connections typically use

50
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
on Network Interface Card or NICs of PCs.

51
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.000
MDI is also use by routers and can be used on uplink ports on Ethernet switches.

52
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
On certain older switches you’ll see a button normally on the uplink port

53
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
that allows you to change how that port operates.

54
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
So you can change the mode from MDI to MDIX or back again.

55
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
This allows you to connect 1 switch to another switch using a straight through cable

56
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
rather than using a crossover cable which I'll mention in a moment.

57
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
So in the past, you may have connected your PC to a hub

58
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
such as this 2 using a straight through cable.

59
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Now straight through cables are used in situations where you connect

60
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
the PC to a switch or a PC to a bridge, or q PC to a hub.

61
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
I’m gonna explain how this devices work in a moment

62
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
and the differences between a hub, bridge and switch

63
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
but from a cabling point of view

64
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
you would use a straight through cable from your PC to one of this devices.

65
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
In the past when connecting devices of the same type

66
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000
such as 2 PCs or 2 routers, a crossover cable would be used.

67
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
So in this case rather than a pins being straight they crossed.

68
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
So in this example, we have 2 MDI devices in other words 2 PCs

69
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
which need to communicate and thus a crossover cable would be required.

70
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
This is an example for 10Base-T or 100Base-TX.

71
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:37.000
In this example pins 4, 5, 7 and 8 are not used but notice pin 1 is crossed with pin 3

72
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.000
pin 2 with pin 6, pin 3 with pin 1 and pin 6 with pin 2

73
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.000
in other words the TX or transmit and RX or receive are correctly cabled

74
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000
so that TX+ is connected to RX+ and so forth and so on.

75
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Pins 4, 5, 7 and 8 are configured in the straight through format

76
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
but are unused in this example.
