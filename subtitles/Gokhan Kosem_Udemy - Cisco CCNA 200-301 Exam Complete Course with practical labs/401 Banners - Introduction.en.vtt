00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:07.770
Bentos allow you to display text when a user connects to a Cisco router with a switch.

2
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:14.770
This is often used to display a message perhaps a message of the day indicating that maintenance will

3
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.180
be done on the network or more often these days.

4
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:25.840
It's used to display a illegal message setting that unauthorized access is not permitted.

5
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.210
If a hacker connects to your router or switch as an example and you don't display some kind of warning

6
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:38.830
message or some message to indicate that unauthorized access is not permitted it may be more difficult

7
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:45.060
to prosecute them as they would state that there was no indication that access is not allowed.

8
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.160
It's a very bad idea to have a message saying welcome to my router.

9
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.140
Welcome to my switch because that would indicate that someone is allowed to access that device.

10
00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:03.490
It's a good idea to get some input from your legal department to find out what message should be used

11
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.230
as a corporate policy in specific countries of the world.

12
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.600
You couldn't as an example say that if you access my rod I'm going to shoot you.

13
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.100
That wouldn't be legal.

14
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.090
As an example Benas can display all kinds of text.

15
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.700
Here's an example of a router and I've got configured.

16
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:30.290
So in this example on into my username and password and I'll be able to log into the router but notice

17
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.410
some kind of message is displayed stating that you shouldn't access the device unless authorized.

18
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.260
And here has some additional information is provided to the user if they want to access these labs.

19
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.300
No such message is displayed by default.

20
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:54.580
So as an example if telnet from one to rodded to I'm able to log in and all I'm prompted for is the

21
00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:01.810
user access verification which in this case is a password no Benas have been configured on this router

22
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:08.620
but in a global configuration mode you can use the command Bena and question mark to view various types

23
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:14.770
of banners that can be configured on a road or switch for the CCN a course we're going to concentrate

24
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:22.630
on the exec banner log in banner and message of the day Bena other messages such as in-coming can also

25
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.480
be configured but that's not important for CCMA.
