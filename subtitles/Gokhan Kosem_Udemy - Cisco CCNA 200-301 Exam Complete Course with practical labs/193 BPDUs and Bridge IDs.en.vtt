00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:03.350
Now how do you switches learn about each other.

2
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:11.290
As mentioned bridge protocol data units or BPT use are sent out of all ports on switches by default

3
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:17.170
every two seconds when running spending three switches will learn about each other when they receive

4
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.110
BPT use from other switches on their ports.

5
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:28.640
As an example in this typology switch one will know that there's a loop because it's receiving a PPD

6
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.770
from switch to on port 2 as well as Port three.

7
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:41.140
So BPT use from a switch with the same bridge ID are received on multiple ports and thus switch one

8
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.160
knows that there's a loop between itself and switch to in the same way switch to knows that there's

9
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:54.210
a loop because it receives BPT use from switch one on both port 1 and port 3.

10
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.940
In other words it's receiving BPT use from the same switch on multiple ports.

11
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.650
Hence they must be a loop.

12
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.000
Now PPD use contain lots of information and I'll demonstrate that in a moment.

13
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:16.880
One of the pieces of information that a BPT contains is the bridge ID of the sending switch a spending

14
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.920
tree bridge IDs an 8 byte value unique to the switch.

15
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.910
It consists once again of a two by two party field and a six binary system ID with a system id being

16
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.540
based on the burnt in MAC address of the switch.

17
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:39.950
So in other words the bridge I.D. consists of the property 6:57 6:08 by default in decimal or eight

18
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.060
thousand in hexadecimal and the MAC address of the switch.

19
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.480
That means that the bridge is going to be unique in spending three.

20
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.180
So BPT use contain information about spending tree switches.

21
00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:03.820
S. BPT use using a unique MAC address to a destination multicast address of because 0 1 ADC 2 0 0 0

22
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.320
0 0 0.

23
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:14.210
Or if using Poovey and spending 3 0 1 0 0 0 0 C C C C C C D.

24
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.950
There are three kinds of people who use a configuration BPU which is used by spending tree to provide

25
00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:28.270
information to switches a topology change PPD you to tell switches of a change and an acknowledgement

26
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:35.860
PPD which is used to confirm the receipt of a topology change notification are sent by default every

27
00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.150
two seconds once again.
