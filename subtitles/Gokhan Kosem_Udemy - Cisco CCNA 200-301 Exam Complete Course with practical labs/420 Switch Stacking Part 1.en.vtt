00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:07.350
In a topology like this we had to configure spanning tree H.S. IP link aggregation and other technologies

2
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.000
to try and optimize the way that this topology works.

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.960
As an example we made a switch one route for some of V lands and then we made a switch to the route

4
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.690
for other v lands.

5
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:29.010
So we managed to optimize a layer to forwarding by optimizing spanning tree but then to optimize the

6
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:36.780
routing in this topology we had to configure H.S. IP and then configure switch one of the eight U.S.

7
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:44.160
IP primary for the same villains as the as the router switch.

8
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:50.270
In other words if switch one is the spending tree router for VLAN 10 then we had to make it to the HSR

9
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.260
IP primary router for V Line 10.

10
00:00:53.310 --> 00:01:00.090
So in other words we had to optimize both spanning tree as well as a just IP to make sure that they

11
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.810
are aligned.

12
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.320
In other words if so which one is the spending tree root for VLAN 10 we don't want to make a switch

13
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.980
to the H.S. IP primary router for VLAN 10 we want to match them up to optimize the forwarding.

14
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.280
So there's a lot of additional work that you need to do here.

15
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.280
You need to configure spanning tree you need to configure HS IP you need to configure link aggregation

16
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.010
you've got to match it all up.

17
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.120
It's not very efficient.

18
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.040
Is there a better way of doing this.
