00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:07.850
So to reiterate a decimal value of zero equates to a hexadecimal value of zero decimal value of one

2
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:16.690
equates to a hexadecimal value of 1 2 is 2 3 is 3 and so forth and so on until you get to 9.

3
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:25.730
So 9 in decimal equates to 9 in hexadecimal a decimal value of 10 equates to a hexadecimal value of

4
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:36.390
a decimal 11 is hexadecimal B 12 13 14 is e 15.

5
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.160
F that's what you need to remember.

6
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.150
So doing a more complex example once again.

7
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.770
What about 2 to 4 in decimal.

8
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.200
That equates to 1 1 1 0 in binary.

9
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:58.880
If you're not sure use a Windows calculator to help you or refer back to my binary and decimal conversions

10
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.580
to work out these values.

11
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:08.920
So two to four in decimal equates to that in binary.

12
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:16.540
If we split it in half the secrets to zero in decimal or zero in hexadecimal and this equates to a zero

13
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.340
a to a four and an 8 in binary.

14
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:30.590
So eight plus four was 12 plus two's 14 plus 0 is 14 14 and hexadecimal equates to e in hexadecimal.

15
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.400
So this is the zero in hexadecimal.

16
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:41.730
So two to four in decimal equates to zero in hexadecimal Stewy another example.

17
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.690
What about 240 so 240.

18
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.280
Looks like this.

19
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.910
In binary these are Windows calculator.

20
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:59.300
So to 4 0 in decimal equates to a binary value of the following.

21
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:06.090
So break it into this equates to zero in decimal and zero in hexadecimal.

22
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.550
This equates to 15 in decimal or if in hexadecimal.

23
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.050
Convert that to hexadecimal and you get the value of f is 0.

24
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:23.980
So two to four equals zero in hexadecimal 240 equals zero in hexadecimal.

25
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:33.170
Getting back to our previous example of 255 255 equals eight binary ones split in two.

26
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:45.800
That gives you 15 in decimal or F F in hexadecimal so 255 255 255 255 gives you 8 hexadecimal F's.

27
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.430
So what about a IP address such as 10.

28
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.500
Doc wondered wondered one what is that in hexadecimal.

29
00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:01.910
So 10 in binary and let's fill in the leading zeros would look like this.

30
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.200
One would look like this.

31
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:13.070
And you would repeat that for the third and fourth octet so converting to hexadecimal.

32
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:19.660
Break these into 4 binary bits 0 is 0 in hexadecimal.

33
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.070
That is 10.

34
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.750
So it's an A.

35
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.170
This is a 0 and this is a 1.

36
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:32.950
So that's a fairly simple example of how to convert a value like this into the hexadecimal equivalent

37
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.020
valleys Let's take another example.

38
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.140
What about 3:58 don't one to two or three.

39
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:56.850
So to do for Looks like this in binary one looks like this too looks like this entry looks like this.

40
00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:10.030
So that equates to eight plus four plus two which is 14 14 in hexadecimal is e 0 in hexadecimal is a

41
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.610
zero.

42
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.720
This is fairly easy once again that's a 0 and a 1 in hexadecimal.

43
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:25.930
This is 0 2 in hexadecimal and this breaking it up into four binary bets is 0 3 in hexadecimal.

44
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:34.990
The trick to remember is that decimal values are 0 2 9 equivalent to hexadecimal values zero to nine

45
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:43.270
decimal values 10 to 15 or equivalent to hexadecimal values 8 to f.

46
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.360
The largest single hexadecimal value is an F and that's four binary ones.

47
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:59.090
So you need to convert any IP address number such as 240 into two portions of 4 binary bits and then

48
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.170
work out the hexadecimal for each for binary bit value.

49
00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:14.740
So this is F and this is a zero and you can see that using a calculator is 240 in decimal equals zero

50
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.580
in hexadecimal.

51
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.650
As we worked out.
