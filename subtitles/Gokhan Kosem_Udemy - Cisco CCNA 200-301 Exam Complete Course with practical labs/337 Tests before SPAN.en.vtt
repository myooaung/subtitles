00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.450
Yes the console of the 37 50 switch show.

2
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:13.440
MAC address table some MAC addresses are listed in the table

3
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:29.250
what I'll do now is ping from wrote a one to Robert to show IP interface brief Rado one has this IP

4
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:39.590
address and write it to has this IP address which we can see on the console of right a T so there's

5
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.050
the IP address of wrought a T

6
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.600
right one is once again able to ping Robert it too.

7
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:55.340
So when we look at the MAC address table off switch one previously we only had those three MAC addresses

8
00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:04.010
in the table but now notice we have this MAC address as well as this MAC address in the table I have

9
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:14.480
configured the MAC address of rudder one as follows some using a Cisco vendor code MAC address and to

10
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:21.320
make it simple I've specified the MAC address of write a one as follows on router 2 I've done something

11
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:31.420
similar so MAC address is the Cisco vendor code zeros and a two so at this point the first thirty seven

12
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:39.190
fifty switch has learnt about the MAC addresses of router one and wrote a 2 to keep things simple I

13
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:49.920
haven't configured any villains all devices on VLAN 1 Let's capture traffic in why shock on our P.C.

14
00:01:50.660 --> 00:02:01.270
so it's currently receiving some traffic but let's do a ping from router 1 to write it to once again

15
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:12.460
and I'll filter for ICMP traffic in the output here you can see that the PCI is not receiving any ICMP

16
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:21.410
traffic from router 1 2 write of 2 and in the same way if routed to pings write a one no ICMP traffic

17
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:33.000
is shown on the capturing P.C. but if out of one pings this window's P.C. which has an IP address of

18
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.100
ten dot wondered one to triple to

19
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:48.540
notice we see the ICMP packets so why shock is able to capture traffic from 10 1 1 1 going to 10 1 1

20
00:02:48.630 --> 00:03:01.750
2 2 2 so the piece is not able to capture unique cost traffic st from road a 1 2 Road 2 What about multicast

21
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:12.450
traffic in this example you can see that the ICMP traffic was received to the multicast address so wrought

22
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.700
a one with IP address tendered wandered wandered one is sending traffic to the multicast address 239

23
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.110
wandered wandered one

24
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:29.090
you can see as an example that the source MAC addresses rather one destination MAC address is 0 1 0

25
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.200
0 5 v which is the multicast MAC address in IP version four.

26
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:43.470
As you can see over there what about a broadcast of Ping tendered one that one the 255 and I'll just

27
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:52.690
repeat this once as you can see here broadcast traffic is being received by the P.C..

28
00:03:52.800 --> 00:04:00.410
So in other words unique cause traffic is sent from Rada 1 to the capturing device is forwarded out

29
00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.030
of this port and that's based on the Mac address

30
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:14.510
shown here as learnt by the 30 750 switch on this P.C.

31
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.610
on have changed

32
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.470
the MAC address in Windows

33
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.520
to use a bunch of zeros and a one.

34
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.650
So the MAC address is

35
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:46.420
eleven zeros followed by one and that was learnt by the switch on Fost Ethan at 1 0 5 as shown over

36
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:53.830
here so unique caused traffic gets forwarded to the P.C. multicast traffic gets forwarded to the P.C.

37
00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:01.920
and that's because multicast MAC addresses are not added to the MAC address table in the same way that

38
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:09.060
a unique cast of MAC addresses are broadcast traffic is also forwarded to the P.C. So to summarize

39
00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:20.570
I'll restart the Y shock capture unique concert traffic sent from Rhonda want to write it to is not

40
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:32.480
received by the capturing device multicast traffic is received broadcast traffic is received if we want

41
00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:38.090
to capture traffic from Rada want to write it to for troubleshooting as an example we would need to

42
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:46.120
enable span on this port or merging to use the other term so that traffic sent and received on this

43
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.940
port or this port or on VLAN 1.

44
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:55.750
In this example is forwarded out of this port so that the capturing device can see the traffic as another

45
00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:56.380
example.

46
00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:05.670
If we telnet from router one to write a 2 and log in the capturing device does not see the Telnet traffic

47
00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.560
so we can't see the session from rudder one to write it to.

48
00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.500
And that's because the switch is doing what it's supposed to do it's forwarding traffic from this interface

49
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.440
to this interface and not sending it out of unnecessary reports.

50
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:27.370
So now let's configure span so that the capturing device can see the unit cost traffic.
