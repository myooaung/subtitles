00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.420
Solutions have a number of tools that you'll find very useful.

2
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.520
The tool that I'm going to look at here is the key of SLOC server.

3
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:16.640
This is a light weight slug server for launch and network and more options.

4
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.590
You probably want to look at network performance monitor which I'll show you in a moment.

5
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.750
You can download a free trial of the QB says log server.

6
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.980
It has a lot of great features including centrally managed SSAS log and SMB traps.

7
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.110
You can receive real time alerts based on Sisler messages automatically respond to log messages store

8
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.170
and archive your logs.

9
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.600
Schedule the generation of this log reports via e-mail and monitor and manage your logs from a web console.

10
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:59.010
This is going to be a lot easier than trying to do it using the console of a Cisco router or even the

11
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.200
buffer of a Cisco router.

12
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.150
I'll put a link to the software below this video to learn how to use it looks over.

13
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.040
Download a free trial and then you can get it running with Jeana's 3 as an example.

14
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.040
In this example I have a Windows 7 PC that I'm going to install the QB so it looks over on under the

15
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:29.250
settings of the server I have configured the network adapter to use my local host only.

16
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:37.830
That's because I want to connect to G and his three ingenius three under Edit Preferences.

17
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:46.510
In this example I'm using VM way on the VM way of VM where it Vians all selected new and I'm going to

18
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:57.550
select the tools VM and click Edit and under network I'm going to allow gymnast's 3 to use any configured

19
00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.560
VM way adapter.

20
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.480
Click OK

21
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.130
under my devices.

22
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:15.460
Now I have this tools when seven PC which I'll add to the topology I'll connect to.

23
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:25.660
In the example to write a one on Fuster Ethan at one slash Zira to the Ethan at Port of that PC which

24
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.330
I'll now start up Jena's three automatically starts up the VM in VM workstation.

25
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.270
If you're using Virtual Box it would start it up in a virtual box.

26
00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.960
So my VM is booting up.

27
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.710
There it is.

28
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:51.690
I'm going to go to settings go to Options shared folders and I'm going to enable a shared folder to

29
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.160
my downloads directory on my local Windows machine.

30
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:04.340
If you don't want to watch the full process skip ahead to the next video to watch the actual integration

31
00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.020
between Cisco and QB log.

32
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:13.220
Or if you want to see the installation process continue watching the video.

33
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.200
Here's my genius 3 downloads directory.

34
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:26.760
I'm going to open up a QB so SLOC file in this case I'm going to copy the Curiosus looks over to my

35
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.910
desktop unzipped

36
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.880
and then I'm going to run the executable file.

37
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.170
Say yes to install the software.

38
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:50.370
You should read to the terms and conditions and if you want to continue click I agree you can install

39
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.430
it as a service or install it as an application.

40
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.620
Installing it as a service means you don't have to log into Windows to start the service.

41
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.240
It also allows you to manage the interface through a Gibbie.

42
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.990
So I'm going to go with that with a local system account.

43
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.810
You can install a web interface on going to enable that click next.

44
00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:20.180
And basically just follow the prompts to install the software on my Windows VM which is now connected

45
00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:24.970
to my Jeana's 3 environment.

46
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.330
In this case dot net is required.

47
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.170
So dot net is being installed

48
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:40.300
and my server installation can begin.

49
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.390
Now if I want to install the web server I need to install some perquisites.

50
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:52.020
I'm going to click Finish in this example just to get the installation completed so that I can demonstrate

51
00:04:52.650 --> 00:05:02.900
the capturing of slug messages from the Cisco Rodders to the kibbutzes looks of.

52
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.390
Here's the main installation.

53
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:12.950
And I'm just going to choose all the options including starting the local web server.

54
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.410
I'll set a very secure password of Cisco in this example.

55
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:25.040
And click Install now the installation would be a lot simpler if I didn't install all the options in

56
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:31.070
this example or want to install multiple options including a web interface so the installation process

57
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.200
is slightly longer.

58
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.680
In this case I have to reboot.

59
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.370
I'm going to reboot the server.
