00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.845
Hello everyone. Welcome back.

00:00:01.845 --> 00:00:03.420
So we discuss reboot,

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.345
upper bound, and then we discussed the boat.

00:00:06.345 --> 00:00:08.700
So what is a wildcard in upper-bound?

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.930
So wherever you introduce cushy amount that is called as the wildcard.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.550
And why do we need them?

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.810
Just in case if I don't know what is the type is going to come.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.730
I guess normally even in normal generic scenario,

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.070
we have no idea what kind of type is going to come.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.580
But still we use some thing called T,

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.575
which means it indicates some type.

00:00:28.575 --> 00:00:33.045
But here we're going to use the wildcard here.

00:00:33.045 --> 00:00:36.090
So let's try an example.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.950
So basically what I want to do is I want to create a method which

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.060
will take a list of some input and it will return the list,

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.600
I mean some of the list of data. So can we do that?

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:55.410
So at least frantic and avoid calculate sum.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.440
This is not a generic method because I'm going to use the inputs of a January here.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.075
So the way I do that,

00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:08.780
it's going to be a list of four.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:16.520
Now I'm going to pass that into here and here, hcl list.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.845
Okay, so now what I'm gonna do,

00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:24.590
I'm going to initiate something like int sum.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:35.580
And then I'm going to create a for loop here in region I and or integer.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.550
Okay, batch up.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:50.300
So now I can

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:57.110
say here all I can do is I'm just simply printing the data, not the data.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.320
It has to be outside.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.500
Some basic work.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.905
Some plus whatever the data is coming in current,

00:02:06.905 --> 00:02:08.430
just

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.450
you don't find

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.705
anything suspicious ear and it's very simple example, right?

00:02:20.705 --> 00:02:24.290
So let me run it. But before I need to pass some input,

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.360
so I want to pass some range of Inuit,

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.310
for example, 0 to a 100 so I can adequately,

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.140
they're list like list,

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.430
array list or task list.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.680
So what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna create,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.730
I'm going to use the in-stream to create a range of data, right?

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.530
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to use that in stream.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.305
In stream dot dilemma that I'm going to use range.

00:02:51.305 --> 00:02:53.825
So I'm going to take one to a 100.

00:02:53.825 --> 00:02:56.690
Then I'm going to box the data which will convert

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.340
the primitive wrapper upper two primitive boxed dot.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.740
And then, and I had to collect the data as

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.280
a list

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.315
L K.

00:03:17.315 --> 00:03:19.610
So all I need to do is calibrate

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.480
them called the Calvary method and pass the input less salt.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.220
So nil, let's run it.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.460
Okay, fine. So for 95 or there is a total outcome.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.300
So how are we going to introduce the wildcard here?

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:40.075
Let's take an example like I'm going to pass something like a double string.

00:03:40.075 --> 00:03:43.315
So again, I'm going to use the in-stream.

00:03:43.315 --> 00:03:49.600
Good arrangement. The one come on a 100 dot, double.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.490
Shame I'm converting the instrument is double-strand

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.920
because I want to receive as a list of a double.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.830
So dot boxed.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.870
And I'm going to collect the data using correct editorialist.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.545
Got it.

00:04:05.545 --> 00:04:06.790
So now what I'm gonna do,

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.475
I'm gonna pass them. Collect one.

00:04:10.475 --> 00:04:12.410
So which will throw an error because the culprit,

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.430
some matter which takes the list of integer.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.975
So if we want to fix the tissue normally what we do,

00:04:20.975 --> 00:04:25.130
we introduced the type here, right?

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.450
But the moment I didn't type here,

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.960
it will throw an error because it is not a generic method.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.130
So you have to provide the generic here.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.105
Right? So this is how we used to do.

00:04:38.105 --> 00:04:41.135
But now I'm not going to write as a generic method

00:04:41.135 --> 00:04:47.135
because I might not sure what is the type is going to come and even the pipe is coming,

00:04:47.135 --> 00:04:50.270
I have to bound,

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.845
which means that the upper bound,

00:04:51.845 --> 00:04:53.810
even the input, can be any time,

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.919
but they are, belongs to a number or it is subscribed.

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:01.565
So what I can do, so let me remove this.

00:05:01.565 --> 00:05:06.725
So here I'm going to use the wildcard, the question mark,

00:05:06.725 --> 00:05:11.765
which represents the wildcard and extense may end.

00:05:11.765 --> 00:05:13.505
I'm going to provide a number.

00:05:13.505 --> 00:05:15.815
So what is it mean here?

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:18.620
Because this wildcard x since number,

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.180
which means you can provide,

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.595
the wildcard minted can be replaceable by any type.

00:05:22.595 --> 00:05:26.150
But one thing is it has to be a numeric type because I'm extending number,

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:32.700
which means it can use number or its subclasses, which means like this.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:44.760
You can use this class and its subclasses.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.855
Ok, which means I can use number and I can either integer or anything.

00:05:50.855 --> 00:05:54.230
But here, when you, when you are iterating the loop,

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.510
it is still throwing it away or using interior

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.585
here because this isn't a base pay because i'm,

00:05:59.585 --> 00:06:01.160
I'm trying to use a number.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.225
Because if you pass integer,

00:06:05.225 --> 00:06:06.950
number can accept it.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.660
But here you do not accept it because it's in the integer here.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.420
So I need to use the base class type here.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.595
So if I'm using number here,

00:06:16.595 --> 00:06:18.455
even if you are an integer here,

00:06:18.455 --> 00:06:19.580
number will accept it.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.130
Even if you pass double number lugs of it.

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.415
Even if you pass along all so number, we'll accept it.

00:06:25.415 --> 00:06:29.960
But if you're passing along here and if you're trying to either longer,

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.260
it will throw an error saying like it cannot be taken.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.845
And then let's make a small change here.

00:06:36.845 --> 00:06:41.015
So I'll, I don't W0 value.

00:06:41.015 --> 00:06:42.695
So now what I'm gonna do,

00:06:42.695 --> 00:06:46.115
I'm gonna pass the collector as the input.

00:06:46.115 --> 00:06:49.610
And so we'll say what is the outcome?

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.265
Now, it will work for all kinda data,

00:06:52.265 --> 00:06:54.440
but only one restriction.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:07:00.185
It has to be a numeric type filter on it again.

00:07:00.185 --> 00:07:03.410
Again, we got 4950,

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.710
okay, so I want a long list.

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:12.575
So long list means a list of long.

00:07:12.575 --> 00:07:15.320
So I'm going to use a long stream dot.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.845
Again, I'm going to use arrangement that I want today.

00:07:18.845 --> 00:07:20.180
I wonder range of data,

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.560
which one to a 100.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:41.155
Okay, so now what I'm gonna do,

00:07:41.155 --> 00:07:43.420
I'm gonna pass collect to as the input,

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.450
which means it is a list of long.

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:48.530
I'm going to run it again.

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.689
You'll get the same output.

00:07:52.689 --> 00:07:54.850
Okay, So the one thing that you need a mind,

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:56.995
keep it in mind here.

00:07:56.995 --> 00:08:02.665
This particular wildcard extense a number.

00:08:02.665 --> 00:08:06.520
So which means whatever input is coming to replace the wildcard,

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:12.735
it has to be a number or its subclasses. Right?

00:08:12.735 --> 00:08:14.990
Here we're iterating the data.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:16.850
It has to be a base class type here,

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:18.230
you cannot use a subclass.

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:19.880
For example, if you're using subclass,

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.750
you're not happen if baseless coming to

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:28.850
the wildcard because R plus that handle that, right?

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:29.930
So when d is the base,

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:32.600
we heard any costs or whatever the extensor,

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.770
you can use the same type here,

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:35.480
which will work perfectly.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.250
So this is just a simple example.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.430
In the next example I'm going to give you even a little different example,

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:44.670
like we will have some custom dy du and we'll try to use it.
