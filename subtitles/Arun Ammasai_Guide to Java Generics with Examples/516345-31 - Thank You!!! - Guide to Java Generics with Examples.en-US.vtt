00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.180
Hello everyone. So if you're seeing this last video,

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.775
which means he completed the Java generics.

00:00:11.775 --> 00:00:14.580
Okay, so we might have seen a simple examples and

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.940
some kind of sometimes we are having some at different examples.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.820
Okay, So the only thing which you need to do to get

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.075
familiar with the Java Generics tried to do more exercise.

00:00:25.075 --> 00:00:28.865
Just first, start understanding about what is array.

00:00:28.865 --> 00:00:31.895
And if you know all idea about array,

00:00:31.895 --> 00:00:33.545
then move on to collections.

00:00:33.545 --> 00:00:37.474
So if you know collection and arrays as good as possible,

00:00:37.474 --> 00:00:40.700
which means you are ready to go for generates because there are

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.465
some floss in arrays and there are some flaws in collections.

00:00:44.465 --> 00:00:48.575
All of the flask has been addressed in the generics.

00:00:48.575 --> 00:00:52.775
So when you start learning genetics,

00:00:52.775 --> 00:00:57.590
make sure you have better understanding about the recent collection.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.910
Okay, so not only that,

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.550
even though after you completed this particular course,

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.385
the one thing you have to try,

00:01:03.385 --> 00:01:06.095
lot of examples that are a lot of real-time scenarios.

00:01:06.095 --> 00:01:08.810
Go to Google and search some problematic,

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.530
so problematic programming and try to find a solution for it.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:13.760
And if you have any doubts,

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.025
you can ask me a question at any point of time,

00:01:16.025 --> 00:01:17.465
I'll be ready to help you.

00:01:17.465 --> 00:01:23.180
So I'll try to respond back to your questions as soon as possible.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.310
So I'll be pretty much active in Udemy,

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.440
so you can send add questions here,

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.910
your questions at any point of time.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.615
And thanks very much for joining this course and happy learning.

00:01:32.615 --> 00:01:34.560
Thank you.
