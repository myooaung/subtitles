00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.145
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.145 --> 00:00:04.110
So we did a simple example, right?

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.295
So let's try the same example which you tried for the upper bound.

00:00:08.295 --> 00:00:14.800
So the one I'm talking about is the upper bound YOU CAN example.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.780
So here you have a list of family rate,

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.595
so we can try to use the same year.

00:00:19.595 --> 00:00:23.640
So let me copy this alone.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.170
So here let me comment out these two lines.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:38.660
Okay. So now I have a list of family here.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:39.920
So interrupt this method.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.510
Let's try to add something into it.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.600
We'll try to add the family members.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:51.660
So public, static, void.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.420
So the only difference between the previous example and this example, previous example,

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:13.400
it is a list of wildcard and extense some class,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.859
but here it is going to be super.

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:19.070
And for example, it's a father class here.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.010
And there's a list.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.070
So you know how to extract the data rate.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.100
So you can use for the for loop.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.470
So you can use either father or it is a base classes,

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:34.640
so you can use father.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.710
Oregon followed his father base class,

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.325
his grandfather and van for us, baseless family.

00:01:40.325 --> 00:01:42.810
So you're going his family as well.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:02:00.060
Okay. So what does require time gap to know super father?

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.620
But bro air this family,

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:04.970
there is a reason behind it.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.865
Because what is the father?

00:02:07.865 --> 00:02:16.340
The father is grandfather, not the family.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.820
So what will happen if we pass the grandfather here?

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.705
Okay.

00:02:23.705 --> 00:02:26.450
So still sharing and I will dating.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:33.090
Why is that? Because let me do this.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.370
And it is still showing an edit.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.045
Just incubators and otherwise keep on throwing an error.

00:02:41.045 --> 00:02:45.590
It's going to still give you the error.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.575
So that is a possible to do.

00:02:48.575 --> 00:02:51.185
Any kind of type is going to come here.

00:02:51.185 --> 00:02:55.280
So it'll always safer to use the base class.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.035
What is a base class for everything?

00:02:57.035 --> 00:02:58.715
It's object.

00:02:58.715 --> 00:03:00.665
So you can use object,

00:03:00.665 --> 00:03:02.555
which will resolve the issue.

00:03:02.555 --> 00:03:05.480
But anyway, this is not the ultimate goal for us.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.245
We're not trying to I did the data and see what is inside because

00:03:09.245 --> 00:03:13.430
we are trying to add something into it because we did not possible in the upper bound.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.125
Okay, so what I'm trying to do here,

00:03:15.125 --> 00:03:22.280
I have a list of family, right?

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.480
So what I can do,

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.040
first of all, let me give you some hints here.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.455
So how, what are the inputs you can pass to this method? Okay?

00:03:30.455 --> 00:03:39.320
So you can pass, pass father.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.430
And its superclass.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.085
Superclass is actually if you're,

00:03:49.085 --> 00:03:50.660
if you're accepting father here,

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.475
you can send grandfather's to this input and family as the input to this method.

00:03:55.475 --> 00:03:57.680
Okay, so let's verify that one.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:05.105
So first I'm going to call the Add Member and let me go let me pass the father's list.

00:04:05.105 --> 00:04:08.840
Okay, so when I'm passing the father is the list.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.310
That is no error. So let me try to pass sunless.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.695
The moment I added a destroying some exception

00:04:18.695 --> 00:04:21.920
because require type is super father and you're sending list ofs.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.715
And because what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to send the subclass here.

00:04:25.715 --> 00:04:30.935
When you're using super, make sure you're passing the class or the superclasses.

00:04:30.935 --> 00:04:33.979
So which means if you're always in Father,

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.190
you can use grandfather and family.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.380
Settlement tried to pass a family

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:46.670
here still a lot because it is a base class of other class.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.290
Right?

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.360
So let me pass filers for now.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.170
So you can pass the father and it is a superclasses.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.325
And then let me try to add something here, list dot add.

00:05:01.325 --> 00:05:07.560
So I'm going to add new son.

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.285
Oh, I remember to access.

00:05:11.285 --> 00:05:13.940
I'm able to add so let me try to add something.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.560
Some I have a father here, right?

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.730
So let me add some father here.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.835
It's still up. Okay, so I added a subclass.

00:05:25.835 --> 00:05:29.450
I added a class, right?

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.600
I added subclass which is the sun and the iron,

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.790
the class which is a father.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.950
So to try to add some base class into it.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.490
The bass clef, father, grandfather, right?

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:54.200
That is the problem. Here. You can add

00:05:54.200 --> 00:06:04.430
only the class and subclass while passing in a do pass only the glass and the base class.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.570
But when you're trying to add,

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.850
you have to add d glass.

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.415
And this glass means it's a father here.

00:06:10.415 --> 00:06:13.805
So you can add the father.

00:06:13.805 --> 00:06:16.250
I'd also you can add the subclasses like

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:21.180
sun grants and in case if you're using grandfather here.

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.100
Yeah, now it is possible to other grandfather.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.980
But initially I had grandfather here.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.360
I mean, just a father here.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.490
So when they're using Father,

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.400
you cannot add the base class.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.440
Okay, So can I add some?

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.820
Are going to add a grandson.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.460
Of course you can add because that is a subclass.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:50.060
So list dot add new grants,

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.280
and of course it is possible to add it.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.609
And here, line number 26,

00:06:55.609 --> 00:06:57.650
we got an error, right?

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:03.710
Because I'm trying to add the superclass.

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:09.830
Because you can only add or modify these subclasses, right?

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:15.180
So what will happen if I try to pass the family here?

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:19.400
When I tried to pass family here,

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.440
you can add any subclass,

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.330
which means even grandfathered, you can add,

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.370
you're going to have grandstanding can add everything.

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.550
Right?

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.670
So this is how this super will walk.

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.340
So what are the editor here and let's save it.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:44.300
Yeah. So make sure you're passing this superclass on the class.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:45.485
So what does a family here?

00:07:45.485 --> 00:07:47.705
So I'm going to pass the family,

00:07:47.705 --> 00:07:51.510
which will resolve our issue.

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.425
What is the issue here?

00:07:57.425 --> 00:07:58.430
Yep. Cool.

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:04.020
Okay. Just try and try with multiple culmination so you get familiar with that.
