00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.355
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.355 --> 00:00:06.315
The next important thing which you're going to talk about, upper-bounded wildcards.

00:00:06.315 --> 00:00:09.075
So we all know a good upper bound, right?

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:17.145
So for example, at type extense a number and type extent some classes.

00:00:17.145 --> 00:00:19.725
So that is what called as the upper bound.

00:00:19.725 --> 00:00:21.060
What is a wildcard?

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.710
Just take a scenario.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.815
I'm not sure what is it type I'm going to receive.

00:00:25.815 --> 00:00:28.410
So you have to grow, right?

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.470
Instead of our type you how to grow and the question mark

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.010
which represents the wild-caught in January's.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.330
So normally that question mark stands for the unknown type. For example.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.600
In previous example we tried T extends number,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.150
which means d always going to be number type.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.240
But now I don't know what is that type is going to come.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.635
So I make it as a wildcard.

00:00:54.635 --> 00:00:56.510
So wildcard minutes, you can prove it.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.590
Have question-mark.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.305
It can be anything.

00:01:00.305 --> 00:01:01.550
Right?

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.090
So and that may be times when you want to restrict

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.275
the kind of types that are allowed to be passed to a type parameter.

00:01:09.275 --> 00:01:13.655
And that is the main purpose of having the upper bound, right?

00:01:13.655 --> 00:01:17.870
So a method that operates on numbers might only want to accept the instance of numbers,

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.360
which means if you extense a number,

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.795
it will only accept subclasses out number like int, float, double long.

00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:30.020
And you can make use of wildcard with an upper bound.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.474
We already tried these examples before without the wildcard.

00:01:34.474 --> 00:01:39.245
Now we're going to use the wildcards to make this block.

00:01:39.245 --> 00:01:39.830
I'll pay.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.835
So I am going to show you

00:01:43.835 --> 00:01:49.520
that with a simple example to understand what is the upper bound wildcards,

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.520
see, upper bound means it's a extense.
