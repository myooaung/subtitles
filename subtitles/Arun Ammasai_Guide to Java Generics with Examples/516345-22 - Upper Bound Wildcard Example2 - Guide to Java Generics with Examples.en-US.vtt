00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.620
Hey everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:02.985
In the last example I'm,

00:00:02.985 --> 00:00:05.760
I just showed you a simple example how we can use

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.725
the wildcard against some time to do some, some operation, right?

00:00:10.725 --> 00:00:13.170
So here let's try some property example

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.660
like when you are dealing with the customers De Duo,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.125
so how it can be used.

00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:20.165
So what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna create a family tree.

00:00:20.165 --> 00:00:22.790
So this is how I want to dry.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.460
So I'm going to create a class family here.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.470
I'm not going to prove anything inside here it is.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.285
I'm just going to keep it empty.

00:00:29.285 --> 00:00:39.990
And then I'm going to create glass grandfather, grandfather extense family.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:52.020
And then plus further extends. Grandfather.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.730
That is the reason why I'm trying that you'll know it when I'm using it.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.800
Extense father.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.190
And here class.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:16.820
Then send extense son.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.020
Okay?

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.820
Okay, so now I have a list of classes here and each and every one of them,

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.005
X and MTV each other.

00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:30.080
So what I'm trying to do, the previous example,

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.790
we tried to calculate the sum, right?

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.920
And we use list of excellence number.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.200
And here I'm going to use something different now.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.555
So what I'm basically trying to do is I'm,

00:01:38.555 --> 00:01:41.330
I'm trying to create a family tree here.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:49.530
Let's create a method static wide and family tree.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.055
Okay, here is the difficult part.

00:01:55.055 --> 00:01:56.870
So what is the input here?

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:02.030
So list of and the quotient map,

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.855
because I don't know what is the type is going to come here.

00:02:05.855 --> 00:02:12.635
And but one thing I know that DI water is coming that is extending the grandfather class.

00:02:12.635 --> 00:02:15.060
So what is the mean?

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:25.270
Which means you can use grandfather and it is subclasses here, right?

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.670
And list until you do more if it is.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.495
Got it.

00:02:34.495 --> 00:02:37.569
So which means if the question mark extends the grandfather,

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.775
which means you can use the grandfather,

00:02:39.775 --> 00:02:46.150
end its subclasses, which means you can use everything here right now.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.100
Okay, So the next thing is,

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.215
so what I'm trying to filter the list.

00:02:50.215 --> 00:02:52.705
So what is the type I need to iterate?

00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:57.085
I need to either reducing the base class extended here,

00:02:57.085 --> 00:02:59.245
which means it's a grandfather.

00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:00.400
Right?

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.975
So let me try that.

00:03:01.975 --> 00:03:08.405
So I'm going to create a for loop here. Grandfather.

00:03:08.405 --> 00:03:14.790
Grandfather is equal to the list of type.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.800
And here it gets if you want to again,

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.420
provide some space out here in case you've just want to print something here.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.360
So I can simply say class is.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:37.925
So getClass

00:03:37.925 --> 00:03:40.160
dot name.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.620
That's, so now if you call this method,

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.760
we will not have any end in

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.180
a one go instead it a little because we don't have data for it.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.800
So the first thing, what do we need to do to create a list of family?

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.590
Right? So let me do that.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.075
So list of family here.

00:03:59.075 --> 00:04:00.380
Okay.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.579
Family.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.540
Yeah.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.280
Okay.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.960
So here the list of photos,

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:31.050
folder and Sen

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.460
and here it is going to be a grandson.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.765
Okay, so now I have a list of family here.

00:04:49.765 --> 00:04:54.235
I mean, just our family and grandfather and father and son and grandson.

00:04:54.235 --> 00:04:57.655
Okay. But each and every one of the mics running to each other.

00:04:57.655 --> 00:05:02.630
Okay. So I don't have any data here it for now what I'm gonna do,

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:13.070
I'll just simply add something here, like string, name.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.290
Okay.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.690
Just want to print something just in case.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.970
Okay, so here what I'm gonna do is I'm going to call

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:36.500
the family tree method's family tree with family list.

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:45.400
What will happen here? Because Cushing month extends Glenn for that.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.740
But I'm trying to pass. A family.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.250
Family does not extend to the family.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.680
So that is the reason that it's throwing an error.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.670
What will happen if you pass a grandfather list?

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:03.740
See there is no error because in case let me modify back to original.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.015
So now it is family here.

00:06:05.015 --> 00:06:06.410
So interrupt grandfather.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.480
If I use family here,

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.355
there will be no issues here.

00:06:10.355 --> 00:06:13.970
Because the data I'm passing to family tree,

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.430
which is extending your family.

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.130
Or it is a base class.

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.145
Either it is a base class or it is subclasses.

00:06:22.145 --> 00:06:22.910
Okay?

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:24.500
So that's the first thing we need to know.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.560
And the second thing, the moment I modified this,

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.900
I got to error and D, I'll trade at.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.460
So when you're using a trader,

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.930
what do you need to do is you have to make sure that you are using the base class here.

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.780
So whatever the class are,

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.235
type your x and a year,

00:06:40.235 --> 00:06:42.965
that has to be greater.

00:06:42.965 --> 00:06:44.615
So the reason why I'm doing that,

00:06:44.615 --> 00:06:46.700
if you are using the base class here,

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.070
it can, it can take grandfather,

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.590
father, son, grandson, everything.

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.320
Okay, so let me try something else.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.915
So let me use grandfather here.

00:06:56.915 --> 00:07:01.580
So eventually you'll get an issue here because I'm passing family which will not work.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.905
So I'm passing grandfather again.

00:07:03.905 --> 00:07:05.375
Right?

00:07:05.375 --> 00:07:10.400
And then what I'm trying to do is here,

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.270
instead of iterating, I need to identify grandfather.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:15.380
Got it.

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.400
And so so far so well,

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.695
because I'm passing a grandfather list,

00:07:18.695 --> 00:07:20.135
so it is working fine.

00:07:20.135 --> 00:07:24.755
So what will happen if I pass a list of further FAA?

00:07:24.755 --> 00:07:26.600
It will still work.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.030
And if you're trying to provide father here,

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:36.740
it will throw an error because father is a subclass of grandfather.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:40.475
So what do you need to do is whenever you're editing the data,

00:07:40.475 --> 00:07:41.870
it doesn't know what type.

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.880
So if you don't know what is the type,

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.190
you always have to use the base class,

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.010
which means whatever you're extending your Unity, use it.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.585
So if you use that,

00:07:50.585 --> 00:07:54.425
you can pass father list and you can pass unlist,

00:07:54.425 --> 00:07:56.945
it will not cause any issues even if you pass it.

00:07:56.945 --> 00:08:01.010
Grants and it will not pass any.

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:03.785
He because all of them are excellent in the grandfather.

00:08:03.785 --> 00:08:05.630
Okay. So now what I'm gonna do,

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:10.800
I'm gonna pass the father less surrogate, run it once.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:22.650
Okay, So grandfather, let me add something here like FAA dot.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:33.380
Let me create a folder here just to show some data in it.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:38.280
So I'm creating a simple object to add it in time before the list.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:54.755
I'm just adding name is John.

00:08:54.755 --> 00:08:57.420
And then F a dot.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.170
That's all.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:06.600
So let me run this.

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:12.605
So the glass is gone. Dead father.

00:09:12.605 --> 00:09:16.530
The same time you're going to try to blend as well.

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:24.845
Again, it will work.

00:09:24.845 --> 00:09:26.930
So when you're using wildcard,

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:29.615
just make sure, because we are talking about upper-bound.

00:09:29.615 --> 00:09:34.745
So operon means it will take the base class and it is subclasses.

00:09:34.745 --> 00:09:35.870
Right?

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:40.110
So just try with some example and let me know if you're not able to understand.
