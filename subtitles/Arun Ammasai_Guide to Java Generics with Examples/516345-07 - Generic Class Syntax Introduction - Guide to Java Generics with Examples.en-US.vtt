00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.085
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.085 --> 00:00:04.500
So now we understand what is a generic.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.340
Now let's talk about how a generic class that looks like.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.435
Okay, So it's pretty much like a normal class.

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:14.475
You're creating a class called class taste,

00:00:14.475 --> 00:00:16.830
and you're writing something in it and a generic class,

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.105
it's pretty much the same thing.

00:00:18.105 --> 00:00:22.440
All you need to do when you're creating a class name with the diamond operator,

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.140
you're going to provide some type parameter.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.600
So the type parameter is cold,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.545
or that type parameter makes the class as a generic class.

00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:33.990
And the parameter can be multiple types says,

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.420
well it's not like I can only pass through only one parametric and

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.385
music gamma and you're going to use multiple parameters.

00:00:39.385 --> 00:00:43.070
So that is why they are called asset management. Rise to classes.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.170
Normally class it doesn't have any parameter,

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.555
but if a generic class,

00:00:47.555 --> 00:00:51.845
it will have the parameterized classes.

00:00:51.845 --> 00:00:54.245
Okay, and now how does it looks like?

00:00:54.245 --> 00:00:59.900
So this is the simple generic class syntax with a single parameter.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.810
So it's generic classes gesture name.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.670
And within that diamond operator you have something like t,

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.545
which is a type parameter.

00:01:09.545 --> 00:01:11.360
It's not like you can employ only t there,

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.465
you can prove it, award over the data you want to or whatever the name you want.

00:01:14.465 --> 00:01:17.885
You can probably DR. You can probably on MS or not a problem at all.

00:01:17.885 --> 00:01:20.270
And the second thing,

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:28.220
simple January class with multiple parameters, t comma s.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.915
So you can do that.

00:01:29.915 --> 00:01:32.765
So the class can contain a single parameterized,

00:01:32.765 --> 00:01:36.050
and it can be how multiple

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.665
parameterized asset both of them called as a parameterized class.

00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:43.460
Or you can simply call them as they are generic class.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.990
So now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to create a normal class,

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.475
and I'm going to convert the same class into a generic class.

00:01:52.475 --> 00:01:53.840
And I'll tell you what is

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.910
the advantages of converting the normal class into a generic class?

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.290
So let's jump with an example.
