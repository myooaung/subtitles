00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.055
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.055 --> 00:00:06.840
So we discussed a lot about January, right?

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.180
But actually how it is working in the behind the screen.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.690
Okay, so we need to know about type a ratio concept.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.480
So this has nothing to do with the developer perspective

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.225
because it's all the responsibility of a compiler.

00:00:21.225 --> 00:00:24.180
For example, you're writing a generic class, okay?

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.115
The purpose of writing a generic class,

00:00:26.115 --> 00:00:29.655
it will tightly checking their types,

00:00:29.655 --> 00:00:33.840
which means why we came from collection to genetics or RAs from

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.030
January because it has the type safety and it has the type casting is not necessary here.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.860
So that is a two reasons.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.295
They came degenerate.

00:00:42.295 --> 00:00:45.485
But end of the day everything is going to be normal Java class.

00:00:45.485 --> 00:00:46.910
So basically what happened?

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.560
The compiler will apply a logic called type erasure.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.905
So what will happen when the type erasure is applying?

00:00:54.905 --> 00:00:58.940
So basically, whatever the generic class which you will return,

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.720
it will be converted into the actual class.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.045
Okay, the reason behind it to accept any kind of a type,

00:01:08.045 --> 00:01:11.165
and it is a generic way of programming.

00:01:11.165 --> 00:01:15.065
And most important thing is compiler will make sure that,

00:01:15.065 --> 00:01:18.500
that it'll be no additional or extra classes are created,

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.095
not only classes, some kind of a bridge methods.

00:01:21.095 --> 00:01:25.610
So that is a whole responsibility of a pilot process.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.320
I mean compiler responsibility.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.125
Okay, so to talk about that,

00:01:30.125 --> 00:01:34.700
I'm going to create a simple add a template or a skeleton for a class.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.295
And I'll tell you how it will be converted in the,

00:01:37.295 --> 00:01:40.500
behind the screens. Let's talk about that.
