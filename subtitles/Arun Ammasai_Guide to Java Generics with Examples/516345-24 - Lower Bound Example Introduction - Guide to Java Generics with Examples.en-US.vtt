00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.085
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.085 --> 00:00:06.360
So in this example we're going to talk about the lower bond.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.925
So if it is an upper bound, upper bound,

00:00:11.925 --> 00:00:21.165
so would we do normally the wildcard extents some class, right?

00:00:21.165 --> 00:00:23.920
But when it comes to lower bound,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.950
it is little different.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.245
So wildcard Super of glass.

00:00:33.245 --> 00:00:39.365
So which means you can use the glass and it is base classes.

00:00:39.365 --> 00:00:43.340
But when erasing extent you can use the class and subclass has there is a difference.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.560
So when you're using extends class and subclass,

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.395
when you're using superclass and the base class.

00:00:48.395 --> 00:00:50.870
Okay, So let me give you a simple example for that.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.410
So what I'm trying to do is I'm just trying to create a method

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.655
here which will again a display some value.

00:00:58.655 --> 00:01:02.615
Okay, so the way how I'm going to create a method here.

00:01:02.615 --> 00:01:08.705
So public, static,

00:01:08.705 --> 00:01:15.695
and it may have a method called display and which adsorbs I list of.

00:01:15.695 --> 00:01:19.295
I don't know what the type, so I'm going to provide the wildcard.

00:01:19.295 --> 00:01:24.304
And here I'm not going to use the extent because I'm going to use this super.

00:01:24.304 --> 00:01:26.510
And then what is the type we'll try?

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.700
Let's try number itself. So a number.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.150
So how we can,

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.440
how we can iterate the number.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.410
So in the previous example we tried when you're ideating the data,

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:50.130
you can use a class or it is base class, right?

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.250
But here it is pretty much the same thing.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.395
So what is the base class of number?

00:01:56.395 --> 00:02:00.055
Of course it has to be object because the object is a base class and everything.

00:02:00.055 --> 00:02:02.005
So I can use object, correct.

00:02:02.005 --> 00:02:05.180
So what I'm gonna do for

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.160
Object Align

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:19.510
list here.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.860
So object dot ALI,

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.875
and then I'm going to print out just simply the LI,

00:02:26.875 --> 00:02:34.560
or I can simply provide a num here number.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.135
Okay?

00:02:38.135 --> 00:02:39.770
So basically what I'm trying to do here,

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.420
I'm going to pass some inputs,

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.530
right, to display that.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.670
So what I'm gonna do,

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.855
Let's try create some list of integers as we always do.

00:02:50.855 --> 00:02:55.280
So int stream, dot arrange, closed.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.320
Or you can use range as well.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.255
Boxed, boxed.

00:03:05.255 --> 00:03:08.910
And I'm going to collect as a list.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.600
So display and I'm going to pass the collect here.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.240
So the moment you pass to the collect,

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.870
I mean the collection into a displacement that it is throw an error because

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.070
the error message saying like you are passing a list of integer,

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:39.605
but the required that the list of wildcard Super number,

00:03:39.605 --> 00:03:44.585
which means you can pass the class are the base class.

00:03:44.585 --> 00:03:48.155
So A's and I need to pass a number or any deposits or object.

00:03:48.155 --> 00:03:52.325
So what I'm gonna do, I'm just changing the Indian into object.

00:03:52.325 --> 00:03:54.725
So now the error is gone.

00:03:54.725 --> 00:03:58.115
Here. There is a difference because when you're using extensive,

00:03:58.115 --> 00:03:59.930
you can pass the class.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.150
And subclass is when you're using super,

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.350
you can use class,

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.860
you can pass class and it is base class is not the subclasses.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.440
So let me try to run this.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:18.870
See, we've got an enter print out till 12.

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:22.160
Since I'm using range,

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.740
it's taking up going at if I use range closed,

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.410
it will take everything said were rounded up from one to a 100.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.495
Now we've got a 100 as well.

00:04:32.495 --> 00:04:35.540
Okay, So I already got a list here,

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.790
so can I add something into it?

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.500
Of course it is possible here.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.015
So Ally taught, add,

00:04:44.015 --> 00:04:52.710
for example, double, and it is going to be 10.50.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.150
And I'm going to run it again.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.140
Say it still works because when we're using is super,

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.610
I'm able to update the data.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.115
I'm able to modify the data,

00:05:07.115 --> 00:05:08.210
but when I'm using extents,

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.220
I can only use them.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:16.250
We kinda of a read-only and when erasing slope or it isn't the right one LI Right.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.080
So there are some restriction in it.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.480
To show you the restrictions I had to show you

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.005
a different example like how we used to family and the grant and reds.

00:05:24.005 --> 00:05:29.940
So I'm going to show you that example to tell you what is the restriction in it here.
