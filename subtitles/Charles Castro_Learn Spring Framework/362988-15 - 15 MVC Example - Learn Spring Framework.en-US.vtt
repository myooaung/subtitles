00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.860
Hello there.

00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.250
And welcome back to this spring development course.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.320
So today we're gonna be going over spring M v c.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:08.790
Of course,

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:09.170
First of all,

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.130
we need to have a project with which we could actually run MPC.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:22.020
So you should have a very basic knowledge of how surveillance work and how Java enterprise

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:22.020
,

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:22.160
you know,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.140
double Web works in general.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.440
That said,

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.280
if you don't try to follow along,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.570
you may need to Google some things,

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.050
but I'll do my best to explain very basics of servers.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.850
I like you,

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:37.320
so Yeah.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:37.760
Anyway,

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.370
without further ado,

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.240
let's get it.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.550
So it's closed up everything we have here because we don't really need it anymore.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.040
And we're going to create a new Joe Projects.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.390
We're gonna create a new maven project.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.680
All right,

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.750
let's call this.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.060
Actually,

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.130
no,

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.680
we need to call anything right now.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.080
Just keep everything as is all right.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.810
Let's call the group I d.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.020
Web Web group,

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.520
and then artifact Web artifact.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.950
Okay.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.210
All right.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.720
There we go.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.650
Let's finish it up.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.250
And there we go.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.160
All right.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.890
So at this point are we have amazing project,

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.080
but our maven project isn't a Web project to change that.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.750
We to go to properties.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.280
Java build path.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.480
No,

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.810
I'm sorry.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.790
No Project facets convert to faceted form.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.040
All right.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.770
And then we're gonna go dynamic Web module,

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:31.550
and,

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.190
uh,

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.850
I got it,

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.550
all right.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.550
And so now it's gonna apply.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.470
Applying close,

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.880
and there goes you'll see,

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.510
Now we have a deployment descriptor,

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.090
And then we also have a Jax WS Web services.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.790
So all this mean,

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:47.270
essentially,

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.550
is that we is that we,

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.080
um,

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.360
have changed our project into web form.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.080
So now if we open up our laptop JOA,

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.850
we actually have a default code that it was written.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.920
I'm not really sure by whom.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.410
But anyway,

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:07.070
it was written,

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.490
and we can now run our project on server.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.550
So if you go to Web artifact,

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.000
right click,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.190
weaken,

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.220
do run as run on server.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.350
So this is where the knowledge of basic Java service would come in.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.400
Um,

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.280
we need to understand how a server works.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.740
Essentially,

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.290
what you need to do is download Tomcat,

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.500
which is a server folder.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.480
It's written in Java,

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.890
by the way.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:33.670
So yeah,

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.130
Donald Tomcat,

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.750
um,

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.200
and in that tomcat server will then serve as a server that you can then use so essentially

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.830
here.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:42.820
Right now,

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:43.950
I need to,

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:44.990
um,

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.640
choose my Tomcat insulation director.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.740
So that means that Idella to Tomcat is gonna be a zip file.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.070
Most likely unpack that zip file,

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.780
and then it's going to give you a folder with the Tomcat files.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.280
And so right here is where you're gonna find that folder inside your file system and

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.040
actually choose it.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.520
I'm not entirely sure where it is in my file system since there we go.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.280
We have Tomcat.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.420
Russian 9.0.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.080
Never got right here.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.740
You'll see a folder.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:11.680
Something like this.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.050
Okay.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.850
And so now we're actually No,

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:14.060
no,

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.870
it will be like this.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:15.360
Here we go.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.680
Yeah,

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.400
I saw that the amount of space was taking up.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.800
There's only 200 kilobytes.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.130
I'm supposed to be around 13 megabytes.

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.450
So yet,

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.360
anyway,

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.210
So this is the folder they're gonna get most likely.

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.970
So you're good.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.510
You're gonna go into open that up,

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.960
makes you have the right tomcat version.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.450
We're gonna be using 9.0,

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.180
and now we can finish.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:40.040
And now our server will actually run on Tomcat.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.490
CLC server startup in 752 milliseconds there because,

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.660
you know,

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.920
we have local host 80 80 Web artifact.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:47.730
But now,

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.360
when we go to this link,

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.110
it'll actually be our server.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.460
Now,

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.980
our server doesn't actually return anything here.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.240
So when we actually do this,

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.200
it doesn't.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.190
It doesn't tell us anything,

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.560
so Tomcat will return back this HTML here,

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.870
which sends it just means that you can't find what exactly we wanted to do.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:04.820
Alright,

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:05.700
let's stop our server.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.050
Um,

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.340
just click this button here.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.100
We can stop it.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.780
And,

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:10.080
you know,

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.960
there we go.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:12.700
All right.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.070
And so now we can go ahead and open up.

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.750
Our,

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.400
uh it should be somewhere.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.350
Here have been no web content.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.540
We've been made in meeting.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.930
It's impossible to find it.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:27.510
Actually,

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:28.320
I think we need to generate.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.700
Okay,

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.010
So now go to right.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.470
Click on it.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.940
There we go.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.110
Job E tools.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.990
And then right here,

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.930
generate deployment.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.180
Descriptor stub.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.200
Let's click on that.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.090
And there we go.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.900
So now in web in If we have our web dot xml file,

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:40.750
it's open natto.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.930
And so right now let's open up all the resources we need to make our project actually works

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.930
.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:51.560
We're gonna go open up web dot xml We're gonna open up palm dot xml If it'll open.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.750
There we go.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:53.530
All right.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.250
And essentially,

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.080
that's all we're gonna need.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.360
And then you're gonna make sure you want to find your under web content.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:04.130
You're gonna want to find your web dot XML file and then the web in folders.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.430
Well,

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.250
so make sure you have that open since we're gonna be at adding things into there.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.030
So there we go.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.650
So now we've got our project set up.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.890
Now,

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:17.790
let's go ahead and install the necessarily meant necessary maven dependencies in order to

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.290
use spring NBC.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.410
All right,

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.760
so it's going to our pom XML file.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:23.930
All right,

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:24.500
there we go.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.500
And so here,

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.050
let's go ahead and inside our dependencies.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.520
Let's copy in this So I actually have this property here.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.880
We also need some properties for this.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.250
Let's copy down as well,

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.760
and I'll go over exactly what?

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.950
What?

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.050
All this is in a second here.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.320
All right,

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.760
there we go.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:51.380
So here all that this is really is We have org's spring framework.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.070
The group and the artifact is spring Web,

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.660
NBC,

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.800
and for the spring down version were using 3.2 point 13.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.340
For now,

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.180
I believe spring forth,

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.530
out.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:01.180
Maybe it's not.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.870
Uh,

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.550
I think Spring five is out for security.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.950
Anyway.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.440
We're gonna use 3.2.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.550
It's the same exact thing for now.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:08.400
Later on,

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.250
perhaps we'll update it.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:14.770
But there really isn't all that much difference between three and and more.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:15.120
You know,

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.920
recent versions for what we're gonna be doing here.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.340
I mean,

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.160
if you're gonna be doing some pretty complex stuff,

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:21.390
Yeah,

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.960
it may be generous,

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.320
but three low level.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.710
It's very simple level,

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:25.400
you know,

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:25.860
difference.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:26.360
Okay.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.040
And then we also need this job.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:33.290
Backs dot service dot Js d l dependency as well that she's gonna That's we're gonna use to

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:34.830
actually run our server.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:35.560
All right,

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.720
so now that we have this,

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:43.920
we're gonna go ahead and go to our Java Resource is we're gonna create a new Actually,

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.360
we could use this app.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:45.770
Don job.

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:46.660
Let's open that as well.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:46.940
All right,

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.500
this when we use for our controller.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.560
All right?

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.500
And so here,

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.840
we're gonna use this hand little,

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.010
but she saved first.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.650
This had a little annotation called controller.

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.220
Okay.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.430
And we'll go over the exact the everything they were going to do here in more detail in the

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:02.770
next us,

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:04.340
and we're going to have a power point with it.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.720
You're gonna understand the theory behind everything is just a quick demo.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.450
So you can see what exactly we're gonna be working with.

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.890
So we're gonna import controller.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.450
So this just means that this is gonna be a troller,

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:15.360
um,

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.150
that we're gonna be using what seems to the problem.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:21.880
Give me a weirder started save.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:22.160
Yeah,

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:22.420
There we go.

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:23.650
That's just that that fixed it.

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:24.470
All right.

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:24.790
And then here,

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:26.650
we're gonna do at request mapping,

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.150
Okay,

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:30.470
request mapping,

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:33.020
and then the value is just gonna be slash.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.590
Hello?

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:35.060
Okay,

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.810
let's import that as well.

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:39.000
Okay.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.340
And now we can do is return.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:47.990
Hello dot James B.

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:49.810
Actually,

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:50.300
let's do.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.270
HTM Islands dead.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:51.840
Hello?

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.890
All right,

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:55.020
there we go on.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.560
This is gonna be a string,

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:01.190
and then this is gonna be Hello,

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:01.530
world.

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:02.150
There we go.

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:03.000
All right,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.060
So now that we got this,

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.100
if we're going to be one hour application now,

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.250
lets go and run it,

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:10.030
um,

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:10.620
on server?

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:11.020
Sure.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:11.470
Why not?

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:13.130
Um,

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:17.750
and it'll start it up it will start the eclipse given be given,

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.070
uh,

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:20.890
what is this?

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:23.970
Given browser and eclipse the built in browser and eclipse.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:24.460
There we go.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.510
And now we can do local host 80 80.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:26.660
Where?

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:26.820
Board,

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:27.140
in fact,

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.010
we can do Hello.

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:30.250
Since we have requests mapping flash.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:30.660
Hello.

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:31.030
Right.

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:33.770
But it doesn't actually give us anything.

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:34.060
Well,

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:35.260
that because we haven't,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:39.350
that's because we haven't configured it to do so to go toe.

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:39.740
Hello.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:42.860
It doesn't know that this is actually a request mapping thing.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:46.210
So if we were actually going to be doing spring boot,

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:47.700
this would be all that we need to do.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:51.240
But since we aren't doing to bring boot reading to do more,

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:55.150
that's just an example of how spring boot makes things less complicated.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:59.450
This is all going to do it to create a basic application if we were using spring boot.

00:08:59.450 --> 00:08:59.890
All right,

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:01.030
so now,

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:01.690
without further ado,

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:05.480
let's add in some more configurations that this controller would actually work.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.660
All right,

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.040
let's go to our Web XML file.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:08.450
All right?

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:10.050
Okay.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.350
Let's go and delete this welcome file list.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:13.820
Let's give a display name.

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:14.230
Let's call it,

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:14.700
um,

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:15.020
yeah,

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:16.280
let's keep it with Web artifact.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.100
And now we're gonna do you gonna do serve lit,

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.950
mapping,

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:21.360
All right.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.440
And in service mapping.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:29.450
What we're gonna do is we're gonna do serve lint name.

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.990
Okay.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:32.840
It's gonna be ah,

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.240
spring NBC.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:35.840
Okay,

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:36.950
Um,

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:38.650
what seems to be a problem?

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:43.720
Okay,

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.240
let's say we'll see if they're doing okay.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:49.820
Let's go to actually write out or servility and then focus on the air.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:50.610
Um,

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:51.280
here,

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.220
we're gonna have Ah,

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:52.670
you are?

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:52.910
Oh,

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:54.310
whips.

00:09:54.310 --> 00:10:00.680
You are ill pattern is gonna be just slash.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.750
All right.

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:03.410
Okay.

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:04.080
There we go.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.150
And still seeing there.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:12.650
That's odd.

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:14.310
Uh,

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:15.850
seems to be that everything is there.

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:17.520
Okay,

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.220
let's actually create our service as well.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:19.880
So right now,

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.540
if we save it other ago,

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:23.220
that's from.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.870
So since we're gonna have served your a pattern,

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:27.810
it was sensing that it was not.

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:30.100
The serverless mapping tag was not complete.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.090
And so that was giving the air.

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:35.280
And that must be saved it so that we had the servant mapping there and so end result.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.650
It understood that we had everything I expected.

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:39.670
All right.

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:41.940
And so now let's go ahead and create our surveillance.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.550
So if we if we run our server now.

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:45.850
Well,

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:46.190
actually,

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:51.500
get is an error Since is that you're gonna be looking for a spring NBC servant you'll see

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:51.880
here.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.350
So a child continue failed during start.

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:54.960
So essentially,

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.130
the problem is that it can't find this spring NBC serval it.

00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:59.110
That's what we're looking for.

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:00.030
So sort of mapping,

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:03.440
essentially just maps a u r l to a certain servant.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:08.100
So we're saying that we're mapping the slash who are ill to spring NBC in this case,

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.950
and I give us a problem,

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:11.560
since we can't.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.430
Actually,

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:13.340
we don't serve it.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:14.100
That's name.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:14.740
Just bring NBC.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:15.600
So to do that,

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.920
what we're gonna do is we're gonna have,

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:17.310
um,

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:19.380
use a satellite tag.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.820
All right,

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:21.670
And then inside here,

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:24.650
we're gonna have serve lit name.

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:25.650
All right.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:26.020
Uh,

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:26.710
spring,

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:27.360
NBC.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.150
All right,

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:32.580
then we're gonna have servant.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:35.240
Whoops.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:35.550
Nope.

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:50.390
Serval it class as or go Spring Framework Web.

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:53.080
Serve it.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.890
And I think it's from a capital letter.

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:57.480
Young dispatcher.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.180
Servant.

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.850
There we go.

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:01.840
Okay,

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:02.050
Now,

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:02.950
let's save this,

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:05.840
and we're still getting an air for some reason,

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.110
okay?

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:07.150
And then we also need,

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:09.110
um,

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:12.310
load on,

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:15.450
start up.

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:17.580
And they was gonna put one.

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:18.190
All right,

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:18.750
There we go.

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:20.790
And let's indexes,

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:21.530
Let's save it.

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:23.750
And we're getting air for some reason.

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:25.660
Ah,

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:29.890
Dad is on.

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:39.610
Oh,

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:40.250
there we go.

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:43.900
I had sir Levet serve.

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:44.280
Let.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:44.870
There we go.

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.400
That explains a lot.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.050
Okay,

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:49.320
I was sitting there digging What?

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:49.990
What in the world?

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:50.330
Whatever.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:50.950
Is that all right?

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:51.380
There we go.

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:51.960
All right,

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.660
Now that now that we got that out of the way,

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:54.020
let's go.

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:59.990
And it's actually run this and you see what's that?

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.730
We still get an error.

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:05.190
So class not found so it can actually find this dispatcher servant class.

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:07.590
So why can't it find that dispatcher servant class?

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:08.140
Well,

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.450
that's because way haven't yet created.

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:15.550
All right,

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:19.340
So what we're gonna do is inside our web INF.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.250
We're gonna do new,

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:22.130
uh,

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:23.050
XML file.

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:24.350
There we go.

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:30.490
And gonna call it Spring NBC,

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:35.350
Servite dot xml There we go.

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:36.120
And let's finish,

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:36.650
and there we go.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:37.430
All right,

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:38.320
So now here at the top,

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.160
we're gonna need,

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:39.750
um,

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:44.910
some We need some dependencies.

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:45.770
All right,

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:50.970
so these are not really dependency so much that they are just sort of tag libraries for XML

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:50.970
.

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:53.670
So we're just going to do is copy in this right here.

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:58.970
So I hope I will be able to get this somewhere on the left or on the right.

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:04.900
But if I'm not able to search for online and you search for a basic tutorial on embassy

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:05.220
online,

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.250
and I'm sure gonna find it,

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:07.750
so it's it's pretty standard stuff.

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:08.600
All right,

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.350
so it's gonna close off beans as well.

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:11.730
There we go.

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:12.500
All right,

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.050
So what,

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:15.420
we're gonna type in between beans?

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:15.920
Well,

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.010
first of all,

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:21.900
we need to actually tell our spring application where it needs to look for things like

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.400
controllers and request mapping,

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.350
then so on and so on.

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:36.350
So first of all we're gonna be doing is typing up context component skim.

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:39.110
And so here's like that.

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:40.330
All right,

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:40.960
there we go.

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:41.460
And then here,

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:50.050
we're gonna have base base package equals.

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:52.100
And this is gonna be,

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:52.640
um,

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.350
Web group dot Web.

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:57.950
Our effect.

00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:59.130
All right,

00:14:59.130 --> 00:14:59.850
there we go.

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:00.720
All right,

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.950
let's close itself.

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:03.550
Let's close this.

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:03.850
Well,

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:04.780
all right.

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:05.380
And then also,

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:06.270
we're gonna have,

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:06.820
um,

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:08.000
context.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.350
What context?

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:13.450
Annotation?

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:14.790
Conflict.

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:17.590
So what we're doing here What clothes?

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:19.140
So we're doing a couple things here.

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:20.690
First of all when you're doing components.

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:26.190
Can were just telling it that it needs to look for components like controllers and so on

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:28.590
and so on here in this base package.

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:29.160
So Web group,

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.980
that web artifact that was gonna find this app dot java is going to see Oh,

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:33.350
look,

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:34.450
here's a controller.

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:36.580
So I need to send everything was slash.

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:37.070
Hello?

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:37.530
Here,

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:38.550
for example.

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:39.700
All right.

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:40.570
And then here,

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:43.680
while we're also going to do and then contact annotation conflict,

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:48.930
it just means that we're gonna use do the configuration using annotations and not something

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:49.270
else.

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:49.830
Alright,

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:50.450
Pretty simple.

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:51.650
All right,

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:52.760
so we can now actually try to run.

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.030
This is going to run it.

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:54.850
Uh,

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:56.070
Tom cat.

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:58.170
And as you'll see,

00:15:58.170 --> 00:15:59.240
we actually get an air.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.390
So the same error we get,

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:02.050
um,

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:04.930
dispatcher service so it can find our dispatcher shovel.

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:07.510
So if we actually go to palm No,

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:07.810
I'm sorry.

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:08.620
Web XML.

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:10.300
You actually see we have this to special.

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:10.580
Certainly.

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:10.770
Here,

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:11.620
and it can't find it.

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:12.550
Why can't I find it?

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:12.690
Well,

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:14.340
it's actually in the spring framework,

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:15.250
um,

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:18.430
package worth in the spring framework module.

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:19.440
And right now,

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.290
the dependency,

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:20.940
the spring framework,

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:23.430
dependency is actually getting uploaded to our server,

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:24.700
and so it can't find it.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:25.570
So how do we change that?

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:25.930
Well,

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:26.950
first of all,

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:30.470
let's go into project properties.

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:31.380
All right,

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:31.530
Now,

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:33.000
let's go to deployment assembly.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:33.550
All right?

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:37.640
They were gonna do add Java build path entries,

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.830
and then may have independency.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:44.870
So all this will do is they just give us our actual maven dependencies until the Tomcat

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:50.280
that we want the maven dependency files toe also be run when we actually run our server.

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:53.580
So it's finish plain clothes.

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.070
All right,

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:56.910
And now let's run our application.

00:16:56.910 --> 00:17:03.970
All right?

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:05.660
And so now when it runs,

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:08.470
we should see starting service engines right here.

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:10.190
We should All right.

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:11.000
And there we go anyway.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:11.660
Um,

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:15.300
so we actually it started.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:18.930
So you'll see here server startup in 3762 milliseconds.

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:19.940
So it works now.

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.200
It still giving us not found,

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.940
since we don't actually have any mapping to nothing.

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:25.510
But we do have mapping to Hello,

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:25.840
right.

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:26.470
Remember,

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:27.750
in our apthe java,

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:31.800
we have mapping to hello and I believe I put html cure.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.380
It's whether it save the HTML.

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:35.450
That's that's odd.

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:37.800
I have never seen that happen before anyway?

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:38.620
Nevertheless,

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:39.080
it happened.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.530
And so now we can do slash.

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:41.520
Hello?

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:41.970
Okay,

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:42.080
well,

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:42.380
now,

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:43.250
okay,

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:44.140
so it happen now was,

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:44.480
actually,

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.870
it just reloaded the context.

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:46.500
So,

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.110
uh,

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:50.450
I change this to hdr html since it deleted it for some reason.

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:53.280
And now that I changed it,

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.390
it actually,

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:55.150
um,

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:58.110
since I changed it,

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:00.340
it reloaded the server Sort off.

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:00.960
Anyway,

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.840
just think of it as it was there and don't paid into the reloading on the server.

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.870
So now if we press enter,

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:08.270
there we go.

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:11.660
So we actually get in a circular view path hello dot html.

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:12.210
So essentially,

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:12.650
we just meet.

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:16.360
This just means that it would dispatch back to Hello.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:19.160
So if we change now,

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.070
it essentially when we do Hello.

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:24.500
Html it would then go back to hello.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:25.970
And so it would go back to this,

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:29.910
serval it to serve that mapping and so dispatch about back hello.

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:31.310
And it would be a vicious cycle.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:32.780
So that's why is giving us an air.

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:33.410
So let's try.

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:34.310
Hello,

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:35.850
world dot html.

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:40.760
It isn't gonna work either way since we don't actually have a little of the HTML created

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:41.120
yet,

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.530
So let's Either way,

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:45.720
let's still do it just to make sure it works.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.950
And they're going to create a whole oral that HTML file.

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:50.140
All right,

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:50.600
there we go.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.560
And hello.

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.250
And there we go.

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:58.430
So the origin server do not find a current representation for the target resource or is not

00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:59.760
willing to disclose that one of this,

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.370
this just means that there isn't.

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:01.550
Ah,

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:02.060
hello,

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:04.190
World die html file created yet,

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:05.350
So let's do that right now.

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:07.600
So we're gonna go to our deployments,

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:11.270
some deployment of resources web in and Okay,

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.890
that's great.

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:12.620
Determinate failed.

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:13.440
Um,

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.000
and now create new html file,

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.620
and we're gonna call it,

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:19.550
um,

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:25.010
low world dot HTM.

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:25.180
Oh,

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:25.900
All right,

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:26.280
there we go.

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.040
And inside here,

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:27.570
we just do.

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:31.550
Um ah h one.

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:33.530
Hello,

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:34.330
world.

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:34.810
There we go.

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:35.530
All right.

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:36.580
And in our app,

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:37.830
we should have Hello,

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:38.580
World html.

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:38.940
Alright.

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:40.550
Everything seems to be working correctly.

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:43.000
So now let's rerun the server.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.190
Just it actually really works.

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:48.260
And then that will be the end of the lesson.

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:57.150
And you can actually see here in the log where has mapped your l path slash Hello onto

00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:57.970
handler app.

00:19:57.970 --> 00:19:59.230
So right here.

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:01.500
Adapt it maps it to handler.

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:02.650
And so that,

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:03.310
essentially,

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:06.940
is what it's what you would you want to see.

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:07.450
Okay.

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:09.950
And then we also have,

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:10.320
um,

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.320
framework.

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:11.590
Serve.

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:14.010
Let's spring M V C in its initialization.

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:16.920
Completed in 1217 milliseconds.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:22.490
That's the initialization off the serval it that we specified here.

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:23.190
No,

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:23.580
I'm sorry.

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:24.550
Here.

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:26.070
There we go.

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.760
Yeah.

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.490
All right.

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:28.710
So now,

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:29.130
at this point,

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:31.410
we can actually run our application.

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:32.710
Nothing's stopping us from doing it.

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:34.920
We can actually enter our your link,

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:35.140
Ramos.

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:35.720
Did you try that?

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:36.790
It's going to go to chrome.

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:37.700
All right.

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:38.950
And let's go to a local host.

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:39.710
80 80.

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:40.290
Um,

00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:40.670
no.

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:41.400
90,000.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:46.090
We're gonna go to a 80 slash web artifact slash.

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:46.470
Hello?

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.950
All right.

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:51.590
And we actually can't find the html file.

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:52.660
Why is that happening?

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:53.020
Well,

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:53.620
actually,

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:54.190
go to spring.

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:54.900
So the problem,

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:55.460
of course,

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:56.590
is a couple of things.

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:57.180
First of all,

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:59.760
when we have this,

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:00.210
um,

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:04.250
hello world here dot html when we were turned this string.

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:08.950
What it returns is the name of an HTML file that it looks for,

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:11.530
and this deployed resource is Okay,

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:13.740
so,

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:14.440
in theory,

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.980
um,

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:17.340
if we put it into deployed resources.

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:17.880
It'll find it,

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.370
but it's not in deployed researches in it.

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:21.490
We can't put it into the deployed researches folder,

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:23.910
and we have to put it into the web in folder.

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:25.660
So we do Web,

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.590
web,

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:32.910
web in slash.

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:33.160
Hello,

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:33.430
world.

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:33.780
Hmm.

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:34.260
All right,

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:35.130
there we go.

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:36.760
But well,

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.970
we will actually be met with a different problem.

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:41.300
So I'm only going to restart the server,

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:42.670
um,

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:43.760
to run it.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:48.260
And any day now there we go.

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:48.510
All right,

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:49.590
So restarted a server.

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:49.920
Wait.

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:50.100
No,

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:50.910
it didn't started yet.

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:51.680
There we go.

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.930
Restarted a server and now Google Chrome.

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:56.630
We still get an air,

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:58.290
so it it still can't find it.

00:21:58.290 --> 00:21:58.740
Well,

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:02.190
that's because we're actually using HTML and not jsp.

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:07.660
C spring sort of out of the box is supposed to only work with Js be it sort of.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:08.880
It's Well,

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:09.070
I mean,

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:10.620
isn't it honest early spring so much?

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:12.430
It is Tomcat.

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:13.960
It's made to work with jsp.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:21.260
So if we change our hello world html file to let's delete this actually,

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:21.360
no,

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.670
We could just create a new one right here.

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:23.990
So we're gonna do new,

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.820
um,

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:27.160
jsp file and we're going to do?

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.970
Hello,

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:32.660
world world dot Jsp All right,

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:34.100
so we have this Hello,

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:35.210
roller jsp file.

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:37.880
We get this error since it can't find HDP service,

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:38.810
but don't worry about it,

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:40.450
and it'll still work.

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:43.420
And so here we can now do H one.

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:45.540
And now we can do Hello,

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:46.240
world here.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:46.960
All right,

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.720
And now in our abduct Joel,

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.130
let's change this to Jay.

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:50.460
Speak.

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:51.250
All right,

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:55.240
So we'll be looking for this file when we go to this request mapping.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:55.660
Okay,

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:58.770
so let's go ahead and actually run this now.

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:03.190
And now if we do in fact enter the euro into the browser,

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:04.480
it should give us hello,

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:04.780
world.

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:05.980
So let's make that this works.

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:08.640
And there we go.

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:09.940
So you can see we get back.

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:10.130
Hello,

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:11.580
World overexaggerate to this.

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:14.300
Don't pay attention to this that I just think that are loaded.

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:16.230
I e since I was working with angular,

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:17.000
So don't worry about it.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.170
You will just get this.

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:18.400
Hello,

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:18.710
world.

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:19.050
That's it.

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:20.010
All right.

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:21.780
So we have this Hello world here.

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:23.670
So what if we wanted to do it?

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:24.780
Not with jsp,

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:26.240
but with html.

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:26.780
Well,

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:34.460
we would actually have to add There we go we would actually have to add our mapping into

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:36.620
our web dot xml.

00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:38.400
So what mapping will that be?

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.830
But Snoopy will be serving,

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:41.180
mapping,

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:43.480
mapping.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:44.160
All right,

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:48.210
then it will be a serve lit name,

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:50.280
serve,

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:51.450
licked name.

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:53.370
And certainly name will be,

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:54.760
um jsp.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:55.220
All right,

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.020
then.

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:58.590
Serve it.

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:00.660
I'm sorry.

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:11.160
Euro pattern will be just be all right.

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:11.930
And then,

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:12.070
well,

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:13.510
it's gonna have another euro pattern,

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:17.340
which will be HTM.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:17.520
Oh,

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:17.840
all right.

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:18.950
I think that is correct.

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:19.990
Ah,

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:21.260
pressure.

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:24.710
Or I actually think you actually need dots or their ago.

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:25.370
All right,

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:25.970
so there we go.

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:26.680
I I got enough.

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:30.490
So now when we do have HTML or JSP finals,

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:34.010
it'll automatically map and map them into the jsp servility.

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:37.230
And then our Tomcat server will actually know what to do with him.

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:41.690
So we can now in our app dot Java change how the world to html.

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:49.960
And now we can run this a damn.

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.740
There we go.

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:52.400
Server startup.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.660
Now let's go to boo chrome reload!

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:56.530
And there we go.

00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:57.310
It works as well.

00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:59.550
So it also works when we do it through html.

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:00.440
All right.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:04.790
This has been a very basic spring M V C tutorial.

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:08.970
You can see how it's starting to get harder and harder as we go on.

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:16.140
So there is ah lot a ton off configuration for us to do simply to create obey,

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:18.050
a very basic server that just returns Hello,

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:19.740
world when we go to a certain link.

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:25.490
So that is actually why Spring boot itself has become sort of an industry standard and why

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:26.500
everybody uses it.

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:28.960
It's because this it requires spring.

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:33.450
NBC without boot requires a ton of configuration to do very simple stuff.

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:34.050
So,

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:34.240
yeah,

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:37.440
you can imagine how much configuration requires to do very complex stuff.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:37.910
So,

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:38.050
yeah,

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:39.210
Anyway,

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:40.250
without further ado,

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:43.100
your homework is just simply to get this running on your machine.

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:47.340
I don't think you're gonna be able to get this ring their machine because there were most.

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:51.880
There will most certainly be some kind of error that you won't know what to do with what I

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:52.590
would recommend.

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:53.750
If you are getting those areas,

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:54.730
they're just crazy.

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:57.650
You don't know what to do with them and their ruining your life.

00:25:57.650 --> 00:25:59.090
Go to some website,

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:00.130
download some project.

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:05.940
Perhaps I'll even put this project up so you can download it directly from you to me or

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:06.400
some other.

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.650
Put a link somewhere where you can download this project itself,

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:10.060
but yeah,

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:10.560
so anyway,

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:12.740
on and then you run that project.

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:14.760
So that way you get the code running on your machine.

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:15.930
Next time,

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:19.630
we're gonna go over into all of go over all of this in more detail.

00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:20.080
And really,

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:24.640
we're gonna be going over pretty much everything in this where we went over today for quite

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:25.390
a bit of this course.

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:29.790
So it's mostly gonna be just dissecting what we went over today and what we did today.

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:30.260
So yeah,

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:31.230
you know,

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:32.110
without further ado,

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:36.820
I truly wish you luck here with creating this on your machine,

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:40.930
because and I don't think anywhere luck had as much to do with it.

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:43.640
Because if you get lucky and it runs without any errors,

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:44.990
just magically,

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:45.890
um,

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:48.010
then you really legitimately go lucky.

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:48.190
So,

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:48.430
yeah,

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:50.160
I wish you the best and,

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:50.450
uh,

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:51.710
without for their do,

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:52.650
I'll see next time
