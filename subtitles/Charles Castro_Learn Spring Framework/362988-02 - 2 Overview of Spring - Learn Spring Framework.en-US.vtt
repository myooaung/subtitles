00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.640
Hello there.

00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.900
And welcome to this spring development course.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:08.980
So today we're gonna be going over exactly what spring is where it fits into the whole idea

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.810
of Enterprise Java development.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.310
And you know what,

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.600
exactly?

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.660
We're gonna be going over in this course,

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.270
or at least in the next couple of lessons,

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:16.740
at least.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.340
So for starters,

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.680
with has to go to the spring to start to spring that I Oh,

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:22.010
yes,

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.330
bring that I owe There we go.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.990
And,

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.230
Ah,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.040
this is the official site for spring.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.620
So this is the official website where,

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:29.040
you know,

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.660
all spring news and everything is,

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.250
um,

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:32.930
posted.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.400
So we can actually now go to projects and you'll see there are quite a bit of projects in

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.900
spring.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:38.850
Um,

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.520
a lot of them are very useful,

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.420
and a lot of them are very important as well.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.970
I I really wouldn't say that spring as anything that isn't useful,

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:48.820
since it is.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.290
It is a pretty good framework,

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.740
and,

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.940
uh,

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.790
is a pretty good bundle of technologies on the whole,

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.230
but yeah.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.580
So today we're gonna be going over spring framework.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.140
So there's the spring framework.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.160
This is the sort of meat and potatoes of spring,

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.980
I would say,

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:06.640
Um,

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.320
it's really what is most often used in every single spring applications.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.120
If you're if you're creating a spring application,

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.910
this is most likely what you're going to be using.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.250
Everything else sort of is a plug and play,

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.610
sort of.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.510
So another important thing that we're going to just talk a little bit about this spring

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.870
boots.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.750
So spring boot is actually a little bit of a different story altogether,

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.410
but it actually builds upon what we do in this course together.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:38.500
So spring boot is sort of everything after whatever we learn together.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.420
So it sort of it simplifies what we what will be learning in this course.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.150
So it's gonna go to spring framework in general,

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.390
so there's a quick introduction.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.750
You can read it if you want.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:48.480
Um,

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.910
and the important thing here is feature,

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.050
so we're going to really focus on dependency injection and spring NBC as well.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.400
So spring and Mrs M.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.540
V.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.940
C.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.560
Is actually dance for Spring model view controller.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:09.470
So Spring Model View controller is an idea of separating an application into three parts.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.130
The model,

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.240
which is the data access the view which is the front end.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.820
So what the person sees And then the controller was short of intermingled the two,

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:20.680
so it connects them,

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.120
sort of.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.110
So we're gonna be going over into exactly what m v c means and how it works later on.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.720
But we're going to start with dependency injection.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.870
What?

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.850
That is so what a bean is and so wanted so on.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.130
So yeah,

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.040
So this is just have been,

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.430
ah,

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.780
quick overview of the spring framework and what we're gonna be learning in this course just

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:40.440
a quick Noah's.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.940
Well,

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.070
the prerequisites for this course are,

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.050
ah,

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:50.450
just knowledge of Java and core java as well as you do need some basic knowledge of serval

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.180
it's and java,

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.690
you know,

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:52.570
Web development,

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:53.000
sort of.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.250
Ah,

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.180
if you don't know Web development and that Yes,

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.010
I guess you could sort of pick it up as we go along.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:06.420
But you definitely need to know Java development if if you are going to be sort of

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.210
following along in this course,

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.380
what's also nice to have would be made and knowledge since we are going to be using maven

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.790
in this course,

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.560
I know that we could just use jars just,

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.700
you know,

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.710
manually add them.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.830
But I'd say in 95% of the project they're gonna be working on in.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:23.860
Ah,

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.250
in professional development,

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.220
there is going to be made in.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.490
So in 95% of projects,

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:29.440
there is going to be maven.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.240
And in the 5% that there aren't,

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.000
you're going to be wishing that there are that there is maven.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.780
Uh,

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:41.780
since after you have a couple 100 jars and you got a couple dozen problems with the jars,

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.490
you're definitely gonna be thinking.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:44.890
I wish I had using maven,

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:45.660
So Yeah.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.420
Okay.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.900
So anyway,

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:47.550
uh,

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.650
this has been just a quick overview of spring and the course and,

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:53.080
uh,

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.950
I'll see you next time will soon.
