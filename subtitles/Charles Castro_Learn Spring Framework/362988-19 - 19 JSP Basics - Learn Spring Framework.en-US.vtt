00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.650
Hello there.

00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.340
And welcome back to this spring development,

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:02.920
Of course.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:08.820
So last time we went over the model and you had to form to do your job was to create a

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.880
controller which would pass a string into a view.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.580
And then that view would then display these strings.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.420
So here's then who it should have done.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.010
So you have a model in view.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.010
Um,

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.230
And then I just sent you name to view,

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.280
and then I had an object.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.260
My string with the value.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.370
This is my string.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.950
Then I return model in view.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.460
So will return this right here,

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.950
then here in view.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.040
I just have a paragraph tag with value of my street.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.910
So now when we run this,

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.670
what's Nope.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.270
Uh,

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.250
when we run this,

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.350
when it will start up,

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.380
we should Damn.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.790
There we go.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.970
So we start up in 5000 milliseconds.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:55.390
Now,

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.150
let's go to chrome.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.640
All right,

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.170
so here we are,

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.700
and we can now refresh the page.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.360
Local host 80 80 Web artifact.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.670
Hello.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:02.030
Or actually,

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.550
I was gonna be get message.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.220
What's Nope.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.350
Um let me take a look.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.480
What every I put here.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.700
Oh,

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.920
what?

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.740
Get Messa.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.270
Okay,

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.600
Well,

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.150
you know,

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.350
you never know when you when you white need what?

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.580
There we go get messed up.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.080
And how will we get this?

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.560
Is my string as expected.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.870
Okay,

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.230
so in our controller here,

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:28.490
what we do is we put in This is my string with the key that my string.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.050
And then here we get the my string key using my string.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.610
So,

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.450
um,

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.200
using the jsp dollar sign curly brackets.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.480
So you have personal stuff I think we should have done if you got that.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.940
That's very good.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:42.270
If not,

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.010
don't worry about it.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.170
Essentially,

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.730
just understand what this does it.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:46.670
There's nothing too difficult.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:47.840
Here is not rocket science.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.480
So she's understand that,

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.250
um,

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.120
if we have,

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.850
we have my string as a key.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.380
This my string is the value.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.350
And then we get the value using the key here in the view.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.650
Pretty simple stuff.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.580
I know.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.680
I keep repeating it that you know,

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.900
there's a kid in the value,

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.400
but,

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.550
you know,

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:05.240
it's important to note,

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.280
and that's pretty much that we need to note so and so without further ado,

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.610
then,

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.150
um,

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.570
let's get in.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:11.840
All right.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.380
So they were gonna be going over the very basics of jsp and how that works.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.860
Because the next time we're gonna be going over some more advanced.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.610
Um,

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.660
jsp,

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.760
uh,

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.000
I guess tutorials or concepts yet so in a way,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.420
your speed.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.860
Pretty simple.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.200
So just be essentially something that combines Jonah code with,

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.470
um uh,

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.800
you know,

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.630
html code.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.180
So here we have this jsp father we've created,

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.410
and we've already work with them a little bit.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.300
Essentially,

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.580
Jace be essentially just html with job so we can actually execute Java commands directly

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.160
using the script lit tags.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.310
So here we can do system dot out dot print.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.760
Ellen.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.820
Actually,

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.890
no.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.910
What we need to do is we need to do just out dark print.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.280
Tell him outdoor print,

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.530
Ellen,

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.000
and it's anywhere you can put a Hello world.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.670
Hello,

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.000
world.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.470
Okay,

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.330
okay.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.980
And so now when we run our server,

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:04.610
let's save it.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:05.500
Will it refresh?

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.170
I wonder if it will refresh.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.420
Um,

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.470
because in theory,

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.550
it should refresh the server to accommodate our changes in jsp.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.010
But it seems like it's not refreshing.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.410
Still is going to stop the server.

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.620
And we started there we go.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:25.650
It's launching it right here.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.150
and starting up every goats during the server.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.040
Okay.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.290
Loading XML being definitions Server startup.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.520
OK,

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.890
there we go.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.960
So now if you go to Google Chrome,

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.850
we can now refresh this page.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.560
Okay,

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.860
there we go.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.520
So we bring how the world here what this does essentially,

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.230
is it outputs hello world to our browser.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.170
So essentially this rights here gets then compiled into this HTML code.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.290
Here's what's gonna be like,

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.840
pee,

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.440
and then you can actually be a paragraph.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.930
It's more gonna be on long lines of just inside the HTML code.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.250
Is there to me hello world right?

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.200
Resemble just inside html.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.370
So we don't actually have to have text inside a p tag or an age tag or anything like that.

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.790
If we just put a text into an html file,

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.700
the browser will read it and then display according essentially,

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.150
what out does now?

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.300
We can also add a system dot out.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.440
Let's see what that does.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.550
So if we do system not out and restart our server,

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.050
I don't know what's not refreshing automatically.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.160
ITT's quite weird.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.000
It should do automatically.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.080
I mean,

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.360
we're not using spring boot in spring boot.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.930
You don't know what their server doesn't refresh automatically in regular springing should

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.930
.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:36.870
But it's where there doesn't.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:37.190
Okay,

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.580
there we go.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.250
All right,

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.960
now we've got,

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.280
um that's running.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.560
Now,

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.450
we can now refresh our our page here,

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.880
and you see,

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.790
now that we don't actually get anything in our browser So before when we just did outdoor

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:56.020
parental and we actually got hello world in our browser since it actually compiled into tax

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.250
that are browner than displayed.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.220
But if we just do if we do system,

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.680
not outdoor parental in it,

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:10.040
interest in it instead outputs it into our consul here so you can constantly print hello,

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.250
world.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.950
So that's actually how that work.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.960
You can also add in for loops,

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:14.470
for example.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.600
Four and I Whoops.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.250
End int I equals zero eyes less than 10.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.050
10 I plus plus.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.290
All right,

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.900
there we go.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.400
I just did a big practice program project,

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.610
so I put some python syntax in there,

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:36.350
uh,

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:37.030
accidentally.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.450
Yeah.

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.890
Anyway,

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.900
way have this four loop,

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:40.120
right,

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.260
and we actually do out dark parental into the browser.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.140
So now we Let's just the output I instead of doing hello.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.340
Well,

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.450
just to have some kind of,

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:50.700
um,

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.100
variance.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.120
Are they really don't know what?

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.460
Nope.

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.740
Nope.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:55.530
We're gonna get an error.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.100
We're gonna get it.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.320
We forgot to stop our server.

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.390
This what happens when you forget to stop your server before you started again?

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.810
There we go.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:02.160
All right.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.560
So now when we started,

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.970
it should start starting.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:07.280
Certainly.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.580
Engine loading XML be definitions.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:11.050
And there we go.

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:12.670
There was sort of complete.

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.010
And now if we refresh,

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:16.270
you'll see.

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.770
We get 0123456789 Okay,

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.680
so we can also add in html code insider Java code.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.760
So,

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:25.210
for example,

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:26.130
here we have this four loop,

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:26.450
right?

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.540
We can What if you wanted to break every single time we output this.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:30.330
So instead of having,

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:30.840
you know,

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.490
0123456789 What?

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:34.480
He wanted to have zero.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.480
And then on the X line one on the next.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.510
Find two on the next line.

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:38.090
Three and so on.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.490
It's on.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:39.220
Well,

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.680
we do that using the break statement.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:40.950
Right?

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:44.490
But how could we answer the break statement into Java coat?

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:44.860
Well,

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.250
all we do is just weak.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:52.320
And the Java code right And in between the end of the Java code,

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.400
the rest of Java code,

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.750
we just put a br here.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.750
Here we go.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:01.650
All right.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.750
And now let's restart our server.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:09.700
There's a lot of server restarting when you're developing applications.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.770
All right,

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:13.310
Any day now.

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.820
There we go.

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:16.170
All right,

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:17.300
So now when we run this,

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.390
we get all the numbers.

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:21.480
But this time we add a break.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.010
So what?

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:22.750
It only happens here.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:23.090
Well,

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:29.080
what we do essentially is here when we have four and I equals zero.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.870
I sometimes type responses Java code.

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:35.440
So our JSP library or JSP itself,

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.520
will actually take a look at this.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.940
It will read this and will understand.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:38.150
Oh,

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.360
look,

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.270
this is Java code.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:40.820
I'm gonna add This is Java code.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:47.130
But then we ended the Java code using this last this up percent and then the right arrow

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:47.430
here?

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:47.850
Yes,

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:48.100
there,

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.140
Right after that.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.310
It understands.

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:51.450
Oh,

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:51.640
look,

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:52.650
we've ended that Java code.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:53.830
This is now HTML code,

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:55.490
and then we start up that Java code again.

00:07:55.490 --> 00:08:01.410
So now understands that what we mean to do here is we mean to have a loop that I will put

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:02.260
some java code.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:03.740
And then in between that Java code,

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.420
we're gonna put some HTML code essentially.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:10.010
And so that is then compiled to to,

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:20.000
um to This is right here.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.120
I'm gonna write this out.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.010
Just they really get the idea of what,

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:26.290
exactly?

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:27.390
So I'm going on here,

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:29.850
Uh,

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:31.950
because I care about your,

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:32.150
uh,

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:33.150
learning.

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:34.610
Okay,

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:35.080
there we go.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:39.100
So this right here is actually compiled to this right here.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:45.750
So what that means is that Java read it right and understand that here we have this Java

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:48.850
code and HTML code and this right here,

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:49.780
uh,

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:50.980
more job code,

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.820
and it combines those java coats to form four statement.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.850
And then in between those four statements it puts,

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:56.420
you know,

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.960
this right here br tech and one result it compiles is down to this.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.150
Um,

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:04.910
that said compilation is actually pretty simple.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:07.270
So we have programming languages that compile easily.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:07.500
Right?

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:07.890
So we have,

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:08.160
you know,

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.270
Java python C plus plus,

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:12.270
uh,

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:12.660
you see,

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.110
I'm not entirely sure with C.

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:14.540
I don't know.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:14.780
See,

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:15.050
but,

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:15.780
you know,

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.650
there's a ton of compiled programming languages.

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:18.380
Ruby.

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.710
Pretty much all programming languages today are compiled,

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:22.490
but of young pressure.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:22.730
See,

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:23.550
his company anyway.

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:28.010
But so compilation is nothing new,

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:28.320
you know,

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.120
we've been doing it for decades,

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.680
so there's no reason why we can't compile,

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:32.970
you know,

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:34.630
Java code that is,

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:35.990
you know,

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:40.970
interpolated with HTML code into just regular HTML code.

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:41.850
And so,

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:42.570
in doing so,

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:47.300
it it creates very sort of dynamic html code and results.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:47.520
So,

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.030
for example,

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:50.380
we can output out.

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.690
We can do outdoor parental.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:55.850
We could output every number from 0 to 9 by using a for loop and not by,

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:56.200
you know,

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.770
manually printing them out.

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:00.170
We can probably use JavaScript for this by then.

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:04.600
JavaScript is like executed on the front end.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:09.750
So it's executed in the browser while JSP is executed on the server.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:10.800
And so as such,

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:11.110
we can,

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:11.330
you know,

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:15.570
do some more secure things with it that we can't do with the Browner.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:16.080
So if one,

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:16.570
for example,

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:17.470
tracks the database,

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:22.640
we can't do it in JavaScript just because it's attacks here in the browser.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:26.780
And so I mean on the client's brothers barrels or there is no database,

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:27.440
a database backup,

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:27.990
the server.

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:30.000
So we would have to use job attract for the database.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:30.850
Um,

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:31.850
so you get the idea.

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:32.880
All right.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.310
So that essentially the basics of J speech,

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:35.650
this right here is actually called a scripless.

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:40.420
So this what is between this left arrow?

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:41.640
Percent and percent,

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:41.910
right?

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:42.310
Arrow?

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:43.850
This is called a script lit.

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:45.000
It's essentially just,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.090
um a Java script.

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:47.560
That is No,

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:48.310
not JavaScript.

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:54.300
Is that Java language script that is inside html code or in this case,

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:54.900
J speak.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.990
Okay,

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.070
So next we're gonna be going over this in a little more detail,

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:01.990
we're gonna be understanding exactly what this right here does.

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:05.410
We're gonna be understanding taking a look at the sea library,

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:07.500
and you look at some very cool things we can do.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:07.860
Like,

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:08.690
for example,

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:09.850
that we can,

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:10.400
um,

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:15.850
using the C library we can actually generate over lists and data structures.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:17.340
Enjoy speed on what?

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:18.520
One last thing I'm gonna show you,

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.250
we can output.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:21.250
Um,

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:27.340
your your I P address is Plus,

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:30.580
I know it's gonna be plus,

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:31.390
uh,

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:32.400
request.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.250
Don't get remote.

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:36.290
And there we go.

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:37.830
So request actually built an element.

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:43.070
NJ species is essentially the object that is the off type request class.

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:43.190
So,

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:47.300
essentially the request that we've sent on and then we get the remote address.

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:48.810
This is just gonna display my piece was going,

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:49.350
actually.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:50.230
Um,

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:50.890
restart this.

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:52.630
I can trust you guys.

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:53.280
You're not gonna happen.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:53.670
You're right.

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:54.510
No,

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:55.850
of course there's really no wayto.

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:57.180
As far as I know,

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:58.470
I'm not a personal hacker by any means,

00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:59.220
but as far as I know,

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:02.110
there's no hack somebody with just the right p address.

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:02.280
I mean,

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.190
it's really pretty public knowledge.

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:05.080
Anyway,

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:05.870
let's go ahead.

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:06.320
And,

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.250
um,

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:09.650
server.

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:10.220
There we go.

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:10.870
Um,

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:12.860
I'll go to refresh the page.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:14.930
And now we get your I.

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:17.810
P address is 0000 Service origins one.

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:18.770
So in this case,

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:20.690
actually giving me serious Here's another one,

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:22.120
since it's running on local host.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:26.210
But if I was running it on some other machine,

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:27.280
it would give me a different All right.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.070
So you can also get the remote address if he wanted.

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:38.020
So requests dot yet dot get What's weird is that let me go.

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:42.450
And this year ago request dot yet remote.

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:46.670
I had hopes a DDR There we go.

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:47.250
All right,

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:48.460
so we got the local address,

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.220
but here we could get the remote actress as well.

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:53.490
Let's run this and in theory,

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:57.280
we should and they know.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.200
There we go.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.690
Now we can go and refresh this,

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:04.250
and now we'll get the remote address,

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:07.290
and this is actually going to give us the same exact thing since we're again running on the

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:08.220
same exact machine.

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.410
But if you're running on different on different machines,

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:12.800
it would give us different addresses.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:13.820
Okay.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:16.930
Is that essentially the very basics of J Speed is a lot of different things that we can do

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:17.100
here.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:23.100
You got your sea do request dot and actually gives you a bunch of different a bunch of

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.250
different methods.

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:26.240
They conduce,

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.140
we could get the local port,

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:27.710
for example.

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:29.000
Let's see.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.410
But it should give us give us some 80 80 and theory,

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:33.980
Uh,

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.990
see if it does in theory again.

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:38.250
Uh,

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:41.250
there we go.

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:41.540
Yeah,

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:42.360
we could refresh this.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.330
And yep,

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:45.500
80 80 as expected.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.340
So,

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:46.500
yes,

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.820
there are a lot of different things that we could do a lot of pretty cool things that we

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:49.220
can do.

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.210
Using this using jsp.

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:51.690
Anyway,

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:53.010
McCormack is just to get days,

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:53.470
be running.

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:54.070
Um,

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:54.980
you know,

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.480
understand the basics of jsp?

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.090
No.

00:13:58.090 --> 00:13:59.260
Nothing to do for homework.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:00.200
really Just,

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:00.470
you know,

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:00.890
study.

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:02.530
So yeah.

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:03.060
Anyway,

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:03.790
without further ado,

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:04.070
then,

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:06.770
um I guess I'll see you next time we'll win.

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:08.840
We'll we'll We'll be diving deeper into E.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.220
J s being how exactly that works.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:10.510
And,

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:10.700
uh,

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:11.060
yeah.
