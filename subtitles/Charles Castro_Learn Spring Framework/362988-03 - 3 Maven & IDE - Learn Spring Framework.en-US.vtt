00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.790
Hello there.

00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.360
And welcome back to the spring development course.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.160
So last time we took a general look at what,

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.020
exactly spring is how works where we can use a fore.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.300
And so on today we're gonna really be diving deep into how we can create a spring

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:15.950
application.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.090
Now,

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.190
at this point,

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.070
we really haven't gone over much.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.570
We don't know what a being is,

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.290
what is IOC containers and so on and so on.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.100
So what we're gonna be creating you may seem it may seem like I'm doing something crazy

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.350
that I haven't gone over,

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.280
and that's a little bit the idea.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.800
So you're going to see exactly what we build.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.240
And then later on,

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.490
as we start to learn more about how exactly spring works you're gonna think,

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.860
Oh,

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:43.950
so that's what that does.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.700
And in results,

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.190
you'll get a better understanding of exactly what's going on.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.680
All right,

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.410
so that we're gonna be going over exactly how we could download our i d.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.670
E.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.630
That we're gonna use to develop our applications.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.110
So we're going down the eclipse going down with it.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:06.340
I'm gonna go to eclipse that orig and the regardless is gonna take us to the main page

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.910
because see,

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.050
oxygen came out.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.670
Jr's just recently,

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:10.560
um,

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.150
so now we condone with it Just click download and take you to the download page.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.050
It will automatically give you the best,

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.150
you know,

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.730
location for where you're gonna download it.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:22.650
That's going bellowed.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.020
All right,

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.400
there we go.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.450
And school start downloading.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.730
So it's called a current quite a bit.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:31.030
Um,

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.910
let me go and actually pause the video while it's downloading,

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.910
and then I'll come back to it when it actually finishes.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.400
All right,

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.780
there we go.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:39.180
It's done.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.200
You know,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:48.550
we go and open it up and they know,

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.550
-

00:01:48.550 --> 00:02:32.770
All

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.990
right,

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.450
there we go.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.890
And then it should actually give you this eclipse installer.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:36.550
Um,

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.880
it should have,

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:37.550
actually.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.030
Okay,

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.500
There we go.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.100
There it is.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.490
Downloads folder.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.790
It's not going to open up a cliff installer.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.070
All right?

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.080
It will go and open it up.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.420
All right,

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.000
here we go.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.690
And we're gonna click on eclipse Ide ee for Java e developers was going click on it is

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.310
gonna select an installation folder.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.010
Just you know,

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.510
you could use the default and stall and don't install,

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.370
So here's well,

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.740
let me go toe,

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.590
pause the course and then all in posit.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:10.280
Once it installs,

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.750
we go.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:12.710
It's finished downloading.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:13.840
And now you can just do lunch,

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.560
all right?

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.920
And it'll go in and launch him for us any day now.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.360
This is all taking very long,

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.550
all right?

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.330
I think I'm gonna posit here as well and wait until something changes.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.590
Oh,

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.950
no,

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:32.420
They're ago.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.800
It changed quite perfectly.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.110
Okay,

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.420
so now we're gonna select a workspace at this point.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.740
You know what,

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:38.180
workspaces?

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:47.400
Just where are all our project files will be and lunch again,

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.050
taking some time and they know.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.670
All right.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:56.190
And there we go.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.940
Okay,

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:58.470
let me go to now,

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.850
Remove what I have so far here.

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.200
I don't really know why I'm here.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:12.530
All right?

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:13.060
And there we go.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.180
All right,

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.140
so we're gonna get started with Eclipse.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.920
Uh,

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.100
maybe some we're gonna be doing maven as well,

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.800
getting to know that as well.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.210
So,

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.600
first of all,

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.800
it's going to switch our perspective.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.870
So we're gonna do window,

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:25.710
uh,

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.930
perspective,

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.050
open perspective,

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.500
other,

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.150
and then select Joe E and open that up.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.100
There we go.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.570
All right,

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.650
so now we're in a different perspective.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:38.590
Just needed to that.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.920
All right,

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.410
Now we should be able to do file new and may even project.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.950
So let's do that.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.260
All right,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.820
there we go.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.380
We're gonna create a simple project.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.890
You the default default workspace location.

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:54.170
Just click.

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.750
Next.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:55.830
We're gonna answer.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.100
Insert a group I D.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.840
So the way maven projects work is that all projects have a group.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:00.850
An artifact I d.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:06.250
We could just put group an artifact group artifact.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.730
There we go.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.090
So now we can just finish.

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.980
All right,

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:13.520
There we go.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.730
So now we have the our maven project.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.580
So if you don't know how Maven Project works,

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:25.540
every single maven project has this palm dot XML file and this palm dot XML file.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.820
We can open it.

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.760
There we go.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.320
Um,

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.660
it actually first give you an overview.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.890
So apartment XML fired is just like any other xml file,

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.110
except maven reads it.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.830
And then from there,

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.120
it can install certain plug ins or dependencies and so on and so on.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.030
So we go to the raw palm and you can see exactly what's going on here.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.610
Source.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.370
We have our group i D and R artifact.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.750
I d as well as our version.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:57.260
And here we can actually start to add some configuration so we can add some dependencies by

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.650
doing dependencies.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.520
Dependencies?

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.070
There we go.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.930
And here we can actually answer some dependencies.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.550
So right now I'm gonna answer the spring dependencies.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.790
All right,

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:11.220
here we go.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.750
So the 1st 1 is gonna be just spring core,

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.600
so let me go to actually,

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.660
four minute you can do shift control F or shift command.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.350
If you're on a Mac 24 minute,

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.050
then save it up.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:23.050
Okay.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.550
All right.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.870
Now we're gonna go ahead and actually start using our spring files,

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:33.610
and you can actually see there's a maven dependencies file or yes,

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:38.160
section here where you can actually see exactly the jars that installed.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.090
So it's it's installed Spring core and spring Jae seo.

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.040
So we're gonna go to actually create a spring file.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.330
First of all,

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.690
it's good it was good and create a new package.

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:55.330
And this is gonna be com dot example dot Let's just say,

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:01.500
um bkg All right,

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:01.830
there we go.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.160
So now we're gonna create a new Java file.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:04.700
A class.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:05.150
I'm sorry.

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.610
So the class will be,

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:08.270
um,

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:12.540
sample being all right there in the new public.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:12.790
Static,

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:14.450
avoid main finish up.

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:17.500
And okay,

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.300
so here.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.060
What are we going to do?

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:19.700
So,

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:20.730
first of all,

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:24.930
what we're gonna do is actually go back to our palm dot xml file,

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:30.070
cause I complete for God that we also need spring context in order for our very first

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.980
application to work.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.970
Okay,

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:33.530
there we go.

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:36.040
So now we're gonna go ahead and remove this.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:36.350
All right?

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:39.080
So it should just build the project with Save it.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:43.350
And now we can do application context.

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:46.460
Ah,

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.580
c equals new application context.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.960
It's actually conform to Java coding conventions here.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:53.330
Once again,

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.240
we actually going now import it.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.250
Here we go.

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.280
Uh,

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.820
let's do application context.

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:01.550
There we go.

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:05.070
And now we can do instead of new application.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:08.810
Contacts were going to do new ah,

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:09.500
class,

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.150
path,

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:13.150
class,

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:13.850
path.

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:17.000
And then I think xml application context.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:17.410
Yeah,

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:17.960
class path.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:22.210
Xom Island is from Capital Letter class class path,

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.030
XML application context.

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:27.440
And now we can right.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.040
XML is like that.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:29.570
There we go.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:31.920
Can I really remember the name?

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:32.140
All right,

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:32.550
there we go.

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:33.260
Ok,

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.900
and now we just need to import the name of our XML file again.

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.110
This film beat makes sense in a second here.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:40.210
And so now we can dio,

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:46.270
um beans dot xml All right,

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:46.700
there we go.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.190
So at this point,

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:55.650
we've named the sample being was actually named this application start start.

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:59.500
Since we're gonna have a different sample being,

00:08:59.500 --> 00:08:59.870
uh,

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:01.040
let's bring in the compilation unit.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:01.500
There we go.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:07.750
So now we actually got are going to create a new class called Let's Just Say Point.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:11.450
There we go.

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:12.520
I'll check Main.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.550
All right.

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:16.690
So our point will actually be a being rex.

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:17.460
You don't need Maynard.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.490
I don't know why I checked it.

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.980
And here we actually create some values,

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:26.860
weaken dio into X and y and then just generate getters and centers as well.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:33.050
So source generate gators and centers.

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:35.920
There we go,

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.670
X y and then we can do OK,

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:41.150
All right,

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:41.460
there we go.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.850
So now we have our being close to his private as well.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:49.050
There we go.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:49.950
Okay.

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:51.510
So now we have our bean.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:52.590
All right,

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:57.480
So now our next step will be to create our beans out xml file,

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.320
but that's gonna be that in the next lesson.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.390
So Ah,

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:01.560
Ah,

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:01.960
it's better.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.350
It's best to keep this these lessons a little shorter so that,

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:04.550
you know,

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:05.780
you can understand it.

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:06.950
Just go along.

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:07.920
Sort of.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.080
How can I say this steps?

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:10.470
Sort of.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:11.760
So your job,

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:12.200
for now,

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.100
is just to get this working on your machine.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.860
So he's not actually gonna work Fashion a runner?

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.570
I know it'll actually give me an error.

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.050
Yeah,

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:21.430
As you can see,

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:23.360
it can't find the beans on xml file.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:28.430
But your job is to get it working so that there's so that it can import application context

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:30.410
and then just get the point working as well.

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:31.210
And then in the next time,

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:36.440
we're gonna go over exactly how we can install our being dot xml file and how we get it

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.050
working as well.

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:38.510
So anyway,

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:39.150
um,

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:40.990
I'll see you next time soon
