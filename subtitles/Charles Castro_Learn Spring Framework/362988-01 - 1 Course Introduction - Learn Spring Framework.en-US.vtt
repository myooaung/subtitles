00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.220
Hello there.

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:03.100
And welcome to the spring development,

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:03.680
Of course.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.410
So didn't reason.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.110
Talking a little bit?

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.570
About what,

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:06.870
exactly?

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.820
Going to be going over in this course what prerequisites you need.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.720
So what enology already need to have in order for this course as well as just,

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.930
you know,

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.050
some general thoughts on how exactly made this course and how things have been work.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.580
So you start off at you know what,

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:23.910
exactly?

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.720
We're gonna be going over in this course,

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.690
so we're gonna be taking a look at exactly.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.830
And things were going to be going over in the first lesson.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.340
But just so you know,

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.540
we're essentially going to start with.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.500
Then you look at core spring,

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.560
so just like this is gonna be the very core of spring.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.450
So this is how it works under the hood.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.670
We're gonna take a look at a dependency injection essentially spring and how that work,

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.990
they will take up a little bit of time.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.340
Um then we're also going to take a look at spring MBC So spring,

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.760
NBC essentially just stands for spring model view controller.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.670
And this is just something that greatly simplifies the development of web applications.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.170
So applications that utilize,

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.550
you know,

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.760
And so it really simplifies that,

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.710
and that's going to be taking a look at as well.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.740
After that,

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.610
we're gonna take a look at some Js p basics,

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.800
which is essentially sort of like you can think of it as front end.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.870
So sort of like the visuals of the application.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.640
So when human you go to a website,

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.050
you need to see something.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.420
And,

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.570
you know,

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.810
we're not gonna be going into front and development so much.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.780
It was going to be going over the very basics of JSP,

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.750
which is the show just allows us to do some visual work.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:30.540
Um,

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.820
we're not actually gonna be creating,

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:32.280
you know,

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.270
like extreme front and designs,

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.540
though,

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.110
So yeah.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.070
Um,

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.390
OK,

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.480
And then after that,

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.820
we're gonna be taking a look at rest in spring.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.610
So rest is in,

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.200
um,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.750
ap I architecture not not really an I p in a p I architecture.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.110
There's a lot of different sort of definitions for arrest,

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.740
but,

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.950
you know,

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.690
it's generally just a way of a P.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:57.620
I is part of rest,

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.450
so you can develop a race to arrest a P I and That's one of the things that you can do.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.750
Okay?

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:03.260
And after that,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.210
we're going to take a look at you know,

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.040
how we can configure a longer in our application.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.910
And then after that,

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.930
that is essentially all,

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.830
um so it's actually it may not sound like that much,

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.540
but the things that we're actually gonna gonna go over there actually very dense.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.150
And so there's a lot of sort of,

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.210
um there's a lot of different things to go over in each unit,

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.910
so yeah,

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:26.970
All right,

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:27.540
prerequisite.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.640
So before prerequisites,

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.780
there's nothing much you said.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.100
You just have to know Base java.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.570
And again,

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.150
we're gonna talk about prerequisites in the first lesson as well.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.310
But you have to know just based Java.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.010
So court Java.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.670
So how exactly?

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.450
Everything works for if methods,

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.710
you know,

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.470
some object oriented programming.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.550
They like that as well as maybe some,

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.420
um,

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.670
Servet Basic.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.450
So enter job enterprise development.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.840
Basic.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.050
So All right,

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.330
so anyway,

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.930
without further do,

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.360
then I will see you in the first lesson,

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.730
and,

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:57.000
uh,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.350
yeah,
