00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.900
Hello there.

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.410
And welcome back to the spring development,

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:02.930
Of course.

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:06.950
So last time we went how over how we could get input into Ah,

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:07.320
you know,

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:07.810
an arrest,

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:08.450
a p I.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:16.750
And today we're gonna be going over how we can use different requests methods to sort of

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:17.650
Okay,

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.510
how can I say this to accomplish different things?

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.920
I mean,

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.780
says it in India in the title of the lesson.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.210
So,

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.430
yeah.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:25.910
Anyway,

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:26.450
um,

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.160
without for do,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.080
let's get into this.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.750
All right,

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:29.250
here we are.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.000
So,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.450
um,

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.580
using different request methods so we can use different request methods to accomplish

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.420
different things here.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.190
We're going to use the delete method to delete a certain class.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.480
And class is not gonna be a Java class is gonna be a class like class room inside our list

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:44.480
.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.870
Here's how we would do that.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.170
So here we have everything the same.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.830
So request mapping value gets students met the request method.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:50.620
Don't delete.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.590
That's the only difference on and then response body.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.160
You know,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.540
we already went over what that does,

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.490
and then we have a request.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.930
Haram.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.470
Class I d were signing to Class I d and then here instead of returning something we have

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.310
avoid here.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.990
We have two students start removed.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.750
Class I D.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.680
Since we have a request method or delete here.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.730
So by specifying different request methods,

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.750
we could accomplish different things.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:11.660
Okay,

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.780
so now it's going to take a look at how we can actually use this in the code.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.050
Okay,

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.490
So,

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.990
saying jump,

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.350
let's actually not change anything was actually add another controller.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.400
There we go.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.060
We're gonna have get,

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.350
Seems,

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.760
except here.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.650
We're gonna have a request method delete,

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.970
and they hear sort of guessing is we're gonna have Del students,

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.930
and then here we're gonna have the same get students here.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:35.760
Actually change this.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.700
Just students.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.850
And then let's change this to,

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:39.870
um,

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.150
students as well.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.780
All right?

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:42.410
There we go.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:43.090
Um,

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.520
and so now we can go ahead and here instead of return.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.440
We're just going to do students don't remove,

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.000
and then class,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.370
I d.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.880
All right,

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.570
There we go.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.420
Okay.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.220
And then here.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.050
Let's change this to void as well.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.040
All right,

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.650
There we go.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:07.350
Um,

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.550
And so now we can go to do students.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.270
I added R minus one years.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.480
Well,

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.430
just to make it a little bit you understand what I'm actually recording actually stopped

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.180
there for some reason,

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.190
it crashed.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.400
Right?

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.530
Rear courts.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.950
Anyway,

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:21.560
um,

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.760
so that now we can do students system system,

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.370
doctor out print,

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.350
Ellen and then strengths.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.060
Okay,

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.600
there we go.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.030
And we actually are met with a little bit of Ah,

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.450
um,

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.480
how can I say this problem here since students is when we do,

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.770
our raised are as list.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.730
We actually get back a,

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.160
um uh,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.750
abstract list.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.650
And so that its immutable So we can't actually perform the remove method on it.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.180
So to do that where we didn't we would actually have to do to implement this remove We

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.190
would have changes to a new array list.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.920
So,

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:07.580
um,

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.310
let's go actually,

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:15.750
really quickly do That's what's gonna dio equals equals new our A list.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.670
There we go.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.650
Mostly this,

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.550
uh there we go.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.950
It's import or a list.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.250
Okay.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.850
And then to string here a ray list are realist.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.470
Ah,

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.350
realist string.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.550
There we go.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.890
That's good.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:47.650
Genes that as well.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:48.800
All right,

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.190
there we go.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.980
And then here we're gonna really quickly do dio Yeah,

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.770
students,

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:05.350
let's go really quickly create a another method here We do at request mapping.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:06.880
Ah,

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.550
value equals slash in it,

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.790
they're Riggio.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.320
And then we're gonna do at let's just do no response body at all.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.250
We're going to public void in it.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.640
All right,

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.100
there we go.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.060
And then he was gonna do,

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.330
Ah,

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.980
students don't add,

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.450
um,

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:29.100
and then here,

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.850
we're gonna copy back in.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.050
What?

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.630
We just we just really let me go.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:34.720
Any friends that really quickly,

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.480
But this right here.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.050
So we're gonna take this right here and just paste this into here.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.360
There we go.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.250
Uh,

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.680
this what was won't be a list.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.150
Like that theory.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.720
We should able to.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.040
Nope.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.260
Nope.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.750
Another work.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:54.880
Okay,

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.350
because then we're gonna need to create a,

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.560
um,

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.150
new for a list.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.800
Ah,

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.050
string.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.450
Uh,

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.600
object.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.450
H let's make this a realist string as well.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.230
There we go.

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.710
OK,

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.570
h dot ad Can we do at all?

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.530
Ad all.

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:24.200
Here we go.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:29.650
And then we can just do it like this.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.050
Our raise dot as list.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.090
Whoops.

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.400
Back,

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.730
back,

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:38.090
back.

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.550
There we go.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.950
There we go.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:43.640
All right.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.560
And that we could do students that at H and they were going to the same thing for the rest

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.390
of h.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:50.950
So do just like that.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:59.050
And then we'll just do this is well before it so that it points to a new pointer.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.040
Ah,

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.580
OK.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.050
This is this is pretty taking quite a long time.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.050
Um,

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.650
if this was all hooked up to a database and obviously would have a problem,

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.120
so yeah,

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:21.240
but that's where we have our own sort of separate our own separate data source.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.150
We have to reconfigure this correctly.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.940
All right.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:28.450
And there we go.

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:29.760
Okay.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:35.430
And then we just do stuff that h and then students don't add H and then students don't add

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.120
h here as well.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.820
Ok,

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:38.380
there we go.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.890
So now is gonna call the unit method in side Postman.

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:42.590
Let's get let me out.

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:43.550
Lessons going and wait.

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.070
Let's delete this as well.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:49.250
So this is gonna be this is gonna provide on air.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.130
There we go.

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:53.890
Um all right,

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.350
let's wait for you to restart the server.

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:58.190
There we go.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:03.500
All right,

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:03.800
there we go.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.270
So we started.

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.850
Server now is gonna go to our postman.

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.200
Let's do ah,

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.250
get requests to rib artifact slash In it.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:17.260
Ah,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:17.870
Whoops.

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:18.470
OK,

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:25.990
so it appears that when we did it not to map it.

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.140
No,

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:26.700
a map to him.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:27.020
Update.

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.850
Let's take a look at it was at least happening here.

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:30.300
Ah,

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.210
Web artifact slash In it.

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:33.830
That's odd.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:34.590
Uh,

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:43.550
let's do at response body here just to make sure things working.

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:45.150
There we go.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:46.370
Okay.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:47.840
Lets wait for to refresh.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:54.140
Right.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:54.650
There we go.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:56.940
Okay.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.360
And then now in Postman,

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.320
we should be able to initialize it.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:00.520
Okay.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:00.890
There you go,

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:01.150
sweetie.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:01.950
Initialized it.

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:05.190
Now you go to our method here,

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:05.970
we can get it,

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:07.780
and it gets back this right here.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.270
And then we can delete this.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:10.550
Let's changes to delete.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.740
And now they will delete it.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:13.390
And then would we?

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:16.710
Do you'll see here how it no longer exists there.

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:17.610
Now there's only two.

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:19.510
And then same goes here.

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:20.750
When we do post,

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.460
we now don't actually get it,

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:26.070
so it can't find it.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:28.710
So index to it out of bounds for length to,

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:30.350
So I can't find it since we delete it.

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:31.380
There we go.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.750
So that is how that works.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:34.520
All right.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.870
That has been sort of an intro to building arrest ap.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:41.760
I um hopefully you got something we did quite spend quite a bit of time could figure in our

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.420
data source correctly and at the end there.

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:44.050
But,

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:44.410
you know,

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:46.680
there's just no way we could and that without it,

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.240
but,

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:47.530
uh,

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:47.850
yeah.

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:48.140
Anyway,

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:48.660
without further ado,

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.180
then let's assigning homework all rights of Rome work.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.010
You're gonna utilize the put method in a ref controller.

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:54.600
So delete,

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.450
delete something,

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:56.450
Get,

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:57.250
get something.

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:00.570
And here you're going to use the put matters with Put some things you're gonna add some

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:02.590
kind of array list.

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:03.450
So pretty stuff.

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:04.450
Um,

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:05.580
I wish you luck.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:06.500
And,

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:06.850
uh,

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:08.450
I sect doesn't.
