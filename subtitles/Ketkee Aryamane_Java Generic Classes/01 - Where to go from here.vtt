00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.009
- [Ketkee] Now that you are equipped

2
00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:04.005
with the fundamental knowledge of generics,

3
00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:06.004
it would be beneficial for you

4
00:00:06.004 --> 00:00:09.007
to pick up and learn the collections framework in detail

5
00:00:09.007 --> 00:00:12.000
if you haven't already done so.

6
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.003
You can use the course, "Learning Collections in Java,"

7
00:00:15.003 --> 00:00:17.006
right here on LinkedIn Learning.

8
00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:19.007
Even if you know the collections framework,

9
00:00:19.007 --> 00:00:23.002
it would still make a of sense to look at it again

10
00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:25.008
in order to understand the best practices

11
00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:29.005
that Java collections framework uses with generics.

12
00:00:29.005 --> 00:00:33.002
You can grab the book, "Effective Java" by Joshua Bloch,

13
00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:37.004
which covers best practices on all topics in Java.

14
00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:40.000
Additionally, you should now be able

15
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.003
to read and understand code with generics

16
00:00:42.003 --> 00:00:45.009
in any Java or JEE frameworks.

17
00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:48.005
Thank you for joining me on this course.

18
00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:51.000
Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn.

19
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I'd love to hear your stories

20
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.007
on how you apply the learning from this course

21
00:00:55.007 --> 00:00:57.001
in your projects.

22
00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:59.000
Happy learning.
