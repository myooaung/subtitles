00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:03.006
- [Ketkee] When you write code, it is always better

2
00:00:03.006 --> 00:00:06.007
to have bugs and programming issues identified

3
00:00:06.007 --> 00:00:09.000
and addressed at compile time,

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.004
rather than them showing up at runtime.

5
00:00:11.004 --> 00:00:13.006
Generics in Java provides a way

6
00:00:13.006 --> 00:00:16.000
to define parameterized types.

7
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.005
It implements strict type safety checks at compile time

8
00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:22.007
and helps eliminate bugs at runtime.

9
00:00:22.007 --> 00:00:26.004
It also lets you impose restrictions on parameterized types

10
00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:30.007
to ensure that your application becomes more robust.

11
00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:34.000
The feature of wild cards in generics further helps

12
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.003
to build flexible solutions.

13
00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:40.007
It is an indispensable feature in the Java language today

14
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:42.009
and one of the most powerful tools

15
00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:45.002
in a Java developer's toolkit.

16
00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:47.000
I am Ketkee Aryamane.

17
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.003
I work as a Java developer, technical trainer, and writer.

18
00:00:51.003 --> 00:00:53.002
Join me in my course,

19
00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:55.009
where we will start off with the fundamentals,

20
00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:59.005
then do a deep dive and implement code examples

21
00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:01.008
to understand these concepts better.

22
00:01:01.008 --> 00:01:03.000
Let's get started.
