00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.001
- [Instructor] In order to make the most out of this course,

2
00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:05.002
there are a few things to consider.

3
00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:07.002
You should have a solid foundation

4
00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:10.004
of object-oriented programming concepts in Java.

5
00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:13.001
This includes classes, objects,

6
00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:17.001
inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

7
00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:18.003
Beginner-level knowledge

8
00:00:18.003 --> 00:00:21.008
of Java version 1.8 or above is required,

9
00:00:21.008 --> 00:00:25.002
along with the ability to write classes, methods,

10
00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:27.002
and run applications.

11
00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:28.009
You should have the JDK,

12
00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.001
that is Java Development Kit Version 1.8,

13
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:34.006
up and running in your environment.

14
00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:37.001
It would be nice to have a good understanding

15
00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:39.004
of the collections framework in Java.

16
00:00:39.004 --> 00:00:41.003
There are many demos in the course

17
00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:44.004
that cover a basic use of this framework.

18
00:00:44.004 --> 00:00:47.002
Lastly, hands-on experience with any IDE,

19
00:00:47.002 --> 00:00:50.008
like IntelliJ or Eclipse would be great.

20
00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:55.000
We will use IntelliJ Community Edition for this course.

21
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It can be downloaded for free.

22
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
You can also use any other IDE of your choice.

23
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Let us take a look at the exercise files for this course.

24
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.007
They have been listed movie-wise.

25
00:01:07.007 --> 00:01:09.009
Each movie has two folders,

26
00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.001
One that is suffixed with b,

27
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:13.008
which stands for beginning.

28
00:01:13.008 --> 00:01:16.006
This would have the start state of the project.

29
00:01:16.006 --> 00:01:19.002
The other folder is suffixed with e,

30
00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:21.009
which stands for end, and this contains

31
00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.003
the end state of the project.

32
00:01:24.003 --> 00:01:26.006
All right then, with this information,

33
00:01:26.006 --> 00:01:31.000
let's dive right in and start learning Java Generics.
