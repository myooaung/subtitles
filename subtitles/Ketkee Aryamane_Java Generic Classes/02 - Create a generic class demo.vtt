00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.007
- [Instructor] In our previous video,

2
00:00:01.007 --> 00:00:03.005
we have already seen the overview

3
00:00:03.005 --> 00:00:05.002
of everything that we need to do

4
00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:08.003
in order to build our generic class box.

5
00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:11.000
We will split this demo into two parts

6
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.006
for the sake of simplicity.

7
00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:13.007
In the first part,

8
00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:16.002
we'll code everything on the box class,

9
00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:18.005
and we'll also code our type arguments,

10
00:00:18.005 --> 00:00:20.007
which is Book and Fruit.

11
00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:21.008
We'll test this out.

12
00:00:21.008 --> 00:00:24.006
In the subsequent videos, we will add methods,

13
00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:28.000
and then test everything together as a whole unit.

14
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.008
Now, I have steps mentioned on the slide

15
00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:33.001
in order to get started for building the generic class box.

16
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:35.006
So let's execute those steps one by one.

17
00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:38.001
The first step is to create a class box

18
00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:41.004
and define a type parameter T for it.

19
00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:43.002
Let's head back to the IDE.

20
00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:47.005
And on this package, let's create a class called box.

21
00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:49.008
And this time, it is going to have a type parameter.

22
00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:51.007
So you have to enclose that type parameter

23
00:00:51.007 --> 00:00:55.007
in a pair of angle brackets like that, done.

24
00:00:55.007 --> 00:00:58.002
The second step is to declare a list

25
00:00:58.002 --> 00:01:00.009
of T items instance variable.

26
00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:02.001
So as we said earlier,

27
00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:05.004
this box can contain multiple items of the same type.

28
00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:07.001
So we need to incorporate that

29
00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:10.000
by means of an instance variable declaration.

30
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So let's go ahead and say private,

31
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.001
all your instance variables

32
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:16.006
should always be private in Java.

33
00:01:16.006 --> 00:01:19.007
So private, list.

34
00:01:19.007 --> 00:01:22.002
This will be list of T.

35
00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:25.008
And let's call this, items.

36
00:01:25.008 --> 00:01:26.008
We'll do one more thing.

37
00:01:26.008 --> 00:01:32.009
We will create a constructor for this box class

38
00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.002
and inside this constructor,

39
00:01:34.002 --> 00:01:38.001
we'll access the items property using the this operator

40
00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:42.007
and instantiate this to an empty array list.

41
00:01:42.007 --> 00:01:44.007
Because when we declare the instance variable

42
00:01:44.007 --> 00:01:45.009
on line number seven,

43
00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.005
this is going to be having the default value of null.

44
00:01:49.005 --> 00:01:50.008
So I'm going to instantiate that

45
00:01:50.008 --> 00:01:53.000
to an empty array list on line number 10.

46
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.003
And if you see,

47
00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:56.004
we have the diamond operator in action.

48
00:01:56.004 --> 00:01:59.007
Next, let's go ahead and also make a getter method

49
00:01:59.007 --> 00:02:04.001
in order to access the items property outside the box class.

50
00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:08.009
So I can just go ahead and say right click, Generate,

51
00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.005
choose the Getter, select the field and say OK.

52
00:02:13.005 --> 00:02:17.000
That's all that we need to do in the box class as of now.

53
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.002
Let's go to the next step.

54
00:02:18.002 --> 00:02:21.001
We have to create classes Book and Fruit

55
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:23.002
in order to test the box generate type.

56
00:02:23.002 --> 00:02:25.005
So let's go ahead and create those POJOs,

57
00:02:25.005 --> 00:02:27.000
plain old Java objects.

58
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.002
So let's right click on this package,

59
00:02:30.002 --> 00:02:34.006
create a Java class and name it, Book.

60
00:02:34.006 --> 00:02:37.003
Let's quickly add properties to the Book class.

61
00:02:37.003 --> 00:02:41.006
So I'll say private string name,

62
00:02:41.006 --> 00:02:46.009
private string author,

63
00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:49.002
and we'll also take the weight of the Book as a property.

64
00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:52.005
So that'll be a double, like that.

65
00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:53.008
Now there are a few things that I want to do

66
00:02:53.008 --> 00:02:55.004
for the Book class.

67
00:02:55.004 --> 00:02:57.003
One is I want to create a constructor,

68
00:02:57.003 --> 00:03:01.000
so you can say right click, Generate, a Constructor,

69
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.005
select all the three fields,

70
00:03:02.005 --> 00:03:04.007
because we want all the three fields to have values

71
00:03:04.007 --> 00:03:07.006
during instantiation, click OK,

72
00:03:07.006 --> 00:03:09.004
and your constructor is ready.

73
00:03:09.004 --> 00:03:12.002
Next, we want the getter methods

74
00:03:12.002 --> 00:03:14.000
to access all the three properties.

75
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.007
So again, right click, Generate, Getter,

76
00:03:18.007 --> 00:03:20.002
select all the three fields,

77
00:03:20.002 --> 00:03:23.006
we want methods for each one of them, say OK.

78
00:03:23.006 --> 00:03:29.006
So now you have getName, getAuthor, and getWeight.

79
00:03:29.006 --> 00:03:30.005
The last step that we'll do here

80
00:03:30.005 --> 00:03:35.000
is we'll generate the toString method for this POJO.

81
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.006
So right click, Generate, say toString,

82
00:03:38.006 --> 00:03:41.008
and select all the three fields and click on OK.

83
00:03:41.008 --> 00:03:44.005
So whenever you're trying to print the Book object,

84
00:03:44.005 --> 00:03:46.003
you will be able to see the values

85
00:03:46.003 --> 00:03:48.007
of the name, author, and weight properties,

86
00:03:48.007 --> 00:03:50.008
instead of some random string representation

87
00:03:50.008 --> 00:03:53.000
that Java gives you by default.

88
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.002
So there we go. We have the Book class ready.

89
00:03:55.002 --> 00:03:56.009
Let's also create the Fruit class.

90
00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:59.001
So I'll right click again on the package,

91
00:03:59.001 --> 00:04:04.000
create another Java class and name this as Fruit.

92
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.002
Let's define properties here as well.

93
00:04:06.002 --> 00:04:10.005
Private string, that'll be the name of the Fruit.

94
00:04:10.005 --> 00:04:11.006
Yes, that's right.

95
00:04:11.006 --> 00:04:14.006
Next is private string,

96
00:04:14.006 --> 00:04:20.006
let's call this field as country of origin,

97
00:04:20.006 --> 00:04:23.006
the country where this fruit originated.

98
00:04:23.006 --> 00:04:26.003
Next will be private string,

99
00:04:26.003 --> 00:04:29.001
let's also have the color of the fruit as a property,

100
00:04:29.001 --> 00:04:32.006
and then we'll have the weight of the fruit.

101
00:04:32.006 --> 00:04:35.006
So that'll be a double type, like that.

102
00:04:35.006 --> 00:04:37.009
And we'll do the same ritual for the Fruit class

103
00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:39.000
as we did for the Book.

104
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.002
So let's go ahead.

105
00:04:41.002 --> 00:04:44.009
Right click, Generate, a Constructor,

106
00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:47.005
select all the four fields, click OK.

107
00:04:47.005 --> 00:04:49.003
So your constructor is ready.

108
00:04:49.003 --> 00:04:51.003
Next, we'll define the getter methods.

109
00:04:51.003 --> 00:04:55.006
Right click again on line 16, Generate, Getter,

110
00:04:55.006 --> 00:04:56.009
select all the four fields,

111
00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:00.005
we want methods for each one of them, say OK.

112
00:05:00.005 --> 00:05:01.003
There we go.

113
00:05:01.003 --> 00:05:04.005
You have getName, getCountryOfOrigin,

114
00:05:04.005 --> 00:05:08.004
getColor, and getWeight.

115
00:05:08.004 --> 00:05:10.002
Lastly, we need the toString method,

116
00:05:10.002 --> 00:05:13.003
again, to print the Fruit object in any case.

117
00:05:13.003 --> 00:05:14.008
So let's go ahead.

118
00:05:14.008 --> 00:05:18.001
Right click, Generate, select toString,

119
00:05:18.001 --> 00:05:21.002
select all four fields and then click OK.

120
00:05:21.002 --> 00:05:22.001
So there we go.

121
00:05:22.001 --> 00:05:24.007
We have the Book and the Fruit types ready.

122
00:05:24.007 --> 00:05:26.001
We'll also do one more thing.

123
00:05:26.001 --> 00:05:29.008
In our Box class, we have the constructor,

124
00:05:29.008 --> 00:05:31.006
we have the getter method.

125
00:05:31.006 --> 00:05:34.004
Here as well, we will generate the toString method.

126
00:05:34.004 --> 00:05:39.001
So let's right click, Generate, say toString,

127
00:05:39.001 --> 00:05:42.002
select the items property and say OK.

128
00:05:42.002 --> 00:05:43.007
So there we go. We are all set.

129
00:05:43.007 --> 00:05:46.007
The last step will be to create a test class

130
00:05:46.007 --> 00:05:49.004
in order to invoke the box generic type

131
00:05:49.004 --> 00:05:51.008
for the classes that we define just now,

132
00:05:51.008 --> 00:05:53.001
the Book and the Fruit.

133
00:05:53.001 --> 00:05:55.000
So we'll create two different boxes.

134
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
One is box of Books, the other box of Fruits.

135
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
So let's go to the IDE and create a test class.

136
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.004
Let's call this test box generics.

137
00:06:08.004 --> 00:06:10.006
Let's write the main method.

138
00:06:10.006 --> 00:06:13.007
And now let's go ahead and create a box of Books first.

139
00:06:13.007 --> 00:06:15.004
So let's say box.

140
00:06:15.004 --> 00:06:18.002
And this time we are going to pass

141
00:06:18.002 --> 00:06:22.002
the type argument of Book.

142
00:06:22.002 --> 00:06:25.000
This will be Book box.

143
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.004
The variable name generally gets generated by the IDE.

144
00:06:27.004 --> 00:06:29.005
So you really don't have to strain much

145
00:06:29.005 --> 00:06:32.005
in order to decide to name your variables.

146
00:06:32.005 --> 00:06:35.009
Let's instantiate this.

147
00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:37.009
And again, we have the diamond operator in action.

148
00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:42.001
So you need not declare the type argument Book again

149
00:06:42.001 --> 00:06:45.000
on the right-hand side of the assignment operator.

150
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.005
So what we did on line number five

151
00:06:46.005 --> 00:06:49.006
is we invoked the box generic type

152
00:06:49.006 --> 00:06:53.000
and we did this for the type argument Book.

153
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.007
So now you can think of something like this

154
00:06:55.007 --> 00:06:58.004
that this Book is going to replace

155
00:06:58.004 --> 00:07:02.003
that T type parameter that we have on the Box class.

156
00:07:02.003 --> 00:07:05.009
So if you take a look at the Box class and go right up,

157
00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:09.004
so everywhere that you see the T type parameter,

158
00:07:09.004 --> 00:07:10.009
Book is going to replace it.

159
00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:13.004
That's what you can think that this is doing.

160
00:07:13.004 --> 00:07:18.004
Similarly, let's also create a box of Fruits.

161
00:07:18.004 --> 00:07:20.000
So it's the same thing.

162
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.009
This time, the type argument will be different.

163
00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:28.007
Let's call this Fruit box, new box.

164
00:07:28.007 --> 00:07:30.004
That's all.

165
00:07:30.004 --> 00:07:32.000
And now, let's do one more thing.

166
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.006
On line number six, let's print the Book box.

167
00:07:36.006 --> 00:07:43.005
On line number nine, let's print the Fruit box.

168
00:07:43.005 --> 00:07:47.003
Right. And let's go ahead and run this program now.

169
00:07:47.003 --> 00:07:53.006
And let's observe what the console output is. Right.

170
00:07:53.006 --> 00:07:59.000
So if you see, so right now we have just created two boxes.

171
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.007
We have invoked the box generic type

172
00:08:00.007 --> 00:08:02.006
for the Book and the Fruit.

173
00:08:02.006 --> 00:08:07.001
We have not added any items to either of the boxes.

174
00:08:07.001 --> 00:08:09.003
We will do that when we start adding methods

175
00:08:09.003 --> 00:08:11.001
to the generic class.

176
00:08:11.001 --> 00:08:12.000
So that's all.

177
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.005
This is the generic class box that you wrote

178
00:08:14.005 --> 00:08:17.000
and we have everything set for the class level.
