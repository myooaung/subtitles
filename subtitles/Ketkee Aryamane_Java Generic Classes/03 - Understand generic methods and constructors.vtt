00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.000
- [Instructor] The next part of the demo

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
is to add generic methods to the box generic type.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.004
But before that, let's understand the concept

4
00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:10.001
of generic methods.

5
00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:12.004
So the way you define generics on the class level

6
00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:15.007
you can always extend that to the method level, as well.

7
00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:18.002
And there are two parts here that we have to talk about.

8
00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:21.003
Generic methods inside a generic class

9
00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:24.007
and generic methods outside the generic class.

10
00:00:24.007 --> 00:00:26.006
Let's first talk about the generic methods

11
00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:28.004
inside the generic class.

12
00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:32.003
So a method inside generic class will always have access

13
00:00:32.003 --> 00:00:36.000
to the type parameter that was defined on the class level.

14
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And hence, it automatically becomes a generic method

15
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.007
relative to that type parameter.

16
00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:44.008
In addition to this, a method which is inside

17
00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:49.001
a generic class can always use more type parameters

18
00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:51.005
other than the ones defined on the class level.

19
00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:54.008
So for example, if your class has a type parameter

20
00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:57.009
T defined, then the method inside your generic class

21
00:00:57.009 --> 00:01:00.001
can definitely use T

22
00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:02.006
because that is available on the class level.

23
00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:05.005
But additionally, it can also use more parameters

24
00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:06.007
for its own logic.

25
00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:12.004
For example, S-U-V can definitely be defined on that method.

26
00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:15.004
Now let's talk about methods outside a generic class.

27
00:01:15.004 --> 00:01:19.001
Let's say you have a utility class for the box generic type

28
00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:23.000
called BoxUtils and you want to define a method

29
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.009
in the utility class which gives you access

30
00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.003
to the type parameter T of your box generic type.

31
00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:32.009
It is then possible to have the type parameter declared

32
00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.001
on that method as well.

33
00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:37.000
So you can write generic methods

34
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.004
even outside a generic class.

35
00:01:39.004 --> 00:01:43.005
Lastly, as we know, constructors are very similar to methods

36
00:01:43.005 --> 00:01:45.004
except that they do not have a return type.

37
00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:48.001
So all the rules that we saw with generic methods

38
00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:51.006
naturally get applied to constructors, as well.

39
00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:55.003
Now let's go ahead and start the second part of our demo.

40
00:01:55.003 --> 00:01:58.003
Let's add methods to the generic type box.

41
00:01:58.003 --> 00:01:59.008
So I have a series of steps here.

42
00:01:59.008 --> 00:02:01.006
Let's execute them one by one.

43
00:02:01.006 --> 00:02:04.007
The first one is add method to the box class.

44
00:02:04.007 --> 00:02:07.004
The first method is additem.

45
00:02:07.004 --> 00:02:10.006
This method is supposed to add an item to the box.

46
00:02:10.006 --> 00:02:13.001
So let's go back to the IDE

47
00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:17.000
and inside the box class, let's open that,

48
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.006
let's come after this constructor and on line number 13

49
00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:23.009
we are now going to define a generic method

50
00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:28.003
which is going to add an item in the list for this box.

51
00:02:28.003 --> 00:02:32.005
So we can say public, we don't need to return anything,

52
00:02:32.005 --> 00:02:35.007
so this can be labeled void, the return type

53
00:02:35.007 --> 00:02:39.005
and the name of the method, which will be additem.

54
00:02:39.005 --> 00:02:46.000
Now, this additem will take a parameter of the type T

55
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.003
and we just have to access the list and say,

56
00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:54.000
items.add T.

57
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.008
There we go.

58
00:02:54.008 --> 00:02:55.008
That is all.

59
00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:59.000
So you have defined a method inside the generic class.

60
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.003
And as I said earlier, that this method

61
00:03:01.003 --> 00:03:05.004
will be able to access the T type parameter

62
00:03:05.004 --> 00:03:06.009
that you've defined on the class level.

63
00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:09.005
So it automatically becomes a generic method.

64
00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:10.009
The next method that we have to add

65
00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:13.007
is getting the latest item from the box.

66
00:03:13.007 --> 00:03:17.002
So we'll define a method called getLatestItem.

67
00:03:17.002 --> 00:03:22.007
Let's go on the next line and say public

68
00:03:22.007 --> 00:03:24.000
and let's understand this.

69
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.008
Now you're trying to return the latest item.

70
00:03:26.008 --> 00:03:30.000
So you're trying to return a T from this method.

71
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.000
So the return type will now be T and say getLatestItem.

72
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.004
And what you have to simply do is,

73
00:03:40.004 --> 00:03:45.005
return, take the items variable, like that,

74
00:03:45.005 --> 00:03:51.003
sorry, it should be this.items.get

75
00:03:51.003 --> 00:03:55.005
and I can specify the index like that.

76
00:03:55.005 --> 00:04:00.009
Items.size minus one.

77
00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:03.003
Since you want the latest item from the box

78
00:04:03.003 --> 00:04:05.008
you just have to calculate the size of the items,

79
00:04:05.008 --> 00:04:08.001
subtract one and that will be the index number

80
00:04:08.001 --> 00:04:12.003
you need to provide to the get API, to get the latest item.

81
00:04:12.003 --> 00:04:13.002
So that is all.

82
00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:16.006
So if you note online 17, the return type of this method

83
00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:22.000
is a T because we are trying to get a T out of our box of T.

84
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.007
And then the next step will be to test each of these methods

85
00:04:24.007 --> 00:04:27.006
on the box instances that we already created.

86
00:04:27.006 --> 00:04:28.008
So let's go back

87
00:04:28.008 --> 00:04:32.007
and let's go to our test box generics class.

88
00:04:32.007 --> 00:04:36.006
And now here, let's go ahead and add items first

89
00:04:36.006 --> 00:04:37.007
to the book box.

90
00:04:37.007 --> 00:04:42.004
So I'll say book box.additem

91
00:04:42.004 --> 00:04:44.006
and I'll have to add a book object.

92
00:04:44.006 --> 00:04:47.004
So that'll be new book.

93
00:04:47.004 --> 00:04:49.003
And you already defined a constructor

94
00:04:49.003 --> 00:04:50.008
in a previous demo for the book class,

95
00:04:50.008 --> 00:04:54.009
so we just have to specify the values for the fields now.

96
00:04:54.009 --> 00:05:05.003
So let's say "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"

97
00:05:05.003 --> 00:05:10.006
and this was JK Rowling,

98
00:05:10.006 --> 00:05:16.004
and let's say the weight of that book was 0.5 kilograms.

99
00:05:16.004 --> 00:05:20.000
Okay, let's add another item to the book box.

100
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.005
Add item.

101
00:05:21.005 --> 00:05:24.005
Let's say new book again.

102
00:05:24.005 --> 00:05:29.009
I recently read a book which is called "Deep Work",

103
00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:38.000
it's an excellent book and the author is Cal Newport

104
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.004
and let's say 0.25.

105
00:05:41.004 --> 00:05:46.000
Okay, so we have two books added to the book box.

106
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.002
Let's go ahead and invoke the other method.

107
00:05:50.002 --> 00:05:53.005
So we can just CIS out this to the console,

108
00:05:53.005 --> 00:05:59.000
say, bookbox.getlatestitem.

109
00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.008
So there we go.

110
00:05:59.008 --> 00:06:01.007
We have utilized both the methods on the book box.

111
00:06:01.007 --> 00:06:05.004
We have been able to add items using the ad item method

112
00:06:05.004 --> 00:06:07.007
and we have been able to get the latest book,

113
00:06:07.007 --> 00:06:10.005
using the get latest item method.

114
00:06:10.005 --> 00:06:13.000
We'll do the same thing for the fruit box, as well.

115
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.005
So let's come down here and say fruit box.aditem

116
00:06:18.005 --> 00:06:21.008
and this will be now a fruit object.

117
00:06:21.008 --> 00:06:24.002
So let's go ahead and say name.

118
00:06:24.002 --> 00:06:26.006
So let's say mango.

119
00:06:26.006 --> 00:06:31.001
I am going to say country of origin, let's say India.

120
00:06:31.001 --> 00:06:36.001
Then we want the color, that will be yellow.

121
00:06:36.001 --> 00:06:41.009
And let's say the weight 0.5 again.

122
00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:43.005
Let's add one more.

123
00:06:43.005 --> 00:06:50.008
Fruitbox.additem new fruit,

124
00:06:50.008 --> 00:06:56.003
let's call this banana.

125
00:06:56.003 --> 00:07:01.003
Let's say it originated in Brazil.

126
00:07:01.003 --> 00:07:04.005
Color, let's say green this time.

127
00:07:04.005 --> 00:07:05.004
It's a raw banana.

128
00:07:05.004 --> 00:07:06.002
Let's say.

129
00:07:06.002 --> 00:07:10.007
And then the weight is 0.3.

130
00:07:10.007 --> 00:07:12.002
Okay, so there we go.

131
00:07:12.002 --> 00:07:15.005
We have added fruits to the fruit box, as well.

132
00:07:15.005 --> 00:07:18.005
And let's go ahead and invoke the get latest item

133
00:07:18.005 --> 00:07:19.007
on the fruit box, as well.

134
00:07:19.007 --> 00:07:24.005
So fruitbox.getlatest item.

135
00:07:24.005 --> 00:07:27.005
So now let's go ahead and run this program.

136
00:07:27.005 --> 00:07:29.006
So, after you run this program,

137
00:07:29.006 --> 00:07:32.004
both the books should be added successfully to the book box

138
00:07:32.004 --> 00:07:34.004
and you should be able to get the latest item

139
00:07:34.004 --> 00:07:37.002
out of the book box and the same kind of output

140
00:07:37.002 --> 00:07:39.006
you'll observe even for the fruit box.

141
00:07:39.006 --> 00:07:42.004
So let's run this.

142
00:07:42.004 --> 00:07:45.002
Okay, so now if you observe the output,

143
00:07:45.002 --> 00:07:48.007
if you see the first output is book name, "Deep Work"

144
00:07:48.007 --> 00:07:52.006
and that is the output of the line number eight,

145
00:07:52.006 --> 00:07:55.000
which was the latest item that we added in the book.

146
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.006
So yes, the latest item indeed was the "Deep Work" book

147
00:07:57.006 --> 00:07:59.006
that's what is printed on the console.

148
00:07:59.006 --> 00:08:01.005
And then we also printed the book box

149
00:08:01.005 --> 00:08:03.006
on line number nine in our code.

150
00:08:03.006 --> 00:08:08.002
So that the entire content of the box.

151
00:08:08.002 --> 00:08:12.000
That is both the books, "Harry Potter" and "Deep Work".

152
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Similarly, when it comes to fruit,

153
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.007
the latest item that we added was indeed the banana object,

154
00:08:17.007 --> 00:08:19.007
so that's printed on the console

155
00:08:19.007 --> 00:08:22.000
and we printed the entire fruit box.

156
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.003
So it printed all the items in that box of fruits,

157
00:08:25.003 --> 00:08:27.008
which is mango and banana, both.

158
00:08:27.008 --> 00:08:28.006
There we go.

159
00:08:28.006 --> 00:08:30.007
So we have now generic methods defined

160
00:08:30.007 --> 00:08:32.002
inside the box generic type,

161
00:08:32.002 --> 00:08:34.006
which we have been successfully able to

162
00:08:34.006 --> 00:08:36.000
invoke and test out.
