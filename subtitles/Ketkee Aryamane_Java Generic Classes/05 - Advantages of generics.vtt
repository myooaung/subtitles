00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.007
- [Instructors] Let us now talk about

2
00:00:01.007 --> 00:00:03.003
the advantages of the benefits

3
00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:04.008
of the Generics concept.

4
00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:07.005
The first one is compile and runtime protection.

5
00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:10.002
We know now that Generics always will do

6
00:00:10.002 --> 00:00:12.001
the type safety checks

7
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:14.007
at the compilation stage itself.

8
00:00:14.007 --> 00:00:16.009
These type safe checks will then avoid

9
00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:18.002
all the potential problems

10
00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:20.002
that you encounter at runtime.

11
00:00:20.002 --> 00:00:23.000
So it gives you compile and runtime protection.

12
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.002
Secondly, you do not have to do any kind

13
00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:26.005
of explicit casting

14
00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:28.002
in order to process your values

15
00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:29.008
inside the Generics code.

16
00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:31.009
The compiler will do that implicit casting

17
00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:32.007
for you.

18
00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:35.003
This essentially means that you do not introduce

19
00:00:35.003 --> 00:00:37.000
any kind of clutter,

20
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.001
and your code is always clean and robust.

21
00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:43.005
Lastly, Generics have a way to define operations

22
00:00:43.005 --> 00:00:44.005
that can be performed

23
00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:46.002
on a varied number of types.

24
00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:48.008
This essentially will give you a chance

25
00:00:48.008 --> 00:00:51.001
to develop generic algorithms.

26
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:53.001
Generics is a very powerful feature

27
00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:54.004
in the Java language.

28
00:00:54.004 --> 00:00:56.005
Ensure that you always write your code

29
00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:57.000
with Generics.
