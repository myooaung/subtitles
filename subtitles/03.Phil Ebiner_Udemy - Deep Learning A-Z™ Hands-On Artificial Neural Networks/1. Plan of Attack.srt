00:00:00,530  -->  00:00:01,840
<v Instructor>Hello, and welcome back</v>
2

2

00:00:01,840  -->  00:00:03,180
to the course of deep learning.
3

3

00:00:03,180  -->  00:00:06,080
today were starting the section on auto encoders,
4

4

00:00:06,080  -->  00:00:09,180
so how are we going to tackle this topic?
5

5

00:00:09,180  -->  00:00:11,330
Well in this section will learn the following,
6

6

00:00:11,330  -->  00:00:12,940
auto encoders what are they,
7

7

00:00:12,940  -->  00:00:16,110
what is the architecture and how do they work.
8

8

00:00:16,110  -->  00:00:18,080
We'll talk about training of an auto encoder
9

9

00:00:18,080  -->  00:00:19,900
and the steps that go into that.
10

10

00:00:19,900  -->  00:00:22,200
will talk about a situation where
11

11

00:00:22,200  -->  00:00:25,260
we have over complete hidden layers in an auto encoder.
12

12

00:00:25,260  -->  00:00:27,840
And then we'll talk about three regularization techniques,
13

13

00:00:27,840  -->  00:00:30,040
which are used in order
14

14

00:00:30,040  -->  00:00:32,230
to combat some problems that arise there,
15

15

00:00:32,230  -->  00:00:35,356
and these techniques are sparse auto encoders,
16

16

00:00:35,356  -->  00:00:38,880
de-noising auto encoders and contractive auto encoders.
17

17

00:00:38,880  -->  00:00:41,940
Then we will talk about stacked auto encoders,
18

18

00:00:41,940  -->  00:00:44,800
and will finish off with deep auto encoders.
19

19

00:00:44,800  -->  00:00:46,930
And what I wanted to mention here is that
20

20

00:00:46,930  -->  00:00:48,900
the first part of this section
21

21

00:00:48,900  -->  00:00:51,260
will be quite straightforward,
22

22

00:00:51,260  -->  00:00:52,250
will be very simple
23

23

00:00:52,250  -->  00:00:54,470
because of all the things we've already learned
24

24

00:00:54,470  -->  00:00:55,303
in this course,
25

25

00:00:55,303  -->  00:00:59,380
so you'll see that will breeze through this auto encoders
26

26

00:00:59,380  -->  00:01:03,530
and you will be able to very quickly get up to speed
27

27

00:01:03,530  -->  00:01:04,850
with was going on.
28

28

00:01:04,850  -->  00:01:08,300
And then the final part of the section,
29

29

00:01:08,300  -->  00:01:10,400
starting from over complete hidden layers
30

30

00:01:10,400  -->  00:01:12,800
and all the way to deep auto encoders,
31

31

00:01:12,800  -->  00:01:16,970
and these tutorials are more of a high level overview
32

32

00:01:16,970  -->  00:01:18,010
as you can see there's lots
33

33

00:01:18,010  -->  00:01:21,080
of different variations over complete hidden layers,
34

34

00:01:21,080  -->  00:01:23,360
sparse, de-noising, contractor, stacked and deep
35

35

00:01:23,360  -->  00:01:25,750
there's lots of different variations of auto encoders
36

36

00:01:25,750  -->  00:01:27,300
and instead of going into depth
37

37

00:01:27,300  -->  00:01:29,630
on one or two of these specific topics,
38

38

00:01:29,630  -->  00:01:31,430
we decided to rather give you
39

39

00:01:31,430  -->  00:01:35,210
a quick introduction to each one of these variations,
40

40

00:01:35,210  -->  00:01:36,990
are these topics out of auto encoders
41

41

00:01:36,990  -->  00:01:40,430
and then at least you'll be familiar with the terms
42

42

00:01:40,430  -->  00:01:44,120
and at least you will know what is the reference to
43

43

00:01:44,120  -->  00:01:45,040
when you hear them
44

44

00:01:45,040  -->  00:01:48,000
or when you're encountering them in literature
45

45

00:01:48,000  -->  00:01:50,040
and then whenever you decide
46

46

00:01:50,040  -->  00:01:51,630
that you need to go into depth on one
47

47

00:01:51,630  -->  00:01:53,210
or several of these topics,
48

48

00:01:53,210  -->  00:01:54,760
for each one of these tutorials,
49

49

00:01:54,760  -->  00:01:56,810
we going to provide additional reading
50

50

00:01:56,810  -->  00:01:58,950
which you can look into,
51

51

00:01:58,950  -->  00:02:01,330
find out more information
52

52

00:02:01,330  -->  00:02:04,260
and up-skill yourself on that specific topic.
53

53

00:02:04,260  -->  00:02:06,270
So that's how this section is going to be structured,
54

54

00:02:06,270  -->  00:02:07,670
can't wait to get started
55

55

00:02:07,670  -->  00:02:09,660
and I look forward to seeing in the first tutorial.
56

56

00:02:09,660  -->  00:02:11,623
Until, then enjoy deep learning.
