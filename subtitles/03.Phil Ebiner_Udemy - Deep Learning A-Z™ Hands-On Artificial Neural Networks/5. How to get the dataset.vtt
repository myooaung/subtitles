<v Instructor>Hello, and welcome back</v>
2

2

00:00:01.153  -->  00:00:02.770
to the course on Deep Learning.
3

3

00:00:02.770  -->  00:00:04.810
In today's tutorial we're going to see where
4

4

00:00:04.810  -->  00:00:07.350
you can get all the materials and datasets
5

5

00:00:07.350  -->  00:00:08.750
for this course.
6

6

00:00:08.750  -->  00:00:09.930
So in order to get the datasets,
7

7

00:00:09.930  -->  00:00:14.800
you need to go to www.superdatascience.com/deep-learning
8

8

00:00:15.750  -->  00:00:17.190
and then if you scroll down here,
9

9

00:00:17.190  -->  00:00:20.540
you will see that everything is prepared here for you.
10

10

00:00:20.540  -->  00:00:22.290
So first of all you need to download
11

11

00:00:22.290  -->  00:00:24.980
the Deep Learning A-Z Course Folder Template.
12

12

00:00:24.980  -->  00:00:27.520
So it's an empty set of folders,
13

13

00:00:27.520  -->  00:00:29.920
but they're in the correct hierarchical structure
14

14

00:00:29.920  -->  00:00:32.380
which will allow you to better be prepared
15

15

00:00:32.380  -->  00:00:34.470
for the tutorials in the course.
16

16

00:00:34.470  -->  00:00:36.540
And then, when you get to a certain part of the course,
17

17

00:00:36.540  -->  00:00:38.280
you just need to download the dataset
18

18

00:00:38.280  -->  00:00:39.113
for that part.
19

19

00:00:39.113  -->  00:00:41.550
For instance, in Part 1, Artificial Neural Networks,
20

20

00:00:41.550  -->  00:00:43.130
you just download this dataset,
21

21

00:00:43.130  -->  00:00:46.680
you unzip the file into your folder
22

22

00:00:46.680  -->  00:00:48.740
which you've downloaded, and there you will have
23

23

00:00:48.740  -->  00:00:52.000
all of the items and all of the data
24

24

00:00:52.000  -->  00:00:54.190
that you will require to go through the tutorials
25

25

00:00:54.190  -->  00:00:55.120
in that part.
26

26

00:00:55.120  -->  00:00:56.880
And then you do the same thing for the next part
27

27

00:00:56.880  -->  00:00:57.910
and so on.
28

28

00:00:57.910  -->  00:01:00.020
And more over here, you'll find all of
29

29

00:01:00.020  -->  00:01:01.650
the additional reading which we mentioned
30

30

00:01:01.650  -->  00:01:03.080
in the intuition tutorials,
31

31

00:01:03.080  -->  00:01:05.640
so the dataset is for the practical tutorials,
32

32

00:01:05.640  -->  00:01:10.010
the additional reading is all the papers and
33

33

00:01:10.010  -->  00:01:11.870
all the blog posts that we mentioned
34

34

00:01:11.870  -->  00:01:14.470
through the intuition tutorials and it's just easier
35

35

00:01:14.470  -->  00:01:16.170
for you to click through them here
36

36

00:01:16.170  -->  00:01:18.150
rather than having to Google for them
37

37

00:01:18.150  -->  00:01:21.500
or type up their URLs.
38

38

00:01:21.500  -->  00:01:23.260
So there we go, that's where you get the datasets
39

39

00:01:23.260  -->  00:01:25.950
and all the supporting materials for this course.
40

40

00:01:25.950  -->  00:01:27.680
We can't wait to see you throughout these tutorials,
41

41

00:01:27.680  -->  00:01:29.650
it's gonna be lots of fun and exciting,
42

42

00:01:29.650  -->  00:01:32.003
and until next time, enjoy deep learning!
