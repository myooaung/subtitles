<v Tutor>A simple Linear Regression</v>
2

2

00:00:04,080  -->  00:00:05,480
is basically this formula,
3

3

00:00:05,480  -->  00:00:08,990
where Y equals B zero plus B one times X
4

4

00:00:08,990  -->  00:00:10,580
and you might recognize this formula
5

5

00:00:10,580  -->  00:00:12,370
from back in high school.
6

6

00:00:12,370  -->  00:00:14,560
It's just a formula where a trend line
7

7

00:00:14,560  -->  00:00:16,660
or a slope
8

8

00:00:16,660  -->  00:00:20,210
sloped line on a X-Y axis.
9

9

00:00:20,210  -->  00:00:23,710
And let's go through these variables
10

10

00:00:23,710  -->  00:00:26,960
and coefficients one by one.
11

11

00:00:26,960  -->  00:00:29,570
So this is the dependent variable.
12

12

00:00:29,570  -->  00:00:32,570
The dependent variable is something you're trying to explain
13

13

00:00:33,685  -->  00:00:37,490
For instance how does a person's salary change
14

14

00:00:37,490  -->  00:00:39,020
with the years of experience that he has,
15

15

00:00:39,020  -->  00:00:42,420
so in that case Y would be the dependent variable.
16

16

00:00:42,420  -->  00:00:46,900
Or what grade does a student get depending on how much time
17

17

00:00:46,900  -->  00:00:48,490
he's put into studying.
18

18

00:00:48,490  -->  00:00:50,430
In that case Y would be the dependent variable.
19

19

00:00:50,430  -->  00:00:53,045
So something that you're trying to understand
20

20

00:00:53,045  -->  00:00:56,390
how it depends on something else.
21

21

00:00:56,390  -->  00:00:58,530
X is your independent variable.
22

22

00:00:58,530  -->  00:01:00,010
In this case in the simple Linear Regression
23

23

00:01:00,010  -->  00:01:01,590
we only have one independent variable,
24

24

00:01:01,590  -->  00:01:04,440
so we don't even have to call X one we could just call it X.
25

25

00:01:04,440  -->  00:01:09,100
And this is the variable that is, you're assuming
26

26

00:01:09,100  -->  00:01:11,270
that it is causing the dependent variable to change
27

27

00:01:11,270  -->  00:01:13,075
or as we will learn further,
28

28

00:01:13,075  -->  00:01:15,240
sometimes that independent variable
29

29

00:01:15,240  -->  00:01:16,539
might not be a direct cause and effect
30

30

00:01:16,539  -->  00:01:19,410
but still, there might be an implied association
31

31

00:01:19,410  -->  00:01:20,470
between the two.
32

32

00:01:20,470  -->  00:01:24,020
And in that case you're trying to figure out
33

33

00:01:24,020  -->  00:01:25,600
this association
34

34

00:01:25,600  -->  00:01:30,540
Then B one is coefficient for the independent variable
35

35

00:01:30,540  -->  00:01:35,540
and it kind of says how the effect or how a change in X one
36

36

00:01:36,370  -->  00:01:39,540
a unit change in X one and we'll be talking about this a lot
37

37

00:01:39,540  -->  00:01:40,750
Unit Changes.
38

38

00:01:40,750  -->  00:01:44,510
A unit change in X one, how that affects a unit change in Y.
39

39

00:01:44,510  -->  00:01:48,530
So it's kind of, think of it as the translator
40

40

00:01:48,530  -->  00:01:52,760
or the multiplier, something like that that connects the two
41

41

00:01:52,760  -->  00:01:56,102
the connector between Y and X one, so you can't just say,
42

42

00:01:56,102  -->  00:01:58,910
you can't always say X one is directly proportional
43

43

00:01:58,910  -->  00:02:00,400
there is,
44

44

00:02:00,400  -->  00:02:04,850
well you can't just say Y, the change in X is always equal
45

45

00:02:04,850  -->  00:02:05,683
to the chge in Y.
46

46

00:02:05,683  -->  00:02:07,700
There might be this coefficient of proportion
47

47

00:02:07,700  -->  00:02:12,450
to which proportion that change is inflated or deflated.
48

48

00:02:12,450  -->  00:02:15,274
And B zero is a constant so it's a constant term.
49

49

00:02:15,274  -->  00:02:19,030
And we'll talk about the constant just in a few seconds.
50

50

00:02:19,030  -->  00:02:21,130
So now let's look at the Simple Linear Regression
51

51

00:02:21,130  -->  00:02:22,790
because it's the easiest one to discuss,
52

52

00:02:22,790  -->  00:02:26,660
it's pretty straight forward you can visualize it quite well
53

53

00:02:26,660  -->  00:02:29,600
So here we've got the Y and X axis.
54

54

00:02:29,600  -->  00:02:31,180
Let's look at that specific example
55

55

00:02:31,180  -->  00:02:32,770
where we have Experience and Salary.
56

56

00:02:32,770  -->  00:02:34,910
So Experience is gonna be our horizontal axis,
57

57

00:02:34,910  -->  00:02:36,800
Salary is our vertical axis.
58

58

00:02:36,800  -->  00:02:39,704
And we wanna understand how people's salary
59

59

00:02:39,704  -->  00:02:41,780
depends on their experience.
60

60

00:02:41,780  -->  00:02:43,430
Well what we would do in Regression,
61

61

00:02:43,430  -->  00:02:44,900
is we don't just come up with a theory,
62

62

00:02:44,900  -->  00:02:48,210
we look at the evidence, we look at the live hard facts.
63

63

00:02:48,210  -->  00:02:50,700
So here are some observations we've had
64

64

00:02:50,700  -->  00:02:51,930
So in a certain company,
65

65

00:02:51,930  -->  00:02:55,380
this is how salaries are distributed among people
66

66

00:02:55,380  -->  00:02:57,760
who have different levels of experience.
67

67

00:02:57,760  -->  00:02:59,750
And what a Regression does is,
68

68

00:02:59,750  -->  00:03:01,700
so that's the formula for Regression,
69

69

00:03:01,700  -->  00:03:04,670
in our case it will change to Salary equals B zero
70

70

00:03:04,670  -->  00:03:06,750
plus B one times Experience.
71

71

00:03:06,750  -->  00:03:09,580
And what that essentially means is just putting a line
72

72

00:03:09,580  -->  00:03:12,860
through your chart that best fits this data.
73

73

00:03:12,860  -->  00:03:15,510
And we'll talk about best fitting in the next tutorial
74

74

00:03:15,510  -->  00:03:17,178
when we're talking about Ordinary Least Squares,
75

75

00:03:17,178  -->  00:03:21,880
but for now this is a line that best fits this data
76

76

00:03:21,880  -->  00:03:22,870
and it even looks like it, right.
77

77

00:03:22,870  -->  00:03:24,700
So I don't--
78

78

00:03:24,700  -->  00:03:27,720
it's quite hard to draw a line that fits this data better
79

79

00:03:27,720  -->  00:03:29,390
and the assumption here is it's impossible
80

80

00:03:29,390  -->  00:03:32,370
this is the best line that approximates this data.
81

81

00:03:32,370  -->  00:03:33,860
What does that mean?
82

82

00:03:33,860  -->  00:03:36,460
Well we'll talk about that in the next tutorial once again.
83

83

00:03:36,460  -->  00:03:41,460
For now let's focus on the coefficients and the constant.
84

84

00:03:41,830  -->  00:03:43,920
So what does the constant mean here?
85

85

00:03:43,920  -->  00:03:46,257
Well the constant actually means
86

86

00:03:46,257  -->  00:03:50,130
the point where the line crosses the vertical axis.
87

87

00:03:50,130  -->  00:03:52,310
And let's say it's thirty thousand dollars,
88

88

00:03:52,310  -->  00:03:53,143
what does that mean?
89

89

00:03:53,143  -->  00:03:55,950
Well it means that when experience is zero,
90

90

00:03:55,950  -->  00:03:58,640
so when, as you see on the horizontal axis,
91

91

00:03:58,640  -->  00:04:01,330
when experience is at zero then in the formula on the right
92

92

00:04:01,330  -->  00:04:05,190
you cans see that the second part; B one times Experience
93

93

00:04:05,190  -->  00:04:06,023
becomes zero.
94

94

00:04:06,023  -->  00:04:08,030
So Salary equals B zero.
95

95

00:04:08,030  -->  00:04:11,590
That means that Salary will equal to thirty thousand dollars
96

96

00:04:11,590  -->  00:04:13,140
when a person has no experience.
97

97

00:04:13,140  -->  00:04:15,520
So as soon as somebody is fresh from university
98

98

00:04:15,520  -->  00:04:18,750
and joins this company, most likely they will have a salary
99

99

00:04:18,750  -->  00:04:20,402
about thirty thousand dollars.
100

100

00:04:20,402  -->  00:04:23,060
There will be some Confidence Intervals there
101

101

00:04:23,060  -->  00:04:25,350
but we won't go into that right now.
102

102

00:04:25,350  -->  00:04:27,740
Just we can say that according to this model,
103

103

00:04:27,740  -->  00:04:30,270
that person will be probably getting paid
104

104

00:04:30,270  -->  00:04:31,710
thirty thousand dollars.
105

105

00:04:31,710  -->  00:04:33,050
Now what is B one?
106

106

00:04:33,050  -->  00:04:35,773
B one is the slope of the line and,
107

107

00:04:36,690  -->  00:04:40,200
so the steeper the line, the more you get,
108

108

00:04:40,200  -->  00:04:42,950
more money you get per extra year of experience.
109

109

00:04:42,950  -->  00:04:45,530
Let's look at this in this particular example.
110

110

00:04:45,530  -->  00:04:47,223
Let's say somebody went from,
111

111

00:04:48,490  -->  00:04:50,990
I dunno, maybe four to five years of experience, right.
112

112

00:04:50,990  -->  00:04:54,310
So then to understand how he's salary will increase,
113

113

00:04:54,310  -->  00:04:56,220
you have to project this onto the line,
114

114

00:04:56,220  -->  00:04:59,730
then project that onto the salary axis.
115

115

00:04:59,730  -->  00:05:03,200
And you can see that here, for one year experience
116

116

00:05:03,200  -->  00:05:06,251
the person will get an extra ten thousand dollars
117

117

00:05:06,251  -->  00:05:07,670
on top of his salary.
118

118

00:05:07,670  -->  00:05:12,150
So if the coefficient B one is less,
119

119

00:05:12,150  -->  00:05:13,300
then the slope will be less
120

120

00:05:13,300  -->  00:05:15,490
and that means the salary increase will be less
121

121

00:05:15,490  -->  00:05:17,090
per every year of experience.
122

122

00:05:17,090  -->  00:05:21,067
If the slope is greater then that means the experience
123

123

00:05:22,470  -->  00:05:26,220
will yield a more increase in Salary.
124

124

00:05:26,220  -->  00:05:27,300
And that's pretty much it,
125

125

00:05:27,300  -->  00:05:29,460
that's how a Simple Linear Regression works.
126

126

00:05:29,460  -->  00:05:32,900
So the core goal here is that we're not just drawing a line
127

127

00:05:32,900  -->  00:05:36,010
theoretically that we came up with somehow.
128

128

00:05:36,010  -->  00:05:39,540
We're actually using observations that we have
129

129

00:05:39,540  -->  00:05:41,290
to find the best fitting line.
130

130

00:05:41,290  -->  00:05:44,050
And what a best fitting line is, we'll talk about that
131

131

00:05:44,050  -->  00:05:45,223
in the next tutorial.
