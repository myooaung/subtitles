1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.770
All right, everybody, welcome back, so we're going to do is start coding up the static templates

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.720
of our bootstrap to WordPress theme.

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.360
So real simple HTML access, maybe a little bit of JavaScript, but mostly just keep it real simple.

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.490
Put in some plug ins there, like bootstrap.

5
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.690
You know, jQuery.

6
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.800
You know the deal.

7
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.010
So let's kind of create a new folder here on our desktop.

8
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:27.600
Call it be two W two for bootstrapped WordPress to get it right or whatever the heck you want.

9
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.970
You could just be like my site or another thing or whatever, right?

10
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.690
So I'm just going to go B to you two.

11
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.550
And let's just call this student just for my sake.

12
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.080
I'm calling it that, and we're going to open that up in your favorite code editor of Choice.

13
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.640
Whatever you choose, I'm cool with visual, whatever this or that.

14
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.900
Hack it, hack wiki.

15
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.280
I don't know whatever you use.

16
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.570
I use Adam these days.

17
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.490
Atom Atom Dot, I oh, very cool.

18
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.910
They call it the hackable text editor.

19
00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.590
So if you want to really try and break your code editor in waste a lot of time, you're not.

20
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.610
You're totally welcome to.

21
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.690
I don't.

22
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.310
I just use it as a code editor because it's it's good.

23
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.420
OK, so let's open a new folder or new project in here at a project folder, and we're going to choose

24
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.760
on the desktop here.

25
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.800
UW to student.

26
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.550
That's the one I chose.

27
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.540
Whatever you call it, whatever is, whatever you want to do, you can just do whatever you want.

28
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.660
And I'm also going to put the final here as well so that I have a reference to see, you know, what

29
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.410
we're going to make.

30
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:32.370
All right.

31
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.590
So under your version, your student version here, let's create a new file and an Adam.

32
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.150
I guess all you have to do is press a cool and then just type in indexed on each HTML.

33
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.320
Here we go.

34
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.220
We've got our index file.

35
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.790
Now what?

36
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.530
We're going to do something a little different here on the site itself.

37
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.530
We're not actually going to like code up the index file.

38
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.860
So if I go to like bootstrap to WordPress.com, like this is the home page, but we're not actually

39
00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.760
going to code this up because we're going to build this in elementary, but we're essentially going

40
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.410
to do is build the theme.

41
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.630
So it doesn't have to be the literal website.

42
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.340
So when you design and build sites for clients or yourself, you don't have to build the literal websites.

43
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.720
You just need to make sure all the elements, all the styles on the layouts are available so that you

44
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.850
can use them in your site as you're as you're, you know, dragging and dropping with Alimentare and

45
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:21.330
things like that.

46
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.040
So we're not actually going to code this up.

47
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.820
We're actually just going to create an index file and we're actually just going to code.

48
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.680
Let's see what we got here.

49
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.800
The index is just going to be the like the home, the blog list, I believe.

50
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.400
Yeah.

51
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:42.900
So the index is just going to literally be this and this will be the, you know, the blog, the blog

52
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:43.530
index page.

53
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.930
But we won't have this be the home page on the actual site.

54
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.840
So we're just going to start there and just kind of code this up.

55
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.130
So let's get in there.

56
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.480
Let's head over to our code editor.

57
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.260
I got Adam going and we're going to do the usual stuff here.

58
00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:02.070
Now I'm obviously I'm going to provide all these downloads so that you can just have everything available

59
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.440
to download so that you don't have to, you know, code out every single line if you don't want to.

60
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.200
But you're obviously more than welcome to follow along code along because that's that's always fun.

61
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.200
It's always fun learning it that way.

62
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:21.360
So let's get started by writing out our doc type in Adam, just type HTML and and tab, and then it

63
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.910
will just kind of right this shell out for you.

64
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.840
And that's totally fine.

65
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.210
And we're going to just start might as well give it a title.

66
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.860
Let's call it bootstrap to WordPress 2.0, whatever you want for the title.

67
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.740
And then let's get started.

68
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:43.860
I'm just going to write the what goes into the head tag here and feel free to just pause and write up

69
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:44.370
what I wrote.

70
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.020
I don't need to speak every single line.

71
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.660
So here we go.

72
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.460
And we added this viewport meta tag here.

73
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.830
Just for those of you who don't know that so that we can make this thing responsive and the viewport

74
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.780
will scale to the size of the device width.

75
00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.670
That's what this says.

76
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.430
You don't have to know exactly what it means to know that it works.

77
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.770
Now this one, the link rel style sheets we're going to, we're going to actually create a folder shortly

78
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.550
called assets and then CC and then put bootstrap in there.

79
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.780
That's how we're going to put that.

80
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:13.740
We'll put that there in a moment.

81
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.550
We're also going to put flat icons because we're going to use those in the design.

82
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:21.150
So we're going to download that, throw it in our assets folder under Font folder.

83
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:27.420
And then we've got our usual style dot CSC, which is just going to sit in the in the just kind of the

84
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.200
root folder here.

85
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.510
All right.

86
00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.450
So we got that another thing we're going to do is we're going to add some Google Fonts now.

87
00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.660
The Google font that I'm going to use is the entire font to show you how to download that in just a

88
00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:42.110
sec here.

89
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.110
But let's first add a new folder.

90
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:50.300
So in Adam, Shift A is a quick way of creating a new folder, and we're going to call that assets.

91
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.070
And then in that, we're going to create another folder called CSC.

92
00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.380
And then in the assets folder, we're also going to create another folder called font.

93
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.980
Hey, so inner assets Holder was UFC assassin font great.

94
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:12.690
So in that what we're going to do is we're going to add bootstrap, we're going to add Vlad Icon also

95
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:13.600
in our root folder.

96
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.720
Let's create a new file that's just a in atom for a new file.

97
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.290
And we're just going to call it style that CSC and that's where our styles are going to sit.

98
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.230
So let's see, Styles loses this cool.

99
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.230
So now let's go ahead and throw our entire font family in there.

100
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.940
So a couple of ways you could do it.

101
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:41.970
You can go to our Sam asked me, so readers must stop me and you can you can download it this way or

102
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.030
Google Fonts pretty standard and just look for inter type and enter.

103
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.570
Here it is.

104
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.230
You can download it here to your machine, or we can use it as a web font.

105
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.930
We're just going to use which ones are my use in here.

106
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.050
We've got four or five six seven eight hundred.

107
00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:59.500
OK, so we want four five six seven eight hundred.

108
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.440
Those font weights shows that everyone you want.

109
00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.040
I don't care.

110
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.770
It's up to you.

111
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:03.750
This is your choice.

112
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.720
And I just I, my code told me to do this.

113
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.710
So that's what it is.

114
00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.070
I'm going to put in there, and all you need to do is just copy this down over here.

115
00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:17.370
You see that copy that you can use import in your styles if you want, like import it in your in your

116
00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.710
HTML or you can use link in your HTML.

117
00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.430
And then this is the case you use to specify the font family.

118
00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:24.810
So I'm just going to do this.

119
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:25.390
Copy that?

120
00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:29.590
Go to our code editor editor and paste it.

121
00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:30.390
Look at that.

122
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.350
Clean it up.

123
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.230
That's looking very nice and perfect.

124
00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:35.430
So there we go.

125
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.760
We've got our head kind of sorted out there.

126
00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:38.550
Got our head straight.

127
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:43.620
OK, now because I said, we're going to be coding up the blog.

128
00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.350
Remember that we're going to we're going to use this index as the blog index.

129
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:53.730
And then later on, we'll actually build our home page in elementary.

130
00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:58.290
One other thing that we should make sure that we do is get bootstrap and flat icon as well.

131
00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.270
So that'll be under our assets.

132
00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.370
We're going to do just the old fashioned way.

133
00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:07.560
No fancy ways and was a lot of people who like to use terminal and use like a bunch of different things

134
00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.340
and blah blah blah.

135
00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:17.790
This is the way that just the everyday kind of lay coder layperson coder lay coder should do it.

136
00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.920
Just Google Bootstrap and.

137
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:22.760
Just download it, it's so easy.

138
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.650
It's just as simple as that.

139
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.200
And what we're going to do is just pick, pick your poison.

140
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.040
How do you want to do it?

141
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.800
You can do it via a CD, and I like CD ends.

142
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.850
But then, you know, people like, you know, you can also put it right into your project.

143
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.240
So what we can do is we can download the source files.

144
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.060
You can download the compile jazz and see us as it's up to you.

145
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.120
What I'm going to do is actually just download the compiled CSC.

146
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:44.600
And yes.

147
00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:45.680
So here it is here.

148
00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:49.410
So SJS, we don't really need all of this.

149
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:54.350
Like, I'm just going to grab the bootstrap minidress and the bootstrap.

150
00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:57.500
Let's see.

151
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:02.690
Yeah, I mean, I think that's I'm I'm cool with that bootstrap men ss and if we need anything, if

152
00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:04.700
something breaks, we can always just throw it all in there.

153
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:07.390
So we're going to grab bootstrap mendacious.

154
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:11.900
Yes, you could drag it into your assets folder and also just go like this assets.

155
00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:14.090
We got access.

156
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.590
So which I'm in?

157
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:17.030
Throw it in the c ss.

158
00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:17.600
There it is.

159
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:24.920
And let's also grab the we're going to need the bootstrap J.S..

160
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.530
So that was another thing that we need to make sure that we have.

161
00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.200
I don't think I added it to the site yet.

162
00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:34.180
Usually, yeah, this is the problem, OK, we need to add our scripts as well.

163
00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:38.830
So before the closing body tag, that's where you put your scripts because you want your scripts to

164
00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:39.460
load last.

165
00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:44.110
Because sometimes scripts can take a while and it can make your website take a little bit longer to

166
00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:44.890
appear.

167
00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:46.530
And that's a bad user experience.

168
00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:47.530
So insider scripts?

169
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:50.350
It's going to copy all three of them.

170
00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:51.040
Paste them in.

171
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:56.050
So just script assets, just bootstrap men as it's just jQuery.

172
00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:01.840
And then main script is the one that we're going to use if we need to code any of our own JavaScript

173
00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:02.770
or jQuery.

174
00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:07.660
So we're going to add a new folder under assets, and that's going to be Jass.

175
00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:08.710
There it is.

176
00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:13.030
And so let's start by dragging our bootstrap.

177
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:14.820
J.S..

178
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:21.570
Into I think it's bootstraps as much, I mean as a bootstrap.

179
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.160
Men.

180
00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.300
Do I not have much time in here?

181
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:30.420
Oh, you probably saw before I saw this.

182
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:37.800
So this is a jazz file, not a zoo, I'll drag that into your jazz folder and then go to your CC bootstrap

183
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.570
men CC.

184
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.050
And throw that into your CSC folder.

185
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:47.160
Now, Bootstrap has all these other things like grid and.

186
00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:52.370
And a whole bunch of things here, we may need those, we may not.

187
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.500
We're just going to leave that for now and we'll try it as we go.

188
00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:58.310
If something's not working, we'll fix it as we go, because that's that's my style.

189
00:09:58.730 --> 00:09:59.120
All right.

190
00:09:59.300 --> 00:09:59.900
What do we need now?

191
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.550
Any jury at this time?

192
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:03.810
Three point six point zero is what the code says.

193
00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:05.780
Let's see what Jan has in store for us.

194
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:09.080
Go to Jake recom you go download.

195
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:14.520
And then just choose the way you want to do it, you can do ampm, jaan Bauer, blah blah blah blah

196
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:14.940
blah.

197
00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:18.540
I like just straight up downloading it or using a CD.

198
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:23.880
And where are we at code Takeaway.com so you can download it?

199
00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:28.410
Or you can just use the CNS as a CD ends if you're to click it like slim minified.

200
00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:29.580
You can do that.

201
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:31.410
Let's see where we can download it.

202
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.060
All right here.

203
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:34.800
So download the compressed production jQuery 3.6.

204
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.100
Meanwhile, I'm fine with that.

205
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.650
So just real small file.

206
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:39.120
Copy that.

207
00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.320
It looks crazy.

208
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:41.130
Just copy it.

209
00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:48.440
So what we're going to do is create a new file under J.S. and that's going to be jQuery Dash three point

210
00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:56.880
six point O Dot Minaj's bleeding call whatever you want, but that's the title of it in the script tag

211
00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:57.120
there.

212
00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.130
Paste it in Save.

213
00:10:59.460 --> 00:10:59.760
OK.

214
00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:05.610
I like to test to see if jQuery is working by just like really quick going into your wherever you want

215
00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:06.720
in your email file here.

216
00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.610
We're going to add a script tag.

217
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.400
I just like you can do console, but I just like doing alert.

218
00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.690
Hello.

219
00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:18.840
There you go, first thing, Lou, take that out because you don't want that.

220
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:24.210
Now, you know, a more refined developer would say console, not log and then do that.

221
00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:29.480
And then what you could do is head over to your page again, refresh and then inspect.

222
00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:34.410
Go to console and then you can see, Hey Lou, right there.

223
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:35.790
So cool.

224
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:36.840
Let's see.

225
00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.880
What issues do we have here?

226
00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:38.880
We don't have flat icons.

227
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:39.840
Of course we need to get that.

228
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.040
We don't have the main script.

229
00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:47.180
Robin, a few issues here with OK.

230
00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:49.200
My job, blah blah blah blah blah.

231
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.570
OK, so let's go back here.

232
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:53.700
Get rid of the script.

233
00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:57.530
Let's just kind of keep chugging along here, and then we'll deal with issues as we go.

234
00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:03.570
So one of the things I want to do is interject create a new file called main dash scripts such as,

235
00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:08.630
you can call it, whatever I usually call it script main, not script is fine.

236
00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.620
You can call it like, I doesn't matter.

237
00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:11.370
It really doesn't matter.

238
00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:13.920
But, you know, keep it so that it makes sense.

239
00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:17.880
If you're sharing your code with somebody else, you have a developer working with you.

240
00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:24.960
You know, then don't call this like, you know, my fuzzy pets or something like that.

241
00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:26.250
I might be a little weird.

242
00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:27.570
Main script is fine.

243
00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:29.310
Here it is.

244
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:31.980
We're not going to do anything right now with that.

245
00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:34.290
OK, so here we go.

246
00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:34.940
We've got this.

247
00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:36.360
There's nothing in there so far.

248
00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.200
One more thing we needed to do just to get her project ready.

249
00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:42.000
Let's call this lesson the get our project ready.

250
00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:44.950
Lesson and then we'll carry on in another video here.

251
00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.180
So we're almost done getting our project ready.

252
00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:48.480
We need under font.

253
00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:51.390
We need those flat icons.

254
00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:52.230
So let's do that.

255
00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:53.100
All right.

256
00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:56.220
So icon, flight icon, dot com slash icon font.

257
00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:56.880
That's what we want.

258
00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:04.920
So what you can kind of do is I think you can like, create your own collection to to to to choose all

259
00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.350
of what you want and then download the icon font.

260
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:12.180
A copy to your CSO keeps it kind of lightweight so you don't have all the fonts.

261
00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:13.980
I think that's kind of the idea here.

262
00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:22.170
So a couple of ways we can go about doing this is we can choose your whole collection here if you want

263
00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:27.360
to do that or if we want to keep it really simple because I already have it in my folder, my final

264
00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.450
folder in the final folder under assets.

265
00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:32.280
CSC, sorry assets.

266
00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:32.850
Fonts.

267
00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:40.490
You can just grab this like everything in the fine folder and just drop it into yours because.

268
00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:43.990
We already have a collection of funds that we're using here.

269
00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:51.090
And then this is, you know, this is what you need to put in here, so we're using these in icon fonts.

270
00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:58.350
So instead of going hunting around on the video and finding these, I already have them done so just

271
00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:00.650
grab them in the final folder under font.

272
00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:06.990
Grab everything in here and make a copy of it in your student here.

273
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:11.790
Assets under font to make a copy of all this, I'm just going to copy this over into here.

274
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:18.750
Like that, and then I think we should be good here, so we got our flat icon Nazi SS and we're good

275
00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:19.440
to go.

276
00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.920
So right now, that is kind of our project.

277
00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:24.000
We set up our project.

278
00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:25.970
Quick, quick, quick review.

279
00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:28.530
We've got our B to W two student folder.

280
00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:30.690
You can download the final one if you wish.

281
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:36.420
And we've got our assets folder and index file, a style that suggests on our index file, we got the

282
00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:37.650
basic skeleton here.

283
00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:46.410
We got some meditating, some links to bootstrap flat icon and Google Fonts for the Enter Font family.

284
00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.570
And then we've got our bootstrap.

285
00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:56.350
J.S. Jay Cary and a main script folder, I mean, script file rather for a jQuery JavaScript assets

286
00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:58.810
folder right here CSC, Font and Jass.

287
00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:04.540
Here's the CSC files and the font and the JSE, never mind.

288
00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:10.270
If you see this does underscore store files just ahead and file every folder has hidden files on your

289
00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:10.690
machine.

290
00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:15.370
I just happen to have them showing for some reason, but never mind that you don't need to add that.

291
00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.670
That's it for this session of the project.

292
00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:20.770
In the next one, we're going to keep going with this index file Tata.
