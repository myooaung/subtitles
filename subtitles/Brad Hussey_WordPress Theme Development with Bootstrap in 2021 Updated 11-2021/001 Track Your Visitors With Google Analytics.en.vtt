00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.744
[NOISE] We're gonna put
Google Analytics and stuff on this one.

2
00:00:04.744 --> 00:00:09.050
So I'm just gonna put my baby away and
then we'll get right to it.

3
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:17.943
[MUSIC]

4
00:00:17.943 --> 00:00:22.550
So what we are gonna do now is add
some Google Analytics to our website.

5
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.890
Basically what you need to do is make
sure you sign up for Google Analytics.

6
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.685
You would technically have an account
as long as you have a Gmail account,

7
00:00:28.685 --> 00:00:30.170
Google.com/analytics.

8
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.570
Go through that process and
once you get to this page,

9
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.180
come back to this part of the lecture,
and let's continue.

10
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.600
Once you're here,
you're gonna be in the Admin tab.

11
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.802
And we're gonna create a new property for
Google Analytics,

12
00:00:44.802 --> 00:00:51.419
and this website name for me will be
bootstrap to WordPress, the website URL.

13
00:00:54.494 --> 00:00:57.578
And then you can go ahead and
select all the rest of the information,

14
00:00:57.578 --> 00:00:58.400
get tracking ID.

15
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.540
And that will give you
a tracking ID like so.

16
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.000
Copy that, and what you could do is
you can add this to your footer,

17
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.440
in your template, or
you can go straight into

18
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.350
your plugin section, and install a plugin
called Google Analytics by Yoast.

19
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.620
There's a lot of plugins you can use, but

20
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.960
I prefer this one because
this guy's great.

21
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.930
To activate that plugin, open up
the settings for that plugin up here under

22
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.110
Analytics, and then authenticate
your Google Analytics profile.

23
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.480
You can authenticate with your
Google account by clicking here or

24
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.738
you can manually enter your UA code.

25
00:01:32.738 --> 00:01:36.990
If you wanna be able to use the
dashboards, then authenticate like this.

26
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.270
Paste in the Google code that he
gave you and then press Return.

27
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.020
And then you can choose
your Analytics profile.

28
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.069
I'm gonna choose Bootstrap to WordPress.

29
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.970
And then you can go ahead and
just save those changes.

30
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.110
You should now have your
Google Analytics installed.

31
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.320
You can go around and
play with the settings here if you'd like.

32
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.080
You probably don't need to.

33
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.760
But that's how you
install Google Analytics.

34
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.710
Now what if you want to be able to
add your logo to the login screen?

35
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.650
So instead of you seeing the default
generic WordPress login, like so,

36
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.860
what if you want your logo there?

37
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.600
Well, you can do that like so.

38
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.860
Right here in your plugins, just add a new
plugin called Login Logo, install that

39
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.513
plugin, and all you need to do is
drop a .png file named loginlogo.png,

40
00:02:20.513 --> 00:02:24.200
into your WordPress content directory,
and the plugin takes care of the rest.

41
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.530
So let's go back to our Code Editor
in your live site here.

42
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.560
Really all you gotta do is
make sure to put your logo

43
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.410
right in the WordPress content directory.

44
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.620
So we have that logo, got it right here.

45
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.704
I'm just gonna drag that into here, and
I'm gonna rename it login-logo.png.

46
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.190
Now technically, if I were to log out,
I should have my logo.

47
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.270
And there we go, there's my login logo.

48
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.120
And so basically there you go,
you have your Analytics installed.

49
00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.760
And then now once you're back in Google
Analytics you can do some reporting and

50
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.480
tracking to track the stats of the site.

51
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.130
Right now because I just installed it,
there's nobody here.

52
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.120
But that's how you do that.

53
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.380
And then we have our custom login logo.

54
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.200
And that's all.

55
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.430
So, in the next lecture,
we're gonna wrap up.

56
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.750
And I'm gonna send you off
with a few tips and resources.

57
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:18.641
And we're good to go.

58
00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:19.396
See you there.

59
00:03:19.396 --> 00:03:22.712
