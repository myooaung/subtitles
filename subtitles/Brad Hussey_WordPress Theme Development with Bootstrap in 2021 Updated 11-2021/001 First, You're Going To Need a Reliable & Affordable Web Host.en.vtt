00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:00.730
Hey everyone.

2
00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:02.950
Welcome back to Boost Your Income
With Bootstrap To WordPress.

3
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:04.232
We're almost done here.

4
00:00:04.232 --> 00:00:07.000
We're gonna be trying to get our
website live on the Internet, and

5
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.490
the only way to do that is to have
an affordable and reliable web host.

6
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.705
Let me tell you about that.

7
00:00:13.705 --> 00:00:22.218
[MUSIC]

8
00:00:22.218 --> 00:00:22.820
Hey everyone.

9
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:23.470
Welcome Back.

10
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.280
I hope you are as excited as I am.

11
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.500
We're wrapping up the final
part of the project here.

12
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.230
Now, it's good to know that this
course will be ever growing, and

13
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.170
there will be new sections and
lectures coming in the future.

14
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.290
And it will be ever growing,
ever changing,

15
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.060
and updating to keep adding
value to the course.

16
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.190
But for right now we're wrapping up this
part of the project where we are gonna be

17
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.900
putting our Board Press website live.

18
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.700
And for those of you who don't
have much experience with

19
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.100
web hosting it's totally fine.

20
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.450
Have a free course out there
called Web Hosting 101,

21
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.550
and you can access that for free.

22
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.090
Takes you from beginning to end,
purchasing, domain and

23
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.600
hosting, and getting your website live.

24
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.900
I even show you how to install
a WordPress site or a WordPress blog and

25
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.770
write your first blog post
in about five minutes.

26
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.090
So, useful course to take if you
haven't taken it, totally suggest it,

27
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.090
otherwise you can keep
following along here.

28
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.670
I'm gonna give you a little bit of
a guide through how to get your web

29
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.200
hosting set up.

30
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.290
So it's really good to know that you
need a reliable host when it comes to

31
00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.620
WordPress because you're using PHP, you're
using databases and some hosts out there,

32
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.200
and I can't wrap my mind around this,
why this is the case,

33
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.500
they don't support PHP or they don't
support the latest version of PHP.

34
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.640
Sometimes they don't
let you have databases.

35
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.860
Sometimes you have to pay to upgrade
to be able to have databases.

36
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.560
It's just crazy.

37
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.160
There are great hosts out there and
the one I always use is Justhost.

38
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.610
And you probably even saw it here in
the resources section of your site.

39
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.890
Justhost right here.

40
00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:58.680
And you can even read.

41
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.870
This is my testimonial for
Justhost right here.

42
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.730
When I made my first website seven years
ago, I signed up with Justhost and

43
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:04.480
never looked back.

44
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.290
Since then I've literally built
hundreds of websites with Justhost and

45
00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.610
I've used them as my
exclusive hosting provider.

46
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.160
I have used different
hosts in the past and

47
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.972
I sometimes use other hosts
when my clients require that or

48
00:02:15.972 --> 00:02:19.300
they have different hosting packages,
but I always come back to Justhost.

49
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.580
And in fact, in some cases,
I've worked on a client website and

50
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.360
we've run into some major hosting issues,
almost at the end of the project where

51
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.740
we need to launch the site and
it's not working.

52
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.430
So then we end up scrapping their host and
then repurchasing a new

53
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.000
hosting package with JustHost so they can
actually have a reliable hosting provider.

54
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.973
And so that's why I suggest JustHost.

55
00:02:42.973 --> 00:02:45.848
So, if you have your own host,
that's totally fine.

56
00:02:45.848 --> 00:02:50.589
You might even have JustHost from my
recommendation and that's amazing,

57
00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:51.801
thank you so much.

58
00:02:51.801 --> 00:02:58.060
And also it is good to know if you do use
these links these are my affiliate links.

59
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.290
If you see Brad .ca/justhost
that is my affiliate link.

60
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.810
And that means I'll get
a commission if you

61
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.080
decide to make a purchase with that link,
and at no extra cost to you.

62
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.700
So it costs the same regardless
if you use my link or not.

63
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.870
It just means that I get a little bit of
a bonus, because I sent you their way.

64
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.820
And I only will ever send you through
an affiliate link if I use that product or

65
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.290
service and I recommend it or use it
exclusively and can sing it's praises.

66
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.700
And JustHost I couldn't
sing it's praises enough.

67
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.170
So that's what we're going to do.

68
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.600
I'm going to show you here how
to get started with JustHost.

69
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.000
So go ahead and get started with JustHost.

70
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.500
And you'll be taken to
the justhost.com website here, and

71
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.000
go ahead and just sign up now.

72
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.640
You can see it's starting
at $2.95 per month, and

73
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.863
that price ranges anywhere from $2.95,
$3.95,

74
00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:55.320
$5.99 is their base price, so right here,
this is a good introductory offer.

75
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.010
Go ahead and sign up now.

76
00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.700
And this is if you don't have hosting.

77
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.250
If you do have hosting,
then you don't have to do this,

78
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.050
you could skip this lecture altogether and
move onto the next one.

79
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.720
But this is if you don't have hosting you
need to get yourself a good hosting plan.

80
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.700
So right here you can see Starter,
Plus, Business Pro.

81
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:13.980
Select the one that you want.

82
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.810
You can go ahead and select the Starter
one, or if you want to have unlimited web

83
00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.980
sites, that's what I would recommend,
because you're gonna be building more and

84
00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.680
more sites over time,
if you're a web developer, especially.

85
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.980
And if you just have one site,
that's totally fine.

86
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.050
Go ahead and just do Starter.

87
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.070
So select your plan, and

88
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.580
then if you need a domain name,
type in your domain name that you need.

89
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.510
Choose if it's a .com, ca, org, net,
so on and so forth, then hit Next.

90
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.310
If you have a domain name,
type that in there and hit Next.

91
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.450
Leave the coupon code as is, don't
play with that because you might lose

92
00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:53.080
the discount that they give you and
that's no good, no one wants that.

93
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.160
Once you've typed in your domain name,
hit Next.

94
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.710
And then go ahead and fill out your
information, First Name, Last Name,

95
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.040
optional Business Name, your Country,
all the rest of your info right here.

96
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.310
Make sure to choose your
package information, so

97
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.220
you can choose plus 1 month,
12, 24, 36, or you can upgrade.

98
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.830
Set up fee, primary domain,
registration, that's all free.

99
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.980
And then this stuff is all optional and
totally up to you if you want to do this.

100
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.015
So you can have Domain Privacy,
Site Backup, SiteLock Domain Security,

101
00:05:24.015 --> 00:05:27.080
Search Engine Jumpstart,
gGoogle Apps for Work.

102
00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.930
You don't need to add these, but

103
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.999
if you do want to add them then
you can totally check them off.

104
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.930
And then add in your information.

105
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.480
You can pay by credit card or
pay with PayPal.

106
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.730
Confirm, and then hit next.

107
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.780
You'll be sent an email with your
confirmation info, your receipt, and

108
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:48.680
your login information for your hosting
control panel, plus FTP information.

109
00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.172
That's important, keep that email
in a safe place, stored away,

110
00:05:52.172 --> 00:05:54.883
archive it, and keep it,
you're going to need it.

111
00:05:54.883 --> 00:05:58.551
And then that information in that email,
you have the login information for

112
00:05:58.551 --> 00:05:59.590
your control panel.

113
00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.370
To get to your control panel,
you just go my.justhost.com,

114
00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.960
and then you'll be taken
to the login screen.

115
00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.640
You'll type in your domain or
you user name that was provided and

116
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.720
then the password that you were given,
submit log-in and

117
00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.680
then you'll be taken
to your control panel.

118
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.673
So basically this is your
control panel for JustHost.

119
00:06:18.673 --> 00:06:22.556
It's called cPanel and there are a lot
of hosts out there that use cPanel,

120
00:06:22.556 --> 00:06:25.313
which is great because if
you're a web developer and

121
00:06:25.313 --> 00:06:29.702
your client uses a different hosting
package, or hosting provider all together,

122
00:06:29.702 --> 00:06:33.652
but that client uses cPanel that's
awesome because then you kinda already

123
00:06:33.652 --> 00:06:37.130
know your way around if you're
familiar with JustHost like I am.

124
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:42.500
So you can do a getting started help
wizard or check the help center,

125
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.745
things like that if you wanna get any more
further assistance with the control panel.

126
00:06:47.745 --> 00:06:50.965
But you can see,
you manage your email here,

127
00:06:50.965 --> 00:06:55.800
you got some website tools,
file manager, things like that.

128
00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.300
You can manage your domains here if you
have any add on domains or extra domains,

129
00:06:59.300 --> 00:06:59.980
things like that.

130
00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:02.800
Here you can install Word Press.

131
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.420
So this is one way of
installing WordPress.

132
00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:08.580
In the Web Hosting 101 course we did
it this way where you click this.

133
00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.940
You chose the directory,
you want to install WordPress and

134
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.200
boom it installs WordPress.

135
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.400
You can do that.

136
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.720
And it's very simple, but sometimes you
want to have more customization and

137
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:24.160
more ability to manage how
WordPress is installed,

138
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:29.030
and to make sure that it is secure,
using nongeneric settings.

139
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.400
So that's what we're gonna
do in the next lecture.

140
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.150
We're going to install
WordPress like a pro.

141
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:34.715
See you there.

142
00:07:34.715 --> 00:07:37.681
