Hey, friend, welcome back, this is the blog post single template, it's very simple.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,640
So we're going to go ahead and code up this e-mail template right now and your code editor.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:16,180
Make sure to create a new file in your folder of the site and call it something along the lines of a

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,200
single dot html.

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,080
So let's say single dot h html perfect and in a single day HTML.

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,670
We're basically going to just copy a lot of what's in the index that each HTML to get things started.

7
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,750
So copy the head posted and you're single.

8
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,860
And then we're going to also copy the footer section all the way from.

9
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:43,720
Footer down to the closing HTML tag pasted in there as well, and make sure actually after the opening

10
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:49,130
or the closing had tag, rather we need to add a body tag and that body tag.

11
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:53,380
We're going to give it the class of single dash post.

12
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:54,450
Perfect.

13
00:00:54,460 --> 00:01:01,420
Now inside of there, we're going to have to copy the entire navigation, the hero section, all of

14
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:07,870
this stuff that we got from the home page or the blog index that we just coded up.

15
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,430
So here's our version here.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,320
We need to actually get this whole header section here and paste it into our single post here.

17
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:22,510
Now, once we start coding this in WordPress, we're going to be using PHP and then these can all be

18
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,750
dynamic template files, so we don't have to code every single one up.

19
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,970
But right now, we're just going to have to do that.

20
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:35,050
So go to your index and we're going to grab top navigation all the way down.

21
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,640
Past mobile menu, past title banner past Subscribe!

22
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,220
Bar.

23
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,520
And we're going to stop.

24
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,700
At the content area, so like that is a copy that.

25
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,890
Top navigation all the way to the end of subscribed bar paste that in.

26
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,670
Save now, let's just check to see what this looks like so far.

27
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:05,320
So here's our single template so far you can see we've got the header, the subscriber and then the

28
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,070
footer perfect.

29
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,720
And then we just need to add content in the middle.

30
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:08,650
All right.

31
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:09,430
So we're going to do now.

32
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,360
We're going to add this stuff.

33
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,890
It's going to be very simple.

34
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:18,190
Now let's head back to our code editor after our section closing section tag.

35
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,460
We're going to add a div with the class of content dash area inside of that div.

36
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,940
With the class of content area, we're going to add a div with the class of container.

37
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,300
Another div with the class of row inside of that.

38
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,770
This one's going to have a few utility classes, bootstrap utility classes.

39
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:42,160
So Div and the classes are going to be called Dash M.D. Dash eight Offset Dash, M.D., Dash two to

40
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,470
offset it by two from the left.

41
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:49,750
And then we're going to say overflow hidden dash hidden inside of there.

42
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,360
An article, the class of post.

43
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,540
So now we're just going to post some dummy markup in here.

44
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:00,740
So Level three, heading with just some, you know, leading into next couple paragraph tags.

45
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,440
Let's save that and have a little look.

46
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,510
There we go.

47
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,740
This kind of looks a little bit weird to me, so maybe we change it to a Level four heading.

48
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:14,380
The reality is this once it's in elementary, in WordPress, like you could do whatever you want with

49
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:14,550
it.

50
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,630
So for example, when you're on a post, when you're in the blog and you're writing a post like you

51
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,860
can add whatever text you want in whatever way that you want it, we just have to make sure that each

52
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,150
of those elements are styled.

53
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,760
So it doesn't matter what's in here right now, whether it's a level three heading paragraphs, it doesn't

54
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,780
really matter, but there's our template single HTML file.

55
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,610
Onto the next one.
