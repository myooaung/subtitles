Hey, everybody.
Welcome back to

2
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.770
Boost Your Income with
Bootstrap to WordPress.

3
00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.729
This lecture is called
Coding the Opt-in Section.

4
00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:15.508
[MUSIC]

5
00:00:15.508 --> 00:00:18.390
First off, I'm gonna show you
what it is that we're doing.

6
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.880
So here in our site that we're working on,

7
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.710
we only have up to the header, the hero
section, and all this sort of stuff here.

8
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.915
What we wanna add is this opt-in
bar with our text and then

9
00:00:32.915 --> 00:00:40.079
the button to click to subscribe which
will initiate a modal window, like so.

10
00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.780
So that's what we're gonna do right now.

11
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.060
Open up your Code Editor, and
scroll to the opt in section in your code.

12
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.105
And let's start off by giving
that section an ID of optin.

13
00:00:54.234 --> 00:00:58.710
Inside there, we're gonna give
a div with the class of container.

14
00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.940
That's a Bootstrap class.

15
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.640
Wraps the content in here within
a container that is centered in the middle

16
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.360
of the screen.

17
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.990
And also allows us to add some
responsive markup in here.

18
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.644
So we're gonna add a row.

19
00:01:12.644 --> 00:01:16.440
And inside that row,
we're gonna add two columns.

20
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.590
Because we have some text on the left,
and we have the button on the right.

21
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.605
And we can use columns
to achieve that layout,

22
00:01:26.605 --> 00:01:32.592
and that also means it is responsive
because these are bootstrap classes.

23
00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:36.843
So col-sm-8, it will be 8 columns.

24
00:01:36.843 --> 00:01:43.006
And then after that,
let's add another column, col-sm-4.

25
00:01:43.006 --> 00:01:45.733
That equates to 12.

26
00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:49.476
In our 8 column,
we're gonna add a paragraph and

27
00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:52.430
give that paragraph the class of lead.

28
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.848
That's a Bootstrap class, gives
the paragraph just a bigger font, and

29
00:01:56.848 --> 00:01:59.465
it's a little bit more smooth-looking.

30
00:01:59.465 --> 00:02:03.250
It's supposed to be for leading texts.

31
00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.340
So strong tag, and we're gonna say,
Subscribe to our mailing list.

32
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.830
After the strong tag, We'll send

33
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.840
something special as a thank you.

34
00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.360
Perfect.

35
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.284
And then in here,
we're gonna add a button,

36
00:02:28.284 --> 00:02:34.117
an actual button with
the class of btn btn-success,

37
00:02:34.117 --> 00:02:37.237
btn-lg, and btn-block.

38
00:02:37.237 --> 00:02:42.010
Now, let me explain all these classes, btn
stands for button, it's a bootstrap class.

39
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:48.950
It allows the markup to be styled
as an initial Bootstrap button,

40
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.990
and then all the rest of the classes
will further style that button.

41
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.570
So button success gives
it the success color,

42
00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:00.490
which is set at green, and we're gonna
customize that green color shortly.

43
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:01.728
Button large, makes the button larger.

44
00:03:01.728 --> 00:03:05.854
And button block,
that makes a block element,

45
00:03:05.854 --> 00:03:09.060
rather than a inline block element.

46
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.580
And then we're going to add
a couple more things here.

47
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.420
So data-toggle attribute modal.

48
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.958
Bootstrap attributes here to initiate
our modal window once we code it,

49
00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:31.630
data-target, then the ID of myModal, and
that's gonna be the ID of our modal.

50
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.550
And inside the button, let's just say,
Click here to subscribe.

51
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.200
So let's just have a look to
see what that looks like.

52
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.260
So here it is right here, we have our
leading text, you could see it's bigger,

53
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.060
and our button.

54
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.310
But there's a few things wrong
that obviously we don't have yet.

55
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.500
So we don't have the big blue bar
spanning the width of the page.

56
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.420
The text doesn't look smooth,

57
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.950
like it's not being anti-alias
than using WebKit font smoothing.

58
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.280
And same with the button,
it's got a little bit chunky text in here.

59
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.130
It's not smooth-looking.

60
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.060
So let's remedy that with some CSS.

61
00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.922
I know the first thing that I wanna do
here is I'm gonna fix something that we

62
00:04:12.922 --> 00:04:15.420
probably didn't notice yet.

63
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.000
This image is actually a little
too large for its column.

64
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.210
Let me just toggle between
the websites here.

65
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.891
You could see how the final website,
the image is smaller.

66
00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:33.275
And that's because the image right
now is just fixed at its width,

67
00:04:33.275 --> 00:04:39.659
but we wanna give that images in
our site the max width of 100%.

68
00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:45.160
That means that it will scale
to the width of its parent.

69
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.490
So right here, the parent,
the column ends about here.

70
00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.530
And the same here, it ends about here but

71
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.740
the image kind of overflows outside of it,
and we wanna fix that.

72
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.446
All you gotta do here is,
in your CSS, let's put it in

73
00:05:04.446 --> 00:05:09.269
your Global section,
img { max-width: 100%.

74
00:05:09.269 --> 00:05:10.290
Now, check it out.

75
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.160
And fixed.

76
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.140
Perfect.

77
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.670
Now, let's go and start selling these.

78
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.720
Here in your CSS, at the very bottom,

79
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.270
we're going to add a new comment here,
that's called layout.

80
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.460
And we're gonna add our
layout styles here.

81
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:34.657
So let's add optin, and
optin is gonna have a background

82
00:05:34.657 --> 00:05:39.685
of that blue color, which was 3E4249.

83
00:05:39.685 --> 00:05:44.450
The padding will be 20 pixels,
top bottom, not on left, right.

84
00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:45.402
The color of the text will be white.

85
00:05:45.402 --> 00:05:49.551
We're gonna add some sexytext,
webkit-font-smoothing, and

86
00:05:49.551 --> 00:05:53.420
text-rendering that is, and
font-size will be 1.2em.

87
00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:58.450
So it'll be technically about 20% larger
than the base font size of the whole site.

88
00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.570
We're gonna add style for
the paragraph tag here.

89
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:08.950
And we're gonna say, margin: 7px 0 0 0,
because it currently

90
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:13.750
will be kinda jabbed up in the top, and we
wanna give a little bit of spacing there.

91
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:14.860
Save that, check it out.

92
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.100
There we go.

93
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.020
Now, the only thing left here is this
button's text is a little bit chunky, and

94
00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.960
we need to fix that by going
up to our Global section.

95
00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.790
And here, just above our button class,
let's add

96
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:36.310
button, input, class of button,
a, the class of button.

97
00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.960
This is just gonna cover
all these combinations.

98
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.610
So we're gonna grab the button,
inputs, class of button, and

99
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:48.468
a with a class of button, and
we're gonna give that some sexytext, and

100
00:06:48.468 --> 00:06:54.700
we will give the color white.

101
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.690
Just to make sure,
sometimes when you have a link,

102
00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.660
it will default to a link color like blue,
or red, or something like that.

103
00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.230
So we wanna make sure that it is white.

104
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:03.100
Save it, check it out.

105
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.310
And that looks a little bit smoother,
so that's good.

106
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.190
Don't go anywhere,
because in the next lecture,

107
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:13.150
we're going to be coding
the Bootstrap modal window.

108
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:17.089
See you there.
