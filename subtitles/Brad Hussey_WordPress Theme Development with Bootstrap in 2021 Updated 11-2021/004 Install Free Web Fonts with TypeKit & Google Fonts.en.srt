00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,040
Hey, everybody, welcome back to Boost
Your Income with Bootstrap to WordPress.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,336
This lecture is called Installing Free
Web Fonts with Type Kit and Google Fonts.

3
00:00:08,336 --> 00:00:16,628
[MUSIC]

4
00:00:16,628 --> 00:00:19,540
All right.
Let's add some custom font libraries to

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,850
our HTML.

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,550
Couple things to take note of,
here is the final WordPress website, and

7
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,400
here is the final static website.

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,730
Very subtle difference, but
the difference is there.

9
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:36,430
If you look the fonts here, just look at
the Bootstrap to WordPress title here.

10
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:40,790
You could see that the font is slightly
different here in the static one and

11
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,340
in the WordPress one.

12
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:49,170
Well that is because here I'm using Google
Fonts to serve up a font called Railway,

13
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,260
and here I'm using Proxima Nova.

14
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:59,350
The font is called Proxima Nova
with Typekit by Adobe.

15
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:03,060
So the final font we're gonna be using
is Proxima Nova because it's a much

16
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,070
sexier looking font, in my opinion.

17
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,080
Although Railway's not too bad itself.

18
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,320
But I wanna show you how to add both.

19
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,690
So there is Typekit and
there is Google Fonts.

20
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:21,014
The reason why the static one
isn't serving up Proxima Nova

21
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:26,670
with TypeKit is because TypeKit,
if I show you here in my kits.

22
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,910
You can see my kit settings.

23
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:39,361
The domains that these fonts will
show up on are bradhussey.ca,

24
00:01:39,361 --> 00:01:44,830
localhost and bootstraptowordpress.com
That is where the font will show up.

25
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,360
If it doesn't have any of these,
if it is not a part of these domains,

26
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,490
then they won't show up.

27
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:54,690
So Proxima Nova is looking for
any of these domains here.

28
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:58,110
But because the static site is
just hosted on my local machine.

29
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,340
File volumes blah, blah,blah..

30
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,368
It can't serve up that font, so
it's falling back to the Google font.

31
00:02:03,368 --> 00:02:07,330
So I'm gonna show you how to do both,
how to add both just for variety, and

32
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,220
you might like some Google
fonts better than Typekit.

33
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,205
Plus, Google Fonts is free.

34
00:02:12,205 --> 00:02:16,050
Typekit is free as well, but
the basic version of it is free.

35
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,268
So, Google Fonts.

36
00:02:17,268 --> 00:02:20,420
We have google.com/fonts, and
all you have to do is just

37
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,600
type in the font you're looking for
here if you already know it.

38
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:28,280
Or you could just play around with this to
kinda find a font that you're looking for.

39
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,400
I'm already looking for a railway.

40
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,010
So here's what we're looking for.

41
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:36,950
I'm going to add this
one to my collection.

42
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,810
So here it is down in my collection.

43
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,310
And down here I wan to click Use.

44
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:51,580
And I think I will add some normal and
let's add bold as well.

45
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,640
Okay?

46
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,760
Here it shows you the page load and
the impact on the page load time.

47
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,360
And then here is the script or

48
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,470
the code you wanna add to your
website in order to reference the CSS.

49
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:05,280
So you can use the standard,
you can use the @import Or JavaScript.

50
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,660
Let's just use Standard.

51
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:12,370
Go ahead and copy that HTML snippet there.

52
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:18,030
And then all you have to do is
add it to your header here in

53
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,900
the index file, or in all of your files,
but in this case we're on the index file.

54
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:28,100
So I'm gonna add right here, Google Fonts.

55
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:33,460
And then paste that,
there is our link to the Google fonts.

56
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:37,710
And in order to reference
the railway font,

57
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:40,710
integrate the fonts into your CSS,
this is all you need to do.

58
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:44,040
So when you're typing out the font
family you wanna use in CSS.

59
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,260
Font family in pair of strings, Railway.

60
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,550
So that is all for Google Fonts.

61
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:53,770
We're not doing the CSS yet,
but that's there.

62
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,350
So when we want to use CSS it'll be there.

63
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,100
And Typekit.

64
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,220
So sign up for
typekit.com account, it's free.

65
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,260
Unless you want to upgrade to
kind of a more fancy version.

66
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,990
And create a kit, a new kit, and
then look for the font Proxima Nova.

67
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:14,220
I'll show you the Proxima Nova font.

68
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,360
So I'm just looking for Proxima Nova.

69
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,160
And so here is Proxima Nova.

70
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,200
We wanna click use fonts and
then you can add it as Web.

71
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,440
And then add it to the kit
that you want to add it to.

72
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,630
So I already added it
to my Brad's blog kit.

73
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,490
And then open up your kits here.

74
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:41,380
And I want to open up Brad's blog kit,
you can name yours whatever, obviously.

75
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,830
And here is kind of
the information about this kit.

76
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,270
So, the default weights and styles.

77
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,400
Those will be fine.

78
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,060
This is where you can choose
the styles you want to include and

79
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,730
up here using fonts in CSS.

80
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:01,150
So you just reference it by
typing proxima-nova all lower

81
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,799
case inside a pair of strings
as a font family like this.

82
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:10,180
And you're going to need the embed code.

83
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,560
So copy that embed code right there.

84
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,180
And Kit Settings, this is where you
are going to want to name the Kit and

85
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,030
then choose the domain.

86
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:23,770
So local host would be good,
maybe your website or your blog.

87
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,380
Whatever your website is going to be on.

88
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,608
But, make sure to include local hosts.

89
00:05:28,608 --> 00:05:30,770
Then you're gonna Save those settings, and

90
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:34,870
then hit Publish to
make sure it's updated.

91
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,420
And then, go back to your code editor.

92
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,780
Go down to the very bottom.

93
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:44,150
Just below the closing body tag,
paste those two scripts and

94
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:48,785
these will be your
TypeKit Fonts right there.

95
00:05:48,785 --> 00:05:51,999
For proxima nova.

96
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,990
Save that and that should be it.

97
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,830
So then all you do at this point
we'll get there eventually is for

98
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:02,905
the font family you just type in either
railway in a string, pair of strings or

99
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:06,570
proxima-nova all lower
case in a pair of strings.

100
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:11,172
What we're gonna do is go font family,
proxminova, railway,

101
00:06:11,172 --> 00:06:14,920
sans-serif, so we can have a font stack.

102
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,560
All right.

103
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,128
And that's it for this lecture, and
in the next lecture we're going to be

104
00:06:20,128 --> 00:06:23,755
coding the header and
the navigation bar of our HTML file.

105
00:06:23,755 --> 00:06:24,670
All right, see you there.

106
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,480
