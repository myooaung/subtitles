Welcome back everyone to Boost Your
Income With Bootstrap to Wordpress.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,841
This lecture is called Convert Your
Static Footer to a Dynamic Footer.

3
00:00:08,841 --> 00:00:17,178

4
00:00:17,178 --> 00:00:23,780
Open up your footer.php file in your
Bootstrap to WordPress theme file.

5
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:28,810
So, in the theme directory,
open up footer.php.

6
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:34,280
Basically, we're gonna simplify this a bit
and make sure that our jQuery, Bootstrap,

7
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,770
and all of our styles, sorry,
all of our scripts are hooked in.

8
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,930
Cool, so get rid of everything here.

9
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:50,740
So from page, the div of the idea of page,
remove it all the way up here to content.

10
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,650
Wipe that out, we don't want that.

11
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,270
And after WordPress footer,

12
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:59,710
we want to put the footer info
that we had in our static website.

13
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:04,230
So go to your index file and at the bottom
and you'll see the section that says,

14
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,726
Bootstrap Core Javascript and all this
stuff, type Git fonts and everything.

15
00:01:07,726 --> 00:01:14,730
Grab this, copy it, go back to your footer
and paste it right under WordPress footer.

16
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,450
I'm just gonna line this up here.

17
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,530
Looking good.

18
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,790
So we've got our Bootstrap
core JavaScript,

19
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,960
jQuery is pulling from Google API.com.

20
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,230
Okay.
Now we have assets, jQuery,

21
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,534
we need to fix that
using our PHP blog info

22
00:01:34,534 --> 00:01:39,843
function built into WordPress, okay.

23
00:01:39,843 --> 00:01:40,452
And then,

24
00:01:40,452 --> 00:01:45,470
you can, basically, what I am about to do
it does the same as style sheet directory.

25
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:49,470
You know how we use to do what we've done,
stylesheet_directory.

26
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,027
Well you can do template_directory,
and really there isn't a difference,

27
00:01:54,027 --> 00:01:56,030
unless you modify it somewhere.

28
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,250
But the default functionality
is the template directory

29
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,300
is the template right here.

30
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,200
This is the template directory.

31
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,400
Bootstrap to WordPress.

32
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,800
And the style sheet directory,
well, it's the same.

33
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,250
So unless you change it somewhere,
they are the same.

34
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,110
There's really just kind of for
semantic purposes, I suppose.

35
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,590
So you're referencing scripts.

36
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,540
You don't want to say template style sheet
directory just in case you change that

37
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,960
style sheet directory in the future.

38
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,000
Again, like I said, you probably won't.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,780
But template directory makes more sense in
this case rather than stylesheet director.

40
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,760
So, like I said,
this is the same spot by default.

41
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,030
So go ahead and put template directory.

42
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:40,225
And we're gonna wanna copy that
because we're gonna paste it here for

43
00:02:40,225 --> 00:02:42,010
our Bootstrap main js.

44
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:46,750
And for our main js,
I'm gonna put these closer together just

45
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,592
because they don't need to be spaced so
far apart.

46
00:02:48,592 --> 00:02:50,390
Type kit, looks good.

47
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:53,200
Save that and
there really isn't much change.

48
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,210
Now, we just have JavaScript and
we have access to what Bootstrap offers.

49
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,170
Okay.

50
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:01,600
Great, simple lecture.

51
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,540
I thought I'd keep it simple for that one.

52
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,990
That would be the end of this section.

53
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:09,110
And in the next section, basically, we're
gonna start jumping in and we're gonna

54
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:14,520
actually turn our home page into this,
this beautiful beast right here.

55
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,300
That's what we're going to start
doing in our next section.

56
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,630
So, I'll see you there.

57
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:23,137
Get yourself something to eat, something
to drink, and I'll see you there.

58
00:03:23,137 --> 00:03:26,245
