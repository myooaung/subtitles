Hey everybody welcome back to Boost
Your Income with Bootstrap to WordPress.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:08,922
This lecture is called Learn How to
Create a Modal Popup Using Bootstrap.

3
00:00:08,922 --> 00:00:17,268
[MUSIC]

4
00:00:17,268 --> 00:00:19,690
Now let's code our modal window.

5
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:24,110
Scroll down to the bottom of
your HTML to the modal div.

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,750
And there we're just going to start
using the HTML for the bootstrap modal.

7
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,820
Now this is available on
the getbootstrap.com documentation.

8
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,350
You could just copy and
paste their code and play around with it,

9
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,050
that's all I ever do.

10
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,070
But here since you're with me
you could just follow along so

11
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,430
that you can learn a little bit.

12
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:49,450
So the div will hold the class of modal,
and fade.

13
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,200
That's just something that
bootstraps adds by default and

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,580
it allows it to fade in
when it's initiated.

15
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,190
The id will be myModal using camel case.

16
00:01:02,543 --> 00:01:08,483
Within here, we're gonna have to add
a div with a class of modal dialog.

17
00:01:08,483 --> 00:01:12,990
Again, these Divs in this markup,

18
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,970
is specifically copied from
the get bootstrap documentation.

19
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,130
These classes, they're here for a reason.

20
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,220
I won't really explain them.

21
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,550
Because they just work.

22
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,867
Just use what works.

23
00:01:25,867 --> 00:01:34,730
Modal content And then inside here.

24
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:38,351
This is where we're gonna add
the div with the class modal header.

25
00:01:38,351 --> 00:01:40,226
Modal header.

26
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:44,518
Inside modal header, actually let's
keep adding that mark up first.

27
00:01:44,518 --> 00:01:48,930
Then after modal header we're gonna
have div with a class with modal body.

28
00:01:53,293 --> 00:01:55,800
All right?

29
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:01,040
And now let's go into our modal header,
and give a button.

30
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:06,870
The type of button, the class of close.

31
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:11,560
This is gonna add our close Icon
in the top right of our modal.

32
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,700
Data, dismiss, boot strap attribute,
dismiss the modal window.

33
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,970
And then in here,
we're going to add a span.

34
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:21,910
Make sure to close that button.

35
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:30,650
And inside that span, we're going to say
aria, whoops, aria hidden equals true.

36
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:38,220
And then we're going to add
the times HTML entity for an X.

37
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,220
Then after that, we'll add another span.

38
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:49,110
And then class SR dash, only for
screen reader only, and inside your span.

39
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,000
Close.
That's just so

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,510
screen readers can read that
that is a close button.

41
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:59,558
After your button, add the h4 heading,
class of modal title, and

42
00:02:59,558 --> 00:03:06,380
then id="myModalLabel," just for
some semantic assistance.

43
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,068
And then an i tag.

44
00:03:08,068 --> 00:03:11,650
Class fa fa-envelope.

45
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:17,260
And what this is actually gonna do
is it's gonna grab Font Awesome.

46
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:17,760
This is how you.

47
00:03:19,937 --> 00:03:21,690
Use a Font Awesome icon.

48
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:26,700
So the i html tag gives it
the class of fa for Font Awesome.

49
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,690
And then fa dash whatever
icon you're looking for.

50
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,820
And that's available on
the Font Awesome website.

51
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:34,990
For reference.

52
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:40,970
And then space,
subscribe to our mailing list.

53
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,430
Save that and let's check it out,
see if it worked.

54
00:03:47,751 --> 00:03:48,860
All right nothing yet.

55
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,230
And that is because we haven't
initiated some JavaScript I believe,

56
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,910
but let's not worry about that right now.

57
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,329
Let's continue our markup.

58
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:00,360
And then we'll get it working afterwards.

59
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,370
Inside the modal body let's add some text.

60
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,060
And that text will be simply
enter your name and email!

61
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,760
As a thank you for

62
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,440
joining us we're going to give you one of
our best selling courses, emphasis tag,

63
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,190
for free.

64
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:24,060
All right, after that paragraph tag,
we're going to add a form.

65
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,350
That form is gonna have the class form
inline because it's an inline form.

66
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,700
Rule will be form and
then inside your form.

67
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,006
Let's give a div with
the class of form-group.

68
00:04:40,006 --> 00:04:43,290
These are Bootstrap classes.

69
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:47,920
It allows you to give some
default styling to the form so

70
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,430
you don't have to do so much CSS.

71
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:55,840
And then, inside the form group,
label class sr only, whoops.

72
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,890
That is for your screen readers.

73
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:03,280
For subscribe dash name,
that will be the ID of our input.

74
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:09,540
And then your first name,
and then add your

75
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:14,470
input type text.

76
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:23,463
And then class form-control
id subscribe-name.

77
00:05:28,423 --> 00:05:30,640
And then a placeholder.

78
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,710
Your first name.

79
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,480
All right,
that'll be your first form group.

80
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:41,060
Copy that form group,
paste it again afterwards so

81
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,110
you don't have to recode
everything over and over again.

82
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:52,900
This next one will be subscribe email and
then the label will be and your email.

83
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,418
And then this id for
the input will be four,

84
00:05:58,418 --> 00:06:02,413
subscribe email,

85
00:06:02,413 --> 00:06:06,750
placeholder, and your email.

86
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:13,170
Okay, and
after that we're gonna add one more thing.

87
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:22,060
Right after the form group we're gonna
add an input with the type of submit,

88
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:26,990
the class of btn-danger for a red button.

89
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:31,560
Value will be subscribe form.

90
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,060
All right.

91
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,680
And then after our form we're
just gonna add a horizontal rule.

92
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:42,390
HR, and then a paragraph and inside that
paragraph we're gonna add some text,

93
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,710
just like a little bit of a disclaimer.

94
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:48,490
Small tag, by providing your email
you consent to receive and occasional

95
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:51,930
promotional emails and newsletters,
break tag no spam just good stuff.

96
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:52,860
We respect your privacy.

97
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,490
You may unsubscribe at any time.

98
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,980
Okay, that should be your modal.

99
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:03,220
Save that, now that we've got our HTML in,
we should technically be able

100
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,470
to display our modal by clicking
the button, however it's not working and

101
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:15,390
the reason why is because down here at
the bottom, our Bootstrap core JavaScript.

102
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:19,410
I actually forgot to add our
Bootstrap core JavaScript

103
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:23,220
inside of our scripts here
at the bottom of our page.

104
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,550
So that's important, obviously.

105
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:32,040
So right after your
jQuery add a script tag

106
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:40,025
with the source of
assets/JS/bootstrap.min.js.

107
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:45,130
And that's because you're
grabbing your bootstrap min js.

108
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,300
Close that off, and
now your bootstrap should use script for

109
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,430
your bootstrap should be in your.

110
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,560
Website here.

111
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,610
And now your button should
work if you click it.

112
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,950
There's your modal window, subscribe to
our mailing list, enter your name and

113
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:05,160
email and here's the inline form with
the button, your close icon up here.

114
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,750
You see this is the font, awesome icon
here, and then our text at the bottom.

115
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,820
All right, there's the modal window.

116
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,950
Hopefully that made sense to you.

117
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,150
See you in the next lecture,

118
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:20,930
where we are going to code the boost
your income section right here.

119
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:24,889
See you there.
