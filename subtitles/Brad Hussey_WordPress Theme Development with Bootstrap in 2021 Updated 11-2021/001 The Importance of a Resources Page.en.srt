00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,880
Hey everybody, welcome back to Boost Your
Income with Bootstrap to WordPress, and

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,060
we are now in a brand new section where
we're gonna code our resources page.

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,010
But first I want to explain to you
the importance of a resources page and

4
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:15,200
why you should have one in
every one of your websites.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:15,822
Check it out.

6
00:00:15,822 --> 00:00:24,339

7
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:27,462
Okay, so
this is what the Resources page looks

8
00:00:27,462 --> 00:00:31,490
like on the Bootstrap to
WordPress final WordPress site.

9
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,310
And as you can see it's very simple.

10
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,200
Right now I only have
three resources listed,

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,890
I have JustHost, Coda 2 and Dropbox.

12
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:44,480
You've heard me sing the praises of these
many times, especially Justhost and Coda.

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,820
I use them every day, and
they make my life and my business easier.

14
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,030
In fact, they make me money, and

15
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:55,440
the reason why they make me money is
because they are my affiliate links.

16
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,820
And affiliate links are useful when
you are trying to promote a product

17
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,580
that you stand behind.

18
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:05,632
Now, there are people who use affiliate
links simply just to make money.

19
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:09,090
Quick and dirty, and
they've never used the resources before.

20
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,380
However, I don't ever do that.

21
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,840
The resources that I suggest
to you as a student,

22
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,490
are the resources that I would suggest
to my family members, and my friends.

23
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,600
They are amazing, these tools that I use,
I always, always,

24
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,710
always use them extensively before
I even think of recommending them.

25
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:35,010
Because, I want you to trust me and
the resources that I give to you.

26
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,760
So when I say, check out JustHost,
they're amazing,

27
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,540
I'm saying that because they're
amazing and they make my life easier.

28
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,760
Same with Coda 2, you see it right here.

29
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,370
Coda 2, I use it all the time.

30
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:49,620
I use it for all my courses, I use it for
my client website, my personal websites.

31
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,560
In fact I'm even making my
mother's website right now.

32
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,520
I'm using Coda 2 and Justhost and Dropbox,

33
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,370
so trust me when I say
these are useful tools.

34
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:04,780
Now coming back, I digress,
areesources pages are incredibly useful.

35
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:09,110
Because they let your customers,
your clients, your friends,

36
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:12,845
your visitors,
your audience know hey these are useful.

37
00:02:12,845 --> 00:02:17,360
And these tools should be tailored
towards your audience and

38
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,650
what they're visiting your site for.

39
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,340
So when they visit my site, for
example right here, BradHussey.ca,

40
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,440
I have a areesources page, obviously.

41
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,560
And I'm listing out my everyday
must have tools, JustHost,

42
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,520
GoDaddy, 1Password, X,
Coda, everything like that.

43
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,230
And then I have code editors,
invoicing and time tracking, so

44
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,710
my resources are tailored to my audience,
you guys, who wanna learn how to code.

45
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:48,470
You wanna learn how to live like
a freelancer, you wanna live passionately,

46
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,700
you wanna work for yourself.

47
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,860
You kinda wanna live unconventionally, and
so my tools and my resources reflect that.

48
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,510
So when you come to the areesources
page I'm giving you tools that will help

49
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,690
make your life easier,
like they've made my life easier.

50
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,600
And that's what resources pages are for.

51
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,940
So it's very obvious why resources
pages are incredibly important.

52
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:15,120
A bonus of why resources pages
are incredibly useful and

53
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,530
beneficial is because it's an incredibly
valuable page on your blog, your website,

54
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:27,210
your client's website, your niche website,
because it can make you money.

55
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:31,560
And it shouldn't be a surprise to you
when I say you use your affiliate links.

56
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,160
And if somebody clicks on your link,
your product, your resource,

57
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,250
your suggestion,
you can get a commission from that.

58
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,390
Now, they're small commissions,
sometimes they're a couple bucks,

59
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,876
sometimes they could be as high as 100.

60
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,800
But when you have volume and
people visit your site, and

61
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,250
they trust you, and
you give them something useful, and

62
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,740
they click that link,
you're gonna get a commission for it.

63
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:02,640
In fact just last month, my resources
page, now, I don't make money blogging.

64
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,080
I make money as a web developer,
coding WordPress websites and

65
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,860
building websites, consulting,
things like that, selling courses.

66
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,330
My blog, I don't make money on my blog.

67
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:19,490
However, my resources page is
the only page that makes me money.

68
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:26,861
In fact, last month, my resources page,
made me roughly $900.

69
00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:34,270
So it's small in terms of my full time
income, but 900 bucks, that's awesome.

70
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:38,480
So on top of helping your audience and
listing out useful tools,

71
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:44,600
you can get paid for having a resources
page, essentially, so good tip.

72
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,800
All right back here to our resources page,
this is the resources page on Bootstrap.

73
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,880
The WordPress, its very simple.

74
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,080
So we're going to code that out,
we're going to use some Bootstrap grids.

75
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,410
And once we get into WordPress I
make it incredibly easy so

76
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:03,040
that you can add new
resources to your page.

77
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,565
And I think you will find it
incredibly useful, so let's jump in.

78
00:05:06,565 --> 00:05:09,989
