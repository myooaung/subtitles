00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.849
Hey.
Welcome back to Boost Your Income

2
00:00:01.849 --> 00:00:02.950
with Bootstrap to WordPress.

3
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:08.720
This lecture is called Convert Your
Static Header to a Dynamic Header.

4
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.783
Cue funky beats.

5
00:00:09.783 --> 00:00:18.030
[MUSIC]

6
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.270
All right,
here we are in my favorite code editor.

7
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.200
Open up your favorite.

8
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.830
It should also be Coda too.

9
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.790
I'm just kidding, you can use whatever
editor you want as long as it Coda.

10
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.990
Open up your theme,
Bootstrap WordPress theme here.

11
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.160
Make sure it's the directory.

12
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.990
Opened up that headered up .php
file that is provided in the theme,

13
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.860
here it is right here.

14
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.860
But we need to change it up to make
it more like what it's going to be.

15
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.960
So we need to take our index file from our
static site and turn the header section.

16
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.810
All of this stuff.

17
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.690
We're going to include
this in our header.php.

18
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.740
But WordPress-afize it.

19
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:55.650
WordPressize it.

20
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.180
You know what I mean.

21
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.910
Make it WordPress.

22
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.220
So yeah, let's just jump in and
start doing it.

23
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.090
Let's start from the top here.

24
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.700
I'm gonna leave for now, there's some
links to style sheets and font icons,

25
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.510
Google fonts, things like that that we're
gonna get into in an upcoming lecture.

26
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.290
But first, we're just gonna
more importantly do the header.

27
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.140
Like literally the header section.

28
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.112
So let's go ahead and

29
00:01:24.112 --> 00:01:29.530
grab the header, all this right here.

30
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.220
Boom, copy that from
your static index file.

31
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.660
You're gonna take that and under this skip
link right here the screen reader text

32
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.500
basically just take all of this and

33
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.710
remove it we're just going
to scrap it gone forever and

34
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.490
paste what you did from your static site
just going to line this up a little bit so

35
00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.350
here is our header and

36
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.200
now we're just gonna basically
make this more WordPress friendly.

37
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.348
So we have our header,
sight header we're looking good,

38
00:02:06.348 --> 00:02:09.480
basically where we need to start
making this a little bit more

39
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.910
WordPress style is our navigation,
right here.

40
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.710
The navigation menu.

41
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.590
So let's get some space here
between the navbar header and

42
00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.830
the navbar collapse section.

43
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.470
Cuz this is what we're gonna play with.

44
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.460
So in order to make this connect to
Wordpress and pull in our actual Wordpress

45
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.430
menus, we need to use the Wordpress
function, Wordpressnavmenu.

46
00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.150
So I'm going to build this here.

47
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.970
We're going to build this here and then
we're basically going to remove this stuff

48
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.090
afterwards just so you can follow along.

49
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.760
So go ahead and add some PHP.

50
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.540
All right, so in that PHP we need to
use the WordPress nav menu function.

51
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.620
And there we're going to have an array.

52
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.360
And that array,
we have more stuff in here.

53
00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.930
Good.
And then we are going to have theme

54
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.420
location, this is going to be which
menu is WordPress looking for.

55
00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.760
Its going to be called primary.

56
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.060
There is a note on this, I'll copy and
paste this here for you.

57
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.600
If the WordPress, if the menu,
the WordPress admin area is not set,

58
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.480
then the menu class is
applied to container.

59
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.150
In other words,
it overwrites the container class.

60
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.220
So what does that mean?

61
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.090
We're gonna be doing that here.

62
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:34.550
So we have container and that container,
basically what is the container element.

63
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.040
I want it to be the nav element.

64
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.520
The actual nav tag, HTML5.

65
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:46.810
And then class is navbar collapse and
collapse.

66
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.460
And then one more is menu class, so
what is the class of the menu, so

67
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.170
the unordered list.

68
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.210
That's nav, nav bar,
nav, and nav bar right.

69
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.800
These are all boot strap classes remember.

70
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.670
Okay, so what is this,
how does this relate to this?

71
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.920
So, if you don't actually set the menu,
so if

72
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.310
I just save this as is, and left it like
this, it wouldn't actually work properly.

73
00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.120
Because we need to actually set the menu
in the Word Press dashboard, and

74
00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.600
that is pretty easy to do,
actually is is incredibly easy to do,

75
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.020
one of the easiest things you can do.

76
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.830
So I am just going to save this here and
lets delete this for now

77
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.620
just remove the nav bar don't remove
the container just the nav bar collapse,

78
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.120
okay so technically this should be
replacing it so lets save that and

79
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.540
lets go to our site here,
now we have Home and Sample page.

80
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.375
And we have a couple of
other funny things here.

81
00:04:54.918 --> 00:04:57.118
Let's go back into our dashboard.

82
00:04:57.118 --> 00:05:04.060
And Appearance Menus.

83
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.090
We need to create a primary menu.

84
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.230
This one is going to be called Main Menu.

85
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:11.380
You can call it whatever you want.

86
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.750
And I'm gonna create that menu.

87
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.380
And the theme locations
would be primary menu.

88
00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:24.200
That's built in to your underscores theme.

89
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:29.180
So if I were to go back here into our
functions.php, and just search for

90
00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.840
nav, here we go.

91
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.860
So down here on line 43, in our functions,
now functions.php is like,

92
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.890
the main core of our WordPress theme.

93
00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:42.000
This is where all the PHP
functions are hosted.

94
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.140
So register nav menus.

95
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.070
This is how you register
a navigation menu in WordPress.

96
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.490
You can have as many as you want.

97
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.710
So by default they just
give you primary menu.

98
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.340
And that is in the primary, down here.

99
00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.980
Do you see the relation?

100
00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.930
Primary menu, primary menu.

101
00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.110
That's because we, it's right here
by default in the functions file.

102
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.070
You can add more, like footer menu,
sidebar menu, whatever.

103
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.720
And they will show up in
the WordPress nav menu dashboard.

104
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.500
So we want this one to be
set as the primary menu and

105
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:19.340
you can leave home and sample page for
now save that and then go back cool and so

106
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:24.760
that's technically working we have
a broken image here and this button so

107
00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.060
this image is because brand is
referencing nothing really so

108
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.690
let's go back to our header here,
up here the navbar brand.

109
00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.840
To fix that, basically what we wanna do

110
00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:43.760
is just make sure that we're
referencing the correct file location.

111
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.380
And it's also good to know we
probably don't even have it in here,

112
00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.810
we don't have our images or anything.

113
00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.380
And we'll add that in the next lecture,
actually.

114
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:55.550
We're gonna add our images or styles and
our scripts and all the extra bonuses.

115
00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:00.360
So we'll cover that bug
in the next lecture.

116
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:05.240
So really this lecture was about
getting this header set up in there.

117
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.750
And having our navigation menu,
and so technically now if you

118
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:14.470
were to add more pages, and make sure that
those were hooked into that primary menu,

119
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:18.590
they would show up in the header, so
hopefully that wasn't too confusing,

120
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.320
just a real quick recap,
so basically what we did,

121
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:26.060
was we took our headered up php file, and
our under [INAUDIBLE] theme or we can call

122
00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.240
it our Bootstrap to WordPress theme now
because that's what it's going to be.

123
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:35.160
And we took out the default
code under the skip link here

124
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:41.350
and we added our header
from out static index file.

125
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:46.100
And then there we basically just
turned our Word press nav menu.

126
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:50.530
We use the word press nav menu
function to add a dynamic menu so

127
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:55.120
that we can actually have real
dynamic menu items in our header.

128
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.550
And the quick note here, the button
that you see for toggle navigation,

129
00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:00.100
the reason why that is there,

130
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.490
is because we don't actually have
our boot strap styles in there yet.

131
00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:08.560
That's our only class, is a boot strap
specific class which hides anything.

132
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:12.640
As a screen reader and so
that's why we see it up here and

133
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.180
its kind of ugly right now.

134
00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.010
So in the next lecture were
gonna fix up this image,

135
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:20.100
were gonna add out bootstrap styles,
scripts and certain things like that,

136
00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.990
clean the rest of this header up so
we can actually get into the good stuff.

137
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:26.615
Dont worry its going to start
looking good pretty soon.

138
00:08:26.615 --> 00:08:27.885
See you there.

139
00:08:27.885 --> 00:08:33.178
