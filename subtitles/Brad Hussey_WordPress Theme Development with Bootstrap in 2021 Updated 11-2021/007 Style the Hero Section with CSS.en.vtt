00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.270
Hey everybody, welcome back to Boost
Your Income with Bootstrap to WordPress.

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.109
This lecture is called Styling
the Hero Section with CSS.

3
00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:16.520
[MUSIC]

4
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.841
Okay, now let's style this up.

5
00:00:17.841 --> 00:00:18.804
It doesn't look that good.

6
00:00:18.804 --> 00:00:20.395
It doesn't look like that.

7
00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:21.190
Let's make it look like that.

8
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.790
Cool.

9
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.331
You're gonna wanna add a new CSS file in

10
00:00:28.331 --> 00:00:32.719
your CSS folder called custom.css.

11
00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.790
And you're gonna have to
reference that CSS file.

12
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.450
Let's put it under font icon.

13
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:49.040
Link href, assets, CSS, custom.css,

14
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.130
rel, and that will be style sheet.

15
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.171
Great.
Put a little comment there, 'Custom CSS.',

16
00:00:59.171 --> 00:00:59.794
great.

17
00:00:59.794 --> 00:01:01.800
Very readable.

18
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.530
Perfect.

19
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.000
So let's go ahead and open that up.

20
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.420
Nice and blank.

21
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.080
First thing I'm going to do is add some
color references and a comment here.

22
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.640
There we go, nice and
big so you can read that.

23
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.819
Color references.

24
00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:24.050
So the green color is, salmon color is
this, and the blue-gray color is that.

25
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.120
So we'll be referencing this
throughout our CSS just to

26
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.670
make it a little bit easier.

27
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.890
Lets add a comment here and
lets say general.

28
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.780
I like putting comments.

29
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.520
It makes the CSS look a little
bit more organized and clean.

30
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.470
We're gonna style the body here and

31
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.460
to address that issue where
the navigation seemed like it was sucking

32
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.210
the content up into it just
give the body margin-top of 50.

33
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.058
That should fix that problem,
there you go.

34
00:01:52.058 --> 00:01:57.020
Font family proxima-nova, and

35
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.120
remember it won't really work
because we're not on local host.

36
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.815
But it will fall back to Railway, once
we get this website to PHP it will work.

37
00:02:05.815 --> 00:02:08.430
Sans-serif, there we go.

38
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:15.500
And we're going to make
the font size 16 pixels,

39
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.180
just like the base font
size will be 16 pixels.

40
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.255
Background for body will be url and

41
00:02:21.255 --> 00:02:25.830
then ../img/tile.jpg.

42
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.730
We're jumping up a directory and
then down into image, top left repeat.

43
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.620
We have a graphic here in the images
folder that is called tile.

44
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.770
It is basically a background texture.

45
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:37.810
Save it and you'll see what I mean.

46
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.400
There we go.
So we have our background texture,

47
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.470
we have this looks a little bit better
up here, and our font is Railway.

48
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.970
Cool.

49
00:02:50.404 --> 00:02:56.960
Let's add another flag here,
CSS comment, and this will be GLOBAL.

50
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.650
And in GLOBAL, let's just do
a little bit of typography here.

51
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.750
H1, h2, three, four, five, and six.

52
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.329
Let's give these some sexy text.

53
00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.290
You can copy that out,
webkit font smoothing and text rendering.

54
00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.750
And font weight will be bold so

55
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.960
now we'll have some sexy,
smooth headers that are bold.

56
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:29.777
And let's go ahead and
style the rest of our headers here.

57
00:03:29.777 --> 00:03:34.990
So I want the level one heading
to be font size of 3 en.

58
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.040
This isn't just off the top of my head.

59
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.880
I did try it out beforehand to
see what it would look like.

60
00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:41.730
Looks good.

61
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:42.860
You can play around with it if you want.

62
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.840
H1 and h2, I want these guys
to have margin of 0 0 40.

63
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.510
So we have some 40 pixels on
the bottom of the h1 and two.

64
00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.040
Level three heading, let's give that one

65
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.660
margin 20 pixels and 0,
which is 20 pixels on top and bottom.

66
00:04:03.265 --> 00:04:08.080
Now let's go to our h4 and
say font size 18 pixels.

67
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.010
Okay.
So that's just overriding our Bootstrap

68
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.180
styles, cuz they have
default styles in there, and

69
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.010
I just wanted to override
those with my own styles.

70
00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.860
Cuz it will match the design that I have.

71
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.380
Let's check it out.

72
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.510
There we go.

73
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.380
Looking a bit better here.

74
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:27.070
Let's go back.

75
00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:36.220
Now why don't we create a new flag here
specifically for our hero section.

76
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.780
We'll add some more typography a bit
later in an upcoming lecture, but

77
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.480
let's start with the hero
cuz that's what we're on.

78
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.050
Okay.

79
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.441
And in that hero,
we're gonna select that ID.

80
00:04:50.441 --> 00:04:57.630
Now background is gonna have
url ../img/hero-bg.jpg.

81
00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.693
It's gonna be 50% so in the semi centered.

82
00:05:01.693 --> 00:05:04.210
And then repeat fixed.

83
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.540
Save that.
Let's check it out.

84
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:09.540
There we go.

85
00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.052
Starting to look a bit better.

86
00:05:12.052 --> 00:05:13.200
Min-height.

87
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.240
I want it to be a minimum
height of 500 pixels.

88
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.860
I want the padding to be 40 pixels on
the top and bottom, not on the sides.

89
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.600
And the color of the content be white.

90
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.630
Again, let's have sexy text this one.

91
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:28.170
Let's check it out.

92
00:05:30.708 --> 00:05:31.750
Cool.

93
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.660
That's looking much better.

94
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.690
Okay, now let's move down here and
let's do a little bit

95
00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:43.520
more #hero and then .hero-text.

96
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.570
And let's give the hero-text
a margin-top of 30 pixels.

97
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:50.480
Check it out.

98
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.810
Here we go.

99
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.460
Gave this a little bit more margin up here
so it's a bit more centered vertically.

100
00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:59.040
Okay.

101
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.760
Lets select that price timeline.

102
00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.560
And let's give it margin 30 pixels
in the top, zero in the side,

103
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.740
60 on the bottom, text-align center.

104
00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.820
Now let's select, price-timeline .price.

105
00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.340
So we're selecting those
individual blocks.

106
00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:25.467
Display inline-block margin will be zero,
2%,

107
00:06:25.467 --> 00:06:30.830
zero zero, so
I'm having margin right be 2%.

108
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:38.220
The width will be 30% and that's because
there's gonna be three of them and

109
00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.900
I want them to be roughly 30% wide so
that they can stack up beside each other.

110
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.090
Background.

111
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:50.168
We're going to use that
blue-gray right there.

112
00:06:50.168 --> 00:06:52.460
Paste that.

113
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:58.690
Let's have some padding, ten, 20, and 30.

114
00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.709
Let's check it out.

115
00:07:00.709 --> 00:07:01.570
Okay, they're getting there.

116
00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:02.900
They're looking a bit better.

117
00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:08.300
Now I want to design a couple things here.

118
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.160
Position relative and vertical align top.

119
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:17.170
Vertical align top is gonna help
when to keep these things all

120
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:22.360
vertically aligned at the top because
once you shrink the window here, because

121
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.730
there's more content in some of these,
they might not be vertically aligned,

122
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:28.585
that will just help address that
issue should it ever come up.

123
00:07:28.585 --> 00:07:32.448
Okay.

124
00:07:32.448 --> 00:07:34.775
Because they're in line block,
they'll float up beside each other,

125
00:07:34.775 --> 00:07:35.900
rather than using float.

126
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.500
Cool little trick.

127
00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:41.865
Now, let's say price timeline,

128
00:07:41.865 --> 00:07:47.630
.price.active so
the price with the active class,

129
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:52.220
that will be #dd5638;
which is the salmon color.

130
00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:54.310
There it is.

131
00:07:56.722 --> 00:07:59.370
All right a few more styles here to
make these price timelines look good.

132
00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:05.100
#price-timeline price and
we're going to select that span.

133
00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:08.600
Background is going to be 101010.

134
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:13.608
Display we're gonna make it block,

135
00:08:13.608 --> 00:08:20.392
height 70, width 70, text-align center,

136
00:08:20.392 --> 00:08:25.895
line height 70, font-weight bold.

137
00:08:25.895 --> 00:08:30.888
Font-size 24 pixels.

138
00:08:30.888 --> 00:08:33.395
Border-radius 100%.

139
00:08:33.395 --> 00:08:35.330
This is gonna make it a circle.

140
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:39.370
And we're gonna have to use
some webkit-border-radius so

141
00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:42.355
we can also have it be a bit
more cross browser compatible.

142
00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:47.127
Moz-border-radius: 100%.

143
00:08:47.127 --> 00:08:49.994
Position: absolute.

144
00:08:49.994 --> 00:08:52.922
Bottom: negative 35 pixels.

145
00:08:52.922 --> 00:08:59.430
Left: 50% Margin left, negative 35.

146
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:02.910
Now before you go hold on Brad,
what are you doing,

147
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:06.500
let me show you what this looks like and
then let me explain what I just did.

148
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:07.710
Method to my madness, guys.

149
00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:13.220
Okay, do you see how these
circles are now in the center?

150
00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:16.120
This looks nice, this is CSS circle.

151
00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.050
It's in the center of our price box.

152
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:20.260
All of them are.

153
00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.680
How did I do it?

154
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.290
Well, let me explain.

155
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:28.230
First thing's first, I see here I used
font family, that should be font weight.

156
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:29.170
Great.

157
00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:30.960
Okay so we got our background.

158
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.400
Display block height/width.

159
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:37.020
Basically this will allow me to
have a box that is 70 by 70.

160
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.000
Text align,
I want the text to be right in the center.

161
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.110
Line height, I want this to
be vertically aligned center.

162
00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:45.270
So line height, make it the height of
the box, and the text will be dead center.

163
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:46.250
There it is.

164
00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:47.650
Bold, all good.

165
00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:48.920
Border radius, 100%.

166
00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:53.040
This means it will be a circle no matter
the size of the height and width.

167
00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.590
Position, I want it to be absolute.

168
00:09:55.690 --> 00:10:00.350
And I want it to be bottom negative 35,

169
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:04.420
because if I just had it be zero,
you'll see like that, no good.

170
00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:10.290
I want it to be half of
the height of the actual circle.

171
00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:15.310
So 35, that will be dead center, left,
because we're positioning absolute,

172
00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:19.360
left will push it 50% over but
then it won't look good.

173
00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.080
So again, here let me show you,
let me remove this.

174
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.250
That doesn't look nice.

175
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:24.460
We want it to be centered.

176
00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:26.000
How do we center it?

177
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.700
Margin left, negative,
the width of the box itself.

178
00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:35.720
Now we're dead center in height and
dead center in width.

179
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:40.730
Make sure that the parent element,
price, is positioned relative.

180
00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:45.010
That's why we have that, so we can
absolutely position our element within it.

181
00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:46.220
A little bit of CSS, but

182
00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:49.850
I'm assuming you guys are rock stars
at this point with HTML and CSS.

183
00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:52.050
If it got you sweating a little bit,
no worries.

184
00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:53.479
That's good, no pain, no gain, right?

185
00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.640
Hopefully that made sense.

186
00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.430
Feel free to pause.

187
00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:58.810
Go back, check it out.

188
00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:01.140
Otherwise, if you wanna skip
this part altogether, you can.

189
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:06.080
You could just use the course files and
skip this section and

190
00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:06.750
go to another section.

191
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.740
That's okay.
If you like sweating a little bit,

192
00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:10.400
hang on tight guys.

193
00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.418
Little bit more styles.

194
00:11:11.418 --> 00:11:14.167
Price-timeline h4.

195
00:11:14.167 --> 00:11:17.350
Margin: 0 0 10,
that means ten pixels on the bottom.

196
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:18.109
What?

197
00:11:18.109 --> 00:11:22.050
Price-timeline h4 small.

198
00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:24.092
Here we go.
Color: white.

199
00:11:24.092 --> 00:11:26.458
Font-weight: bold.

200
00:11:26.458 --> 00:11:28.700
And display: block.

201
00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:29.670
Now let's check this out.

202
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:31.290
We're gonna look good here.

203
00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:32.220
Woo!

204
00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:32.950
There we go.

205
00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:33.800
See the small?

206
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.020
Looks good.

207
00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:36.830
Prices looking good.

208
00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:38.860
Just a couple more things here.

209
00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:43.210
Up here, in our hero, right after hero,
let's style that hero article.

210
00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:48.800
We're gonna do something here,
width 100%, text-align center.

211
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.070
So it's gonna center
everything right here.

212
00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:53.720
There we go.

213
00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:54.700
So that's centered.

214
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:55.690
We're looking good.

215
00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:56.930
One more little thing here.

216
00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:59.340
That font, that should be bold.

217
00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:01.950
So, let me go ahead and do that.

218
00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:05.660
Scroll up here to your global styles,
and we're gonna do a few things.

219
00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:10.850
Go under your headings there,
and let's give the button class

220
00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.830
font weight of bold, so we're gonna
override some of this Bootstrap CSS, and

221
00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:21.950
we're gonna say btn-danger, and

222
00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:31.050
that will be background-color #dd5638,
which is our salmon color.

223
00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:39.646
And border,
color will just be a little bit darker so

224
00:12:39.646 --> 00:12:44.550
#d95131 Save.

225
00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:46.662
Check it out.

226
00:12:46.662 --> 00:12:47.685
There we go, that looks good.

227
00:12:47.685 --> 00:12:49.420
Okay, there is our hero section.

228
00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:52.220
Let me do just a really
quick ninja overview.

229
00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:54.280
Because we covered a lot in this one.

230
00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:57.470
So we added our CSS,
we added a whole bunch of CSS here,

231
00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:01.370
feel free to go back and
go through it again because it was a lot.

232
00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:08.198
We added some HTML here for
the header, and then we styled it up.

233
00:13:08.198 --> 00:13:10.831
So, looks good.

234
00:13:10.831 --> 00:13:15.781
Hopefully that didn't make your head hurt
and I'll see you in the next lecture

235
00:13:15.781 --> 00:13:19.940
where we will learn to do
the parallax effect for this section.

236
00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:20.484
See you there.

237
00:13:20.484 --> 00:13:23.804
