00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,450
Hey, everybody.
Welcome back to

2
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:03,320
Boost Your Income with
BootStrap to WordPress.

3
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,886
We're entering a brand new section now
where we're gonna be coding the HTML

4
00:00:07,886 --> 00:00:11,966
templates for the blog overview
page using Bootstrap, of course.

5
00:00:11,966 --> 00:00:16,882
And in this lecture we're gonna be
coding the Basic Markup & Structure for

6
00:00:16,882 --> 00:00:18,375
our blog.html page.

7
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:18,965
Check it out.

8
00:00:18,965 --> 00:00:27,207

9
00:00:27,207 --> 00:00:27,936
All right.

10
00:00:27,936 --> 00:00:29,272
And welcome back.

11
00:00:29,272 --> 00:00:33,270
We're gonna be coding our blog
section here in our static templates.

12
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,880
So, right here, I'm showing you the file
static site that you can also access in

13
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,220
your course files folder in
the final static website section.

14
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,820
And I'm just gonna show you
here what we're gonna build.

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,690
It's quite simple really.

16
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:50,150
It's just a pretty generic but
beautiful blog overview.

17
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,340
You see this,
it's pretty common in a lot of blogs, and

18
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,710
in most blogs actually there's a blog
overview where you see the excerpts of

19
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,480
the blog,
some small snippets of each blog post.

20
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:04,210
And then you can enter those blog
excerpts to see the full posts.

21
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:06,170
Right now,
we're just gonna build the overview, so

22
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,480
this is the blog overview page.

23
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,250
We have a nice header here,
with a parallax background and

24
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,610
just the title of the page
right here in the center.

25
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,832
Scroll down, you'll see each blog excerpt.

26
00:01:18,832 --> 00:01:22,910
We're gonna be coding all this,
each of these boxes here with the title.

27
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,590
All this metadata, I guess we can call it.

28
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,680
Post info, comment bubble.

29
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,040
Just some generic text here with
a continue reading button or link, and

30
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,310
then our feature image.

31
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,580
And then we're just gonna copy
that a couple more times because

32
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,450
we just really need to style one of them.

33
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:45,080
Because in WordPress we're gonna
be using the loop to post and

34
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,190
generate and
display all of the blog posts.

35
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,160
And then we'll also be
coding our sidebars.

36
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,920
But, in this specific lecture, we're going
to just be coding the basic markup so

37
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,130
that we can get going and
hit the ground running.

38
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:06,476
All right, so jump into your code editor
and create a file called blog.html.

39
00:02:06,476 --> 00:02:13,520
Here in the root of your B2W, if that's
what you called it, static site directory.

40
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,420
I called mine B2W,
whatever you called yours,

41
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,540
make sure to create a file called
blog.html right there beside index.

42
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:25,496
First thing you're gonna wanna
do is just do the pretty

43
00:02:25,496 --> 00:02:30,236
much what you would always
do with a plain HTML page,

44
00:02:30,236 --> 00:02:33,252
to help you speed up time though,

45
00:02:33,252 --> 00:02:37,992
what I would recommend is
going to your index file and

46
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:43,188
let's copy everything here
from the body up to the head.

47
00:02:43,188 --> 00:02:44,535
Let's start there.

48
00:02:44,535 --> 00:02:49,470
Paste that and let's get a bit more here.

49
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:57,958
Scroll down to the very bottom and
grab from HTML all the way up to,

50
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:02,880
I believe, footer.

51
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,380
Here we go.

52
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,770
In fact, we're gonna grab
this sign up section as well.

53
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:11,773
So let's grab that, paste that below here.

54
00:03:17,694 --> 00:03:19,654
And let's make sure we got that there.

55
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:24,288
All right, there's our body.

56
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,526
Good, good.

57
00:03:26,526 --> 00:03:28,920
Okay.

58
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,900
So let's save that.

59
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,840
Check it out here in your browser.

60
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,100
Click on blog.

61
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,140
The blog link and
that should go to your blog.html.

62
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,670
And we've got a pretty
funky looking page here.

63
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,162
I notice there's a couple things missing.

64
00:03:42,162 --> 00:03:46,490
We're gonna need to add our header
because that's pretty global.

65
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,700
So let's go ahead, go back to our code.

66
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,590
And we need to grab, up here in our index,

67
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:57,200
scroll up,
right under your opening body tag.

68
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,460
We're actually gonna grab
a few of these things.

69
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,850
Header, we're gonna grab the header.

70
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,040
Copy that.

71
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,270
Paste that in your blog
right under the body here.

72
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,920
Make sure it's in there nice.

73
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,940
Good.

74
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:14,850
Save that.

75
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:15,560
Let's just check it out.

76
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,480
All right.

77
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,780
There is our header.

78
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,620
Great.

79
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,430
We have our footer down here and

80
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,800
the sign up section which
is global on all the pages.

81
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,510
Let's just go ahead, right away,
first of all just make this tab active.

82
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:36,451
So just go to your blog.html, make sure to
go down to your nav here and take active,

83
00:04:36,451 --> 00:04:42,410
the class="active" out of the first
list item, which is home.

84
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,920
Add it to the second one.

85
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,000
Now, you don't need to do
this when we're in WordPress,

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,500
because WordPress will
automatically do that for you.

87
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,450
But just so you can see what
it looks like, there you go.

88
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,530
Boom, there it is.

89
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:59,610
So there is the basic markup structure for
our blog.

90
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:04,070
And basically what we're gonna wanna do
now is make sure we have everything so

91
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,790
that the next lecture we can
start adding our excerpt markup.

92
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,570
I think the first thing I want
to do is go to your body tag.

93
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:14,470
Add the class of blog because we're gonna
be styling the blog page specifically.

94
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,190
And so, if we can add a class
right up here on the body tag,

95
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:21,410
we can dive down into some CSS
by selecting class="blog", and

96
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:24,770
then anything within it, so
we can style those things specifically.

97
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,955
Just gonna make sure
everything's good here.

98
00:05:30,578 --> 00:05:35,670
After header, that's where we're gonna
add our big graphic with the title and

99
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,430
the parallax background.

100
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,065
We'll get there.

101
00:05:38,065 --> 00:05:40,953
And we'll add some more
content right here, basically.

102
00:05:40,953 --> 00:05:45,211
So just get some space and I'll see you
in the next lecture, because that's where

103
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:48,870
we're gonna start coding the markup for
the header and the excerpts.

104
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:49,683
And so I'll see you there.

105
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:53,219
