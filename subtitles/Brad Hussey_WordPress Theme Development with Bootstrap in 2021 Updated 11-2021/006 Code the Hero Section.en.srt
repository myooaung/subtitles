00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,150
Hey, everybody.
Welcome back to Boost Your Income with

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:03,340
Bootstrap to WordPress.

3
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:07,060
This lecture is called,
Coding the Hero Section.

4
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:15,433
[MUSIC]

5
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:17,810
All right,
first thing's first on the realest.

6
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:22,430
I mean, open your code editor and
scroll down to your section,

7
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:26,410
that we titled hero in your index file.

8
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,290
Now in this lecture we're going
to be doing a little CSS as well.

9
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:34,150
Throughout this whole course throughout
the Bootstrap part especially

10
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,520
we're going to go back and
forth from our HTML to CSS.

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,850
Just a heads up, it's kind of my
style I like going back and forth.

12
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,040
So we're gonna be adding some classes and
then we're gonna jump over to CSS and

13
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,610
we're gonna style those classes so
we see them in real time.

14
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:50,402
Just as a heads up.

15
00:00:50,402 --> 00:00:54,890
All right,
give that section the ID of hero, and

16
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:58,730
inside, actually let's do that first.

17
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,830
Inside here, let's give an HTML5 article.

18
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,240
Tag div.

19
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,300
And that's going to have
the class of container.

20
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,070
We know what container does.

21
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:13,810
Container gives us that wrapper
inside of our full width section.

22
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:17,750
So, right here, section, this is the full
width of the screen because we haven't

23
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:22,818
given a specific fixed width
on our body of our HTML page.

24
00:01:22,818 --> 00:01:27,420
But, anything with the class
container has a fixed width, or

25
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,930
rather a responsive width, and
is centered in the middle of the page.

26
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,210
So that's where we're going
to be using container.

27
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,590
We'll be using container a lot.

28
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,940
And let's add the clear fix class,

29
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:41,580
because Bootstrap has a class
in their CSS for Clearfix.

30
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:45,410
And that will address the issue that
we will come across here when we

31
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,260
have floated elements within a container
or a div, block level element it will

32
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:56,050
collapse on itself if you don't clear
the elements before the container closes.

33
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:00,250
So Clearfix will fix that for us,
magic, it's beautiful saves me so

34
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,390
much coding time.

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,400
You too.
All right, div class row.

36
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:11,910
This is a Bootstrap class and this will
basically give us some styles so when

37
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:17,120
we add our columns in here, we're gonna
have a grid-based layout in this section.

38
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,720
Row is what you to need initially
code to have your grid within it.

39
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,220
There's documentation on
it at getbootstrap.com.

40
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,160
Make sure to check out the grid section,
and

41
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,120
you will learn all about why you need
to use rows to wrap your columns.

42
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:37,811
Just trust me,
I know what I'm doing, I think.

43
00:02:37,811 --> 00:02:40,700
<div class "col-sm" for small 5.

44
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,435
Let me explain this.

45
00:02:42,435 --> 00:02:46,820
You're gonna see a lot of these col-sm and
then a number.

46
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:52,910
So in Bootstrap they now have a grid based
system where you can use classes and

47
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,360
it's a way more robust grid system.

48
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,300
Let me just open that up for you.

49
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,970
Get bootstrap.com.

50
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,210
Let's check out the CSS.

51
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:04,540
Grid system.

52
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,030
Here it is.
This tells you everything you need to know

53
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,440
about the grid system.

54
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,290
Rows must be placed within a container.

55
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:09,860
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

56
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,200
You can read that if you need to know,
want to know a little bit more.

57
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,920
But here's what you are gonna
concern yourself with, right here.

58
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,320
Call.

59
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,480
XS for or whatever number.

60
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,185
It's also MD, LG and SM.

61
00:03:23,185 --> 00:03:29,080
So here are the Grid options right here,

62
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,090
so extra small devices, small devices,
medium devices and large devices.

63
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,470
Here are the class prefixes that you

64
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,800
need to use if you want the grid
to work on those devices.

65
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,320
So, for example, on a mobile device, if
you don't want your three column grid to

66
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,158
collapse down into
a totally vertical layout,

67
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:50,225
then use col-xs and then whatever number.

68
00:03:50,225 --> 00:03:56,601
So if you have three columns,
then you'll use cal-xs4,

69
00:03:56,601 --> 00:04:01,460
so on and so forth, and that will
maintain the grid layout for you.

70
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,200
You'll see what I'm talking
about as we start coding, but

71
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,830
if you're unfamiliar with the new
version of Bootstrap, go ahead and

72
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,640
read the grid documentation here.

73
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,260
It's pretty interesting, and
I think it will blow your mind.

74
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,268
Maybe not blow your mind, but
you'll find it interesting.

75
00:04:15,268 --> 00:04:20,160
Okay, col-sm-5,
that means for small devices,

76
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,186
maintain the layout, but on mobile
devices, just stack it vertically.

77
00:04:24,186 --> 00:04:29,780
All right, so
let's just add our columns first,

78
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,430
just so we can see div class,
needs to add up to 12.

79
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,620
So what is 12 minus 5?

80
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:40,850
I believe that is 7, and

81
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,920
this class will also be hero text because
we're going to use some CSS to style our

82
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,570
hero text, and
we'll get there, don't worry.

83
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,910
Okay so here we go,
inside our container we have a row,

84
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:58,080
inside our row we have some columns,
these columns add up to 12, 5+7 is 12.

85
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,620
So we'll have on one side five columns and

86
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:07,590
on the other side seven columns
where our hero text will be there.

87
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:17,250
Okay, inside our first one let's add
an image assets/image/logo-badge.png.

88
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,870
That is in your image folder,
feel free to check that out.

89
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:28,890
Bootstrap to Wordpress it's the really
big badge, and this will have

90
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:35,330
the class of logo, because we're going
to style that, so give that a look.

91
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,660
There you go, there it is.

92
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,950
All right here, we're going to add
a level one heading and say Bootstrap to

93
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:49,060
Word Press, and then we're gonna have
a paragraph with the class of Lead.

94
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,450
That's a Bootstrap class.

95
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,390
It makes your paragraph tag
just a little bit bigger.

96
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,960

Code Your Very Own Responsive Custom
WordPress Websites with Bootstrap.

98
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:01,970
Go ahead and type that out.

99
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,620
If you don't wanna type out the exact
same thing, write whatever you want, or

100
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,734
use some more.

101
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:12,520
Why don't we give that a look?

102
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,100
It's there, but something's going on here,

103
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,480
because you can see it's
collapsing in under our nav.

104
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,780
That's because our nav is
a fixed navigation bar,

105
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,420
and we're going to need to use
some CSS to pop that down.

106
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,610
Don't worry about it, we will do that, but

107
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,880
first let's add the rest of the content,
and then we'll style it up.

108
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:33,921
Okay, nside our div,
we're going to add another div, the ID of

109
00:06:33,921 --> 00:06:38,974
price-timeline.

110
00:06:38,974 --> 00:06:45,180
And here,
we will put the timeline of the prices for

111
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:50,877
this specific course, price and

112
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:53,920
active.

113
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,560
So that is a class I'll be using.

114
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:04,280
So we're gonna have a couple more of
these, but not with active on all of them.

115
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,500
Just price, price and price.

116
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,472
Inside here,
let's add a level four heading, and

117
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:14,830
say Pre-Launch Price, and

118
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:19,920
then in a small tag, let's say Ends soon!

119
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,940
Then, after that, we're gonna add
a span tag, and put the actual price.

120
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:32,730
So, let's say $149, copy this so you don't
have to write up the same markup again,

121
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:37,566
paste it in the next price,
change this to launch price and

122
00:07:37,566 --> 00:07:43,868
let's just say coming soon and
that price will be $299.

123
00:07:43,868 --> 00:07:50,910
Paste again and this will be Final price,

124
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:57,030
and that again will be coming soon and
that price, let's make it $399.

125
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:01,410
Give that a save, check it out.

126
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:06,620
Okay, so here we have pre-launch and
soon launch and final price.

127
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,800
Great, we have our content.

128
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,150
We'll style it eventually.

129
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:14,360
And one last thing here,
let's add a paragraph tag.

130
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:20,050
Inside that paragraph tag, let's add
an A tag with a class of BTN for button.

131
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,860
Button large and button danger.

132
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,590
These are all bootstrap classes built in.

133
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,160
So this is gonna style
this button real nice.

134
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,680
It's gonna be a button.

135
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,220
It's gonna be a large button, and

136
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,460
it's gonna have button with the color that
is associated with danger, which is red.

137
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,600
And that will have an href of,
right now let's just put root,

138
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,440
because we'll put
an actual link eventually.

139
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,250
Role, button Semantic.

140
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:55,410
Enroll, and then let's put HTML
entity RA quo for right arrow quote.

141
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,305
Save that, check it out.

142
00:08:57,305 --> 00:09:00,990
There's our enroll button and
it looks nice and

143
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,990
it has all the styles pre-built in
we didn't have to CSS that at all.

144
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,630
Gonna stop you right there.

145
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,020
We're getting a little
long with this lecture.

146
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,890
We're at about nine minutes, five seconds.

147
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,870
I don't like my lectures to be too long.

148
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:15,800
I like them to be bite-sized snippets, so

149
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,610
it's not too much content
to take in at once.

150
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:21,140
I know I said at the beginning of the
lecture that we're gonna be using some CSS

151
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,370
in this lecture.

152
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,590
Not.
We're gonna be doing some CSS for

153
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,480
this section in the next lecture.

154
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,710
So consider it the same lecture,
just part B.

155
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:34,187
So see ya in the next lecture where
we're gonna be styling our hero.

156
00:09:34,187 --> 00:09:37,599
