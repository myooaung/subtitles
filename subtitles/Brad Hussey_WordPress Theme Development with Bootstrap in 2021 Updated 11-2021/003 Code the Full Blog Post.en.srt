00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,990
Hey there welcome back to boost your
income with Bootstrap to WordPress,

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,840
this lecture we're gonna code
the full blog post section.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,474
So good, check it out.

4
00:00:11,474 --> 00:00:17,031

5
00:00:17,031 --> 00:00:21,170
Hey welcome back, what we're gonna do now
is clean up the full blog post page or

6
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,750
template, which is this specific one right
here, which obviously doesn't look very

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,640
good because we haven't done anything
to match our final domain design,

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,300
which looks like this,
which is our static site.

9
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,490
And the other thing that we're going
to do is clean up the side bar because,

10
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,750
if you look here on our blog excerpt and

11
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:44,000
what will be our full blog page,
the sidebar doesn't look very good.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,900
The headers are too big,

13
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,790
and just the margins are a little
too spaced out between the headers.

14
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:51,890
And it's pretty easy to fix,
so we're gonna do that.

15
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,060
So, let's head back to our code editor.

16
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,020
And you're gonna need
to open two templates.

17
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,579
First you'll need to open single.php.

18
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,510
Single.php is the template for
displaying all single posts.

19
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,420
Now, it's not the content, it's
the template, or wrapper outside of it.

20
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,780
And so this is what's gonna
allow us to add the wrappers for

21
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,230
the main content and the sidebar.

22
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,270
Pretty easy.

23
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,670
So follow along.

24
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:21,040
So what you'll need to do is open up
your post.html from your static site.

25
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,430
We're just going to grab some
of the market from right here.

26
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:23,980
Not very much.

27
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,290
We're just going to grab
from the container,

28
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:29,590
right under the main content comment here.

29
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,220
And end here at call small 8.

30
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,840
So copy that.

31
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,850
Go back to your single, and
replace these two tags.

32
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,920
So remove these ones and replace
them with the ones you just copied.

33
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,460
Make sure they're lined up nicely.

34
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:50,540
Okay, and we might as well
just make this the tag main

35
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:55,415
because it makes more semantic sense and
that's what it is usually in WordPress.

36
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,430
I you can use a HTML5 tag, why not?

37
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:00,550
You can leave it as the div but
let's change it to main.

38
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,920
As long as we make sure
to close the ending tag.

39
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,470
So now what we gotta do is
close these tags up here, so

40
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:10,250
we're basically going to remove these and
close up the correct ones.

41
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,230
First we're gonna have to close up main.

42
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,242
That's the ID of content.

43
00:02:17,242 --> 00:02:22,188
And then we've gotta close up the primary,
which is the ID of primary, and

44
00:02:22,188 --> 00:02:24,160
then close up the container.

45
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,500
But we also have the sidebar we need
to add, and that is in our post.html.

46
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,330
We just need to get the aside tag,
that's all.

47
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:42,490
And that's gonna be included after the
main tag, and then close up that aside.

48
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:49,280
And in between there,
you just have to php get_sidebar.

49
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,040
But make sure to remove the one down here,
cuz we don't want two of them.

50
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,760
So we got our sidebar.

51
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,950
I'm just gonna add a section title here,
an HTML comment, SIDEBAR.

52
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,890
And then up here I'm gonna the same
I'm just gonna tab this stuff in.

53
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,000
All right, looking good.

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,315
Give that a quick check here,
and looks pretty good.

55
00:03:08,315 --> 00:03:10,015
It's coming together.

56
00:03:10,015 --> 00:03:12,765
Obviously we have some
things left to do here.

57
00:03:12,765 --> 00:03:16,145
And now, to fix the rest of this,
go back to your code editor, and

58
00:03:16,145 --> 00:03:18,675
jump into content single,
because as you can see here,

59
00:03:18,675 --> 00:03:22,784
we're getting a template part and
its content-single, right here.

60
00:03:22,784 --> 00:03:27,792
And then, content-single, we're
basically just going to copy a lot of

61
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:32,799
what we did from the previous lecture
where we did the content excerpt, or

62
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,820
not specifically content excerpt, it was
content.php, but it was the blog excerpt.

63
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,590
And that was in content.php.

64
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,320
And go ahead and
grab the entire header tag.

65
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,250
And everything in it.

66
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,380
Copy that.

67
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,720
Go back to your content single.

68
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,750
And then, replace the header
tag with your own header tag.

69
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:01,270
And then, get rid of the entry content and
the entry footer but

70
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,510
leave the article, closing article tag.

71
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:10,020
And in here go back to your content
PHP and copy the rest of it,

72
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,480
post image, post excerpt, but we're gonna
change something once we paste it in here.

73
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,910
Instead of post excerpt,
it's gonna be called post body, and

74
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,020
then this instead of the excerpt
will be the content.

75
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,924
Save that, now go back.

76
00:04:24,924 --> 00:04:26,820
And we pretty much have
everything in there.

77
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,920
So what we're gonna do
to fix this is actually,

78
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,790
not necessarily in the styles at all,
you can, you can jump into your CSS and

79
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,670
style the headers of these widgets but
the fact is the default is

80
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:43,870
that these widgets have level
one headings as their headers.

81
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:48,380
So we can jump back and style those
headers, but what would be better, and

82
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:52,290
more semantic is to change the source
code altogether, change the markup so

83
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,610
it's not a level one heading.

84
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,850
So we'll go back to your
functions on PHP and

85
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,000
scroll down to the register widget area.

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,440
It should be around line 74.

87
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,580
And then you'll see your sidebars here.

88
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,640
And you can register multiple side bars.

89
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,390
And you can see here before title,

90
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,510
change this from level one
heading to level four heading.

91
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,330
And after title close that tag.

92
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,630
Level four heading, save that.

93
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,620
Go back.

94
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,170
Quick check.

95
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:16,900
There you go.

96
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,880
Looks exactly like it should.

97
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,540
Okay, that's it for this lecture.

98
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,930
In the next lecture we're gonna jump
down here to the comments section and

99
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,020
style this up so
it looks a lot better than this.

100
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:31,879
See you there.
