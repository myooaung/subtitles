Hey everybody.
Welcome back to Boost Your Income with

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,060
Bootstrap To WordPress.

3
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,720
We're in an brand new section now called
Information Architecture where we focus

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,360
a little bit more on the specific blue
printing details of web design and

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:12,910
development.

6
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:17,682
This specific lecture is called
why you must always start your web

7
00:00:17,682 --> 00:00:19,338
design with a sketch.

8
00:00:19,338 --> 00:00:27,501
[MUSIC]

9
00:00:27,501 --> 00:00:30,821
All right, so let's talk about
sketching or, more specifically,

10
00:00:30,821 --> 00:00:33,270
let's use the proper term, wireframing.

11
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,720
Wireframing is an important step in
web design, and it's often overlooked.

12
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:42,130
Think of wireframing as
the blueprints of web design.

13
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:47,000
Let's use a different
sort of analogy here.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,340
When you are building a house,
you don't just start taking wood and

15
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,730
just hammering it together.

16
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:56,400
If you have house building experience,
you know that's not right.

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,820
You don't just do that.

18
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,330
Because you overlook things like
where's the electrical going to go,

19
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,070
where are we going to put the plumbing.

20
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,640
How is the plumbing gonna
run through the house?

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,730
Where are the doors?

22
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:06,880
How are the doors gonna open?

23
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,340
Which direction?

24
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,250
Does that door get in the way of this?

25
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,710
Or is there something
blocking that entrance?

26
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,590
What about windows?

27
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,740
Where are the windows gonna be?

28
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,480
Electrical outlets?

29
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,980
Things like that have been
very important steps.

30
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,570
The layout of the house needs to
be blueprinted and sketched out.

31
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:30,670
Before you even pick up a hammer and
a nail, the same goes for web design.

32
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:35,795
The blueprint, or the wireframe,
needs to be laid out and sketched out.

33
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:42,750
Before you start opening Photoshop or
writing a line of code.

34
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,350
The reason why is,

35
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,900
it lets you work out all the details
before you get too far into the project.

36
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,000
So, if you just jump into designing and
you don't even think like,

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,190
this is where we're going
to put the carousel.

38
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:56,410
This is we're gonna put the contact page,
content, it's fine over here.

39
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,770
We'll throw a sidebar there.

40
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:58,990
Lots of websites have that.

41
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,630
Great, we're good.

42
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,960
You don't even think about usability.

43
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,160
You don't think about the architecture.

44
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,410
You don't think about important elements
because your head is somewhere else.

45
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,800
You're in a creative process.

46
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,120
This is a more logical process.

47
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,590
You need to see the steps,
you need to see the outline, and

48
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:18,530
you can work out details before you
even get farther into the project.

49
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,160
The reason why is because you're just
looking at the black and white boxes and

50
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,350
lines that you sketched out on pen and
paper or in Photoshop.

51
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:31,490
You're just sketching out
just a rough draft, and

52
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,600
it's easy to say, scrap that,
that doesn't look good.

53
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,970
Let's try this layout.

54
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,610
Let's discuss that with the client.

55
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,090
What are we putting a sidebar there?

56
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,349
What kind of content goes there?

57
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,340
Where should we put this?

58
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,720
Where should we put that?

59
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,160
It's easy to modify a wireframe,

60
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,160
cuz you're just sketching something
out on pen and paper or in Photoshop.

61
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,550
It's just,
it's really easy to hash out the details.

62
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:56,270
A few of the reasons why it's
important to wireframe is because

63
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,260
usability becomes important.

64
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,900
You focus on where the links are,
the navigation structure.

65
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,910
Certain elements.

66
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,110
What is more important?

67
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,400
Why is that placed on the page?

68
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,640
Let's think about the usability
a little bit more.

69
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,990
And that's what wieframing lets you do.

70
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:20,320
The design process also becomes a bit more

71
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,650
easy because you're just
sketching out your layouts and

72
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,920
your design elements on paper or
on Photoshop.

73
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,570
And once you've kind of worked
through the perfect layout,

74
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,240
you can then jump into Photoshop and
you'll already know what you're designing.

75
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,450
You're not just thinking of something off
the top of your head as you are adding

76
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:43,068
colors and fonts and background images,
and all this and all that.

77
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:49,380
So basically, it's an important
process that's often overlooked,

78
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:54,510
because people think of it as boring,
or not important.

79
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,290
But it works.

80
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:01,750
Whenever I sketch a website layout out,
I can see, oh, that doesn't make sense.

81
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,590
Why am I doing that?

82
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:08,520
Or maybe this needs to be in a more
important spot or that's not gonna work.

83
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:16,620
Or it's easy to have an iterative process
with your team members or with your client

84
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,280
and without jumping into a full design and
having your client say I don't like that.

85
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,140
What if we switch something up here?

86
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,910
Then you're putting way more
work in than you need to.

87
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,810
If you just have boxes and lines.

88
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,420
You can drag and
drop stuff around no problem.

89
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,240
Because you're just sketching stuff out.

90
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,010
It's easy.

91
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,210
It's a very easy and

92
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:38,910
simple process that is fundamental
in the success of your project.

93
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:42,530
So now that we've covered that,
let's jump into the next lecture.

94
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:46,540
I'm gonna show you a couple resources
that you can use to wireframe.

95
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,350
That professional web designers and
developers use to wireframe.

96
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:50,889
I'll see you there.

97
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:53,803
