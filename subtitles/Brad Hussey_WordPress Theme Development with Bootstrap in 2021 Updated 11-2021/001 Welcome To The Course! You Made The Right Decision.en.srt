00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,430
Hey, everybody, welcome to Bootstrap to WordPress.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,160
I'm your instructor, Brad.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,020
Hey, everybody.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,410
What's up?

5
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,310
Brad Hussie here and welcome to Bootstrap to WordPress.

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,380
A little while since I first published this course, but you know what, the numbers don't lie.

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:25,760
We've got a lot of students here, tens of thousands of them with just as many positive reviews.

8
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:30,940
The only downside, however, is that the course needs a little updating.

9
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,560
Well, that's what I'm working on right now.

10
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:41,290
It's really interesting to go through these videos and just see the tone and the style and the delivery

11
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,610
that I used to do.

12
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:47,770
I've done so many tutorials and videos and that, you know, I've I've just gotten better and better

13
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:48,280
over time.

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,590
So it's just funny when I see the intro video and I just kind of cringe to me like.

15
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:59,920
Hey, everybody, Brad Hussie here and welcome to Bootstrap to WordPress.

16
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:07,370
We're going to have lots of fun, as you can tell, I'm very excited to do this and I'm using the same

17
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,540
headphones, not even plugged in.

18
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:16,670
We're going to be learning how to build WordPress websites with Bootstrap as the foundation framework

19
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:21,680
and under it so that you can build beautiful websites that are responsive in nature.

20
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,770
That doesn't look like a standard bootstrap Web site.

21
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:31,130
You're going to be able to convert any HTML and Kausar static site into a custom WordPress website,

22
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:36,980
have a better understanding of piece so that you can build more WordPress Web sites and play around

23
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:37,610
under the hood.

24
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:42,590
In WordPress, you're going to understand what's most important about custom post type and advanced

25
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,030
custom fields and WordPress.

26
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:50,330
It allows you to customize things and kind of create your own content management system within the WordPress

27
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,160
environment.

28
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:57,170
And that also is a benefit to your clients because you can customize what it is that they update and

29
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,510
edit on their sites.

30
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,580
So while going to bootstrap the WordPress, we're going to have a lot of fun.

31
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,080
And let's do this.
