00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,960
Hey, everyone, welcome back to Boost
Your Income with Bootstrap to WordPress.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,090
This lecture is called,

3
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:08,620
Code the "Boost Your Income" Section
using Advanced Custom Fields.

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:17,242
Check it out.
[MUSIC]

5
00:00:17,242 --> 00:00:20,854
All right, and so what we want to do
now is take this section right here,

6
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,640
the How You Can Boost Your Income section.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,900
And convert it to a dynamic section,

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,380
that you can easily update
using advanced custom fields.

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,500
Super easy.

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,590
Check it out.

11
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,150
Let's go to Dashboard.

12
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,140
Click on Custom Fields.

13
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,895
What we're gonna do is click Add New.

14
00:00:37,895 --> 00:00:43,090
And then we need to enter a title for
a field group.

15
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:45,090
And you'll see what
a field group is shortly.

16
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:50,040
Basically, it's a group of
form inputs that we want to

17
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,040
create that we can use to enter
information into the database.

18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:59,200
Which we then pull that information out of
the database to display it in our template

19
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,810
on our page.

20
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,840
So let's call this
Boost Your Income Section.

21
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,090
And then we're going to add a field.

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,090
And then here we can add a bunch
of information about our field.

23
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,450
So the first one we wanna add
is a section for this image.

24
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,620
We wanna be able to have people
upload an image for that section.

25
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,510
So let's say, income feature image.

26
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:28,360
And then it gives a field name and
that's what we'll use to

27
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,060
grab the information out of
the database in our template.

28
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,150
The field type is going to be an image.

29
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:38,200
And then you can give field instructions.

30
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,180
So if you'd like you can put
some instructions here so

31
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,550
it makes more sense on the front end.

32
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:48,120
So let's say upload an image for
this section.

33
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,240
Required let's say No.

34
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,050
You don't have to have that.

35
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:55,320
Return value, you can have
an Image Object, Image URL or Image ID.

36
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,500
We're not gonna do the ID.

37
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,880
We're basically in between object or URL.

38
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,010
So URL gives you the actual
URL of the image.

39
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:07,240
Or the object,
which is the actual image itself,

40
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,300
which would be an array of information.

41
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,910
So let's stick with Image Object and
Preview Size.

42
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:17,640
So the preview size shown when entering
the data, when you're in the dashboard,

43
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,260
do you want it to be a thumbnail,
medium, large or full?

44
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,400
Let's just keep it as, let's say medium.

45
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,250
Library we limit the media
library choice so,

46
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,800
it will be the global library or
library that's uploaded to the post.

47
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,682
Let's keep is as the global library.

48
00:02:32,682 --> 00:02:36,630
Conditional Logic, we don't need to
do this, basically, this would mean

49
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:41,650
if we added another field, that was
a check box, you could have a check

50
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:47,050
box that would say something like,
do you want to add a feature image?

51
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:51,960
And then if they checked yes,
then you could say, conditional logic, and

52
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:57,090
it would give you a field here
that says include feature image,

53
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,180
and then is equal to true, and
this section will show up.

54
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,130
We're not gonna do that right now.

55
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,810
You don't have to worry about it.

56
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,410
So there you go, that field's in there.

57
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:08,900
The next one we want to add
is the image section title.

58
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,480
So we're gonna add another field.

59
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,215
And let's close this field up so
it's a bit smaller.

60
00:03:13,215 --> 00:03:14,860
Just click on that there.

61
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,970
Income Section Title.

62
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,450
Income section title, there it is.

63
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,560
Field Type,
we want it to be just basic text.

64
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,550
We don't need a field instruction here.

65
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,020
If you like to then sure.

66
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:25,900
Let's make it required.

67
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,490
And you don't need to add
any of these other things,

68
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,350
except let's change this to No formatting.

69
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,450
We don't want to have people
put HTML in there at all.

70
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:39,300
You could put placeholder text if
you'd like just as like helper text,

71
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:39,860
but you don't need to.

72
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,490
And you could limit the characters
that you want people to add, but

73
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,050
I'm gonna leave that as is.

74
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:44,860
Close this field up.

75
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,970
Let's add another field.

76
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:52,200
And this is gonna be
the Income Section Description.

77
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,560
That gives us an auto generated field
name and this will be a text area.

78
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm going to put some field instructions.

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,960
Enter, Required?

80
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,126
Yes.

81
00:04:02,126 --> 00:04:05,440
And formatting, converting your lines
into break tags or convert to HTML tags,

82
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,570
leave them as break tags.

83
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,470
And then close the field up.

84
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:12,220
Great.
The next one you want to be able to do is,

85
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,020
we have these two sections down here.

86
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:18,100
We have two reasons, or two ways that you
could boost your income with this course.

87
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,850
So, we're gonna call that reason one and
reason two and there's a title and

88
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:23,450
a description.

89
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,570
So we're gonna say reason one title,
reason one description.

90
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,430
Reason two title, reason two description.

91
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,330
So let's go in and do that.

92
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,200
Add a Field.

93
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,290
Let's say Reason One title.

94
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,300
There we go.

95
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,160
It's gonna be text.

96
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,730
Required?

97
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:40,930
Yes.

98
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:44,530
And don't convert, so
No formatting at all, no HTML.

99
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,230
Close that up.

100
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,990
Add another field.

101
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,250
This will be Reason One Description.

102
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,690
And this is going to be text area.

103
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,940
Required.

104
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,670
And leave it as break tags.

105
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,880
Close that up.

106
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,330
Cool.
And now we're gonna

107
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,140
duplicate these because we
already have the settings.

108
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,000
We're just gonna rename them.

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,590
So duplicate.

110
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:13,370
I'm just gonna drag this down
below here so I'm not confused.

111
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,202
And edit this.
This is gonna be Reason Two Title,

112
00:05:16,202 --> 00:05:19,830
make sure to change
the subteries int 2_title.

113
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:24,690
They should have the same settings, great.

114
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,620
And then duplicate the description.

115
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:32,340
This is going to be
Reason Two Description and

116
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,495
then make sure to change this so
it's not reason description copy.

117
00:05:35,495 --> 00:05:39,420
reason_2_description.

118
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,080
Text area.

119
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,290
We're all good for the settings.

120
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:45,140
Close that field up and
drag that below the Reason Two Title.

121
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:49,410
Now, what you can do if you wanna
make it a little bit easier to see

122
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:53,180
on the front end is you can
organize these into tabs.

123
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,415
Now before we do that I wanna,

124
00:05:54,415 --> 00:06:00,320
I'm gonna show you what this looks like as
is before we start doing any fancy stuff.

125
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,990
I'll just show you how this works.

126
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:07,730
So technically once you publish this
you'll have this field group but

127
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:12,530
it's not associated with any post,
page or entry at all.

128
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:17,300
So, we need to be able to show this field
group when you're on a certain page or

129
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,270
within a location, and that's what
this section is right here, location.

130
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,690
Create a set of rules to determine which
edit screens will use these advanced

131
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:25,910
custom fields.

132
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,450
So, show this field group if,

133
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:32,010
and then it gives you a bunch of options
to be able to display this field.

134
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:35,440
So we want this to
display on the home page.

135
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,630
So page is equal to home.

136
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,440
There we go.

137
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,060
So this will display only on
the home page when you're editing.

138
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,340
Down here are the options.

139
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,399
You can choose the order

140
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,260
field groups that are created
in order from lowest to highest.

141
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,160
So if you wanted to override that and

142
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,950
put a number where you'd
want this field to display.

143
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:57,460
So if you have a bunch of fields that
are displaying the home page, and

144
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,980
you want this one to be the top,
you'd put zero.

145
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,460
If you have another one and

146
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,009
you wanted it to be in the third position,
you'd put two.

147
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,340
So on and so forth.

148
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:10,008
Position normal after content,
high after title, or side bar.

149
00:07:10,008 --> 00:07:14,800
So when you're editing
a page you have the title,

150
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,450
you have the text field, and
then you have the sidebar content.

151
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:22,990
Do you want this to display
after the text fields or

152
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,220
do you want it to be after the title or
in the side bar?

153
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,400
I'm gonna leave it as normal.

154
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:33,480
The style is seamless, no metabox,
or standard WordPress metabox.

155
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:38,800
Basically a metabox, if I said WordPress
metabox, it will display like this.

156
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,770
Like this section right here.

157
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:47,103
We have a big white box that has a title,
which would be the field group title.

158
00:07:47,103 --> 00:07:49,100
And then you have the rest
of it in this white box.

159
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:53,420
Otherwise, it would have no white
background, it would just have this

160
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:57,528
content, whatever your field groups
are on this gray background.

161
00:07:57,528 --> 00:07:59,877
And you'll see what I
mean once we do this, and

162
00:07:59,877 --> 00:08:03,372
then hide on the screen select
the items to hide from the Edit screen,

163
00:08:03,372 --> 00:08:05,980
if multiple field groups
appear on an Edit screen.

164
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,972
And the first field group's
options will be used,

165
00:08:07,972 --> 00:08:09,556
the one with the lowest ordered number.

166
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:14,153
Basically, on your Edit screen, do you
want to be able to show these things,

167
00:08:14,153 --> 00:08:18,490
these are pretty much the default
things that show up on the Edit screen.

168
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:22,830
So Permalink,
Content Editor those things show up,

169
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,840
excerpt you can have
an excerpt by default.

170
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,800
The excerpt you can have on your
Edit screens, Custom Fields,

171
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,280
we use Custom Fields.

172
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,220
Discussion, Comments, the Slug,

173
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:38,480
Author, Format, Featured Image in the side
bar, Categories Tags and Trackbacks.

174
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,030
These are all the things that
are available by default

175
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,860
natively with WordPress when
you're on an Edit screen.

176
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,184
And so let me just show you what I mean,
so I hit Edit Page.

177
00:08:48,184 --> 00:08:50,998
You can see the Title, the Content Area,

178
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:55,030
the Permalink, got the Page Attributes,
Custom Fields.

179
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:59,910
I can use screen Options to show
Discussion, Comments, Slug, Author, and

180
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:03,400
you can see all those down here now
Discussion, Comments, Slug, Author.

181
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,090
Now those are hidden by default, but

182
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:10,540
if you want them totally
removed from the site, or

183
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:15,770
from the Edit screen to clean up the Edit
screen then you can do that here.

184
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:19,840
So I can say I wanna hide Comments,

185
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,620
and Revisions and
I want to hide Format, Featured Image.

186
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,170
But I'm gonna leave that for now,
because it's not going to effect me.

187
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,222
So there we go, I'm gonna publish that.

188
00:09:29,222 --> 00:09:34,383
And that should now be
available on our udemy

189
00:09:34,383 --> 00:09:39,555
editor homepage, so let's refresh this.

190
00:09:39,555 --> 00:09:42,202
So here we go, the booster income section.

191
00:09:42,202 --> 00:09:45,965
So you can see our Field Groups,
Income Featured Image, Upload an Image,

192
00:09:45,965 --> 00:09:49,910
you've got an Image Uploader,
Image Section Title, Section Description,

193
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:53,695
Reason one title,Reason one Description,
Reason two, and reason two.

194
00:09:53,695 --> 00:09:57,243
So this right now is very linear
it just goes all the way down, and

195
00:09:57,243 --> 00:09:59,500
they have these really big form fields.

196
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,018
But I want to organize this a bit better,
and

197
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,090
in fact I do want to remove
this text field right here.

198
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:08,600
So I could do that by going back
to my Edit Field Group, and

199
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,914
I'm gonna say hide the Content Editor.

200
00:10:12,914 --> 00:10:16,475
I don't wanna see that, and
also I want the reason one and

201
00:10:16,475 --> 00:10:21,310
rReason two to be grouped
in their own little tab,

202
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:26,410
so it's not a huge linear
layout on the Edit screen.

203
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:31,007
So I'm gonna add a field I'm just
gonna say Reason number one,

204
00:10:31,007 --> 00:10:34,410
the Field Name, it's gonna say reason_1.

205
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,530
It really doesn't matter
because it's not gonna show,

206
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:40,250
you're not gonna use this
to input any information.

207
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:45,223
All you're gonna do is choose layout tab,

208
00:10:45,223 --> 00:10:49,239
so you lose the Field Name anyway.

209
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:52,118
And conditional logic, so
you don't need to use that for now.

210
00:10:53,674 --> 00:10:55,555
Drag.

211
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:59,184
So here, let me just explain, use tab
field to better organize your Edit screen

212
00:10:59,184 --> 00:11:02,126
by grouping your fields together
under separate tab headings.

213
00:11:02,126 --> 00:11:04,467
At all the fields following
this tab field, or

214
00:11:04,467 --> 00:11:07,730
until another tab field is
defined will be grouped together.

215
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:12,050
Use multiple tabs to divide
your fields into sections.

216
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:16,270
So this is how you do it I'm gonna
put this above Reason one, and

217
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,980
now everything under
here will be in a tab.

218
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:24,740
But I don't want Reason two to be in
a tab, so I'm gonna duplicate this,

219
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:29,790
and this is gonna be Reason two,
and Reason two is gonna start here.

220
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,060
Now I don't need these Titles to be,
so because these are what show up

221
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,220
on the Edit screen, and
they kinda look a little silly.

222
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,860
So I'm actually, and because they're
gonna be in group sections here

223
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:43,060
I'm just gonna say Title.

224
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:49,660
Keep the field name the same though,
you're going to do the same here for

225
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,338
the description.

226
00:11:51,338 --> 00:11:54,140
That's just gonna say Description we're
going to leave the Field Name the same,

227
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:57,196
because that's important for
us to pull that in from the database.

228
00:11:57,196 --> 00:12:01,710
Reason two, change this to just Title.

229
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,920
Obviously leave the Field Name,
and same with the Description, so

230
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,550
I'm gonna call that Description, great.

231
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:14,160
Now if I save that, or
update it, and go back to our

232
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,670
homepage editor you will now see
a different homepage editor.

233
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:24,210
So, here we go, now we have no Content
Editor, we have the same info here, but

234
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,090
now we have Reason one, and Reason two.

235
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:29,080
So, you just add your information for
Reason one, add your information for

236
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,940
Reason two.

237
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,190
This doesn't affect the way you
pull it into your template,

238
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:38,130
it just groups this so
that your editor is a bit more clean.

239
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,890
And then our custom fields
are still down here, and

240
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:42,630
you can already see now how
this is a way better option.

241
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:47,690
Because I could have done this
theoretically in Custom Fields,

242
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:52,680
but I'd have crazy amount of name,
and value pairs.

243
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,960
That would just go all
the way down the screen,

244
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,680
whereas this is a nice little section.

245
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,970
It's very user friendly, and
when your client logs in they can see oh,

246
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:03,030
I'm updating the Booster Income Section.

247
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:06,740
And the cool thing is you can hide these
if you're working on a new section, and

248
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,010
you don't wanna have all
these fields in your face.

249
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:14,050
So basically what we'll
do now is add some info,

250
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,560
and then I'll show you how to
pull that into your template.

251
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,710
So let's start by adding an image.

252
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:24,430
Now we don't have an image for the Booster
Income Section in the Media Library,

253
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:29,290
so that's gonna be in our assets
folder in your Static Site.

254
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:34,090
You have the images and you also have it
in your WordPress site as well in your

255
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:39,610
assets folder in images you should
have the icon called Icon Boost.

256
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,688
So just go ahead, and grab that and
drag it into your Media Library,

257
00:13:43,688 --> 00:13:46,709
Add a Title and Alt Text,
that's good practice.

258
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:51,066
This would be boost your
actually this is just a graph,

259
00:13:51,066 --> 00:13:55,532
so we'll just say Graph Icon,
and the Alt Text will be,

260
00:13:59,642 --> 00:14:05,192
An icon of a graph, great, so there we go.

261
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:06,687
Income Section Title, and

262
00:14:06,687 --> 00:14:10,068
we're just gonna copy this right
from our from our homepage.

263
00:14:10,068 --> 00:14:12,746
Cuz right now it's static, and
we want to make it dynamic, so

264
00:14:12,746 --> 00:14:14,666
let's go ahead and grab that information.

265
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,406
So this is How You Can Boost Your Income
is what the title is.

266
00:14:18,961 --> 00:14:22,739
And copy that, and
go back to your page, the homepage and

267
00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:25,509
paste the Income Section Title in there.

268
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:28,084
Income Section Description,

269
00:14:28,084 --> 00:14:33,241
that would just be that stuff right here,
paste that in here.

270
00:14:33,241 --> 00:14:34,982
Boom, and then Reason one.

271
00:14:38,372 --> 00:14:39,510
You've got make money on the side.

272
00:14:44,061 --> 00:14:46,499
And we got our description down here
of how you can make money on the side.

273
00:14:49,935 --> 00:14:55,206
And then Reason two,
create a full-time income.

274
00:14:55,206 --> 00:14:56,581
Paste that in the Title, and

275
00:14:56,581 --> 00:14:59,687
then the Description we have our
WordPress folder have option.

276
00:15:02,381 --> 00:15:05,190
Paste that in the description,
now go ahead and update that.

277
00:15:06,816 --> 00:15:11,109
Now currently, this isn't going to do
anything, If we were to refresh the page,

278
00:15:11,109 --> 00:15:14,363
it's still gonna look the same
because this is still static.

279
00:15:14,363 --> 00:15:19,225
And it's not pulling from the database,
but it's actually quite simple, so

280
00:15:19,225 --> 00:15:23,512
let's go into our code and
in our home template, page-home.php.

281
00:15:23,512 --> 00:15:27,529
We're gonna pull that information in,
it's now saved in the database.

282
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:29,967
We just need to pull it out,
and it's really easy.

283
00:15:29,967 --> 00:15:34,205
So let's create another section
here in our PHP script called

284
00:15:34,205 --> 00:15:36,005
Advanced Custom Fields.

285
00:15:36,005 --> 00:15:43,435
And right here we're just gonna basically
make a bunch of variables with our fields.

286
00:15:43,435 --> 00:15:48,202
So that we can echo that out using PHP, so

287
00:15:48,202 --> 00:15:52,839
first one is the income feature image.

288
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:56,880
Now this is a variable, and
you can name this whatever, you can say.

289
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:02,057
IFI or incomeImage or whatever.

290
00:16:02,057 --> 00:16:06,929
But I'm gonna call it
income_feature_image because is the same

291
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:10,931
as the field name that is
automatically generated, or

292
00:16:10,931 --> 00:16:16,070
that you can custom add here,
income feature image, the field name.

293
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:20,470
This can be changed to whatever you want,
if you edit in here but,

294
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,340
we're gonna use this, so,
income_feature_image.

295
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,090
That's what I'm gonna call
the variable as well, just so

296
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,720
it's consistent, easy to understand.

297
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,740
I'm not trying to be a hero here.

298
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:32,380
And, in order to grab that
information from the database,

299
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,300
it's actually quite easy.

300
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:39,710
There's two ways, and the most common
way is using the get_field function.

301
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:43,120
And then in here we have a parameter,
we just have to put the field name, and

302
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,960
the field name is income_feature_image and
there we go.

303
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,990
So now the income_feature_image array is
actually gonna be stored in here because

304
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,270
this is actually an array.

305
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:58,330
So we need to be able to grab the image
URL and everything a little bit later.

306
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,540
Let's keep adding our
variables while we're up here,

307
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,540
we have the income Section_title.

308
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:09,020
And we're gonna use get_field as well and

309
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:14,060
that is same deal, income_section_title.

310
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,440
I'm just gonna copy that and paste it in.

311
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,710
Make sure to move the dollar sign.

312
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,840
And then,
we have the income section description.

313
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,195
I'm just gonna say desc.

314
00:17:23,195 --> 00:17:26,810
D-E-S-C, just cuz it's
a little bit shorter.

315
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,270
And then, this'll be get_field.

316
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:33,450
I'm just gonna copy this, and then change
this to income_section_description.

317
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:36,130
This one is actually the full length,
I believe.

318
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:41,500
We'll look in our field group,
income_section_description, yes.

319
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:45,950
Okay, now we have our reasons.

320
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:49,360
I'm gonna copy this whole thing, and

321
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,168
this is gonna be reason_1,
whoops, reason_1.

322
00:17:54,168 --> 00:18:02,828
Get_field will be reason_1_title.

323
00:18:02,828 --> 00:18:07,510
Is that correct?
Yes, reason_1_title.

324
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:13,630
Copy that and this'll be, might as
well make that say reason_1_title.

325
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:20,560
The same thing reason_1 content,
or description, yes.

326
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,990
reason_1_description.

327
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:28,230
And maybe we'll make that
short like I did earlier.

328
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:31,500
Okay, so
reason_1_title reason_1_description.

329
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,630
This will be reason_1_description.

330
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:37,490
Copy both of those cuz you're basically
just gonna change the numbers now.

331
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:38,568
Reason 1 and 2.

332
00:18:38,568 --> 00:18:39,930
And then, reason1 and 2.

333
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,720
There we go.

334
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,730
So, now we have some information for
our first part of that section.

335
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,800
So, why don't we go down and do that.

336
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:53,810
Go down to you Boost Your Income section
that is hard-coded, and let's start off by

337
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:59,410
doing the image because it's actually
the hardest part of this section.

338
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:01,910
So, get some space here.

339
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:04,760
We're going to do some PHP.

340
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,270
And we need to do an if
statement to see if the feature

341
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,690
image exists because it's
not a required field.

342
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:13,690
So we need to actually check to see,
hey is it empty?

343
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,810
Did it upload an image, or what?

344
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:20,950
So I'm going to say if
feature image exists,

345
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,570
and maybe it's not called a feature image.

346
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:23,430
I don't want to confuse you.

347
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,950
If user uploaded an image.

348
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:30,100
There we go, that makes more sense.

349
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:35,750
And then in here we're gonna have PHP, if.

350
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:39,650
So an if statement, this is the basic
skeleton of an if statement here.

351
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,620
Actually, we're gonna do
a shorthand version of this.

352
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:50,020
It's actually kinda neat, so let's go if,
and then in here, not empty.

353
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,720
And that in here we're gonna
have the income feature image.

354
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,032
So that's pulling the array.

355
00:19:58,032 --> 00:20:03,230
So if the array is not empty,
meaning if the user uploaded an image,

356
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,510
then this is how you do the short hand.

357
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,359
You just go like this.

358
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:12,500
So I'm just gonna fix
this PHP script here.

359
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,330
Make it a bit shorter, use up less space.

360
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,520
So copy that out.

361
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,910
So here we have,
if income_feature_image is not empty.

362
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,580
And then this is how you do
the shorthand of the if statement.

363
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:28,200
And the reason why I wanna do this
is because I'm closing the PHP tag.

364
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,040
I could use a bracket here,
like an open curly brace, but

365
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:38,840
I'm just gonna use the colon because now
I can close it like this, PHP andif.

366
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,670
That's one way of doing it.

367
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,899
I could have also just done this.

368
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:44,995
Could have done that,

369
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:47,430
but I wanna do this, just to show
you a different way of doing it.

370
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:52,870
So, in between these PHP tags,
this is if the user uploaded an image.

371
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,430
Very easy.
So, grab this image here,

372
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:01,100
paste that in between your
PHP if statement, and

373
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:05,620
now we need to change this to be dynamic.

374
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:09,933
So let's get rid of this PHP blog info and
the alt.

375
00:21:09,933 --> 00:21:12,511
Okay so we wanna fill these in,
and we have that information.

376
00:21:12,511 --> 00:21:19,050
So this would be PHP echo.

377
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:22,350
Income feature image, but
because it is an array,

378
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:26,910
we need to be able to grab something.

379
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,480
So we're gonna reference
a key within this array.

380
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,680
And that is going to be the URL.

381
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:37,010
That is one of the things that
is saved within this array.

382
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:38,580
We have URL.

383
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,180
And so,
I'm going to grab the URL from that array.

384
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,650
And then Alt.

385
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:48,020
I just wanna echo the income feature image
Alt text that is saved on the image.

386
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:52,623
So, php echol $income_feature_image, and

387
00:21:52,623 --> 00:21:58,920
then in my square brackets here,
reference the alt key.

388
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:04,430
That is saved within the image
object in the advanced custom

389
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:09,450
fields and for more information on
the different keys you can reference

390
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:14,400
in certain fields,
you can go to the advanced custom fields

391
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,800
documentation which is hugely
extensive and really well documented.

392
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,280
So it's a really great reference.

393
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,220
You just have to go to
advancedcustomfields.com,

394
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:26,440
I believe is the website and
then just click on documentation.

395
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,490
Everything's there if you are curious or
confused, running into any problems.

396
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,740
So this should grab our image.

397
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,280
So why don't we just see?

398
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:36,735
Be the first test.

399
00:22:36,735 --> 00:22:40,747
[NOISE] See, if this image is here now.

400
00:22:40,747 --> 00:22:42,060
It looks like it is.

401
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,560
And let's just inspect it and

402
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:48,840
view the source and see if we have
the alt text in there correctly.

403
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,650
An icon of a graph, and
there is the image.

404
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,600
Perfect, that worked out great.

405
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,450
So, let's keep going.

406
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,620
We have a few more things here,
very easy this stuff.

407
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,050
You probably even already
know how to do this.

408
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,778
We're going to fill in this header.

409
00:23:02,778 --> 00:23:07,640
All I have to do is echo
the income section title.

410
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,800
That's all.

411
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,000
Our text here.

412
00:23:12,368 --> 00:23:18,890
Php echo the income_section_description.

413
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:22,040
And now we have the first reason.

414
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,890
So this is PHP.

415
00:23:26,207 --> 00:23:28,470
Echo income.

416
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,710
Oh, sorry.

417
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,578
Reason one title.

418
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:37,060
I'm just gonna copy this so I don't have
to rewrite the PHP script every time and

419
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,630
then paste it here in
between the paragraph tags.

420
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:42,210
Reason_1_description.

421
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:47,376
Copy the h3 and p because you can just
replace these now in this second column.

422
00:23:47,376 --> 00:23:51,758
Reason_2_title and reason_2_desc.

423
00:23:51,758 --> 00:23:53,420
Save that out, check it out.

424
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,650
Now these should be dynamic.

425
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,140
There they are.

426
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:03,730
Now just to prove that they're dynamic and
they're easily updatable or editable.

427
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:10,120
In here in the dashboard, I'm gonna say,
How You Can Boost Your Income and

428
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:15,540
then in here I'm just gonna say YAY!

429
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:21,180
There we go, update and
let's check it out and see if it worked.

430
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,530
How You Can Boost Your Income!

431
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,570
Yay!

432
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:25,330
There we go, it works.

433
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,530
In here I'm just gonna change
that back to what it should be.

434
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,220
Perfect, so
I'm just gonna update that now.

435
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:36,400
And that's all,
that's how we use advanced custom fields.

436
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,330
That was a brief overview.

437
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:40,040
There's a lot more to
advanced custom fields, and

438
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,590
we're actually going to keep going.

439
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,830
There's a lot more that we have to do.

440
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:47,050
So in the next lecture, we're going to
work on the Who Should Take This Course

441
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:49,170
section using of course,
advanced custom fields.

442
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:49,840
Show you a new field.

443
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,390
All right, see you there.
