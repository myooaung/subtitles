Hey everybody, welcome back to Boost
Your Income with Bootstrap to WordPress.

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,710
In this lecture,
we are going to download WordPress.

3
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:22,720

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,769
Okay, I thought before we get into
any super heavy duty WordPress stuff,

5
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:30,850
I wanna keep this intro lecture so simple.

6
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:35,257
It's probably the easiest lecture
you're ever going to do with me.

7
00:00:35,257 --> 00:00:39,591
Navigate to wordpress.org/download.

8
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,910
Click on Download WordPress.

9
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,384
In my case, I have 4.0.

10
00:00:44,384 --> 00:00:47,290
That's what we're gonna be using for
this course.

11
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:54,460
If yours is later, feel free to use the
newest version if you are a risk taker.

12
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,170
You might come across some bugs
as we go through the development.

13
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,237
If you want to start off a little easier,
I've included in

14
00:01:02,237 --> 00:01:07,550
the Download WordPress B folder,
in the course files, WordPress 4.0.

15
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,712
Feel free to use that during
the duration of this course

16
00:01:11,712 --> 00:01:14,920
while we're building the site.

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,680
But afterwards,

18
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,760
immediately upgrade to the future version
that you might see at this point.

19
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,710
And then do some debugging.

20
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,005
All right, so there's WordPress, or
you could just download it right here.

21
00:01:30,005 --> 00:01:31,440
Make sure it downloaded properly.

22
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,190
There we go, I've got it.

23
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,700
It's right there.

24
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,590
That's all.

25
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,510
See you in the next lecture.

26
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,979
