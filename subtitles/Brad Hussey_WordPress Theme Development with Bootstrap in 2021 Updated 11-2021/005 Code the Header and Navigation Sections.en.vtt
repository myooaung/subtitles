00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.110
Hey everybody, welcome back to Boost
Your Income with Bootstrap to WordPress.

2
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:08.220
This lecture is called Coding
the Header and Navigation Section.

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:16.463
[MUSIC]

4
00:00:16.463 --> 00:00:20.440
All right, so the first thing we
wanna do is open up our code editor.

5
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.950
And make sure to open
your index.html file,

6
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.150
the file that we've been working with.

7
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.280
And in this lecture we're gonna
be adding our header section

8
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.655
with the navigation bar and
we're gonna be using some bootstrap.

9
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.370
HTML with some CSS classes in there, so

10
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.700
that we can utilize the bootstrap
CSS that is pre-built.

11
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.017
And on that thought, I already know,

12
00:00:49.017 --> 00:00:53.793
that we haven't included
a link to our bootstrap CSS.

13
00:00:53.793 --> 00:00:56.600
That's incredibly important.

14
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.870
So why don't we right here,
under our title.

15
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.020
Before we start anything,
this will save some headaches.

16
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:10.770
Add a comment here, Bootstrap core CSS,
and under there we're gonna add a link.

17
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:18.800
And the href will be
assets/CSS/bootstrap.min,

18
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.990
now CSS using min because it's
minified and takes less time to load.

19
00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.540
Plus we won't be modifying the CSS.

20
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.730
So we don't need to access
the full readable CSS file.

21
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.070
That'll save some time, rel stylesheet.

22
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.180
Great.

23
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.120
And save that.

24
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.150
Now, we have access to
our Bootstrap course CSS.

25
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.950
Now, let's jump right in and start coding.

26
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.530
So in here, in our header.

27
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:51.260
Why don't we get started right away, and
give this header class of site-header.

28
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.654
And the role banner role is an attribute.

29
00:01:54.654 --> 00:01:59.820
It just gives us a little bit more,
makes the code a little more semantic.

30
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.060
Class site header, we'll probably use
that a little bit later in WordPress, and

31
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.830
it just makes our code
a little bit more semantic.

32
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.595
So we know that this
header is the site header,

33
00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:12.430
cuz we will likely use the header,
HML somewhere else throughout the site.

34
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:20.770
Okay, within our header,
let's add a comment, html comment.

35
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.540
This will be NAVBAR.

36
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.850
All right.
Let's do a div.

37
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:33.077
Let's give that div
the class of navbar-wrapper.

38
00:02:33.077 --> 00:02:38.935
That is a Bootstrap class and
I just like adding comments here.

39
00:02:38.935 --> 00:02:45.140
Navbar-wrapper so I know,
that that is the ending div.

40
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.980
And in here we're gonna add
a bunch of bootstrap html.

41
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.460
I'll show you what I'm going to be coding.

42
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.280
So I'll code this really fast here, but
I'll show you where you can reference it.

43
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.290
You can obviously
reference the final static.

44
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.180
HTML file or right here and

45
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.010
get getbootstrap.com/components, if you
were to go to navbar, the default navbar.

46
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.910
They give you code right here,
that you can just copy.

47
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.480
So this code right here
gives you this navbar.

48
00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.590
Our navbar obviously, looks different.

49
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.200
It's very simple.

50
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.660
We have the logo brand right here and

51
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.490
just a few navigation
items pulled to the right.

52
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.160
So you would basically use
all of this HTML here, but

53
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.110
you remove the HTML that
you don't actually need.

54
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.480
We don't need the drop downs.

55
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.440
We don't need the search.

56
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.700
We don't need all that sort of stuff.

57
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.380
And I've already done that and
included it in the static HTML file.

58
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.570
But I'll go ahead and code that right now.

59
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.900
And the CSS classes that
you'll see that I'm using,

60
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.990
those are the built in
Bootstrap CSS classes.

61
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.710
So if you're confused thinking Brad,

62
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.610
what are all these classes you're
just coming off the top of your head?

63
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:53.920
They're actually Bootstrap classes.

64
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.600
You can reference them and
see them in the actual Bootstrap CSS

65
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.410
if you want to know a little
bit more about what they do.

66
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.080
But this course isn't necessarily about
how Bootstrap works and how the CSS works.

67
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.220
It's basically, let's use Bootstrap
to build a website real fast.

68
00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.451
So here we go, real fast,
let's code this navbar.

69
00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:14.110
All right.

70
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.990
So div,
we're gonna give it the class of navbar.

71
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:20.860
Again, and
these are all Bootstrap classes.

72
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.740
Also, navbar-inverse,

73
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.235
this is gonna make the navbar
black rather than white or gray.

74
00:04:27.235 --> 00:04:33.460
Navbar-fixed-top, that is going to
make the navbar fixed at the top.

75
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.570
So when you scroll down it will
always stay at the very top.

76
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.480
Role, navigation,
makes just a little bit more semantic

77
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:48.400
and inside of here, let's just give
that a comment and say navbar.

78
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.820
I like when I can see,
what my div's are doing.

79
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.990
Div, we're going to give that the class
of container, that's going to wrap.

80
00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.103
That's a Bootstrap class.

81
00:05:00.829 --> 00:05:07.370
And it will give us
the content inside the navbar.

82
00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.040
Right now, the navbar's full, but

83
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.560
we want the content within it,
our brand logo and the navigation items.

84
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.670
We want those to be within a container.

85
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.290
That is centered in
the middle of the screen.

86
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:18.720
So that's what that is going to do.

87
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.410
Bam.
Just like that.

88
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.910
Real easy.

89
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.018
Div class navbar/header.

90
00:05:29.695 --> 00:05:33.350
Again, make sure you have
class inside navbar header.

91
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:38.348
We're going to add a button,
and that button will have

92
00:05:38.348 --> 00:05:42.694
the type of button,
the class navbar toggle and

93
00:05:42.694 --> 00:05:48.236
basically what this is gonna do
it's gonna toggle the navbar

94
00:05:48.236 --> 00:05:53.530
when it's responsive when
you shrink the website.

95
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:58.414
You'll get a little sandwich icon that
you can click to toggle the navbar, and

96
00:05:58.414 --> 00:06:01.158
that's what Bootstrap will be doing here.

97
00:06:01.158 --> 00:06:09.475
Data toggle,
this is a Bootstrap attribute,

98
00:06:09.475 --> 00:06:13.740
collapse data target,

99
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:19.072
bootstrap attribute class,

100
00:06:19.072 --> 00:06:23.780
so .navbar-collapse.

101
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:30.060
So these things just so, I can like be
very minimal about my explanation here,

102
00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.210
these are just default Bootstrap
attributes and classes.

103
00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.660
They're on the getbootstrap.com website.

104
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:41.220
All the documentation there is if you
want to know, what these are all about.

105
00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.320
But essentially, all you need to
know is they work, so use them.

106
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.730
All right.
Span, we're gonna have some spans here.

107
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.750
This first one, class sr only.

108
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.680
That's a Bootstrap class for
screen readers only.

109
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.020
It will only show this text,
toggle navigation.

110
00:06:59.132 --> 00:07:01.902
If you're visiting the site from
a screen reader which is good.

111
00:07:01.902 --> 00:07:05.850
People with visual impairment or anything
like that, the screen reader will read

112
00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:11.960
this text and will tell them that this
button, it will talk about the navigation.

113
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.520
So really great for usability.

114
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.180
You should always think about usability.

115
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:17.730
No excuses.

116
00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.760
So icon bar copy that two more times.

117
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.730
This is just gonna give us a little line.

118
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:25.200
Bootstrap class, this is gonna give us
three lines, so it looks like a sandwich.

119
00:07:27.002 --> 00:07:31.560
After that, why don't we save that and
just give that a little look.

120
00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.970
All right, so here is our navigation bar.

121
00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:37.090
It's just a big black bar at the top,
we have nothing inside of it.

122
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.510
Technically, everything's good so far.

123
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.190
Let's shrink that.

124
00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:42.920
There's our sandwich.

125
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.598
Perfect.

126
00:07:44.598 --> 00:07:46.810
Let's go back to our code,
and let's continue.

127
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:54.210
We're gonna add an a tag with
the class of navbar-brand and

128
00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:58.070
the href of forwardslash dot.

129
00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:01.030
That will basically tell bootstrap,

130
00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:06.470
cuz there's some CSS in
the bootstrap CSS that will align

131
00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:11.910
the logo of the website in the correct
spot in the navigation bar.

132
00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:12.968
Plus it's semantic.

133
00:08:12.968 --> 00:08:15.698
Image, source,

134
00:08:15.698 --> 00:08:21.158
assets/img/logo.png alt tag,

135
00:08:21.158 --> 00:08:26.640
don't forget your alt tags.

136
00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.130
This one will be Bootstrap to WordPress.

137
00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.551
And I'm gonna save that.

138
00:08:34.551 --> 00:08:36.564
And then below our navbar header.

139
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:41.860
We have another div, and that div

140
00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:50.100
will have the class of navbar-collapse and
collapse.

141
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:54.230
So collapse, there we go.

142
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:58.110
Basically, if you look here this button,
the data target and toggle,

143
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:03.650
you see the navbar toggle,
and the data toggle collapse,

144
00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:08.760
and we're right here, navbar collapse and
data toggle collapse.

145
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:17.670
So this is telling the html to look for
this div right here.

146
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:20.730
So when you click this button right
here it's gonna toggle this div and

147
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:21.800
the content within it.

148
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.100
And so maybe you guessed it.

149
00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.860
In here,
we're gonna put our navigation items.

150
00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:32.655
So UL class of nav,
navbar-nav, navbar-write.

151
00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:36.172
Not really sure why there has to be so
many class is there,

152
00:09:36.172 --> 00:09:38.985
but that's the way Bootstrap does it.

153
00:09:38.985 --> 00:09:41.580
This will pull our navigation bar
to the right, so that's useful.

154
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.785
Navbar-nav not really sure
what that ones about.

155
00:09:43.785 --> 00:09:48.165
And nav again,
there just part of the Bootstrap CSS.

156
00:09:48.165 --> 00:09:50.155
Documentation probably explains it.

157
00:09:50.155 --> 00:09:51.615
It works, it works.

158
00:09:51.615 --> 00:09:52.975
We're good to go.

159
00:09:52.975 --> 00:09:53.915
All right.

160
00:09:53.915 --> 00:09:56.960
In here, we're gonna have some li tags.

161
00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.402
The first one,
will have li class of active.

162
00:10:01.325 --> 00:10:06.000
And that is a custom class that we're
gonna be doing a little bit later.

163
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.850
We're gonna have to make the navigation
bar, the item that you're currently on,

164
00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:15.770
the page that you're on,
we want to highlight that navigation item.

165
00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:18.700
So that people know hey, I'm on the home
page, hey, I'm on blog page, so

166
00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:19.270
on and so forth.

167
00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:24.490
So I'm just gonna put that there
because it will be used eventually.

168
00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:26.600
If you forget at this point, that's okay.

169
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.528
We'll come across the issue a little
bit later and then, we'll add it.

170
00:10:30.528 --> 00:10:37.520
A href, and that will be forward slash,
and that will be the home.

171
00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.660
So that one is a class of active.

172
00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.310
Below that we're gonna add some more.

173
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.018
There will be no class on that one.

174
00:10:44.018 --> 00:10:48.480
A href blog.html.

175
00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.110
So we don't have a blog.html page yet,
but we will.

176
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:54.000
So I'm just gonna put it in there now,
so we don't have to do it later.

177
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.910
Blog.html, this item will be blog.

178
00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:58.860
Copy that, paste it a couple more times.

179
00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.226
Now, you just need to change these values.

180
00:11:01.226 --> 00:11:07.490
So resources this text will be
resources and this one will be contact.

181
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:10.740
And that will be contact sieve that.

182
00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.745
And let's check it out and see,
if we've got ourselves a nice navbar.

183
00:11:16.182 --> 00:11:16.990
There we go.

184
00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:20.580
We got our logo, Bootstrap to WordPress,
Home, Blog, Resources, Contact.

185
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:21.550
Looking pretty good.

186
00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:23.130
And you see how it's active.

187
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:24.290
There we go.

188
00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:25.490
I just realized, I lied.

189
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:27.560
The active class is not my class.

190
00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:28.310
I didn't add that.

191
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:29.990
It's actually Bootstrap class.

192
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:31.280
There is an active class.

193
00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:31.970
My mistake.

194
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:32.990
That's okay.

195
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:34.370
So this is the active class.

196
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:37.580
So whatever item has active
on it will look like that.

197
00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:38.360
And will obviously,

198
00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:42.820
in the future use WordPress to
dynamically decide what page we are on.

199
00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:43.770
Awesome.

200
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:47.960
So that is our header and navigation bar.

201
00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.940
All in this snippet, right here.

202
00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.720
Hopefully that made sense to you.

203
00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.288
And I'll see you in the next lecture.

204
00:11:54.288 --> 00:12:00.080
Where we're gonna be coding ourselves, the
hero section, this nice one right here.

205
00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.155
All right, see there friends.

206
00:12:01.155 --> 00:12:04.629
