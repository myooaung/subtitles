00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.190
Hey everybody.

2
00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:03.860
Welcome back to Boost Your Income
with Bootstrap To WordPress.

3
00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.250
This lecture is called Code The,
Who Should Take This Course, section.

4
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.676
Check it out.

5
00:00:08.676 --> 00:00:16.895
[MUSIC]

6
00:00:16.895 --> 00:00:19.160
Okay, so
this section's gonna be quick and dirty.

7
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.320
It really is the same as the last section.

8
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.740
And we're gonna do a lot of copy and
pasting.

9
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:24.750
So jump in your code editor.

10
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.190
And scroll to the Who Benefits section.

11
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.580
That's what we're calling it,
Who Benefits.

12
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.850
It's shorter, easier to understand,
instead of a whole ID in section called,

13
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.000
Who Should Take This Course,
wth dashes and stuff.

14
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.914
So let's just call it who-benefits.

15
00:00:38.914 --> 00:00:43.508
Makes sense, same deal, who-benefits.

16
00:00:43.508 --> 00:00:44.520
Alright.

17
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.140
Inside our section, you guessed it,
div class container.

18
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.050
You'll get the hang of it here.

19
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.720
And we're gonna start off
with our section header.

20
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.770
Boom, close that up, section header.

21
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.095
And inside our section
header we have our image.

22
00:01:05.095 --> 00:01:10.035
Assetes/img/icon-pad.png.

23
00:01:10.035 --> 00:01:14.898
Alt will be pad and pencil,
or paper and pencil.

24
00:01:14.898 --> 00:01:18.790
I called it pad,
cuz I want it to sound interesting.

25
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.310
Who should take this course?

26
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.750
Well, who should take this course?

27
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.785
Under a section header,
we need to add a div with a class of row,

28
00:01:30.785 --> 00:01:35.440
cuz here we are actually gonna
do something interesting.

29
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:38.586
I'll show you.

30
00:01:38.586 --> 00:01:41.180
Let me show you the final site.

31
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.800
If you look here, something is
interesting about this specific layout.

32
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.100
The container seems to be not
as wide as it usually is.

33
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.510
It is usually that wide.

34
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.420
You could see there's
a big difference here.

35
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.010
So why is this content not as wide,
and takes up less space,

36
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.390
and has more white space on the left and
right sides of the container?

37
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.620
Well, the container actually
still is this wide.

38
00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.740
However, we're using
the Bootsrap columns to add some

39
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.250
white space to the left and the right.

40
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.508
So, this section is only,
I believe, eight columns.

41
00:02:23.508 --> 00:02:26.328
That's correct.

42
00:02:26.328 --> 00:02:32.236
[SOUND] So this section is
actually only eight columns.

43
00:02:32.236 --> 00:02:37.800
And we're giving just two columns of
offset right here, to bump it over,

44
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.930
giving it a more thin look, so
the copy doesn't span the full width.

45
00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.420
So I'll show you how to do that.

46
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.216
Right here, inside of our row,
let's add a div with

47
00:02:50.216 --> 00:02:55.139
a class of col-sm-8, and col-sm-offset-2.

48
00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:58.830
Offset will offset that eight column grid

49
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.070
by two on the left side,
giving us that layout.

50
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.500
Now all we need to do in
here is just copy and paste.

51
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.730
And in that copy deck I provided in the
course files folder under Miscellaneous,

52
00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.280
you should be able to add
all of this copy without

53
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.980
spending a whole bunch of time typing.

54
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.870
So basically, the layout is just h3,
and paragraph tags.

55
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.160
So, go ahead and add the content for
each of those sections.

56
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.010
Some of them actually have strong tags.

57
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.590
Feel free to use a little bit of
creative licensed to lay it out and

58
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.290
view some basic formatting like strong
tags, emphasis, so on and so forth.

59
00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.300
Like I said, this course isn't so

60
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.760
much about copy-writing, it is more
about learning Bootstrap so we can learn

61
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.900
how to turn that into a WordPress theme,
so we can start making some extra money.

62
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.608
So go ahead, copy and
paste and let's keep moving.

63
00:03:54.608 --> 00:03:57.420
I am gonna go ahead and just paste it all.

64
00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.238
Boom, there's all of
the content right there.

65
00:04:01.238 --> 00:04:04.130
Just gonna tab it in just a touch here.

66
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:08.620
Here we go, we're good.

67
00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.380
Now I will save that and
make sure it is all there.

68
00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.950
Check it out on our final site here,
our own site.

69
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.950
Okay, so we're almost there.

70
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.590
The content is there and we got our text,
but the graphic isn't right,

71
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.860
so what's the deal there?

72
00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:28.765
Did I do a typo?

73
00:04:28.765 --> 00:04:32.890
Icon-pad, well assets.

74
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:34.150
I put assetes.

75
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.670
That's not right.

76
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.060
There we go, assets.

77
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.500
That'll do it.

78
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.000
Now the only other thing is the background
of this section should be white.

79
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.730
All we need to do is
jump over into our CSS.

80
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.470
And under our opt in,
make sure this is in our layout section.

81
00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.621
Just a style who benefits,
the ID of who benefits.

82
00:04:56.621 --> 00:04:59.977
Background white.

83
00:04:59.977 --> 00:05:00.610
Check it out.

84
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.580
There it is and that's it.

85
00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.280
That's the who should take this course or
who benefits section.

86
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.915
Awesome.
So, hang on tight.

87
00:05:12.915 --> 00:05:14.081
Hang in there,

88
00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:19.840
because in the next section we're gonna
code the Course Features section.

89
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.450
See you there my friends.

90
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.129
Boom.
