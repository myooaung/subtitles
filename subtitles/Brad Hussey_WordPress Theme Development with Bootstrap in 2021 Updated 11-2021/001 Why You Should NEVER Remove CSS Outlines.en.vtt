00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.430
I wanted to shed some light on a little
issue that a lot of web designers

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.110
have had and currently have.

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.340
In fact,
I've had this issue in the past as well.

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.100
It's regarding the outline style
when a link is focused or a button.

5
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.730
So, if you're using Twitter bootstrap for

6
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.530
example, you will notice when you click
on the button, and maybe hover away or

7
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.309
navigate away, or whatever it
is you do to achieve this style,

8
00:00:27.309 --> 00:00:32.220
the little blue outline kind of
hovers around the link or the button.

9
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.110
And visually, it kind of looks
a little off, it looks a bit weird.

10
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.900
And so, naturally, web designers,
if they have a good eye for design,

11
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.000
they think, how do I remove this?

12
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.650
And they go ahead and google,

13
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.970
and come across a couple forums on
how to remove the outline style.

14
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.420
And it's pretty easy,
you just define the style,

15
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.820
redefine the outline style to zero or
none, and

16
00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.000
put the important pseudo-class
at the end of it.

17
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.510
But the reality of it is,
you shouldn't remove this style at all.

18
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.530
In fact,
it's a terrible idea to remove this style.

19
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.760
It's bad practice.

20
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.290
And the reason why is,
the purpose of the outline

21
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.520
being on a link or a button, is visual

22
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.420
feedback to those who have to use
a keyboard to navigate your website.

23
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.380
So, people with visual impairment or maybe
some other sort of disability that doesn't

24
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.400
allow them to let them use
a mouse as easy as you and I can.

25
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.110
So, you have to leave it there.

26
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.910
And maybe, what you can do instead
is you can update the style.

27
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:45.800
You can change the style.

28
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.660
You can provide better visual feedback,
other than just an ugly blue outline.

29
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:51.490
You can make it look better.

30
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.950
You can change the color of the button.

31
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.040
You can give a better outline.

32
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.270
You can do something that matches
the brand of your website or

33
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.010
your company,
better than just the generic blue outline.

34
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.340
So, instead of removing it,
think about it, and

35
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.220
think about the people who need to
be able to access your website.

36
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.330
You don't wanna discriminate against them.

37
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.580
So, just do something better.

38
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.820
This gives you a good opportunity
to exercise your design chops,

39
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.960
and think about usability.

40
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.960
A really good resource for
you to check out is outlinenone.com.

41
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.920
And you'll see a huge
header at the very top.

42
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.140
It says, don't do it.

43
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.323
So, think about that next time you go to
redefine those outline styles to zero.

44
00:02:33.323 --> 00:02:38.589
