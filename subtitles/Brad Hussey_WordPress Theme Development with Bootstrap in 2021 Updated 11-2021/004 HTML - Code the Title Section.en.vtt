00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.760
Welcome back.

2
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.370
Next up, in this video, we're going to be coding up this section here and maybe this section, we'll

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.210
see where we get to, but of course it doesn't look this nice just yet.

4
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.350
Right now it looks like this real, real, real nice.

5
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.630
Don't worry, folks, this will look a lot nicer as we start to style things up.

6
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.830
But right now we're just kind of focusing on the HTML with some of those utility classes that we've

7
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.900
been going through to give some some layout but add some structure.

8
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.990
But it's really in the case that things are going to start to come together.

9
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.850
So let's head down here and put some space so we can see that screen a little better.

10
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.460
And we're going to after this mobile nav section, we're going to add what is called or what we're going

11
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.510
to call the title banner.

12
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.310
So we're going to use the section tag.

13
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.960
It's just an equal five tag.

14
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:54.510
The class of title Dash banner will be that's going to be a style that we are going to be using a class

15
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.290
name that we're going to be using.

16
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.200
That's not a bootstrap bootstrap specific class.

17
00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.880
And we have a div.

18
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.650
It's going to be a class of container that's going to wrap it in the container inside of there.

19
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.330
We're going to do a row row row.

20
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.920
There we go.

21
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.000
OK.

22
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.280
After that, we're going to have another div and this one is going to have this is going to where our

23
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.000
content's going to be.

24
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.350
So we're going to need to do a few things.

25
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.040
We want to put it and put it in a column, offset it.

26
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.260
So it's in the center and center, align the text.

27
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.490
So we're going to do all that right now.

28
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.700
So we're gonna go call Dash M.D. Dash 10.

29
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.300
So it's a 10 column section Offset Dash, M.D., Dash one.

30
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.660
So.

31
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.590
So for the medium screen size and up, it's going to offset it.

32
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.080
One column from the left.

33
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:55.860
So the way this works is you kind of always want to add up to or be under 12 columns when you do your

34
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.250
math.

35
00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.360
So in this case, 10 column grid, plus an offset of one is 11.

36
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:07.120
So that's totally fine because what's going to happen is it's going to have the 10 column width.

37
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.440
So let's just say like, let's go over and view it right here.

38
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:19.750
So let's say that this is let's say this is 12 columns that width there and probably that is 10 columns.

39
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.660
But if we just left it at 10 columns, it's going to be sitting over here.

40
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.930
So if we offset it by one column, then it's going to center that column where there's going to be kind

41
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.100
of an empty space.

42
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.950
Column here and an empty space column there.

43
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.560
Now another way of doing this would just you could just make it 12 columns and just center line the

44
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.040
text.

45
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.690
That's totally fine, too.

46
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.660
But if you were to have a lot of text here, like on a blog individual post where your post title is

47
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.830
particularly long.

48
00:02:50.100 --> 00:03:00.630
So if we just added a bunch of like pretend words, then that's going to sit in the 10 column width.

49
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:07.020
I'll show you here if I were to change that to like a 12 column width and remove the offset.

50
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.650
Then it would sit like that, and I don't know it just a little bit wide.

51
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.590
So we changed it to be a call medium.

52
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:15.250
10.

53
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.180
See how it sits over there.

54
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.850
So we're going to do the offset.

55
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.940
Offset, maybe one offsets it like that just gives it some left margin.

56
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.520
OK, so let's get back to it.

57
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.270
That's how that works.

58
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:36.490
Called ash smashed 12 That means on a small screen size small break points make it a 12 column span.

59
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.690
The full width of the viewport offset Assam zero.

60
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.480
We don't necessarily need to add that because on the M.D., it's going to just break.

61
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.830
It won't it won't use this class, but you could do that as a failsafe if you want.

62
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.980
It's also quite possible that that's not even necessary.

63
00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.960
Overflowed Dash hidden, so we don't want any techs to overflow outside of the column and we want the

64
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.780
text to be centered, so text Dash Center say that we're going to see what happened here.

65
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:09.490
OK, right?

66
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.050
You're not going to see anything because there's no text.

67
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.280
So why don't we do that first?

68
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.500
So we have our structure.

69
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:21.760
Let's add a run at a paragraph tag and a level one heading in the paragraph tag.

70
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.740
Let's say bootstrap to WordPress course, which have to WordPress 2.0 course or, of course, 2.0,

71
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.250
whatever.

72
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.660
And then in here, we'll say blog, so the classes are going to add for this is we're going to have

73
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.720
this paragraph be like this.

74
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.470
We want it to look like this kind of like the eyebrow of the of the title.

75
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.370
So we're going to say tag dash line.

76
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.240
What's going on is that class and sub dash title.

77
00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.490
And then the one it's going to have the class.

78
00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.360
Page Dash title, and that's we're going to use that to target that in our CSR.

79
00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.950
Save that.

80
00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.270
And we should have some member go smaller paragraph text.

81
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.320
Headline text.

82
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.200
It's centered in that column, but of course, it doesn't look very good right now.

83
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.790
That's all good.

84
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.870
Great.

85
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:12.800
So that's our title banner.

86
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.290
We kind of scaffold that up, scaffolded that up.

87
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.690
Now, let's add the Subscribe bar, which is this right here?

88
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.100
So if you want to have a call to action or an opt in bar, something like that, let's do that.

89
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:33.190
So another section we're going to give that the class of subscribed dash bar.

90
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.450
A container, dev.

91
00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:39.950
A road if.

92
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.800
And then in here, we're going to have a few things, so we've got a death called Dash Smash six.

93
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.320
That basically means we want it to always be a six column regardless of screen size.

94
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:59.210
So that's that outside of that, we want another death with the class of Call Dash Smash six.

95
00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.360
So that equals 12 so to six columns.

96
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.250
So it's going to look like two columns.

97
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.170
But you wanted to add it up to 12.

98
00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:14.590
So six and six, six, 12, so essentially two columns, if that makes sense inside of the first one,

99
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.850
we're going to have a paragraph tag and a strong tag and we're going to say we want to save 20 percent,

100
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:22.390
something like that.

101
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.260
And then in this second column, here we're going have a form.

102
00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.560
Now this is just dummy form.

103
00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:34.960
But if you wanted to use like your opt in form from your email marketing provider emailed the email

104
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.020
marketing tool, then you could just paste it in there into their eyes.

105
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.760
ConvertKit so I would just paste an embed form.

106
00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:46.870
Oh, for now, I'm just going to like this div um, class of row.

107
00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:49.290
And then.

108
00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.910
Div called Dash MMD Dash eight four eight columns.

109
00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.610
We're going to have input text.

110
00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:05.710
And then outside of that, we're going to have different class of call MD for.

111
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.660
And then a button with the class.

112
00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:18.420
Of BTN and BTN Dash Invert, those are bootstrap classes.

113
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.240
And subscribe to see what that looks like.

114
00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.400
Probably nothing too nice, but we got our lay out there.

115
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.870
All right.

116
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:31.430
We got something going on.

117
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:32.060
OK.

118
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:35.860
Again, folks, now this is this is hard for me to look at as well.

119
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:42.410
I like designing while I do the markup, but I'm just trying to separate these things for you so we

120
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:43.940
could just do one and then the other.

121
00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:47.810
OK, now let's leave it at that.

122
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.340
We'll call that a win.

123
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.620
Or we did our title banner and our subscriber.

124
00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:55.850
And then in the next lesson, we'll keep going and then we'll coat up kind of the content area with

125
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.610
the posts, the post section here.

126
00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:59.990
And then that'll be the bulk of that.

127
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:03.110
And then we'll be off to the next templates.

128
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:03.680
All right.

129
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:04.280
It's rock and roll.
