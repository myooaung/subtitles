00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.330
Hey everyone.
Welcome back to

2
00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:03.410
Boost Your Income With Bootstrap
to WordPress.

3
00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.527
This lecture is very simple, and

4
00:00:08.527 --> 00:00:13.827
we're gonna be coding the HTML for

5
00:00:13.827 --> 00:00:16.950
the blog excerpts.

6
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.420
Okay, so let's code our blog excerpt HTML.

7
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.380
So, just so you know what we're coding,
it will be this right here.

8
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.330
We're gonna code this column right here,
all the way down.

9
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.040
These really are just copying and
pasting this first one,

10
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.400
so really the work will
just be right here.

11
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.540
And keep in mind,
there's going to be no CSS in this one,

12
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.080
because we're going to leave that part for
the next lecture.

13
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.280
Cuz there are a few little more details,
so

14
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.230
that we can get this layout looking good.

15
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.220
So this one is just dedicated to HTML.

16
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.660
Let's do it.
Jump into your HTML Code Editor,

17
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.070
not your HTML editor, your code editor.

18
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.330
And right here, in this space that
you left in the last lecture,

19
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.230
we don't really need that much,
but just so you could see.

20
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.028
Let's start coding right here.

21
00:01:00.028 --> 00:01:03.210
First thing we're going to
do is add a section, and I

22
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.730
wanna give it a few classes, so I'm going
to use Emmet to help me speed this up.

23
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.876
Section, the class of feature-image,

24
00:01:13.876 --> 00:01:19.920
whoops, and feature-image-default-alt.

25
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.920
So let's split that out.

26
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.960
There we go.

27
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:23.880
There's my section.

28
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:31.369
And I'm also gonna give it the data-type,
cuz this is gonna be parallax,

29
00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.020
remember, background and
data-speed, whoops, two.

30
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.570
So it's gonna be a little
bit slower of a speed or

31
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.210
quicker, I believe,
cuz we're dividing by two.

32
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.020
Okay, in level one, heading we're gonna
give that a page class of page title.

33
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.467
Then just say blog, very simple.

34
00:01:53.467 --> 00:01:56.820
Okay, now we won't see anything
there if we refresh that.

35
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.020
We won't see any backgrounds or anything,
because the CSS we'll leave for

36
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.430
the next lecture.

37
00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.840
Great.
So we have that.

38
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.900
Now, let's add an HTML comment, and
this will be blog content, okay.

39
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.660
All right, in here let's add a div
with the class of container.

40
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.520
There we go.

41
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.520
And in here, we're gonna add a row,
also with the ID of primary.

42
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:26.360
There it is.

43
00:02:30.023 --> 00:02:35.031
And then we're going to utilize
the HTML Five tag called main,

44
00:02:35.031 --> 00:02:38.730
I don't know if you'd
known that one before.

45
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:48.125
But we'll use that, we'll give it the ID
of content and also the class of col-sm-8.

46
00:02:48.125 --> 00:02:51.190
There it is.

47
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.810
And then I'm gonna add this here.

48
00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.230
Hopefully I'm not going too fast for
you, cuz I'm using Emmet so

49
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.358
I can speed up my HTML super fast.

50
00:03:01.358 --> 00:03:03.130
The kind of purpose of this whole course,

51
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.990
is to show you how Bootstrap can
speed up your front end development.

52
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.140
So that once you're in WordPress,
you can Start creating

53
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.560
super robust CMS websites quickly.

54
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.890
Because Bootstrap helps you speed
up the coding of the templates, and

55
00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.950
WordPress makes some
incredibly powerful websites.

56
00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.330
But the kind of little bonus,

57
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.810
is that if you're using coda 2 you
can install the plugin called Emmet.

58
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.390
But I'm pretty sure you can use Emmet for
other code editors as well.

59
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.020
So go ahead and check that out.

60
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.910
But if you're using coda 2, and
you have Emmet installed good for you,

61
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.930
because it can help speed up your coding.

62
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.415
In my previous courses, I really like
mentioning that it's good to hand code,

63
00:03:43.415 --> 00:03:46.920
and not use any assistance,
any coding assistance,

64
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.600
or code folding or auto-complete.

65
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.050
Because you need to learn muscle memory so
you can code properly.

66
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.960
But, once you're at a level where
you know you're good at coding, and

67
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.110
you know how to use your HTML and
CSS properly,

68
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.080
it can help you to speed up your
development, by using things like,

69
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.010
Coda 2s, autocomplete, and Emmet,
just to help speed up your coding.

70
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.690
Because in this world of web development,
The faster and

71
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.720
more efficient you are, the better.

72
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.100
As long as you don't sacrifice quality and
beautiful code.

73
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.730
And that's what I try and
make sure to teach.

74
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.510
Never sacrifice your quality
of your code for speed.

75
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.700
However, if you can have them live
in harmony, I think you're golden.

76
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.960
And you can make more money that way too.

77
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.680
All right, now that I went
on my little tangent there.

78
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.200
Let's keep going.

79
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.710
Let's give this the role
attribute of main, just for

80
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.940
some more semantic markup here.

81
00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.190
And let's add an article
with the class of post.

82
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.600
This is where we're going
to add some more content.

83
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.560
So article, class sub posts.

84
00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.828
In the article, we want a header tag.

85
00:05:03.117 --> 00:05:06.077
And then within our header tag, actually,

86
00:05:06.077 --> 00:05:10.840
lets keep adding just the basic
skeleton of this article.

87
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:16.026
Then we're going to have a div
with the class of post image And

88
00:05:16.026 --> 00:05:17.762
then after our post image.

89
00:05:20.595 --> 00:05:22.920
We will have, whoops.

90
00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.490
Oh, my goodness, there we go.

91
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.046
Then we'll have a post-excerpt.

92
00:05:30.516 --> 00:05:31.549
There we go.

93
00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:39.580
>> And then after that,
I think we're good.

94
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.600
I'm just gonna add a comment here
after our article so we know.

95
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.970
Okay.
So, let's start off on our header.

96
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.220
And say level three heading,
we're gonna have an a tag and

97
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.950
that a tag will have a href,
which will link to, in our template,

98
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.915
it will just be post.html, because
we're gonna have a new page, post.html.

99
00:05:55.915 --> 00:05:57.290
Where we have the full blog posts.

100
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:00.960
Okay.
But in WordPress,

101
00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.420
keep in mind,
that's gonna be totally different.

102
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.890
It's gonna be dynamic link.

103
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.068
Blog title here.

104
00:06:05.068 --> 00:06:06.415
All right.

105
00:06:08.038 --> 00:06:10.598
Then after our level three heading,

106
00:06:10.598 --> 00:06:14.430
we're gonna have another
div called post-details.

107
00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.980
That is with all of that information.

108
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.420
With the author, the time,
and all that other stuff.

109
00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.950
Okay, so post details,
let's start off with adding a span,

110
00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:30.030
with the class of glyphicon,

111
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:34.549
and also the class of glyphicon-user.

112
00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:40.390
So that will give us an icon,
using glyph icons with a little user, and

113
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.766
then a space, and
I'm gonna say Brad Hussey.

114
00:06:42.766 --> 00:06:47.980
Okay, copy that, hope we save time,

115
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.390
we're gonna do another glyph icon,
and this one will just be time.

116
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:54.967
And let's just put the time tag here.

117
00:06:58.559 --> 00:07:01.440
And say August 7, 2014.

118
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.040
Okay, and paste another time here.

119
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:11.620
Change this from user to folder-open-alt,
and then after that span tag,

120
00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:17.270
we'll have a couple A tags,
and we'll say Tutorials.

121
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:22.470
Put a comma after that A tag, give another
A tag here, and this one will say coding.

122
00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:26.150
So these are the categories.

123
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:33.500
Let's add another span tag here,
change this glyphicon to glyphicon tags,

124
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.000
and you guessed it, those will be tags.

125
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.750
So that's in text, saying tagged.

126
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:43.450
Then an A tag will be WordPress.

127
00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:45.570
Comma after the A tag.

128
00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:48.680
Another A.
And we'll say premium.

129
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.540
Again this one will say another tag.

130
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:55.510
Whoops.

131
00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:57.920
And then we'll have one more.

132
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.480
Word Press tag here, yada, yada.

133
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.800
There we go just so you can see.

134
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.060
All right after all of those spans,
with the classic glyph icon.

135
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.470
Go to space, we're going to have a div.

136
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.910
The class of post comments-badge.

137
00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:16.688
Don't forget to close that div.

138
00:08:20.585 --> 00:08:21.118
Here we go.

139
00:08:21.118 --> 00:08:23.678
Within that post-comments-badge,
we're gonna have an A tag.

140
00:08:26.177 --> 00:08:27.970
Whoops.

141
00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:29.360
There we go.

142
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.960
And that will have some goodies in here.

143
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.639
Be a span tag with a class of glyphicon.

144
00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:42.930
And glyph icon- comments.

145
00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.730
And then after that span, we'll say 168.

146
00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:51.390
That's a lot of comments.

147
00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:54.050
So there's a post comments badge.

148
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:56.690
Now we're down in our post image.

149
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.978
Throw an image in there,

150
00:09:03.978 --> 00:09:12.060
assetsimagehero-bg.jpgalt hero image.

151
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.010
Post excerpts, so I'm just going
to add some more epsom in here.

152
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:25.170
And then right here int he last line,
I'm just gonna take some out and

153
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.480
I'm gonna go, dot, dot,
dot, and then an A tag,

154
00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:33.559
and the A tag will link to post.HTML.

155
00:09:33.559 --> 00:09:39.190
Continue reading, and then an RA quo.

156
00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:43.900
Great, save that, let's just
have a look to see what happens.

157
00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:47.730
There we go.
So we have our blog title,

158
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:53.050
this is our header up here, this whole
thing is the article, this is the header,

159
00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:57.490
these are the post details,
this is the feature image,

160
00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:02.580
the excerpt, and then the more,
the read more link, continue reading.

161
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.070
Okay, so why don't we just copy
that a couple of more times.

162
00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:09.000
So this whole post, we're gonna copy it,

163
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.890
because we're gonna have a couple more,
two more to be exact.

164
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:18.900
So I add another one here,
and another one there.

165
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.750
You can go ahead and change the titles and
whatever if you want.

166
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:23.780
But you don't necessarily have to,

167
00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:26.070
because you're not gonna be
using these additional ones.

168
00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:30.940
You're just gonna be using
the single template here,

169
00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:34.630
because WordPress will dynamically
generate all of the additional ones.

170
00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:35.160
But, just so

171
00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.780
you can see what your template looks
like it's good to have some examples.

172
00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:43.450
Okay, so that's it for
the coding the HTML for the excerpts.

173
00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:47.440
In the next lecture we're going to start
coding the CSS for this section, so

174
00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.658
that we can look a little
bit more like this.

175
00:10:50.658 --> 00:10:51.938
Quite pretty.

176
00:10:51.938 --> 00:10:55.959
