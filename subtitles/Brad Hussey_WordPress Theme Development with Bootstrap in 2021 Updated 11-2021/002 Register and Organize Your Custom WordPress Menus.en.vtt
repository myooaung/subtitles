00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.970
[SOUND] Custom menus,
those are nice, right.

2
00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:05.822
Let's do them.

3
00:00:05.822 --> 00:00:14.386
[MUSIC]

4
00:00:14.386 --> 00:00:15.510
Hey, welcome back.

5
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.790
In this lecture, we're gonna be
playing around with custom menus.

6
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.330
And the perfect example of how
to show you how to do this

7
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.170
is right here in the footer.

8
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.340
We have a menu that we
actually hard coded.

9
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.320
It's static, and that's not awesome,
because what if we have new pages?

10
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.390
What if we add new pages?

11
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.290
What if we wanna update the footer and
we wanna remove this menu altogether,

12
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.670
and we wanna put something else there?

13
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.900
Maybe we have other pages
with different menus.

14
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.730
Hard coding is not the way to go.

15
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.680
Using custom menus is the absolute
way to go and it's super easy.

16
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.530
So, let me show you.

17
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.070
First, what you're gonna do is head back
to your Appearance and then click Menus.

18
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.350
Here is the menu section.

19
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.800
Right here you can edit your menus,

20
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.010
manage the locations, create menus add
the menu structure, so on an so forth.

21
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.760
You can do so much here with your menus.

22
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.000
It's awesome.

23
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.350
So right here we have our main menu and we
have basically the four links that we want

24
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.799
in that main navigation menu and we're
automatically adding new top level pages.

25
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.310
We wanna add a new menu, so
create a new menu right here, and

26
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.460
let's call this one Footer Menu.

27
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.640
And I'm gonna create that menu.

28
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.830
And basically what we wanna do here is,
well in this case it's pretty simple,

29
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.640
it's basically all the same pages, but
we wanna add one extra link called sign up

30
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.510
now, and
there is no page called sign up now.

31
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.030
So, this is how we're
gonna go about doing that.

32
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.389
Let's add all the pages first.

33
00:01:44.518 --> 00:01:45.630
There we go.

34
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.150
We're going to add the right home blog,

35
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.890
resources, and contact, and then we
have one more link that is sign up now.

36
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.490
What we're going to do here is just
click on links down here and then URL.

37
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.120
This is where you're going to put URL for
an external link.

38
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.650
So in this case I would
put a link to the course

39
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.630
where you could sign up to the course.

40
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.200
But for now I'm just going to put
My website, bradhussey.ca, and

41
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.380
once the course is live, I'll actually put
the real link so that it actually works.

42
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.790
Sign Up Now, and Add to Menu,
and there we go.

43
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.710
Now if I save this,
I have a new menu called Footer Menu.

44
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.320
So I have the main menu and footer menu.

45
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.400
And you can see right here,
this says primary menu, beside main menu.

46
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.000
And if you look down here, menu settings,

47
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.260
there's a section here called theme
locations, and there's only primary menu.

48
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.680
So that means our theme only has one menu
registered to be able to use in the theme.

49
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.160
We need to be able to have
another location, and

50
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.250
it needs to be for the footer.

51
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.040
So we need to do that,

52
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.500
otherwise we can't use this menu, unless
you wanted to set it as primary menu, but

53
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.530
we want another menu location, so
go back to your functions.php.

54
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.550
And in functions.php, just find menu.

55
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:21.080
And you can see here on line 43, this
theme uses wp_nav_menu() in one location.

56
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.850
Not anymore.

57
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.540
We're gonna register another one.

58
00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.930
So register_nav_menus is the function
where you can register navigation menus,

59
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.890
as many as you desire.

60
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.740
So I'm gonna copy that first one and
paste it below.

61
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.410
So this is our primary menu and
we're just gonna create another one.

62
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.080
I'm gonna call it footer and
this will be called Footer Menu.

63
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.504
Now save that, go back here,
and refresh the menu.

64
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.340
So now we have two theme locations for
our menus.

65
00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.460
And our footer menu I want that to be
in the footer menu theme location.

66
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.640
Now we're not done yet.

67
00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.550
It's associated with that menu that
we registered in our functions but

68
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.530
we need to be able to
display it in our theme.

69
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.190
If you're forward thinking,

70
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.740
you'll know that we need to
be heading to our footer.php.

71
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:20.680
And down there is where we're going to add
our custom menu, right here in the nav.

72
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.250
So basically we're just gonna use the same
thing that we used in our header, and

73
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.590
I'll just show you real quick here.

74
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.960
We have the WordPress nav menu function.

75
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.880
So I'm just gonna copy that so
I don't have to retype a lot of stuff, and

76
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.490
we're just gonna change
a few sections in our array.

77
00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.660
So go back to your footer now,
take note of the last list item here.

78
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.820
It has a class called sign up link.

79
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.118
Remember that.
We're gonna be using that.

80
00:04:46.118 --> 00:04:47.603
Paste this.

81
00:04:50.361 --> 00:04:54.296
Ok so we have WordPress nav menu, but
we're not gonna pull in our primary menu,

82
00:04:54.296 --> 00:04:56.490
we need to pull in our footer menu.

83
00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.820
The container's gonna be a nav
element 'cuz we want to use HTML 5.

84
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.859
The container class, we don't
actually need a container class here.

85
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.670
So I'm gonna remove that.

86
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:13.050
With the menu class I want
it to be an in-line list.

87
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:18.310
So list unstyled, I don't want
the bullets, this is a bootstrap style,

88
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.230
it's gonna add that to the menu,
and list in-line.

89
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.200
And just to show you,
I'm gonna copy that and

90
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.430
I'm gonna go back to the static version so
you can see what we're trying to achieve.

91
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.380
We've got a <nav> and then we've got
an unordered list, and then list items,

92
00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.990
and there are two classes,
list-unstyled and list-inline.

93
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.300
And the way I did that
is here in menu class,

94
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.250
that tags it,
those classes to the unordered list.

95
00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:48.880
Go ahead and save that.

96
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.700
And head back here and refresh your site.

97
00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.406
And so here you go this is
actually a dynamic menu now.

98
00:05:59.406 --> 00:06:05.640
And the the reason I know that is because
our menu structure is not the same

99
00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.870
as up here, so we have home and resources,
down here we have home and blog.

100
00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:15.972
If I go back to menus, and
I swap those, hit Save,

101
00:06:15.972 --> 00:06:23.670
Refresh, Home, Resources, Blog,
Contact, and then Sign up now!

102
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:28.700
Now one thing is,
the Sign up now used to be red, and

103
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.100
that's because it had a class on it.

104
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.690
How do you add a class to
a WordPress menu in here?

105
00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.560
Easy peezy, pop that open, and

106
00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:42.620
in here you can see there some extra
info that you can add to this link.

107
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.390
Now there's nothing here letting us
know that we can add a class, but

108
00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:46.220
there's a secret.

109
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.870
Up in the top right click Screen Options,
and

110
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:55.320
you can show advanced menu properties,
and we want to check CS classes.

111
00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.590
Now we can add CSS classes to our link,
and that was Signup-link.

112
00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:07.330
Now if I save that menu, head back,
refresh, we should now have a red link.

113
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.150
There it is, so that is the custom menus.

114
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.570
You can register as
many menus as you like.

115
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:15.220
You can put them wherever
you want in your site.

116
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.980
You can put them in your sidebars,
you can put them in your widgets, so,

117
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:22.440
in the last lecture we played around with
widgets, you can choose a custom menu.

118
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.930
So say you wanted to use your extra
side bar, you can select a menu.

119
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.560
So say you created sidebar menu,
your registered sidebar menu.

120
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.420
You added extra information in your
sidebar menu and then in here,

121
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:39.850
in your extra sidebar choose custom menu
widget, select a menu, sidebar menu, save.

122
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:43.210
You're good to go as long as
it's displaying in your theme.

123
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:44.120
Then you're good to go.

124
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.870
So you literally can do so
much with custom menus.

125
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:51.470
And I use it all the time in so
many of my WordPress sites.

126
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:55.450
The other thing I noticed here in
the footer before we get out of here,

127
00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.190
is the date.

128
00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:03.260
We need to make that dynamic.

129
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.108
So super simple, php date,

130
00:08:07.108 --> 00:08:12.340
year ,echo date.

131
00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:13.550
There we go.

132
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:15.490
You can have extra
information in here too.

133
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:19.130
Say I wanted extra information
in this copyright section so

134
00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:21.630
I wanted the name of the blog or
the website.

135
00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:26.435
Well, php, you can actually grab that
really easy using a WordPress function,

136
00:08:26.435 --> 00:08:29.500
bloginfo, you know this one, just name.

137
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:35.220
That's just pulling the name of
the website, and there's one extra thing.

138
00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:40.690
What if I wanted this to be dynamic
to the author of the website,

139
00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:41.635
not just hard coded?

140
00:08:41.635 --> 00:08:45.185
Well, php and then the_author_link.

141
00:08:45.185 --> 00:08:49.106
Let's save that and see what happens.

142
00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:56.350
Bootstrap to WordPress copyright 2014,
bootstrap_admin.

143
00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:59.665
So here we have the author and

144
00:08:59.665 --> 00:09:03.550
Bootstrap_admin doesn't look very good,
so let's change that.

145
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:07.020
Let's go back to our Dashboard real quick,
head over to Users, and

146
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:08.860
I wanna change my nickname.

147
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:11.830
Well, I'm gonna keep the nickname.

148
00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:13.930
I'm actually gonna
change the display name.

149
00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:15.550
That's what I wanna change.

150
00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:18.760
Well, I need to fill in some information
for WordPress to have some options, so

151
00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.610
let's go Brad Hussey.

152
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.290
And then I can change
the nickname to anything I want.

153
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:29.120
It gives me a bunch of options, so
I'm just going to choose Brad Hussey.

154
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.410
Then I'm going to update that profile and
now,

155
00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:35.750
down here, you should see Bootstrap to
WordPress copyright 2014 Brad Hussey.

156
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:36.840
There we go!

157
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.530
And so that is how you play
around with custom menus and

158
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:43.640
then we just made the footer
just a little bit more dynamic.

159
00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.450
Awesome and some of you might be wondering

160
00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:49.340
well what if I wanted to play
around with some drop down menus?

161
00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.770
I wanted to do drop down
menus within WordPress.

162
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:56.890
Well you can actually do and
that is going to be a lecture.

163
00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:59.700
It's just going to be
a future bonus lecture.

164
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.490
So stay tuned for that.

165
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:04.600
In the next lecture we're going to do
something important that a lot of people

166
00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.850
overlook and that is the 404 page.

167
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:09.810
Oh broken, looks bad.

168
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:11.550
This isn't a good page.

169
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:15.130
This is a good reason why someone
will leave my site and not come back.

170
00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:18.380
So we need to fix this, and
we're gonna fix that in the next lecture.

171
00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:24.219
See you there.
