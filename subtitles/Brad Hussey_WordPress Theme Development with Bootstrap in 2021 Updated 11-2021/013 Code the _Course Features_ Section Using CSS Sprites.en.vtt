00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.220
Hey, everybody, welcome back to Boost
Your Income with Bootstrap to WordPress.

2
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.230
This lecture is very exciting, because not
only are we coding a new section in HTML,

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.500
but we're actually gonna be
introducing you to CSS sprites,

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.620
which is something as instructor and
student, we have not done before.

5
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.188
So, check it out.

6
00:00:17.188 --> 00:00:25.554
[MUSIC]

7
00:00:25.554 --> 00:00:26.953
All right everybody, welcome back.

8
00:00:26.953 --> 00:00:30.050
Today we're gonna code the cross
feature section right here.

9
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.630
Sorry about that.

10
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.630
Sometimes when I code I get
a random Australian accent.

11
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.730
So right here we have six columns
using the Bootstrap grid.

12
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:37.630
We have a blue background.

13
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.450
Nothing crazy but the special part about
this lecture are these icons right here.

14
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.670
They're actually sprites or
a single sprite, and that's something as

15
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.290
a student- instructor relationship,
we haven't come this far yet.

16
00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.410
So we're doing really well and we're
gonna learn how to do that right now.

17
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.260
I think you will like it, check it out.

18
00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.630
Jump into your HTML, in your course.

19
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.970
Sorry about that,
I almost went Australian on me again.

20
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.604
Course features, we're gonna start

21
00:01:08.604 --> 00:01:13.818
doing some HTML id=course-features and

22
00:01:13.818 --> 00:01:19.463
we're going to close that
up with a comment and

23
00:01:19.463 --> 00:01:22.400
if class=container.

24
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.645
All right, and here we're going to do our
section header div class=section-header,

25
00:01:28.645 --> 00:01:35.060
awesome There it is.

26
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.485
All right, image, gotta do our image.

27
00:01:37.485 --> 00:01:41.910
Assets/img/icon-rocket.png.

28
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:48.650
Alt will be rocket because
it is a graphic of a rocket.

29
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:56.960
Level H2, level two heading course
features, whoops, features, perfect.

30
00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.190
Under that, we're gonna do a row.

31
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.900
As usually,
you can kind of see a pattern now.

32
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.510
At this point with all these sections,
we're using similar mark up.

33
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.670
OK, don't forget to save.

34
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:10.400
We're gonna do a column.

35
00:02:13.907 --> 00:02:15.930
And I wanna show you something.

36
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.410
See how long it took me
to type all that out?

37
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.590
I know it only took me about two or
three seconds I cuz I'm using Coda two,

38
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.430
I use a custom clip to, I use custom clips
to help me speed up my coding even more.

39
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.440
So, instead of me writing all of this all
I have to do is this, call and then tab.

40
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.860
Then it just asks me for
the size, so small.

41
00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.280
The hit tab, and then I'm using two.

42
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.840
So there it is, that's all I had to do.

43
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.340
So from here, from this point forward,

44
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.490
I'll probably do that,
because I like fast coding.

45
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.420
And if you're using Coda as well,
you can create a custom clip.

46
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.060
I'll just show you really super quick.

47
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.310
Right here clips and you can add
your own clip down at the bottom.

48
00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.500
You can add the quick little plus sign and
you can add your own clip.

49
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:08.940
My custom column clip looks like this,
here it is.

50
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:09.440
Woops.

51
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.430
Looks like this, called grid element.

52
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.940
I just added the HTML, and
I added a place holder called size, and

53
00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.470
a place holder called,
well just the pound sign, and

54
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.790
then the tab was the key,
the trigger, and then I saved that.

55
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.440
And then whenever I type out Call,
it pulls that up for

56
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.050
me, helps me speed up my coding.

57
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.870
Just a little tip there
if you're using Coda 2,

58
00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.320
which I certainly hope you
are because it's the best, awesome.

59
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.248
I class, this is where we're
gonna add our own custom icons.

60
00:03:39.248 --> 00:03:43.680
So, ci, we're gonna use that class and

61
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.990
it's a custom class we're gonna
have to style called custom icon.

62
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.480
That's what I'm calling it Ci,

63
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.540
and then ci-computer I'm using the same
meaning conventions as Font Awesome.

64
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.890
So FA for Font Awesome,
CI for Custom Icon.

65
00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:03.821
H4, this will say,
lifetime access to 80+ lectures.

66
00:04:03.821 --> 00:04:10.190
I'm gonna copy and paste all of this
markup and just change some text.

67
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.260
So instead of computer,
the second one will be watch.

68
00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:21.320
And the text will be ten plus
hours of HD video content.

69
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.035
Paste that out again instead of computer,
this one will be calendar.

70
00:04:28.035 --> 00:04:34.610
The text will be,
30-day money back guarantee.

71
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.050
Paste that out again.

72
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:46.414
This next one will be community,
and the text will be

73
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:53.534
Access to a community of
like-minded students.

74
00:04:53.534 --> 00:04:56.590
For some reason I always
type the last word wrong.

75
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.330
Next one, instead of computer,
instructor, that's me.

76
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:09.880
Direct access to the instructor and

77
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.980
then the last one will be ci device.

78
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.870
And that will say excessive
content on your mobile devices.

79
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.260
Look at that, I got my last word correct.

80
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.780
Save that.

81
00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:24.800
Let's just see what that looks like.

82
00:05:27.938 --> 00:05:29.140
So here we go.

83
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.350
It's pretty much there.

84
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.040
It's all centered because
we have the section header,

85
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.800
the correct graphic and some text.

86
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.850
But we're missing our icons, those things.

87
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.820
So this is where we do some CSS.

88
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:42.809
Jump in your CSS.

89
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.760
First thing's first, let's give that
section the correct background color.

90
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:57.428
So that background color, or
that ID is course features,

91
00:05:57.428 --> 00:06:05.480
background will be 3D four-two-four-nine.

92
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.780
And then the color will be
white because right now,

93
00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.510
the color is actually dark, but
we're going to be on a blue background, so

94
00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.800
it needs to be white in
order to see it properly.

95
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.460
And then text align center,
because these little sections,

96
00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.540
these little blurbs of
text aren't centered.

97
00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.510
They are left aligned,
we want them center aligned, save it.

98
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.640
Let's see if that did the job, perfect.

99
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.150
Now let's work on our sprite.

100
00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.110
So, a sprit, do you know what a sprite is?

101
00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:35.240
If yes, awesome.

102
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.470
You should be excited to do this and
get some practice.

103
00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:41.270
If not, even more awesome because
this will blow your mind.

104
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:47.060
So in here,
I have an image called icon-sprite.

105
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:52.700
You can hardly see it here, but
there are six icons side-by-side.

106
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.580
I wonder if I could show you here, better.

107
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.890
There you go, that's a little bit better.

108
00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:57.000
You could see six icons.

109
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.680
I created a PSD, and

110
00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.410
then I exported it into a graphic,
where I put my custom icons side-by-side.

111
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:08.210
And they're specific widths apart, they're
equal widths, each of the icons, and

112
00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.610
they're side by side.

113
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.570
This way, all I have to do in a sprite

114
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:19.540
is give the section I want to
have a background image and

115
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:26.110
shift the background position to
display whatever icon I want to show.

116
00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:29.140
To make more sense let's just jump in and
do it.

117
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:36.350
All right, here in our CSS, you're
going to want to create a new section.

118
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.790
Just a little HTML section.

119
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:42.360
I'm gonna call custom icon sprites.

120
00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:48.590
This is just so
you have Easy reference to this CSS.

121
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:52.010
So we're going to select the i
tag with the class of ci.

122
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.170
Display inline-block.

123
00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:59.330
The height of these icons are 40 pixels,
and

124
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:02.730
the width is also 40 pixels,
perfect square.

125
00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:06.256
Background URL we're looking for

126
00:08:06.256 --> 00:08:12.590
../img/icon-sprite.png' and
then no-repeat.

127
00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:14.430
We're not repeating this at all.

128
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:17.300
So this is just all of the icon.

129
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:24.180
The iHTML tags with a class of ci
will have this background image,

130
00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:28.650
but we only want to display
a specific section of the sprite.

131
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:33.250
And the benefit of the sprite is we're
only loading one image rather than six

132
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:37.890
separate images, or
you could even do this with 1000 images.

133
00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:41.020
Sites like Facebook for all the little
icons, like the thumbs up for

134
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:46.040
the like and the little comment
bubbles and little avatar icons,

135
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.400
and arrows and everything I got,
that's in a sprite.

136
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.510
So it's only loading one single image for
all of those little UI graphics.

137
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:53.980
Rather than a thousand images,

138
00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:58.000
that takes up a lot of loading time,
to load all those images.

139
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.630
Where as this only loads one image and the
CSS takes hardly any loading time at all.

140
00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:09.540
All right, so now we're gonna
style specific classes, so Ci.

141
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:12.300
Also the class of CI computers.

142
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.020
So you see how these are connected?

143
00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.840
Because this is a very specific selector.

144
00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:24.010
So CI, no spaces here, just ci.cicomputer.

145
00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:24.865
I'm gonna give a couple tabs here.

146
00:09:27.054 --> 00:09:31.180
And background position,
this is the first one, 0, 0.

147
00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.620
Because the computer is
the first graphic in the sprite,

148
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:38.438
background position is
top left essentially.

149
00:09:38.438 --> 00:09:43.038
All right, ci.ci-watch, tab in there.

150
00:09:43.038 --> 00:09:50.369
This background-position will be -40px and

151
00:09:50.369 --> 00:09:55.195
zero, and that's because the X axis,

152
00:09:55.195 --> 00:10:00.240
-40 means I'm pulling the graphic
to the left 40 pixels,

153
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.820
which means,
in my 40 by 40 window that I've set

154
00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:10.130
it's going to now display
the second icon in my sprite.

155
00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:18.320
So think of that 40 by 40
window in my height and width.

156
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.850
Think of it literally as a window and

157
00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:25.110
then behind it I have a big sheet
of paper With six images on it.

158
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:30.480
And when I say negative 40, I'm moving
that paper negative 40 pixels to the left,

159
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.560
which now displays the second graphic.

160
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:35.730
Hopefully that makes sense.

161
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:38.406
Why don't we just check it out and
see what we have so far?

162
00:10:42.368 --> 00:10:43.990
Well, would you look here.

163
00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:47.230
So you can see right now they
are all displaying top and left.

164
00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:50.050
So these ones are incorrect, but
at least the image is being pulled in.

165
00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:51.950
But look here, our watch.

166
00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:53.200
It's showing up.

167
00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:57.760
Let me just show you what I mean by the,
think of the window and

168
00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.530
the paper when I talk about that.

169
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:04.820
If I instead of saying negative 40,
what if I said negative 30 and

170
00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:06.150
I don't go all the way over.

171
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.750
What will happen?

172
00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.350
You could see part of both.

173
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:13.010
The computer and the watch.

174
00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:15.198
So I didn't pull this to the left enough.

175
00:11:15.198 --> 00:11:19.460
So I'm gonna say 40, and
that will be perfect.

176
00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:20.410
Copy that and past that.

177
00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:26.500
I'm just gonna change this value to
calendar, and that now will be 80.

178
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.110
Hopefully that makes sense.

179
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:33.240
Now you can just go ahead and just add the
rest, cuz it's simple math at this point.

180
00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.860
Calendar, we have community, and

181
00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:40.840
that one will obviously be another 40,
which will be 120.

182
00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.840
Let's just go ahead and
change these values here.

183
00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.850
This will be 160 and this one will be 200.

184
00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:51.290
Change this last one here to device oh,
and one more.

185
00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:52.690
This one will be instructor.

186
00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:56.850
Go ahead and save those, and
all your icons will work perfect.

187
00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:02.390
Boom, there they all are, computer, watch,
calendar, community, instructor, device.

188
00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:04.790
There is the Course Features section.

189
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:06.810
Good job,
you learned how to do CSS sprites.

190
00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:08.870
Finally, I revealed the secret.

191
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:11.180
It's very easy, but it's super-useful.

192
00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.570
I love using them and
I'll see you in the next lecture,

193
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:17.410
because we're gonna be coding our
final project features section.

194
00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.155
Very simple section but
I'll see you there.

195
00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:22.919
