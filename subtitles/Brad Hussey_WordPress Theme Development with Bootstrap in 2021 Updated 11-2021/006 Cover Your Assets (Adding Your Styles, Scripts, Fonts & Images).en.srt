00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:00,930
Hola, mi amigos.

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,750
Welcome back to Boost Your Income
with Bootstrap to WordPress.

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,120
This lecture is called Cover Your Assets.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,920
We're gonna be installing our assets
folder into our WordPress site.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:20,800
Boom.
[MUSIC]

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,030
All right, and we're back.

7
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,820
So this lecture is called
Cover Your Assets.

8
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:29,650
And basically what I mean by that is that
we need to add all of the proper assets,

9
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,760
or more specifically,
our assets folder to our WordPress site.

10
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,430
Because right now, we have no images,
we have no styles, we have no fonts,

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,460
we have no JS, all that stuff.

12
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,960
Very important for the overall look and
functionality of our website.

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,650
Specifically, Bootstrap.

14
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:44,800
We need Bootstrap for

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,980
this site to work the way that we coded
it when we did the static version of it.

16
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,900
So right here is the static version we
coded, and here's the assets folder.

17
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,336
Essentially, all I want you to do,
is just take that folder, and

18
00:00:59,336 --> 00:01:05,560
copy it over, right into your Bootstrap
to WordPress theme root directory.

19
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,060
So, that's one step.

20
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,020
We're not quite done yet.

21
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:14,370
So, in there we have the css,
fonts, images, and js.

22
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:18,940
We need to make sure that we
have everything referenced.

23
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:24,683
Now, when we coded this section right
here, when we coded the static site, and

24
00:01:24,683 --> 00:01:31,130
we built our assets folder, at least when
I recorded it, I added Bootstrap 3.2.0.

25
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,897
But in the web development world,
things always update, so

26
00:01:35,897 --> 00:01:39,550
now we're on Bootstrap version 3.3.1.

27
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:44,507
Now at the time of the recording,
I did 3.2.0, but

28
00:01:44,507 --> 00:01:50,102
you probably will have already
downloaded 3.3.1 because

29
00:01:50,102 --> 00:01:57,090
I include it in the course files folder,
right here, Bootstrap 3.3.1.

30
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,730
And that gives us, when you uncompress it,
this dist folder with css, fonts, and js.

31
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:08,410
Basically all I need to do
Is make sure that my css and

32
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,390
my js and fonts are up to date.

33
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,140
So you might not need to do this but

34
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,428
I'm gonna do it right now
just in case you have 3.2.0.

35
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:23,852
So right here, css, let's drag in
our bootstrap-theme.min.css and

36
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:27,588
bootstrap.min.css, pull those over.

37
00:02:27,588 --> 00:02:28,928
Right into our CSS.

38
00:02:31,968 --> 00:02:34,548
And we're gonna replace both of those.

39
00:02:34,548 --> 00:02:36,468
Great, fonts.

40
00:02:38,178 --> 00:02:41,203
We wanna make sure those are up to
date too, so those glyph icons,

41
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:43,035
we're gonna drag those right in here.

42
00:02:43,035 --> 00:02:50,380
We're gonna replace all of those,
and then we have our js.

43
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,470
We have bootstrap.min.js and bootstrap.js.

44
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,050
Grab those, drag them into your js folder,
replace both.

45
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:57,740
Great.

46
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,310
Again, like I said,
if you're already using 3.3.1,

47
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,620
you don't need to worry about this.

48
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,170
If you're using any earlier version,
go ahead and do what I just did.

49
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:11,410
So, drag your assets folder into
the root directory of your theme.

50
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,280
Great.

51
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,900
Now, it doesn't just work that easy.

52
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,040
We need to actually reference these.

53
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,790
So, this is pretty elementary stuff,
but we're gonna do it.

54
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:26,390
We need to, in under our,
let's put it under here.

55
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,260
You could type all this out.

56
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,770
Or, you could check out
your index file here.

57
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:32,660
And you can just, basically,
copy all of this stuff.

58
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:37,680
And we're gonna change
the paths to all of them.

59
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,920
So, copy that.

60
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,850
Paste it right here.

61
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,090
Okay.

62
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,040
Now let's change this up.

63
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:52,630
I need to reference the assets
folder in our WordPress theme.

64
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:56,700
And the way to do that is not
the way that you are used to.

65
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,810
Basically, you need to reference
the root directory of the theme,

66
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,020
not the root directory of WordPress.

67
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,490
Take note of that, or remember that.

68
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:09,640
Because you will run into many
issues if you reference the wrong

69
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,210
path of your assets.

70
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,519
So this is how you do it,

71
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:22,300
php you use a built in word
press function called bloginfo.

72
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,690
And then we can access
the stylesheet_directory.

73
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,840
That will give us the directory.

74
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,659
This is dynamic and will always update
no matter if we're on local host or

75
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:37,980
if you're on your website.com or
your website.ca or whatever it is.

76
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,260
The style sheet directory is dynamic and
will always find your Bootstrap to

77
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:47,340
WordPress style sheet directory, or
whatever active theme you're using.

78
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:53,010
And then after that,
/assets/css, there it is.

79
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,700
So now your core CSS should be hooked in.

80
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,370
Same thing goes for
the rest of this stuff.

81
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:02,530
So let's just copy this and
the forward trailing slash there.

82
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:10,040
And paste this before your
FontAwesome Icons, /css/font-awesome.

83
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,540
Great.

84
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,490
And the Custom CSS.

85
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:19,650
Basically, this is not going to
be included right here because

86
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:25,440
it's built in to WordPress, so
it doesn't quite work the same.

87
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,622
You can add a custom CSS style sheet but
if you want to keep it simple and

88
00:05:29,622 --> 00:05:34,840
use the built in styles, the style sheet
that's already in Bootstrap to WordPress.

89
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,015
They just have it simply here outside
of assets and just have it right

90
00:05:39,015 --> 00:05:42,980
here in the root directory of
the Bootstrap to WordPress theme.

91
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,810
You don't need to actually do this.

92
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:54,320
But you need to make sure that
your styles in your css folder

93
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,520
are copied into this style.css.

94
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,250
So why don't we do that?

95
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,760
Delete this, save what you have so far.

96
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,850
Google Fonts should be good to go.

97
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:10,513
Now, what you wanna do is,
open up your style.css

98
00:06:10,513 --> 00:06:15,700
file that came with the starter theme.

99
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,410
Go ahead and open that up.

100
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,720
Now, this comes with the theme.

101
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,439
There is a lot of
unnecessary styles in here,

102
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:24,170
we're gonna clean it up
in the next lecture.

103
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:28,987
But for now,
basically what we want to do is grab here

104
00:06:28,987 --> 00:06:32,840
in our css folder, open up custom.css.

105
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,304
This is the CSS we coded
in our static site.

106
00:06:36,304 --> 00:06:41,254
Copy all of it, Cmd+A, Cmd+C.

107
00:06:41,254 --> 00:06:42,424
Copy all of that.

108
00:06:42,424 --> 00:06:47,421
And at the end of the style
sheet that's provided with

109
00:06:47,421 --> 00:06:50,430
the skeleton theme, paste it.

110
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:55,570
Okay, so now it's in there, I'm just
gonna scroll up to the very beginning

111
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:58,170
of our custom styles here, and
we're gonna make a note of it.

112
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,650
Okay so we have custom,
we have Galleries here,

113
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:03,530
this is the previous styles, here we go.

114
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:06,110
Here's where our styles start.

115
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,130
I'm gonna add a comment here.

116
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:11,875
And this is gonna be I
believe this is number 13.

117
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:15,090
12.2, yeah we're gonna go number
13 in our table of contents here.

118
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:22,970
This is Theme Specific Styles.

119
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,040
Not necessary to put this,

120
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:28,790
but trying to keep organized here in
our table of contents up at the top.

121
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,965
So why don't we just add that in here.

122
00:07:31,965 --> 00:07:34,070
13.0 Styles.

123
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,290
There we go.

124
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,940
So now you know number 13 is
our Theme Specific Styles.

125
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,768
You can scroll down to your theme specific
styles, they're all right here, okay.

126
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,560
Go ahead and hit Save.

127
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,470
Now you could just get rid
of your custom.css file.

128
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:52,560
You don't need it anymore because
it's now included in your style.css.

129
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,860
However, leave your css folder because we
have our theme.min and bootstrap.min.css.

130
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,570
So this is basically just
external third party things.

131
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:06,390
So like font-awesome CSS for
Bootstrap, fonts for

132
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:10,940
Bootstrap, this is gonna be our images,
and we have JS for Bootstrap and

133
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,900
jQuery, and our custom JS.

134
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,820
All right, so you save that.

135
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,980
Let's go back to our header.

136
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:24,530
One more thing we're missing here
is under our Google fonts here.

137
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:31,770
In our static, we have the HTML5 shiv and
the IE9 maxcdn links.

138
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:32,840
So copy those.

139
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:37,960
And we're going to, under WordPress head,
it's important to do that

140
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,630
because this needs to be
last in our head here.

141
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:49,760
So the HTML5 shiv and

142
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,830
that will include the less than
IE 9 conditional comments here.

143
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,780
So if you're looking at this on IE 8 or

144
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:02,968
lower, then we're going
to serve up some shiv and

145
00:09:02,968 --> 00:09:09,920
respond.js that's gonna help HTML5
work on those crappy browsers.

146
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,340
If any of you are using IE,
I suggest not doing that and

147
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,450
using something like Chrome or Safari.

148
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,650
Okay.

149
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,450
So, we're looking good.

150
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,320
We covered our assets, right over here.

151
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,950
We added our updated Bootstrap files and
all of that.

152
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:33,800
We made sure our styles from our
custom.css were copied into our style.css,

153
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,510
which is a theme specific style
sheet already prebuilt in to our

154
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:44,410
WordPress head function that comes
with our skeleton underscores meme.

155
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,370
Great, all right.

156
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,680
So, good lecture.

157
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,830
You did a good job.

158
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:51,010
There's a lot more to do, but
it's gonna get better and better and

159
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,420
better cuz you're gonna start
seeing some really cool results.

160
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,560
Well, before we end this,
why don't we check it out and

161
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,740
see if something's changed.

162
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,760
You know, maybe something's broken.

163
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,800
All right here we go.

164
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,700
You can see a significant difference.

165
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,750
Obviously it looks like crap right now.

166
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,840
But you can see that
Bootstrap's hooked in.

167
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:15,600
We have some styles that
roughly reflect what we coded.

168
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,350
There are fonts.

169
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,040
And all that stuff.

170
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,840
So we're getting there.

171
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,720
I'll see you in the next lecture.

172
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,750
We're gonna clean up that style sheet and
start making this look a bit better.

173
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,790
All right.
See you there.

174
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:29,629
