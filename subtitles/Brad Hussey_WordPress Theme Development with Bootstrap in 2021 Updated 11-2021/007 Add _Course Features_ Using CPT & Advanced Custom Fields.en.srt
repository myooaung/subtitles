Hey everyone, welcome back to Boost
Your Income with Bootstrap to WordPress.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,648
This lecture is called Add the course
features using custom post types and

3
00:00:08,648 --> 00:00:10,619
advanced custom fields.

4
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:12,268
That's a mouth full, check it out.

5
00:00:12,268 --> 00:00:20,928
[MUSIC]

6
00:00:20,928 --> 00:00:22,298
All right, so this lecture's gonna be fun.

7
00:00:22,298 --> 00:00:25,842
So it's gonna be a little bit more
advanced than the previous lecture,

8
00:00:25,842 --> 00:00:28,796
because what we have to do for
this course feature section,

9
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:32,290
is not only add the image and
the title, which is easy.

10
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:37,069
We have to add each of these items,
these course features, and

11
00:00:37,069 --> 00:00:40,090
we're gonna use custom post types.

12
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:44,064
You want to be able to have these
be individual custom posts,

13
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:48,045
because what if we want to
add only three features?

14
00:00:48,045 --> 00:00:51,835
Or what if I have more features as we
go along, and I have ten features?

15
00:00:51,835 --> 00:00:54,715
And if we were to use just
the advanced custom fields,

16
00:00:54,715 --> 00:00:57,785
then we're only going to make room for
six of them.

17
00:00:57,785 --> 00:01:02,962
But if we do advanced custom post types,
then we can keep adding individual

18
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:07,685
post types and they'll be
individual entries in the database.

19
00:01:07,685 --> 00:01:12,730
The other bonus in this lecture
is we're gonna show you how

20
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:18,200
we can use custom post types and
advanced custom fields to

21
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,190
decide which icon we're going to use,
by modifying the CSS spread.

22
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:27,230
So, jam packed lecture,
this is going to be awesome, all right.

23
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:32,590
So let's head back to our
Custom Post Types UI, click on Add New.

24
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:37,508
And we want to add a new Custom Post Type,
and we want to call it course_feature.

25
00:01:37,508 --> 00:01:41,470
So it's gonna be lowercase and
we're going to use no spaces, so

26
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,590
we're going to use underscore,
course_feature.

27
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:49,035
And then the label on the sidebar
I want to be Course Features,

28
00:01:49,035 --> 00:01:52,209
the singular label will be Course Feature.

29
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:56,794
And then the description, it won't
show up anywhere but this is just for

30
00:01:56,794 --> 00:01:57,782
your own sake.

31
00:01:57,782 --> 00:02:01,659
These are the features you
wanna highlight in the course.

32
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:05,213
In fact, if you hover over this it should
tell you Custom Post Type Description,

33
00:02:05,213 --> 00:02:07,371
describe what your custom
post type is used for.

34
00:02:07,371 --> 00:02:11,210
Okay, so then now you can go to Advanced
Label Options, which we won't be doing.

35
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:15,050
It's just that if you wanted to have
different and more advanced options for

36
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,780
how you want the label to display, but

37
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,790
Advanced Options is
worth having a look at.

38
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,250
So usually the default options are fine.

39
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,680
In some cases you don't want them,
so say for example,

40
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,248
exclude from search, do you want to
exclude the course features the search?

41
00:02:31,248 --> 00:02:35,710
If you have a search field on your web
site and someone types in something,

42
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,790
do you want that course
feature to be excluded?

43
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,100
And I'm gonna say true,

44
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:45,600
because it's not worth an entire page
just to see one single course feature.

45
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,850
Its just gonna be a little icon and

46
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:52,380
a one-liner description,
it's not worth having its own page.

47
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:57,514
And Has Archive, this is whether
the post type will have a post

48
00:02:57,514 --> 00:03:02,466
type archive page,
we don't need that as well,so False.

49
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:05,554
And all the rest is fine.

50
00:03:08,131 --> 00:03:13,913
Show in menu, we do want to show
this in our sidebar menu here.

51
00:03:13,913 --> 00:03:17,096
And the menu icon,
we need to put the full URL for

52
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:19,810
the icon you want to display in the side.

53
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:25,350
Otherwise it'll just have a generic tool,
a little gear icon here.

54
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:29,820
So, we do have the icon, and it is located

55
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:39,080
in your image folder in your
WordPress site, as icon-features.

56
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,910
So we just need to grab the full URL for
that, so if you were to go to Assets,

57
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:50,442
and then image > icon features,
I'm just gonna copy that path.

58
00:03:50,442 --> 00:03:57,300
And essentially, I'm gonna paste it here
but I'm gonna have to remove a few things.

59
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:02,590
So we have icon features which is buried
in image, which is buried in assets,

60
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,500
and then buried in your
Bootstrap to WordPress folder.

61
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,660
So basically all we're gonna do
here is themes, WordPress content.

62
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:15,360
So remove B2W and everything before it,
which would be desktop, volumes,

63
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,250
Macintosh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

64
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:22,330
So we want the root to
be WordPress content,

65
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,880
well the root, and
then jump into WordPress content.

66
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,910
Then themes, bootstrap2wordpress, assets,
image, icon features, that'll do it.

67
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:33,850
Supports, this is what do we want this

68
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:39,620
custom post type to support in its editing
page, do we want it to have all of these?

69
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,260
And because I'm just gonna
have a title and room for

70
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:47,980
an image which we're gonna create in
advance custom fields, we only need title.

71
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,520
So uncheck all of these except for title.

72
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:57,640
Create custom post type, now it'll
display right here in your sidebar.

73
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,950
Course features, there it is, cool.

74
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,691
So now if you click on that, you'll be
taken to the course features section and

75
00:05:03,691 --> 00:05:06,390
you can see all the course features.

76
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,230
For course features right now,
if were to go add course feature,

77
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:15,400
we just have a title, and
we need to also be able to have a section

78
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,880
to choose which icon we wanna
use out of our CSS Sprite.

79
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,370
So we can do that by
going to Custom Fields,

80
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,170
Advanced Custom Fields, that is, and
we're gonna Add a New Field Group.

81
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:31,000
And we're gonna call it Course Features,
and

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,980
we're just gonna give one field here, and
it's gonna be the course feature icon.

83
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:46,210
Field type will be a radio button, meaning
you can select one of multiple options.

84
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,990
And the field instructions will be,

85
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,550
choose the icon you'd like to display
with the feature, is this required?

86
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,750
Yes.

87
00:05:53,750 --> 00:06:00,030
Now Choices, this has a certain syntax
that is required and it's very easy.

88
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:03,400
It says over here you can either just
put the choices like this, one per line.

89
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:10,070
Or you can have the name or the value
that would be associated on the back end,

90
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,710
and then a colon, and
then the front end what will display.

91
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:17,900
So if your front end display is
a little different than what

92
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,810
the choices in the background are,
then you would do this.

93
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:25,660
And that's what we're gonna do,
because our choices,

94
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,230
they're gonna look a little like this.

95
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:36,130
So, I have ci space ci-computer, colon,
and then the front end displays computer.

96
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:39,970
And if you remember or recall,
these are the classes we used for

97
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,935
our CSS sprites, let me just show you.

98
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:47,280
On our index page here, our home page,

99
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:53,400
you can see course features, so we have
an icon with the class ci ci-computer.

100
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,380
So essentially what
we're trying to do here

101
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,980
is give people options to choose
which icons they want to see.

102
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:05,020
So, computer, device, user, so on and so

103
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:10,820
forth, of all the sprites that we
already have in our CSS Sprite image.

104
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:16,650
And then if they choose a certain
radio button, then that will select or

105
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:21,310
tell the database to store this text,
which happens to be the classes.

106
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:25,500
So we can easily,
depending on what they choose,

107
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,510
update the icon to have
the correct Sprite.

108
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:30,480
So the other options look like so.

109
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:35,750
So we have CI watch, and then Calendar,
Community, Instructor, and Device.

110
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,490
So go ahead and

111
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:40,980
write those down in your choices,
feel free to pause if you need to.

112
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:46,109
And then after that I'm just going
to go ahead and close the field.

113
00:07:46,109 --> 00:07:51,053
Here in our location we want to show this
field group if the post type is equal to

114
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:56,401
course feature, because now we have a new
custom post type called course feature.

115
00:07:56,401 --> 00:07:59,803
So this will only show
up on course features.

116
00:07:59,803 --> 00:08:03,009
Down here we want the style and

117
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:08,158
the look to be normal and seamless box.

118
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:13,180
So we have all this like it is already,
in fact you could probably hide

119
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,840
everything here, cuz the only thing
we actually need is the title.

120
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,230
So hide all that and then publish.

121
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:25,270
So now go back to your course features,
and add a new course feature, and so

122
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:29,160
now you'll see the title, and
a course feature icon option.

123
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:34,140
So basically, lets just add new posts,
new course features, and

124
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,600
on our front end we have
them all right here.

125
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,589
So lets just copy these out and
choose the correct icons.

126
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,730
So lifetime access, that's computer.

127
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,530
Add a course feature,
gonna do another one here.

128
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:53,668
And that will be watch,
because we're using the watch icon.

129
00:08:53,668 --> 00:08:59,880
Community icon.

130
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,280
That's the instructor icon.

131
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,903
And then one last one,

132
00:09:04,903 --> 00:09:10,377
we have the accessible content on your
mobile devices with the mobile icon.

133
00:09:13,457 --> 00:09:15,123
And if you were to want more icons,

134
00:09:15,123 --> 00:09:18,410
basically you just add
more icons in your sprite.

135
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:23,950
And then you just add the icons
here in your radio button list,

136
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,900
and then go to town.

137
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,450
So now that we've added all
of our course features,

138
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:28,790
you can see them here in the list.

139
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,850
They're in their own section.

140
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,670
We need to be able to pull them in
to our code, so let's scroll up and

141
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,219
let's do some more variables.

142
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,990
Now there's one thing
that we still need to do.

143
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,770
We need to add the image and
the description for

144
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:44,390
the features, the course features section.

145
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,230
So why don't we go ahead and
do that first?

146
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:49,850
Let's go back to our custom fields, and
we're going to add a new field group,

147
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:56,560
which is going to be called,
Course Features Section.

148
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:04,500
Then we're gonna add field labe,l which
will be the features section image.

149
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:11,180
And then we're gonna choose
the image required no Image object.

150
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,290
Medium preview size in the edit screen.

151
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:14,920
Good to go.

152
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,150
Let's add another.

153
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:20,660
This'll be the Features Section title,

154
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:24,560
lots of typos there,
section title, there we go.

155
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,910
This will be text.

156
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,140
Required, yes.

157
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:33,410
And no formatting, close that field,
and then we have one more thing,

158
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:40,670
the features section body.

159
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,580
Here we go.

160
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,990
And this will be a text area.

161
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,100
Acquired yes.

162
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,590
And everything else looks good.

163
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,240
Okay, cool.

164
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,560
And then do we want to hide
anything on this screen?

165
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,150
Let's at least give it the standard
WordPress meta box style.

166
00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:03,900
And we need to make sure that
the page is equal to home.

167
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,800
Go ahead and publish that.

168
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,780
And then your homepage edit screen,
go ahead and refresh.

169
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,250
There we go,
we have our course feature section.

170
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,790
It looks like it's at the very top here,
above the booster income and

171
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,220
who should take this course section.

172
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,800
Now the reason why.

173
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,350
Is because the position of
the meta box has been set for

174
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:28,050
these two,
when we manually drag them around.

175
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,730
So I'm resetting the position here, so

176
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:35,510
it's overriding what
the default positioning is.

177
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:39,070
When we put that in our field
group using the order number.

178
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,580
And so basically now,

179
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,960
you just need to make sure to drag
this into it's respective section.

180
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,850
Again, it doesn't effect how
it appears in the front end.

181
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,470
But for your own sake, your client's sake.

182
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:56,580
It would probably be a good idea to just
have it be in order in the edit screen.

183
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:00,360
So essentially all I need to do now,
is to just have the image, the title, and

184
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,060
the body.

185
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,770
Which is very easy.

186
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:06,440
We have the image, and
we have the title here.

187
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,260
And I also just noticed that there
is no body section for this section.

188
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:15,120
But we can leave it, because we can
have the option to put that in there.

189
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,550
But we might need to make a few changes,
so let's go back here.

190
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,560
Feature section title.

191
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,210
The image is going to be In our

192
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:30,350
image assets folder here,
were gonna be taking the icon rocket.

193
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:36,270
Drag that in there, and
this will be icon, or

194
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:40,610
rocket icon,
all to be an icon of a rocket.

195
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:47,430
Select, so that'll be good, intersection
body, let's make it optional, because

196
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:51,450
I don't actually have any text for it, and
if you wanted to put in snyyhinh, great.

197
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:56,050
But we're gonna need to make this optional
so for now, because I need to save this,

198
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,730
let's just put something so

199
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:03,060
we can actually save or update,
and go back to our field group.

200
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,070
And feature section body,
make it not require an update.

201
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:12,540
And then we go back to your edit
screen for your homepage here.

202
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,670
Now this is not required,
I can delete that, and then update.

203
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,940
So if you have any text you
want to put there, great.

204
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,460
Let's go to our code editor.

205
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:26,700
And now we're gonna start
hooking all this stuff in.

206
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:31,258
So we need to have a couple
advanced fields variables.

207
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:42,541
And we're gonna have
the features_section_image.

208
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,330
That's going to be the same
as this stuff up here.

209
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:53,800
This will be features section image.

210
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,680
Then below that we're going to
have our features section title.

211
00:14:03,369 --> 00:14:08,332
And then after,
we'll have our feature section body, and

212
00:14:08,332 --> 00:14:11,410
that will be feature section body.

213
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:18,640
Great, now we can access those
down here in our course features.

214
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:23,700
So let's go ahead and change
the content here in the section header.

215
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,070
Again, we're just gonna
copy this PHP if statement,

216
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,480
to grab the feature image
that we have uploaded.

217
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,580
If the user uploaded an image, that is.

218
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:39,390
And this should not be who_feature,
it should be features_section_image.

219
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:43,020
And then this should be the same
feature section image URL,

220
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,830
feature section image alt.

221
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:51,820
Great, and
then now the title we're gonna go PHP

222
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:58,250
echo feature section title.

223
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:06,016
And now, if you want to add some text,
then basically

224
00:15:06,016 --> 00:15:10,000
let's just see what it looks like,
because we haven't actually tested this.

225
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,370
Paragraph tag here and let's just
put some lorem ipsum, just to test.

226
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,679
Go back in to the front end
version of the site and refresh.

227
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,260
Perfect.
So,

228
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,510
this is what the text will look
like if we want to add it, in fact,

229
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:27,410
maybe we'll make it a leading text,
so it matches the rest.

230
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:31,540
So go back,
give this the class of lead, and

231
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:35,740
now, because it's optional,
we need to be able to account for that.

232
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,600
So, let's first hook it in.

233
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:44,780
And say echo feature section body,

234
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:50,613
but only if the user added body text.

235
00:15:50,613 --> 00:15:54,471
But now we need to add a PHP if statement,
I'm just gonna copy this one and

236
00:15:54,471 --> 00:15:55,743
modify it a little bit.

237
00:15:55,743 --> 00:16:00,218
It's gonna be PHP if not empty
Features_section_body and

238
00:16:00,218 --> 00:16:05,910
then we're gonna close that php
if statement down here, end if.

239
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,710
Great so if the user added body text so

240
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,840
meaning if it's not
empty then there you go.

241
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,880
Otherwise, don't have
anything there at all.

242
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,240
Great!

243
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,590
Save that, and
let's see if it shows up on the front end.

244
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:21,690
Now it shouldn't, because we haven't
saved anything in the back end.

245
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,270
Perfect.

246
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:25,190
Now let's add these icons here.

247
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,787
So it's actually quite easy but it's a
little bit different than what we gonna do

248
00:16:30,787 --> 00:16:35,062
in here using the functions
we've been using.

249
00:16:35,062 --> 00:16:39,820
We're gonna be going a little bit more
hardcore but no sweat it'll be all good.

250
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:45,927
Inside row we just need
to create a new loop and

251
00:16:45,927 --> 00:16:53,340
access through WordPress
query the custom post type.

252
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,440
The course feature custom post type.

253
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,280
So the way that we do that.

254
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:04,460
As we need to store a variable,
content in a variable, called loop.

255
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:08,632
Loop equals, and
now hang in there and follow along,

256
00:17:08,632 --> 00:17:15,170
new WordPress so
WP capital letters query like so.

257
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:21,280
And in here, we need to say an array,
because we're accessing an array.

258
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,920
Post type, that's the key.

259
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,980
The value is course feature.

260
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,980
Now you see what we're accessing.

261
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,480
Comma.

262
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:40,744
We want to order by post_id so

263
00:17:40,744 --> 00:17:47,421
we want to order them by post_id and

264
00:17:47,421 --> 00:17:53,890
we want the order to be ascending.

265
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,220
Now we gotta put that semicolon.

266
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,699
Okay so
we have this variable called loop, so

267
00:18:01,699 --> 00:18:06,383
we're gonna access that now,
down here in a php while loop.

268
00:18:06,383 --> 00:18:12,250
Php while( $loop ) we're

269
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:19,345
gonna grab some info out of there.

270
00:18:19,345 --> 00:18:23,140
Have_posts we're gonna check
to see if the loop has posts.

271
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,200
This is how you write that out.

272
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:28,810
While that loop has posts, remove
that semicolon, that was an accident.

273
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:37,000
We're gonna have a :$loop the_post.

274
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,870
This is just how you do this in WordPress.

275
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:45,370
This is how you access
the info in a WordPress query

276
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,010
to get your custom post types.

277
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:51,770
It's the same way of doing it for
any other custom post types,

278
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:55,590
So I know it looks a little bit advanced,
and it is.

279
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:58,640
But once you know it once, you basically
can just use it over and over and

280
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,300
over again, for
different custom post types.

281
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,140
So this is how you do that.

282
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:11,420
And now, that while loop is open,
meaning we need to close it.

283
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,500
So let's close that while loop.

284
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,200
And then we need to put
something in between it.

285
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,350
So endwhile.

286
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:16,850
There we go.

287
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,030
In there I'm just gonna grab one of
the cuz they're going to be a template.

288
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:27,160
Then I'm gonna paste and
it's gonna use the same structure.

289
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,220
But the class, we'll need to grab,
remember how the radio button,

290
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:38,050
they gave us the class when they chose
the radio button, so php in there.

291
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:43,012
To access that you just say the_field and

292
00:19:43,012 --> 00:19:49,265
then we're grabbing
the course_feature_icon.

293
00:19:49,265 --> 00:19:50,845
Great.

294
00:19:50,845 --> 00:19:51,965
That should be good.

295
00:19:51,965 --> 00:19:55,210
And now we just need to grab the title and
this is actually a very fun one.

296
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:55,900
It's nice and easy.

297
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,684
A built in WordPress
function called the_title.

298
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,940
So because we are in posts in a while

299
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:10,150
loop to grab the info
from the course features.

300
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:14,910
We just need to grab the title because
the title is the main title in that new

301
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,480
course feature post, and that is all.

302
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,793
So let's get rid of all the rest
of these here, we don't need them

303
00:20:20,793 --> 00:20:24,600
because it's gonna loop through them
all now, no matter how many we have.

304
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,170
Whether we have 1 or
1,000 it will loop through them.

305
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:32,030
Real quick here before we move on,
you might be curious why I used the field.

306
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:37,150
I am accessing the custom fields

307
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:39,280
using advance custom fields for
the course feature.

308
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,380
Remember when we created
the course_feature, custom post type,

309
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,510
and we gave it some
advanced custom fields,

310
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,600
where you could choose the course
feature icon in the radio buttons?

311
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:54,180
Well this is how you access it, and we're
using the_field, rather than get_fields,

312
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:59,575
and the reason why, here in
the Advanced Custom Fields documentation.

313
00:20:59,575 --> 00:21:04,000
The_field displays the value
of the specified field.

314
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,756
It's the same as going echo get_field
rather than using get_field alone,

315
00:21:10,756 --> 00:21:16,135
whereas get_field returns the value
of the specified field, so

316
00:21:16,135 --> 00:21:22,270
get_field is a little bit
more versatile function.

317
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:26,040
So if we were to use get_field here,
it would be returning an array

318
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,170
of the course_feature_icons and
it wouldn't actually display.

319
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:32,540
And we'd need to add more information,
and more parameters and

320
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,170
arguments within the function.

321
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:38,150
But the_field echoes that specific icon.

322
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:39,615
Which is why we're using the_field.

323
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,890
Save that, and
let's just double check it worked.

324
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:47,950
Go to your frontend and refresh,
and there it is, dynamic.

325
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:55,980
We have the icon and we have the text and
the title of the feature.

326
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,090
Perfect, and that's all.

327
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:58,740
That's how you do that.

328
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,217
In the next lecture we're
going to move on to the final

329
00:22:02,217 --> 00:22:07,100
project features where we can just add
some info for the project features.

330
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,260
So, see you there.

331
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,470
