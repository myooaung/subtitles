Hey everybody.
Welcome back to

00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:02,930
Boost Your Income With
Bootstrap To WordPress.

3
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,972
And in this lecture I'm going to show you
the one weird trick to vertically line

4
00:00:06,972 --> 00:00:08,760
your content within any element.

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,130
I hate Clickbait.

6
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,220
It gets me every time.

7
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:19,590

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,509
All right guys, what we're gonna do now
is vertically align this content here

9
00:00:24,509 --> 00:00:26,980
in our circles, as you can see, here.

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:34,180
Now, what's cool about this is there's
a couple ways to vertically align content,

11
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:39,590
and it's pretty difficult sometimes
to vertically align your content.

12
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:43,050
I know when I have been developing
websites and I didn't know this trick.

13
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,720
It's really frustrated me cuz I
would use margin or I'd position

14
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:52,150
the element absolute and then just use
a pixel value to vertically align.

15
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,840
To make it look like it's
vertically aligned, but

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,320
what if I change the height
of these elements?

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,750
What if I change the height of
the parent block level element?

18
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,950
And then I have to go and
change the absolute position.

19
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,130
Or what if there's more content?

20
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,460
What if the content, I add more content?

21
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,140
And then, now it's not actually
vertically aligned anymore.

22
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:16,060
Or what if the font doesn't load
properly on a certain browser, and

23
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,210
then the font is just a bit bigger,
and then it drops on a new line.

24
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,760
And it's so many things that

25
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,650
kind of make it difficult to vertically
align content within an element.

26
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,660
And what I mean by vertically align,
if you don't know what I'm talking about,

27
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,580
is this is vertically aligned.

28
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:34,270
It's like saying text align center,
but from top to bottom.

29
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,660
Cuz right here,
it's easy to say text align center.

30
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,700
Instead of left or right.

31
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,440
But I want it in the center vertically,
like this.

32
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,520
So when I add my text you could see here,
it's at the top.

33
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,300
Minus a few styling issues, which we'll
fix, it's just stuck here at the top.

34
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,380
But I want it here, and I want it to
always stay in the center no matter how

35
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,518
big or small that freaking circle is.

36
00:01:57,518 --> 00:02:05,240
So, we're gonna use this cool trick that
will solve that issue for you forever.

37
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,930
So please pay attention to this lecture
because when I found out this trick,

38
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,830
I thought why didn't I know this before?

39
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:17,791
Open up that code editor my friend
right here under your instructor.

40
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:22,700
We're gonna select instructor and
num and then span.

41
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,495
So we're just gonna do a little styling
to make it look a little sexier first.

42
00:02:25,495 --> 00:02:26,940
display: block.

43
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,720
So span elements are default inline.

44
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,320
You want that to be a block.

45
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,970
And then the font size,
you want it to be smaller.

46
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,910
And the font weight, normal.

47
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,800
So let's just have a look.

48
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,670
Okay.
That looks a bit better.

49
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:40,580
Perfect.
Okay.

50
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,453
Now back above that.

51
00:02:43,453 --> 00:02:50,480
Select instructor num and num-content.

52
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,000
Remember in our HTML markup
we have the num element and

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,170
then inside num we have num-content.

54
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,090
And that's because this is
what we're gonna do here.

55
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,674
We're going to say
display will table-cell.

56
00:03:04,674 --> 00:03:08,070
And vertical align middle.

57
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:13,730
Now before you go and check anything, in
order for this table cell display to work,

58
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:17,900
it's parent num needs to be display table.

59
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,744
Right now num is display block.

60
00:03:20,744 --> 00:03:22,556
No no no display table.

61
00:03:22,556 --> 00:03:27,450
We need to make the num
element act like it's a table.

62
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,780
And now that it acts like a table,

63
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:36,180
we can say let's make its child
num-content like a table-cell,

64
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,290
and we can vertically align
the content within that table-cell.

65
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:46,420
That's what's neat about this, because we
don't code in tables anymore for layouts.

66
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,720
We lost the access to easily
vertically align things.

67
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,530
Those of you who are old school and
coded in tables,

68
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,200
you might have thought like, oh totally.

69
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,580
Why don't you just vertically align it?

70
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,000
Like in a table?

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,200
But for those of us who have
been learning web development

72
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,500
past the time when you would
use tables for layouts.

73
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,670
This trick is kinda forgotten
because who uses tables for layouts?

74
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,380
Nobody, at least you shouldn't be,
but this is the trick.

75
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:16,930
Make sure the parent is a display table,
and then you need to have an extra element

76
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:23,050
within that display it table-cell vertical
line middle check this magic out.

77
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,280
Holy moly, that's amazing.

78
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,100
Perfect.
The only thing is,

79
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,980
it looks like there's maybe a little
bit of a line height issue.

80
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,208
So, why don't we go back and fix that.

81
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:37,033
So, in here,
let's just put it above our height and

82
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:42,200
between our color and
I hear it doesn't really matter.

83
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,290
But, I'm going to say,
here line height 24 pixels cuz right now,

84
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,970
it's probably at about 30 or a bit more.

85
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:47,920
So, that should fix it.

86
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,750
Man oh man that looks good.

87
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,770
Perfect.
Well, there you go.

88
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,670
There is the secret trick.

89
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:58,220
That one weird trick to make sure all
of your content is vertically aligned.

90
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,650
And hopefully you love it and
are excited about it.

91
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:02,400
Make note of it.

92
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:06,620
And I'll see you in the next lecture
because then we're going to start coding

93
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,670
our testimonials section.

94
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:13,090
And then we're almost done and then we'll
start jumping into our other pages.

95
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,800
See you there friendos.

96
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,249
