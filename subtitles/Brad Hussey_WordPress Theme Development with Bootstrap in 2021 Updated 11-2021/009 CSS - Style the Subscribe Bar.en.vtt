00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:06.120
Friends, welcome back here in the template we are going to style this little bar up with the subscriber

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.740
and the content right here.

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.600
Let's get at it in our code editor.

4
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.300
Go to the bottom where we left off with our styles.

5
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.700
After the media query, you'll see the title banner and then below that title banner, we're going to

6
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.430
add the styles for the content.

7
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.230
Sorry, the subscriber.

8
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.760
Feel free to add a comment to just kind of show you know where you are.

9
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.210
It's easier to see where you are.

10
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.340
Amidst a sea of success.

11
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.490
And we're going to say subscribed bar.

12
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.600
And then we're going to select the subscribed bar class now in our markup just to make sure we're good.

13
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.840
We got the section of the class of subscriber.

14
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.570
So just to be clear, we're styling this up right now.

15
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:58.380
Subscriber it's going to have the background color of triple one, which is like a just slightly off

16
00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.800
black.

17
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.600
Then padding is going to be 30 pixels top bottom zero sorry, 30 pixels on the top, zero in the left

18
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.210
in the right, 10 pixels on the bottom.

19
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.410
Save it!

20
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.230
Let's have a little look, see and see what it looks like.

21
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.520
All right, cool.

22
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.500
Obviously, we need to see our words.

23
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.580
So let's do that.

24
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.740
We're going to select the Subscribe Bar paragraph tags.

25
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.870
That's going to be a color white.

26
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.230
And then margin bottom paragraphs typically have margin on them, especially on the bottom.

27
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.510
And we're going to override that with zero, and then we're going to do subscribe bar input.

28
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.710
And then a comma actually, or in a combine that with another selector and we're going to say subscriber.

29
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:59.220
And then class of BTN, we're going with one hundred percent overflow hidden.

30
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:09.070
And then display in line block now, just to be clear, this is a really temporary style, this input

31
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:16.750
one because the reality is this isn't just going to be a hand coded or hard coded form input.

32
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.860
You're actually probably going to embed a form from ConvertKit, MailChimp Drip, send Fox whatever

33
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.080
you're using to collect an email address to build your email list.

34
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.180
I know that's what I'm going to be doing on the actual bootstrapped WordPress site right now.

35
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:40.180
This is just an input, but in elementary we can actually change that right here in the HTML we're offering.

36
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.730
The basically this section is HTML code and you can just put your form there.

37
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.010
And now right now, it's just like a dummy form.

38
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:55.420
But basically, I will I will capture, you know, I'll I'll get the embed code from ConvertKit, my

39
00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.850
email marketing software and embed it so that I can actually collect an email address in a section.

40
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.260
Now, as you can see, the button doesn't look very good because we have a really styled the buttons.

41
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:12.670
So if we go back to our CSC, head up to the very top in our kind of styles like typography, rather,

42
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:13.870
let's just call this typography.

43
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:21.220
We should have some button styles in there right after we have our our kind of typography style.

44
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.360
So let's say buttons, styles and then in here is what we're going to do.

45
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.130
Things like we'll go between the class of button.

46
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:39.840
And that's going to have the styles padding 20 pixels, 30 pixels, that means 20 on the top and the

47
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.240
bottom and 30 on the left and the right display in line block no border.

48
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.930
A transition for the button is going to be zero point three seconds or, as you may know, VAR Dash,

49
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.580
Dash transition.

50
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:54.810
Do you are?

51
00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.060
Mort, that margin, the margin bottom would be 20 Pexels Font weight is going be bold, that's going

52
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.290
to make this button look.

53
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.010
Uh, well, in theory, a lot better.

54
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.890
It's not quite there.

55
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.890
Now let's keep going for that button.

56
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.480
Well, while we're at it, we might as well do a hover.

57
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.970
Basically want to add a little bit of box shadow when we hover, just to give it a little bit of a usability

58
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:19.420
kind of.

59
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:25.600
Hey, you, we recognize you hovered over this input or this element rather box out of five pixels,

60
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.260
five pixels, 20 pixels GBA zero zero zero zero point five.

61
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.270
Same thing with the fallbacks web kit.

62
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.990
So that's the hover.

63
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.970
If you check it out.

64
00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.270
You know, you don't really see anything there, because I'm not sure why, actually.

65
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.790
Maybe we'll see it once we actually style up the the button that we're using here, which is button

66
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:46.390
invert.

67
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.480
OK, so let's keep styling these buttons and then we'll probably we'll see.

68
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.660
It's probably don't see it because it's black on black.

69
00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.370
That's why you can't see the black shadow on the black background.

70
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.690
That's why.

71
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:02.110
All right.

72
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.350
BTN combine it with BTN Primary.

73
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.690
So this means a button that a button class that also has the button class of BTN primary.

74
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.340
So an element that has both of these classes together is what we're going to be doing.

75
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.930
Styling and color triple one.

76
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:26.200
The background color is going to be f two C nine for C.

77
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.860
Padding 20 and 50.

78
00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.110
Now let's see if that's a variable.

79
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.070
I think it is.

80
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.730
F two.

81
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.360
No, it's not.

82
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.700
We we might not need to use that as a variable if we use it again, then we'll make it a variable.

83
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.680
Now we're going to also do button secondary because these are our button styles, we might as well start

84
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.010
them up.

85
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:56.040
So this is going to be color white and then the background color is going to be R.G. be a.

86
00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:07.170
And we're going to go with zoologist Richard 02:51, 51, 51, zero point one, OK.

87
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.330
And let's also at our BTN.

88
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:16.780
Additionally, the class of BTN Invert, which is the one that we are styling right now in our subscriber

89
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:25.660
color white padding 12 pixels of 44 pixels background color.

90
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:33.910
We're going to go with our GBA 255 255 255 zero point to save it.

91
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.990
Let's see.

92
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:36.220
Much better.

93
00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:39.070
We need a hover effect on that as well.

94
00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.860
So button invert, we're going to give that a hover effect.

95
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:53.460
And we're just going to give it a box shadow of five pixels, five pixels, 20 pixels and then 20 RGV,

96
00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.330
a 255, 255 255 and then point five.

97
00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:03.480
So basically white at half the alpha channel and then put the fallbacks there as well for the other

98
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:03.940
browsers.

99
00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:04.680
If you care to.

100
00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:10.320
Save that over, there it is, you know, I'm even a little more subtle, that's too much.

101
00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.010
I don't like that.

102
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:12.690
Let's do point to.

103
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:17.920
All right.

104
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.950
Not jived about it, but.

105
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.930
Do you like it, you can leave it up to you now.

106
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:26.450
I don't like the size of that input.

107
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.910
We might as well start input while we're at it.

108
00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:39.230
So we'll just maybe we'll get another section here called forms and then we'll say input type.

109
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:52.500
Text font size 18 pixels, what's the base font size 18, so let's just make it one rim perfect padding

110
00:07:52.920 --> 00:08:00.630
eight pixels, five five pixels and then border radius going to be five pixels.

111
00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:01.080
Save it.

112
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:02.410
There it is.

113
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:05.390
Done much better.

114
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:06.550
Cool.

115
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:10.700
Looks good now since we got those buttons done.

116
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:13.910
Let's head down, down, down, down.

117
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.440
To the bottom of our stylesheet.

118
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.840
After subscriber, we're going to start styling our.

119
00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:27.240
Content.

120
00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:36.640
To grab the class content area, and we're going to say padding one hundred pixels zero, so one hundred

121
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.890
pixels top and bottom zero on the left and right.

122
00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:40.150
OK.

123
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.460
And that looks going to give it some more padding here.

124
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:43.090
Nice.

125
00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.060
And then this is going to be the post list on the blog template.

126
00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:54.190
We're going to go select article with the class of post that's going to have the margin of 50 pixels

127
00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:56.500
top bottom zero left right.

128
00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:57.820
I'll see.

129
00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.170
Nice.

130
00:08:59.200 --> 00:08:59.500
OK.

131
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:04.190
We're going to like post, so the class of post with the.

132
00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.680
And also the class of matter.

133
00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:13.430
So post matter, we're going to have font size 16 pixels, font weight 600 pixels.

134
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:17.870
Text transform uppercase color f five zero zero five seven.

135
00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.600
And the margin bottom of eight.

136
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:22.010
Save it.

137
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:23.390
There we go.

138
00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:24.410
You see, that's nice.

139
00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:25.280
Very nice.

140
00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.010
We use that style.

141
00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:29.030
That color, don't we?

142
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:36.360
I then read, what if we use the color red there, let's see if that worked as a variable.

143
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:41.460
I don't want to get too crazy with colors here and when I want to be consistent VAR dash, dash, color,

144
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:42.090
dash red.

145
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:43.360
Let's see if that works.

146
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:44.970
Yeah, I like that.

147
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:47.050
I like it.

148
00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.130
Goes read.

149
00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:56.800
Now we're also going to select the blog class post a hover H2.

150
00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:01.180
So this is this is where we're going to get a problem post a hover.

151
00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:06.470
So I remember we changed our markup so that the Level two heading wraps the tag.

152
00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:12.760
So this is going to not work right here because I'm selecting a hover H2.

153
00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:13.630
So it should be.

154
00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:17.320
Blog post H2.

155
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:18.790
A hover.

156
00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:20.590
That should do it.

157
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:23.010
And we're going to say color.

158
00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.560
On that hovers two seven, eight six zero, let's see what it is.

159
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:35.340
Green, so I know that's green.

160
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:44.430
So we're going to add a variable dash dash colour dash green.

161
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:46.680
Save.

162
00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:48.840
OK.

163
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:50.220
I think that did it.

164
00:10:53.970 --> 00:11:03.480
Now we want to select the blog post, paragraph tags, and we want those font sizes to be 20 pixels.

165
00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:10.500
You know, you could do like one point one RAM or something like that, but we'll just do a hardcoded

166
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:11.070
number there.

167
00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.370
Let's just say one RAM actually will make it 18 pixels.

168
00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:21.920
Try and be consistent with your font sizes to font weight is going to be five hundred.

169
00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:27.510
Color, we'll say.

170
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:34.560
Eight, two, eight two eight two men have been a lighter, kind of lighter black or a darker gray line

171
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.570
height one point five.

172
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:39.320
Well, let's have a check.

173
00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:42.040
OK.

174
00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:43.990
Let's see how it looks compared to this.

175
00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:47.050
So it is a bit smaller there.

176
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.230
You know, I kind of want that to be bigger paragraphs, be bigger.

177
00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:53.320
Yeah, let's do it.

178
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:58.610
Let's say one point to him that works for me.

179
00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.300
OK, blog post.

180
00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:05.500
Now next is blog post.

181
00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:06.860
Read more link.

182
00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:07.970
So that's a read more link.

183
00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:13.370
We want that to be the color at five zero zero five seven.

184
00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:15.620
Now do we use that?

185
00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.000
Yes, so it's this.

186
00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:23.420
You know, I'm going to I'm going to go like this.

187
00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.780
We did color red here for the post postmaster.

188
00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:31.860
We're going to add a color variable called pink.

189
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:37.500
There it is, going to go down where we did color red for the post, Matt, I'm going to go color pink.

190
00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.640
We're going to do the same thing for this one for the Read More Link.

191
00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:45.510
Font size is going to be 1.2 RAM.

192
00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:48.950
Font weight five hundred.

193
00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:56.370
Display in line block margin top is 12 pixels.

194
00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:00.960
In transition, we want that to be over.

195
00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:03.530
Transition, Dir.

196
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:06.630
Here it is.

197
00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:08.520
OK.

198
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:10.230
It's looking pretty good.

199
00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:15.540
Now, when we hover over this link, I want a little kind of effect.

200
00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:17.600
It's going to be read more.

201
00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:22.250
A read more Hover.

202
00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.390
And then we're going to say color.

203
00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:32.100
Is two, seven eight six zero.

204
00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:34.050
Do we use that as a variable?

205
00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.200
Yes, that's green.

206
00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:36.270
Just to confirm.

207
00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:42.570
And padding left five pixels, just like a little effect.

208
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.360
It looks very nice.

209
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:50.340
And one little thing here are these links are blue, whereas this final one, they're black.

210
00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:52.720
So we're going to change that.

211
00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:53.640
They also look bigger.

212
00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:56.190
So let's fix that.

213
00:13:56.490 --> 00:14:03.420
That's a level two heading, so we're going to go in here and we're going to say blog post H to A..

214
00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:06.230
I'm going to say font size.

215
00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:13.110
I don't know to RAM just guessing here, maybe it's bigger and color is going to be black like a triple

216
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:13.380
one.

217
00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.930
OK, an easy, bigger maybe for him.

218
00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:21.580
Three RAM, that works for me.

219
00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:22.130
That's great.

220
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:25.270
We're going to keep this lesson real short because the last one was just jumbotron.

221
00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:28.300
Next lesson we're going to star this little thing up right here.

222
00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:28.840
OK?

223
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:29.350
Ta da.
