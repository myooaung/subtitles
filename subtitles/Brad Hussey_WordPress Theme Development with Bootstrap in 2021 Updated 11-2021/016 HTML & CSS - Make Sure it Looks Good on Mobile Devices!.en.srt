00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,130
Hey, everyone, welcome back in this video, we're just going to do a couple small things just to make

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,840
sure that we're looking good on mobile devices.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,750
Inevitably, there's always going to be something that's kind of out of whack or wonky with your mobile

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,150
device, depending on the device that you're using.

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,770
But smaller screen sizes, we're using bootstrapped, so it takes care of probably 80 or 90 percent

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,150
of the issues, but you're always going to have little things for her to resize this window.

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,440
You're going to see.

8
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,260
It's looking pretty good so far.

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:36,590
And I saw something here, so the margin looks not quite right on that paragraph tag will fix that.

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,620
This button doesn't look right.

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,370
Well, to fix that.

12
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,320
It's a lot of spacing white space here.

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,490
It's probably not necessary.

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,480
Um, this is an issue that's too tight.

15
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,190
We need those to break sooner.

16
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:54,840
This is look and find me, find me and maybe on phone font size could probably afford to be smaller.

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,960
And then the margin in between each of these text cards can be fixed.

18
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:04,710
So that's the widgets page for her to go to, maybe just like the blog index.

19
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,160
OK.

20
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,590
The spacing here is a little bit too much white space.

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,360
And I don't think we really have any other pages to to take care of.

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,280
OK, so let's head back to our code editor.

23
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:24,480
We're going to start in the widget that HTML and these columns the call small for are those text cards,

24
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,220
and this call Small four says that it's going to be a three column grid.

25
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,390
So four, eight, 12, so 12 divided by four is three.

26
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:39,780
So we have a three column grid and it's going to stay in the three column grid until the small break

27
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,200
point.

28
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,820
And then at the small break point, anything less than that, it will break and it will stack.

29
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,370
We want that to happen sooner.

30
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:54,840
So instead of m make it MD for medium break point on those three, save it and now we'll go back to

31
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,470
our widgets.

32
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,730
And try it, the medium break point will happen here.

33
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,190
Perfect.

34
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,060
Alex, good to me.

35
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:06,230
We need some margin in between these, so the trick for that is simple.

36
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:10,190
Go to our style desks and we need to find our text cards.

37
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,150
There we go.

38
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,390
We need to add some margin on the bottom, let's say 20 Pexels Alex Ghadami.

39
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,240
It doesn't affect here stocks.

40
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:22,900
That's looking good.

41
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:23,800
All right.

42
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:29,770
Now, another thing I want to fix is the paragraph tag inside of this subscriber.

43
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:36,170
Something's going on with that, so maybe what we need to do is add some padding in this.

44
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,280
Here we go.

45
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:38,990
You can even see it.

46
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:42,920
So the subscriber has uneven top and bottom padding.

47
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,000
So if we fix that, it should solve the problem.

48
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:54,480
Now, I think it's going to create a new problem with this, but let's let's get to there when we get

49
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,540
to, they're so subscribe dash bar padding some 30 pixels zero.

50
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,850
So that's going to make a 30 top and bottom.

51
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,650
Now you can see there's an issue here.

52
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,570
It's not vertically aligned.

53
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:14,770
Well, what we could probably do there to fix that is maybe use a little flexbox.

54
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:20,110
So what's cool about Flexbox is you can do these things like vertically and horizontally aligning things

55
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,280
and grouping things.

56
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:28,630
It's just a lot easier to align things using and lay things out with Flexbox in this sort of scenario

57
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,250
where in the past we would have had to use like line height or cheat with like position and things like

58
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:33,520
that.

59
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:39,280
What's neat is we just basically have to find the container that we want to be vertically centered.

60
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:39,520
So.

61
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,530
Not this.

62
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:48,360
Not this, we want this rather the row this row to be.

63
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,510
Vertically, like in the in the vertical center.

64
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,070
Of of the row, we want the content to be vertically centered.

65
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,500
So if we were to select a subscriber container row.

66
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,030
Then we should be able to vertically center it.

67
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,490
We can also create our own utility class instead of selecting subscriber container row.

68
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:19,210
So, for example, in our CSIS, instead of selecting Subscriber Container Row, we can create our own

69
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:20,110
utility class.

70
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,510
Now, before we do that, let's see if this will work.

71
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,910
So display flex and then align items.

72
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:32,980
This will, it says, defines how the browser distributes space between and around flex items on the

73
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,480
cross axes of their container.

74
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,850
So line items center.

75
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,260
Let's see if that worked.

76
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:46,250
OK, so it did work here and here, but the Subscribe button, not so much.

77
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:50,290
Let's see why it's a lot of each HTML markup nested here.

78
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:54,520
And then I found the button and the button looks like it has some bottom margin, which is preventing

79
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,470
it from falling down.

80
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,000
So if I were to remove that margin?

81
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,730
Then that would fix that issue.

82
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,750
So we just basically need to give no margin on that button.

83
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:11,200
So we'll go to the markup find with that button is.

84
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,800
It's right here.

85
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:18,570
Button, button invert, so we can do a number of things, we could select this button or we can give

86
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:27,000
it its own utility class, I believe Bootstrap has a margin utility class, so m dash zero.

87
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,570
I think might remove margin altogether.

88
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:38,010
And I believe I'm correct, it did em dash zero is margin zero important?

89
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,630
So that worked.

90
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:40,950
We did the trick there.

91
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,080
Now what I can do.

92
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:48,370
Is instead of doing subscriber contain a row, what if we just like created our own utility classic

93
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,100
something like.

94
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:59,770
Flex, and then let's call it a line center or like Flex Vertical Center.

95
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,000
This is just an example.

96
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:09,580
It might not be the best naming convention, but we could say like Display Flex, a line items center.

97
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:15,260
And then we just comment this one out and then add this class to what we want to have these styles.

98
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,330
See if it works.

99
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,620
So we want the subscriber.

100
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,110
We want the RO itself to have that.

101
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,200
Let's see if it even works.

102
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,220
Flex Vertical Center.

103
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:38,560
And refresh now you'll see our Flex Vertical Center utility class did the trick, but in all honesty,

104
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:45,490
when we fix the padding of the subscriber to be even and the removed the margin on this button, we

105
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:46,840
kind of solved some problems.

106
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,670
But let's see if it works here.

107
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,650
OK, so the margin bottom on the paragraph needs to be fixed.

108
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:01,130
And this subscribe, we probably could have this break sooner.

109
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,010
The form should break sooner the input in the button.

110
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,770
And we need a margin bottom on that paragraph tag.

111
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:13,410
OK, so let's go to our call mad8.

112
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,400
I'm going to say call.

113
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,130
LG aides.

114
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,850
Let's see if that's changed anything.

115
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,680
That break sooner kind of solves the subscribe button issue, kind of.

116
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,450
Maybe we change the padding 12 pixels in 44 pixels on the invert button.

117
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:40,800
Let's go to the button and make just like the padding more like 12 pixels all around.

118
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,110
That works better for me.

119
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:51,220
Now looks good, and then the paragraph here needs some spacing, so we can actually use the bootstrap

120
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,600
utility class on that paragraph tag.

121
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,500
We can say class margin.

122
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,860
Dash, be for bottom, not Dash.

123
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:09,230
It's M B Dash once for margin bottom one, and we added space there, but we don't necessarily want,

124
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,720
although it does work fine because.

125
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,300
We have Flexbox keeping it vertically centered regardless of the size.

126
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:28,040
And we have a little bit of space there, which I'm OK with, but maybe if we did, maybe Dash X s Dash

127
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,010
three, it will only give.

128
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,250
OK, that didn't actually do anything, I thought that that was an option, maybe not.

129
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,040
Maybe, maybe Dash three, that's better spacing.

130
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:41,920
Does it affect here?

131
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,780
The margin bottom here actually looks a little gnarly.

132
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:52,090
Let's go back to meet one spacing looks more appropriate to me.

133
00:08:53,970 --> 00:09:01,850
This is where you can use a media query, so go to the subscriber p and then add a media query here.

134
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:11,940
So media screen and max width, let's go five sixty eight pixels for that small break point and we're

135
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,180
going to say subscribe dash bar p.

136
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,780
Margin bottom 20 pixels.

137
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:23,520
And it doesn't seem to be showing up because it's probably being overridden by this and b one.

138
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:29,070
So remove that and b one class actually change it from five five six eight to like five seventy six.

139
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,320
And that'll be a break point where this breaks here.

140
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,150
There we go.

141
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,470
And that looks good.

142
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,860
Keeps the margin out of it there.

143
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,110
Add some margin there.

144
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,340
Perfect.
