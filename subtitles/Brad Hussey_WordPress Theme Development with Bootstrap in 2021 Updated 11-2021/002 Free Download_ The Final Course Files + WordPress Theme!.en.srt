00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,190
Hello everybody.

2
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:04,350
Welcome back to Boost Your Income
with Bootstrap to WordPress and

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,110
in this lecture we're going to be
downloading the final course files.

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:17,633
[MUSIC]

5
00:00:17,633 --> 00:00:18,180
All right.

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,160
So in this lecture I have provided

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,530
a link to download the Bootstrap
to WordPress final course files.

8
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:34,620
Once you've went ahead and downloaded that
asset, you will be delivered a zip file.

9
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:40,400
And that zip file, if you open it up and
unzip it it'll give you a folder and

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,570
that folder will look
a little something like this.

11
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:48,510
It should have four folders within it.

12
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,040
As time goes on,
I will likely add more folders, so

13
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:57,980
this lecture might be slightly out of
date in the future, but not so much.

14
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,885
We'll just have, I'll make sure to update
the course files so you can go back and

15
00:01:01,885 --> 00:01:05,830
redownload them if there
are any new assets or

16
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,830
folders that you would need to or
would like to download.

17
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:13,260
So at the time of this recording,
we have A, B, C, and D.

18
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,890
A is Download Bootstrap and
I provided Bootstrap 3.2.0.

19
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:22,789
B is Download WordPress and
I have provided WordPress 4.0.

20
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:27,745
So a little note on that, once we get
into the development of WordPress,

21
00:01:27,745 --> 00:01:31,900
you have to download WordPress
in order to work with it.

22
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,190
So at the time of this recording.

23
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,409
We will be using WordPress 4.0.

24
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:44,580
I suggest using WordPress 4.0 only for
the duration of this course.

25
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,550
Then what you're gonna want
to do is update WordPress.

26
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,200
If you have newer version of WordPress,

27
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,269
because it is always important
to update WordPress.

28
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,470
Then check to see if
everything still works.

29
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:02,740
Sometimes when WordPress makes updates,
a few bugs will appear.

30
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:09,420
And while I'll do my best to be on top of
those major changes and let you know if

31
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:17,250
there's anything you need to do in order
to make sure your website is up to date.

32
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,650
And when I say website I mean
the website we're gonna be building.

33
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,590
It will also be your challenge to see if
you could squash those bugs yourself.

34
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,450
See we have final static website.

35
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:35,010
There's a folder in here called B2W-
Static and that is the static website.

36
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:38,850
That static website has all
of the HTML templates and

37
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:44,770
assets that we'll be using to start
our Bootstrap static website.

38
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:49,300
So we have our index we have post,
resources, blog, and contact.

39
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:56,490
And then in our assets folder,
we have CSS, fonts, Img for image, and js.

40
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,760
You might recognize that the js, fonts and

41
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,920
CSS folders are basically the Bootstrap
files that we downloaded.

42
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,310
There are a few modifications in here.

43
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:12,820
We have a custom CSS file which is not
included in the bootstrap download.

44
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,680
We have a folder called Font Awesome
with a couple folders within there.

45
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,270
And that is for the custom icon font
we'll be using for this course.

46
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,684
Pretty cool.
We'll get into that a little later.

47
00:03:25,684 --> 00:03:29,584
The images, we have all of the image
assets that we will be using for

48
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:30,430
the website.

49
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:37,472
And I recommend just grabbing those
because I don't have a PSD file with these

50
00:03:37,472 --> 00:03:38,608
assets for you and

51
00:03:38,608 --> 00:03:43,900
we are just going to be focusing on
the development not the design aspect.

52
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,890
So go ahead and

53
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:50,230
take these you'll find them in
the Images folder, look in the assets.

54
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,940
And we'll get to that
once we start coding, js.

55
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,550
We have a main.js,
that's also new and jQuery.

56
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,390
We'll get into that a little bit later.

57
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,790
Don't worry about it right now.

58
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,280
Just trying to show you
what's in our course files.

59
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,460
So recap, A, B, C and D.

60
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,357
A is Bootstrap the version we're using for
this course.

61
00:04:07,357 --> 00:04:11,410
B is WordPress again the version for
this course.

62
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,870
C final static website.

63
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,390
That's all the final assets.

64
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,840
And then D miscellaneous.

65
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,720
So right now there's
only one file in here,

66
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,660
the Bootstrap to WordPress information
architecture or wire frames and site map.

67
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:31,140
You can see here, so go ahead and
just check that out if you're interested,

68
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,840
just to see how to do a wire frame.

69
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,660
This folder will likely be
updated as time goes on.

70
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,560
So at the time of the recording,
there's only one file,

71
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,640
but maybe when you download it,
there may be six files.

72
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,400
All right.
So that is the course files.

73
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,500
So go ahead and download those and
we can get started.

74
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,840
Because in the next lecture we're going
to be setting up our project environment.

75
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,070
So making sure we get
everything sorted out so

76
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:00,480
once we start development hopefully
we worked out the initial kinds.

77
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,291
Okay, so you there.

78
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:04,759
