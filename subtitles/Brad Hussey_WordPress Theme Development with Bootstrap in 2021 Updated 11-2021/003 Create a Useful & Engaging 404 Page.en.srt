00:00:00,749 --> 00:00:03,252
[NOISE]

2
00:00:03,252 --> 00:00:08,760
Where is it?

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,327
I can't find it.

4
00:00:10,327 --> 00:00:13,520
404, lecture not found.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,762
Bad joke.

6
00:00:14,762 --> 00:00:22,952
[MUSIC]

7
00:00:22,952 --> 00:00:25,390
So, what is a useful, and engaging 404?

8
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,860
Well, for those of you that don't know,

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,870
a 404 is an error that the server throws
at you, at the browser when you come

10
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:37,360
across a page that is no longer there,
or was never there in the first place.

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,980
So, a lot of the time when you build
a site, you kind of overlook this part.

12
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,680
Or you don't even add this part at all.

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,770
But in WordPress you can easily overlook
it, and you get a page like this.

14
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,065
Now maybe, it would look a little bit
better, and it would be in a container.

15
00:00:50,065 --> 00:00:56,550
Like oops, that page can't be found,
search for something, is kind of useless.

16
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,380
You're probably gonna
lose your visitor anyway.

17
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:03,200
So, what can we do to make this
a little bit more useful, and engaging?

18
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,120
So that,
when a visitor comes across a 404,

19
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,790
which they will at some point,
or some visitor will.

20
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,390
How can you engage them into your site,
and have the keep going, and

21
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:17,560
maybe give them some value,
to keep them sticking around.

22
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,580
Well, that's what we're
gonna do right now.

23
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,825
And it's really simple.

24
00:01:21,825 --> 00:01:25,830
And we're just recycling parts of
the site, to add into our 404.

25
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,400
In your Code Editor,

26
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,690
open up the 404.php that's built
right in to the WordPress site here.

27
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,470
And then you're gonna get just
a template for displaying 404 pages, and

28
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,200
that's what you already just saw.

29
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,130
But we're gonna make it a lot better.

30
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:46,240
What we're gonna do is we're gonna start
by adding a feature-image at the very top.

31
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,885
So, if you open your,
let's say, Resources page,

32
00:01:49,885 --> 00:01:55,360
we're just gonna copy just the
feature-image content here, the section.

33
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,140
Don't get the php, or anything,
just the feature-image part.

34
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,394
And right here,
what we're gonna do is at the very top,

35
00:02:01,394 --> 00:02:05,030
under get_header,
we're going to paste that in there.

36
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:09,570
Now, remove the style, and
all that sort of stuff here.

37
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:16,260
What we should have done is actually
just copied the fallback feature-mage,

38
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,415
but we can just add those classes here.

39
00:02:18,415 --> 00:02:23,190
Feature-image-default-alt.

40
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,890
Okay.

41
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,280
And then regarding the title,

42
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,390
what we're gonna do here,
we're just gonna type in some text.

43
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,447
And that's just gonna be, Bummer!

44
00:02:33,447 --> 00:02:36,588
That page can't be found!

45
00:02:39,014 --> 00:02:39,570
There we go.

46
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:43,890
And now, what we're gonna do is we're
gonna clean this stuff up, right here.

47
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,910
So, let's just remove all of these.

48
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:50,120
Remove everything all the way down until
get footer, and leave get_footer there.

49
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,640
So, this is all we have for
our 404 right now.

50
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,824
We're gonna start off by adding
a div the class of container.

51
00:02:58,824 --> 00:02:59,764
Make sure to close that.

52
00:03:02,423 --> 00:03:07,954
And then in there, we're gonna
add a div with the id of primary,

53
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:10,030
and a class of row.

54
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:16,470
Within primary we're gonna add a main tag,
the id of content.

55
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,814
And then class, here we go.

56
00:03:20,814 --> 00:03:24,616
And then in there,
we're gonna have another div, and

57
00:03:24,616 --> 00:03:29,672
that's gonna be div with the class
of error-404, and not-found.

58
00:03:34,455 --> 00:03:36,011
So, a lot of markup here.

59
00:03:37,678 --> 00:03:41,926
And then another div in here,
we got a lot of markup, guys.

60
00:03:41,926 --> 00:03:47,510
Div class of page-content.

61
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:53,700
Now, we're going to inside
page-content at a level two heading,

62
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,680
and that's gonna say, Don't fret!

63
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,830
Let's get you back on track.

64
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:04,540
And then what we're gonna do,
is we're gonna have a series of content

65
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,980
that's just all from over our site, and
we're gonna give it to them right there.

66
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,975
So that, they can take action on it,
and give them some value right away.

67
00:04:11,975 --> 00:04:16,500
So we're gonna have Some resources here.

68
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,275
We're gonna spit out our RESOURCES.

69
00:04:18,275 --> 00:04:21,690
And so right here,
I'm gonna have a level three heading, and

70
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,890
say Resources, paragraph tag and
this will just say,

71
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:31,870
Perhaps you were looking for
a specific resource?

72
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:36,720
And now, instead of just hard coding some
resources, we can actually loop through,

73
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,100
and get the actual resources.

74
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,710
All the resources that we actually
have stored in our database.

75
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:50,101
So go to your page.resources.php, and
down where you have your resource-row.

76
00:04:50,101 --> 00:04:56,781
[SOUND] Go ahead, and copy resource-row,
right down to where resource-row ends.

77
00:04:56,781 --> 00:04:58,610
Copy everything inside of it.

78
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,271
This is what's great about this.

79
00:05:00,271 --> 00:05:04,173
All you got to do now really,
is just paste that, and

80
00:05:04,173 --> 00:05:07,294
we're going to simplify it just a touch.

81
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:10,760
There we go.

82
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:15,930
They're gonna tap that in, so we're gonna
leave that as is except for right here.

83
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:19,080
We're gonna have the excerpt instead of
the content because the content is quite

84
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,930
large, and

85
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,980
the excerpt will give us a smaller,
more condensed version of the content.

86
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:28,160
Let's make sure we have the rest of our
markup before we go, and view that.

87
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,770
I wanna make sure,
you see something good here.

88
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,846
After main,
I want you to add your sidebar.

89
00:05:35,846 --> 00:05:38,050
And we're gonna have an html.comment here.

90
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:44,365
I'm gonna say SIDEBAR, and then I'm
gonna have my aside tag with a class of

91
00:05:44,365 --> 00:05:48,760
col-sm-4, and then in here,
php get_sidebar.

92
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,490
This would be a great time
to use a custom sidebar,

93
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,530
if you wanted to use dynamic sidebar.

94
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:58,070
And create a custom sidebar, and
register it in your functions.php, and

95
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:02,540
then go to your appearance widgets,
add some widgets to that sidebar, and

96
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,910
then it will show up on your 404 page.

97
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,770
Perfect time to use that.

98
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:06,970
I'm just gonna use get_sidebar for

99
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:10,570
now, but you're always free
to customize as you wish.

100
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,130
Let's save this, and check it out so far.

101
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,600
Bummer!
That page can't be found.

102
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,800
Don't fret!
Let's get back on track.

103
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,370
Resources.

104
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,210
Perhaps you were looking for
a specific resource?

105
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,500
So, we don't really see anything.

106
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,220
Something broke.

107
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:26,230
Let's go back, and see why that is.

108
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,120
Well, I know exactly why.

109
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:34,700
We didn't actually initiate, and
we'll re-initiate the WordPress query.

110
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,008
We need to actually have that in there.

111
00:06:36,008 --> 00:06:40,518
[SOUND] So,
[SOUND] we should have copied this

112
00:06:40,518 --> 00:06:44,787
PHP line here in your page-resources.

113
00:06:44,787 --> 00:06:49,930
You're storing WordPress query in
the loop variable, just right here.

114
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,620
Well, let's put it above
your resource-row.

115
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,390
Save that, now we're good to go.

116
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,135
Here we go.
So we've got our sidebar, good.

117
00:06:58,135 --> 00:07:03,000
We got our resources,
they show up in their specific order.

118
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,690
We've got the excerpt,
continue reading, or

119
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:08,350
you can get started with that
resource right away, great.

120
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:14,820
Now, why don't we add some categories,
so let's add, let's say CATEGORIES.

121
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,430
Right here you're gonna add a level
three heading, and say Categories,

122
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:26,030
paragraph tag, with some text say,
or maybe a popular category?

123
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,070
Great!

124
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:31,142
And right here we're going
to add some markup for

125
00:07:31,142 --> 00:07:34,620
a widget, cuz we want that style.

126
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:40,350
So class, widget and
then widget_categories.

127
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:45,380
And then in here we're gonna
have a level four heading, and

128
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:51,550
that's gonna say, class widget-title.

129
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:55,490
This will be, Most Used Categories.

130
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,090
And under here, we'll have a level,
an ordered list.

131
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:03,226
And then we're gonna be using
WordPress function called,

132
00:08:03,226 --> 00:08:06,590
or wp- or _ list_ Categories.

133
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,740
And then there are some arguments,
you can put in here.

134
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,610
We're gonna start out, with an array.

135
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:15,950
Make sure they're both closed.

136
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:19,710
And then in here, there are some
key value pairs that you can add.

137
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:26,231
So there, first you can add, orderby,
and then that will be count.

138
00:08:26,231 --> 00:08:29,329
And then order,

139
00:08:29,329 --> 00:08:34,868
descending, show_count.

140
00:08:38,749 --> 00:08:40,688
This will just be 1, the integer.

141
00:08:42,901 --> 00:08:49,298
Title_li, no title_li.

142
00:08:49,298 --> 00:08:53,315
And number 10.

143
00:08:53,315 --> 00:08:57,114
And so, where I snagged all this from,
is I just went to the WordPress codecs,

144
00:08:57,114 --> 00:08:59,303
searched up WordPress list categories, and

145
00:08:59,303 --> 00:09:03,600
it gave me all the arguments that
you could put within this function.

146
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,950
And then you can just play around with it.

147
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:08,290
So, WordPress list category is
basically lists out the categories

148
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,530
that you have on your blog.

149
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:10,570
So, here's an example.

150
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,500
And there we go.

151
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,150
Or maybe a Popular Category,
or Most used categories.

152
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,690
And you can see them right here.

153
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,540
Awesome.

154
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,150
Now, why don't we move on
to one more section here.

155
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:24,210
Add just a little bit
more value to the 404.

156
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:28,300
And let's do some ARCHIVES.

157
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:33,766
So, the old Archives, level three heading,

158
00:09:33,766 --> 00:09:37,140
Archives, paragraph tag.

159
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:44,480
And this will say,
You can always sort through our archives.

160
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,520
And then if you wanna snag
a specific widget, so

161
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,710
I wanna get the archives widget.

162
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,270
And right here,
you could use a built-in PHP, or

163
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:59,230
a WordPress function called the_widget.

164
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:03,930
And just to show you here how this works,
in the codex,

165
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,680
this is the template tag that displays
an arbitrary widget outside of a sidebar.

166
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,350
It can be used anywhere within templates.

167
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:16,600
So, the usage is the widget, and then
there are three parameters you can add.

168
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,760
And so for example, for

169
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,790
widget you can choose the widget
by grabbing the PHP class name.

170
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,080
For any of these widgets that
are built into WordPress.

171
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,740
So Archives, Calendar,
Category, so on, and so forth.

172
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,680
I wanna grab WordPress-Widget-Archives.

173
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,950
And then there are other things down here,
so instance, and arguments.

174
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:40,490
So, if you wanted to customize a little
bit, what displays before the widget,

175
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,860
after the widget, so on, and so forth.

176
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:50,300
So then in here, I just, in a string,
paste the php class name for the widget.

177
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,720
Let's hit save, and check that out.

178
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,370
And here it is,
got our Archives widget right here.

179
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:59,660
So if you wanna change the title here,
you could just,

180
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:07,380
in the parameters of this function,
you can add using title.

181
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,130
Change the title.

182
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:13,100
So let's say, I wanted to say,
Our Archives.

183
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:13,720
Then, there you go.

184
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,850
So, you can change it around like that.

185
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,860
And if you wanted to update what
displays before the widget,

186
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,530
like right here, or after the widget,
or before the title,

187
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:25,480
so currently the default is a level two
heading, but I don't really like that.

188
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,826
So, I wanna change that
to level four heading, so

189
00:11:28,826 --> 00:11:31,068
it matches the rest of the style.

190
00:11:31,068 --> 00:11:33,366
So I do that like so.

191
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:39,791
Before_title, and

192
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:45,146
this would be level four heading,

193
00:11:45,146 --> 00:11:49,946
the class of widget title, and

194
00:11:49,946 --> 00:11:54,746
after title, close that H4,

195
00:11:54,746 --> 00:11:58,640
close the bracket here.

196
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,810
Perfect.
Now save that, we should be good to go.

197
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:02,452
Archives.

198
00:12:02,452 --> 00:12:03,380
Our Archives.

199
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,950
Perfect, and that is the 404.

200
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,528
And here is a useful, and engaging 404.

201
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:11,360
So, oopps, came to the wrong page!

202
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,680
Bummer!
That page can't be found!

203
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,840
Little bit of humor.

204
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,490
Scroll down.

205
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:15,010
Don't fret.

206
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:15,900
Let's get you back on track.

207
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,130
Hey, so now,
maybe I was looking for a resource.

208
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,660
Or hey, this looks cool,
maybe I'll check out justhost.

209
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,300
Or I kind of wanna check
out some coding tutorials.

210
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,670
Or whatever, so on, and so forth.

211
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:27,970
We can add one more thing here,
just to finish it off.

212
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:33,540
Let's just add a paragraph tag,
and say, or

213
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,830
just head back to the home page.

214
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,012
And then let's give them
a link to make that easy.

215
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:47,803
And normally, you could just put a forward
slash to get you back to the root.

216
00:12:47,803 --> 00:12:55,281
But in WordPress,
if you wanna reference the home URL,

217
00:12:55,281 --> 00:13:01,497
php echo esc_url, and in here, home_url.

218
00:13:05,027 --> 00:13:08,625
And then in the string, forward slash.

219
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:09,774
Close out that with semicolon.

220
00:13:09,774 --> 00:13:10,570
Good to go.

221
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,290
Save that.

222
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,490
And then your 404 page should be perfect.

223
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,670
There you go.
Takes you back to the homepage.

224
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,140
Everybody's happy.

225
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,880
That was the useful,
and engaging 404 page.

226
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:26,310
And in the next section, or module,
we're gonna be learning how to launch our

227
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:31,350
final WordPress site,
live on an actual domain on the Internet.

228
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,640
So, you could share with family,
friends, clients.

229
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,630
If you're working on a client site,
you can get it live on their site.

230
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:41,148
This is a very useful skill to know,
because it's not as easy as click, and

231
00:13:41,148 --> 00:13:42,884
drag, uploading your FTP.

232
00:13:42,884 --> 00:13:46,658
There's a little bit of a skill,
and process involved.

233
00:13:46,658 --> 00:13:47,698
So, let me take you through that.

234
00:13:47,698 --> 00:13:50,577
