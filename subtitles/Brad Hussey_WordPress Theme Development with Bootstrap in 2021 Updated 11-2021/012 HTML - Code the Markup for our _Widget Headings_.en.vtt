00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.200
Hey, friend, welcome back.

2
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:07.950
So now we're going to do is move on to styling these widgets here you'll see them that these are all

3
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.080
the different elements or widgets that we want to be able to add via Alimentare.

4
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.150
Once we get there, we want to be able to add these.

5
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.740
So if we go down to our widgets, but you have to WordPress, we've got buttons, titles, links, info,

6
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.650
cards, calls to actions and testimonials, and we want to be able to have those styles appear when

7
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.550
we add them.

8
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.840
And these are our custom widgets, so we got to style those that markup.

9
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.800
We're going to tell the markup for those and we have a little page here just called widgets on HTML

10
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.680
and the final HTML code, and we're going to start those up.

11
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.510
Adam in here so that we can use them once we convert over to elementary.

12
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.430
And just as another reference here, like you might wonder, like, well, what about the contact page

13
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.690
or about this join page?

14
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.490
These are just shell pages.

15
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.210
We're going to create these HTML files, but we're going to be doing this within Gutenberg.

16
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.180
The copy and the text and the layout is all the same.

17
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.680
And just in Gutenberg, we want to be able to just add our content and it'll show up in our default

18
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.490
page templates.

19
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.970
But for now, let's get into these widgets.

20
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.630
We might need to separate this into a few videos.

21
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.180
So it's not to too long, but we'll see as we go.

22
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.270
So in your code editor, we're going to create a new file called widgets that each HTML.

23
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.670
And here it is in our B2 W2 student widgets that each HTML.

24
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.180
And the same goes here, my friend, with all of the markup in the the the code.

25
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.550
Rather, you need to copy all the kind of initial code here.

26
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.490
So let's get that skeleton put in place.

27
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.690
We're going to do grab the heading tag, all that sort of stuff.

28
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.740
We're going to go down and we're going to copy the footer as well and paste that in there.

29
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.910
Well, I just noticed something.

30
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.820
Actually, you know what we need out of body tag, of course, but see how there's a closing body take

31
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.940
care and one down here.

32
00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.950
That's a big problem.

33
00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.520
So I need to get rid of this body tag and that's where it closes there.

34
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.730
But I realize that we actually did it in our single that HTML.

35
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.750
I think we have two body tags, so we've got to get rid of the look there in there.

36
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:08.410
That's a problem.

37
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.500
So get rid of this other one before the footer tag, and that is the proper closing body tag right there.

38
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.320
So just a little update on the last video.

39
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.150
Let's go back to our we just study HTML.

40
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.730
So body tag opening, closing there.

41
00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.870
All right.

42
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:30.940
Now what we need to do is we need to grab all of the top navigation stuff and the hero heterosexual

43
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.960
mobile menu, title banner and subscriber copy that that entire bit of code pasted in your widget that

44
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:38.620
age HTML.

45
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:47.440
And then finally, what we should do is a couple of things we need to also copy the content area container

46
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.540
div row.

47
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.580
We're not going to copy the columns.

48
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.860
Because really, this is just for styling, this is not a template, the widgets like page, we're not

49
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.070
going to use this as an actual page.

50
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.220
It's just a way for us to see what we're going to style.

51
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.370
So we need to close that row row div.

52
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.320
We need to close that container div and we need to close that content area div.

53
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.340
We're going to clean that up.

54
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.160
There we go.

55
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:25.080
And what we're going to do is inside of row have a div the class of called smashed 12 and then in there

56
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.410
we want a dev of the class of title dash wrapper.

57
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.360
And inside title rapper, we want a paragraph, the class of sub Dash title.

58
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.880
This is a subtitle or eyebrow.

59
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.740
And then we want a level two heading.

60
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.100
Title here.

61
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.990
Right now, let's just save that and see what we can see.

62
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.060
Make sure you're buying widgets that age HTML.

63
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.780
Here we go.

64
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.430
So we've got our shell.

65
00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.840
And we got this is the subtitle Her Eyebrow and a title here, so this is where we would start styling.

66
00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.110
So we'll get started.

67
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.370
We do need to style this up.

68
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.470
The title rapper.

69
00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.400
So let's go to our style.

70
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.820
Let's see us.

71
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.440
And we're going to add a section here, maybe somewhere near the bottom.

72
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:21.700
And we're just going to have like a new comment, and we're going to call this element or widgets styles.

73
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.710
And let's start with the title dash wrapper and then subtitle.

74
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.660
Actually, it's sub Dash title.

75
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.380
And then let's say the font size.

76
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.020
We're going to say 0.8 REM font weight.

77
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:41.620
Let's go 700 and the color we want to be our VAR Dash or VAR.

78
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.370
Color pink, I believe we'll save that.

79
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.710
There we go.

80
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.330
It's not quite right.

81
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.520
It's a little bit too small, it's a better final version.

82
00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.820
You can see it is a little bit different, so let's go back to our code.

83
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:06.610
Go font size, zero point nine RAM and we'll need to say text, transform uppercase.

84
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.260
Let's check it out now.

85
00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.220
That's a little bit better, but not quite quite what we're going for.

86
00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.130
Probably going to want to add some letter spacing, and let's just say like you can do a number of ways,

87
00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.340
you can do any unit of measurement that you want, like you do a pixel.

88
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.430
You can do Ramsey.

89
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.890
You do point eight RAM.

90
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:28.970
That's going to be really big.

91
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.020
Let's do one pixel.

92
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:31.380
There you go.

93
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.000
You can see that.

94
00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.610
So instead of one pixel, let's do like 0.9.

95
00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.300
And it's very big.

96
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.670
Zero point zero two.

97
00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.470
And let's go a little bit bigger.

98
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:43.400
Zero point zero five.

99
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.210
And 0.04.

100
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:48.130
Looks decent to me.

101
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.270
And maybe 0.95 Haram.

102
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.000
Perfect.

103
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.710
And the title, it looks pretty good to me, but let's just make sure that we got what we need.

104
00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.880
I'm happy with that.

105
00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.550
You know, I could make the level two heading a little bit larger.

106
00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:08.730
So what if we went up to our global typography here instead of 2.5 or, say, 2.7 REM for the level

107
00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:09.180
two heading?

108
00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.380
And then we refresh now our level two headings are bigger, maybe even bigger.

109
00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.010
2.8.

110
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.350
I'm happy with that size.

111
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.850
I just kind of think that maybe I change our mind here on the subtitle.

112
00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:25.920
I don't want to text, transform uppercase and force it to be uppercase because I actually think that

113
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:31.530
we should have the option to not like if we want to make it uppercase, we could just type all caps

114
00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.810
because this, you know, is an eyebrow convention here, eyebrow and header and kind of like this better.

115
00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.180
And in fact, I like this style better than this one.

116
00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.960
So maybe what?

117
00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:40.920
We're going to do it well.

118
00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.300
We'll copy this style.

119
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.300
We'll just make sure that it's matching so subtitle.

120
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.130
Font size 1.2, font 500.

121
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:55.730
OK, so let's actually change that, so font weighs me 500 font size is going to be 1.2 RAM.

122
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:57.620
No letter spacing at all.

123
00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.370
Let's see what happens that that looks much better to me, actually.

124
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.990
And I want the ad to be a little bit tighter.

125
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.190
I don't want any margin on the subtitle.

126
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.430
So let's find I think I have a global subtitle style.

127
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:13.070
Let's do like a global subtitle style here.

128
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.690
Let's see if we can change that subtitle.

129
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.380
Margin zero.

130
00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.270
Let's see what that does.

131
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:24.230
All right, so every subtitle on the site, this one, this one and this one got rid of the margin and

132
00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.760
actually like that spacing much better, it's much tighter, not too tight, but it looks much better.

133
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:30.450
OK, that style.

134
00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:31.400
That's it for that style.

135
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.210
These so we'll get to these right now back in the code editor.
