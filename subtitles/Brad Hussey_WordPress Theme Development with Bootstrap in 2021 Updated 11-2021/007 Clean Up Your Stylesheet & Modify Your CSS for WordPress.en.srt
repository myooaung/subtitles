00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,040
Hey, everyone, welcome back to boost your income and bootstrapped WordPress, and this lecture is

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:05,490
called.

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:07,820
Let's call.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,680
Clean up your stylesheet and modify your access for WordPress.

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:28,040
OK, so one quick thing that we need to do first before we get into cleaning up the stylesheet is a

6
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:36,010
fix the brand down here, the Navar brand, the we're still referencing the wrong image file.

7
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:39,040
And it's been bugging me when I was just getting started on this.

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,870
The electricity, we sell a broken image up here.

9
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,120
Not cool with me, not cool with you.

10
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,190
Let's fix this super easy.

11
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,740
All you got to do is.

12
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,360
And then do the good ol.

13
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,490
Blog info.

14
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,000
And reference the stylesheet.

15
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:09,360
Underscore directory and then slash and then that should get you the correct.

16
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,000
File, let's see if it's there.

17
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,060
Cool, it is there it's kind of hidden under the dashboard, the toolbar up here, but that's what's

18
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,070
part of this lectures about we're going to clean up the CSFs.

19
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,360
So this starts to look a bit better.

20
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:28,510
Part of it will be making sure that we can see our header and not have our toolbar covering our good

21
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,000
stuff.

22
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:29,400
All right.

23
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:35,710
In your code, editor, open up that good old style dot access file.

24
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,920
Now, let me tell you a few things about all this fancy stuff up here.

25
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:48,400
When you create a new theme, this first comment up here in your stylesheet the style access file is

26
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:48,990
very important.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,500
It tells WordPress a lot of important information, like the theme name, the theme, you or I, the

28
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,060
author, author, you are description, version, number, license, bla bla bla bla bla bla bla.

29
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:06,240
Where you would see this in your dashboard, check it out, dashboard head over to appearance and then

30
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,390
themes this year that these guys have information here.

31
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:15,450
So let's click on theme details, bootstrap to WordPress version 1.0, and then I'm not sure what that's

32
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:15,620
from.

33
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,020
I'm pretty sure when you downloaded the underscores theme, a tag that on.

34
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,640
So let's just go version one point.

35
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,320
Oh, boom, that'll be good.

36
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:29,980
The name good to go author, you can change that to you if you wish and save that.

37
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,910
You'll see that now version one point oh.

38
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:39,180
Now, you're probably wondering, hey, why do I just have a just like a default, kind of transparent,

39
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,560
immature, I want a cool image.

40
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,150
Well, you can do that.

41
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,640
And I actually have an image already.

42
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:52,710
I will make sure that it is in your miscellaneous folder, in the course files miscellaneous, I'll

43
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,120
make sure that you have the proper screenshot.

44
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:55,700
Boom.

45
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:56,280
There you go.

46
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:56,960
Screenshots.

47
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:02,780
And this is what we're going to be using as the theme screenshot kind of image.

48
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,620
So that's in your miscellaneous folder.

49
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:11,160
And then all you need to do is replace the screenshots right here.

50
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,690
This is your transparent picture.

51
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:20,400
Just replace screenshot in the root directory of the theme with your screenshot right there.

52
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,530
Now, watch this and replace that.

53
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,030
And if I refresh, we're going have a nice image here.

54
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:30,490
Boom, there it is, bootstrapped to WordPress by Brad Hussie, customer first team using Bouchet version

55
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,330
one point.

56
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,140
Oh Wicken there it is.

57
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,920
OK, that looks good.

58
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,560
OK, so let's get back to what Stylesheet.

59
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,450
Got a little excited there.

60
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:51,220
Now there is a lot of success that is included in this default style sheet that I don't want because

61
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,590
it's, it's excessive.

62
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,820
There's a reset, lots of typographical things, elements, forms, navigation, some of it's important

63
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:05,560
like accessibility and certain elements like infinite scroll media captions and galleries, all that

64
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,000
you can remove if you really want.

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,050
But I am going to remove what we don't need.

66
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,070
So what we don't need is this entire reset section.

67
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,180
So get rid of that.

68
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:22,840
We don't need reset because bootstrap already comes with a bunch of reset stuff.

69
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:30,310
The normalized, I believe so give it a reset, in fact, get rid of typography as well.

70
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:35,950
Just kind of redundant, because we already have this stuff figured out in our static site or static

71
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:41,940
site looks great and this is just overwriting all of our hard work and we don't need that.

72
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,830
So elements we don't need this.

73
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,840
Get rid of this two forms.

74
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,370
We don't need that either.

75
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:58,680
And boom, got rid of that navigation, five point one links, we don't need that and we don't need

76
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,240
that menus.

77
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,340
Let's get rid of almost everything.

78
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,850
Get rid of everything all the way down to.

79
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,420
The small menu right here.

80
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,830
And then.

81
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:20,600
We're going to keep sight, main content, navigation, stuff like this, because these are WordPress

82
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:26,870
specific styles and they may come up in our templates as we build our site and as it grows over time.

83
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,960
This isn't specifically overwriting like typography or reset elements or forms.

84
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,150
This is more specifically WordPress style.

85
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,680
So you could see like common navigation, paging navigation.

86
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:42,530
We want kind of we want that to be we want to leave that there for now.

87
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:48,020
Accessibility, important, keep that certain things here are important to keep.

88
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,480
So don't bother removing that alignments.

89
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,800
Keep that as well, because the line left, right and center, this is actually when you code or type

90
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:02,000
something in your WordPress text editor and you just you take a text or like an image and align it left,

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,900
center or right.

92
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:10,070
It tags a class on that element and that class or those classes are these classes and that will help

93
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,060
align those things.

94
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,160
So keep that clearing's.

95
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:14,830
Keep that as well.

96
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,510
Because certain things will keep the country content, content, content, things like that, not necessarily

97
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:24,350
remove that widgets as well, keep that content.

98
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:29,010
Keep this, because these are all WordPress specific styles.

99
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:35,210
Again, we probably won't use most of this stuff, but, you know, as time goes on and we realize,

100
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,640
hey, we're not using the stuff, you can go, go, go ahead and trim that out.

101
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,600
Same with asides and comments.

102
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:48,050
Infinite scroll media keep captions or good galleries.

103
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:48,910
Keep that as well.

104
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:56,810
This is the when you add a specific or a gallery within your content in the text editor in WordPress,

105
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:03,620
it adds these styles so that the items, the gallery items are in a grid like format.

106
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:09,470
And then last but not least, we have our theme specific styles, good SÃ¨vres that we basically cleaned

107
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,070
a lot of it up.

108
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,890
And let's just have a little look to see.

109
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,890
So far, so not really much has happened.

110
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:22,340
A few margin fixes and not much else because we haven't really run into it.

111
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,110
But we solved this little issue up here.

112
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,780
I want to fix that because it's bugging me.

113
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,940
I want to be able to see what is happening up there.

114
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:32,090
Pretty simple right here in your stylesheet.

115
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,760
Let's just add a little something here.

116
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,330
Uh, logged in.

117
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:44,060
Is the class that's actually a class that WordPress adds, you know, you have that WordPress, Dasch

118
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:44,910
head function.

119
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,980
Well, right here in your site, WordPress.

120
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:56,540
Adds a bunch of classes to the body right here home, so we know it's the home page.

121
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:01,760
It's currently the blog page as well, logged in and Midvale, no customer support.

122
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,480
So they add some styles or classes and we can target those.

123
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,510
So logged in Novar fixed top.

124
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,510
We want that to be.

125
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:17,200
Top thirty two, because it is position relative, we can go top 30 to.

126
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:23,620
That no fixed will move down 32 pixels, which is the height of this admin toolbar.

127
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,300
There we go.

128
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:28,210
Now we have our header with our dynamic navigation items.

129
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,050
So this is exciting.

130
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,560
OK, let's keep going.

131
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,730
Let's clean up some more stuff.

132
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:38,940
In our general here, um, let's fix the background, because this this is not going to work.

133
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,550
This is not referencing the right assets.

134
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,930
And you can't do this in WordPress.

135
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,820
You need to actually be more specific.

136
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:52,560
So we can basically do this every time that we find an image, uh, you URL image reference.

137
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,930
But there's probably a handful of these in our success.

138
00:08:54,930 --> 00:09:00,030
So why don't we just do a global search and replace if you're not using coded to most code, do this.

139
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:00,600
If not.

140
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:07,950
Again, a really good reason why Sugar-coated to it saves you so much time otherwise are going to have

141
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,170
to go in manually and do this.

142
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,850
So not cool time waster.

143
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:12,930
All right.

144
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:20,010
So we want to select your URL string, dot, dot, slash image.

145
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,340
And then we want to replace that with.

146
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,990
It looks like this, your URL waps, you are el.

147
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:43,000
String forward slash content, dash content slash themes, bootstrap to WordPress, slash assets.

148
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:49,230
Image and make sure you don't put the trailing slash at the end, if you didn't overhear otherwise,

149
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:55,290
you're going to be adding a double Trilling's and you're going to break your references, your paths.

150
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,070
OK, so you got Web content themes bootstrapped to WordPress, assets, image, what that is doing is

151
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:09,470
jumping from the root of the whole WordPress site B to W WordPress content themes, bootstrap to WordPress

152
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,670
jumping in the assets were jumping in images and were snagging those images.

153
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,840
Awesome, cool.

154
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,090
Replace all boom.

155
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,950
Nine instances were fixed.

156
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,800
So now all of our background images will be they'll be referenced properly.

157
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,590
Why don't we say that and just have a little chat?

158
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,970
Because I know the background should now have a texture.

159
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,280
Great, I can see it here.

160
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,720
I don't know if you'll see it on your on the recording here, maybe it won't be as high enough quality.

161
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:41,320
You see the subtle background, but on your browser you should see the subtle background tile.

162
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,170
Let's keep going.

163
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:49,390
OK, so I went through the stylesheet and there isn't much else that we need to clean up at this point

164
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:55,660
except for down here in the media queries the when we get to a certain width.

165
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:03,140
On our site for mobile devices, the toolbar switches.

166
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:03,710
Watch this.

167
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:11,740
Right there, see how the toolbar becomes a mobile toolbar, but it's kind of it's now it's taller and

168
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,570
it's tucked under our header here.

169
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,820
So we're going to change that.

170
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:17,470
We're going to fix that and add a little media query here.

171
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,090
No problem.

172
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,610
Just before five, six to eight.

173
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:22,510
After seven.

174
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,260
Actually, it's going to be above seven.

175
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:26,800
Sixty eight.

176
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,310
Below nine.

177
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:27,910
Ninety one.

178
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:34,450
And it's going to be specifically to fix the top margin when logged in to media screen and Max with

179
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,170
seven eighty two.

180
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:37,870
For some reason WordPress chose 702 as the width.

181
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:43,210
Not really sure why, but that's the specific width that the breakpoint is at.

182
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:53,950
And in here we're going to say logged in now our fixed top and then that will be top will be forty six

183
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:58,090
pixels, which is the new height of that toolbar.

184
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,260
And that should fix now.

185
00:11:59,290 --> 00:11:59,720
There we go.

186
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,010
So that swaps when you get down to that 70, 80 to perfect.

187
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:03,480
Looks good.

188
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:10,930
And then eventually our toolbar, our neighbor starts working and we go, OK, great.

189
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,240
There's also one last thing here.

190
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:17,520
Now, if I make this bit smaller, you could see the toolbar then just gets a bit smaller.

191
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,210
I'm assuming they do that just to clean up the toolbar so it works a bit better on mobile devices.

192
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:23,770
We need to fix that.

193
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,150
We need that to line up better.

194
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:28,320
So that breakpoint is actually six hundred pixels.

195
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,160
Again, I don't really know why they did that.

196
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:37,920
Why did they didn't use the standard, um, the standard breakpoints in mobile devices.

197
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,300
Not sure, but they did.

198
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,200
So we need to accommodate for that.

199
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,150
OK, so all you need to do is fix the top marginal logged in media screen max with six hundred.

200
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:49,390
Put that above the five sixty eight below the seven sixty eight.

201
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:53,050
And you're all you're going to do here is just select your logged in.

202
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:56,980
No fixed top and that's going to be top forty two pixels.

203
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,480
Check it out there.

204
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,970
It is fixed so that will adjust.

205
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:08,920
With WordPress, great, OK, that's really it for this lecture, next lecture, we're going to clean

206
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:14,530
up the footer in our WordPress theme and add some scripts and all that sort of good stuff.

207
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:14,920
See their.
