00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.390
And welcome back, this is Brad Hussey here, and we are going to take this whole bootstrap to WordPress

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.370
thing into the future here or in the present time, rather.

3
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.210
And so we have a new version of the boot drive to WordPress theme using all of the cool and modern standards

4
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.570
that we want to use in WordPress as of the time of this recording.

5
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.200
And we're going to be using kind of a nicer design.

6
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.480
We're going to be using nicer typography, nicer design standards and conventions layouts.

7
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.490
And also in WordPress, we're going to be using elements.

8
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.960
And of course, Gutenberg is in there and everything's up to date for the most part.

9
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.500
As we all know, WordPress updates all the time.

10
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.890
And so it is a bit of a challenge to make sure it's always up to date.

11
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.940
But I always like to say any good developer worth their salt, especially if you're working out in the

12
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.000
field at a studio, an agency or running your own company.

13
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.330
Any good developer should know how to take what's out of date and update it and learn how to update

14
00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.440
it.

15
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.440
So what I'm going to do here is show you what the site looks like.

16
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.120
This is it live bootstrapped to WordPress.com so that you can actually see what it looks like.

17
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.810
So here it is.

18
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:07.660
It's responsive.

19
00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.630
It's super nice.

20
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.430
Everybody's happy.

21
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.040
Look at that.

22
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.470
Whoa.

23
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.060
Animations, nice colors, nice gradients, nice buttons.

24
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.600
We're going to have it like, I don't know.

25
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.720
Everything looks nice layouts.

26
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.520
Everything looks nice looking good little mini animation.

27
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.560
They're super subtle.

28
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:26.910
Picture of me.

29
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:37.460
More a little subtle animations there, all the CSIS got a quote, some f q links buttons, you name

30
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.720
it.

31
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:38.570
We got it.

32
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.000
I think here's the home page.

33
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.610
Looks like this is what you just saw.

34
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.760
Blog page looks like this pretty standard.

35
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.170
This is the list of blog articles you just click on an article.

36
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.730
It goes into the single post.

37
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.650
Just got some content there.

38
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.480
Just kind of pre-populated from my personal blog, just so you can see what it looks like.

39
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.980
You got an image there.

40
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.280
You got the title, you got the the date.

41
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.240
Everything's nice.

42
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.380
Let's go to courses.

43
00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:13.150
A list of my courses here, and this is just to show you, you know, different layouts that you can

44
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.580
do.

45
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.850
And what's really cool about all this?

46
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.080
Let's head over to FGCU.

47
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.960
Question, answer, question, answer.

48
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.780
Super nice.

49
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.670
Contact contact page.

50
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.370
Right here, form and then join.

51
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.300
That's just like if you want to go to the course.

52
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.990
Cool.

53
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:36.970
Anyway, so what's cool about this is we are using, well, WordPress and bootstrap, but we're also

54
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.500
using Alimentare.

55
00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.740
So in the backend here, like we're going to be building this and we're going to design it up first

56
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.370
static, we're going to code out the HTML and CSS because that's always fine.

57
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.610
I always like that part, and we're going to show you how to kind of get this all themed up and then

58
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.360
we're going to bring it over into WordPress.

59
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.820
And then we're going to start theming it up and coding so that we can use Alimentare.

60
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.330
So in the back here, in the back end, rather.

61
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.270
I'll pull up a page, let's pull up the home page as an example right here, it's the front page you

62
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:15.530
could see we're using elementary.

63
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:23.390
This just makes it so much easier to to design really nice layouts and it just it's a lot of flexibility.

64
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.350
And what's cool is that if you are to build this, you know, once you learn how to build this theme

65
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:33.500
out and build themes in WordPress with, say, elementary Gutenberg, it's really easier to build your

66
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.320
own sites that way or to create client sites and a whole bunch of other things and just kind of using

67
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.820
elemental drag and drop.

68
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.290
So pretty cool.

69
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.150
You can make some really neat layouts here.

70
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.640
We have some custom layout widgets here, so we've got the general kind of basic ones here.

71
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.010
Pro if you upgrade, but we're not going to do that.

72
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.880
And then general and the down here, we got bootstrap to WordPress.

73
00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:04.520
So custom widgets here down here like buttons, titles, links, info, cards, call to actions, testimonials,

74
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:12.260
kind of custom like things that we've made and we're going to design and code and then use them in our

75
00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.740
element.

76
00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.870
And it just shows you the flexibility as you can code up a whole bunch of custom widgets if you want.

77
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.520
So we're going to do a few of those here as well.

78
00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:27.680
So that's the site that's the the, you know, the back end to see that it's an element here and everything's

79
00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.330
going to be pretty much up to date.

80
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.860
And I think it's going be a lot of fun.

81
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.010
So next video we're going to start digging in.
