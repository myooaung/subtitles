00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.810
Hey everyone!
Welcome back to Boost your Income with

2
00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:02.780
Bootstrap to WordPress.

3
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.855
In this lecture we're gonna create
a contact page and code our contact form.

4
00:00:06.855 --> 00:00:15.332
[MUSIC]

5
00:00:15.332 --> 00:00:20.920
All right guys, last page for
our static templates is our Contact page.

6
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.500
Very simple header,
pretty global footer, and contact form.

7
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.700
Super simple.

8
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:35.060
Let's jump in code editor, and
create a new page called contact.html.

9
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.950
Open that contact page.

10
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.110
Actually before you do that,
copy The head, all the way

11
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.990
from the top of this resources page, all
the way down to body, pass that, actually.

12
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.350
Header, we're gonna grab all this again.

13
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.538
And feature image,
copy that, that'll be good.

14
00:00:53.538 --> 00:01:01.900
Open your content.html Great.

15
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.010
Paste that in there.

16
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.200
And at the very bottom we
want to paste some more.

17
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.592
So let's open up our resources again.

18
00:01:12.818 --> 00:01:16.712
And I'm going to Copy from the bottom,

19
00:01:16.712 --> 00:01:22.500
html all the way up to footer
sign-up section there we go.

20
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.168
Right up to the top of sign-up section.

21
00:01:26.168 --> 00:01:27.580
Perfect.

22
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.730
Paste that at the bottom
of your contact page.

23
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.220
There we go.

24
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.810
Looks good, looks good.

25
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.540
Okay.

26
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.200
So why don't we change
a couple things here?

27
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.920
At the top I'm just gonna add a title.

28
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.740
Say, contact, pipe,
Bootstrap to WordPress.

29
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.220
And then scroll down,
full-width instead of resources,

30
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.360
this is going to be full-width contact.

31
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.300
And then we have our header Looks good.

32
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.622
Change the active class, here,
from Resources, add it to Contact.

33
00:02:03.622 --> 00:02:05.152
Good, good.

34
00:02:05.152 --> 00:02:10.187
Change the feature-image
text page-title to Contact.

35
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.570
And, that looks good.

36
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.080
Sign up section.

37
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.340
Don't necessarily need that.

38
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.380
But it'll be removed
once we're in WordPress.

39
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.930
Add a new comment here for a new section.

40
00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.130
This'll be main content.

41
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.110
Div with the class of container.

42
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.870
It's gonna have a child with a div with
the class of row and the ID of primary.

43
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.540
Then we're also gonna have
a child within there,

44
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.350
which will be a div
with the ID of content.

45
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.220
And the class of call, small 12.

46
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.570
Look at this super Emmet.

47
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.785
Boom!

48
00:02:51.785 --> 00:02:54.903
Saved myself a whole
bunch of time on markup.

49
00:02:54.903 --> 00:03:00.840
Content, this is row and
this is container.

50
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.540
Okay, within there, we're

51
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.790
going to have a section with
the class of main content not CSS.

52
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.660
There we go.

53
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:22.523
Within main content, I want
a paragraph with a class of lead And

54
00:03:22.523 --> 00:03:28.380
this text will say have any
questions about the course?

55
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.570
Feel free to get in touch.

56
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.680
I'll to my best to get back to you ASAP.

57
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.890
Now, let's code this form.

58
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.490
Within main content,
we're gonna have a form.

59
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.600
Action leave that alone,
WordPress will do all that.

60
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.530
Role will be form class clearfix.

61
00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.082
Cool, I don't need to add that there.

62
00:03:51.082 --> 00:03:56.930
All right, so let's use some Emmet here
to give us all of our form markup.

63
00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.410
So I'm going to start with
the div with the class of row.

64
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.690
It's gonna have a child
with the class of col-sm-6,

65
00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.630
and we're gonna have two of those.

66
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.700
And those will have children with the
class of form-group, those will be divs.

67
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.110
And now I need to jump back
up out of the col-sm-6, so

68
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.667
I can use this symbol right here.

69
00:04:18.667 --> 00:04:20.393
Shift+ 6 will give me that caret.

70
00:04:22.945 --> 00:04:27.160
And then I'm going to say col-sm-12.

71
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.150
And that will have a child of form group.

72
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.830
Now, if I expand that.

73
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.010
I believe I have everything perfect.

74
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.997
Row, there it is.

75
00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:40.910
Then we have our call perfect.

76
00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.321
That's our 12, this is our six and
this is our six and

77
00:04:43.321 --> 00:04:46.683
then our form groups within
each of those Awesome,

78
00:04:46.683 --> 00:04:49.100
I'm just gonna add a couple
comments just to clean it up a bit.

79
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.270
There you go, awesome.

80
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.760
So all that markup, I saved a whole bunch
of time simply because I used Emmet.

81
00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.660
As you could see,
it helps you speed up your coding.

82
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:07.810
All right, now I'm gonna have a label and
it's gonna have four contact name.

83
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:13.400
Class will be screen reader only, and
then name, and then we'll have an input.

84
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.160
Type will be text,
class will be form-control-input-lg,

85
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.940
that is a bootstrap class.

86
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.980
ID will be contact name
associated with that label.

87
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.500
Placeholder will be your name.

88
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.710
Let's copy that, paste it,
both of these actually.

89
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.890
Label and input,
paste it here in this next form group.

90
00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.439
We're gonna switch these around and
this is gonna say.

91
00:05:42.868 --> 00:05:45.980
Contact-email, here we go.

92
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:53.525
Screen reader only,
this will say email, input type email,

93
00:05:53.525 --> 00:05:59.498
form-control and put large contact email.

94
00:05:59.498 --> 00:06:06.740
And actually I messed up here for
the contact name.

95
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.570
This will be contact name,
not contact form.

96
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.140
This will say your email.

97
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:17.870
Now if we go down here the last
one is slightly different.

98
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:24.675
This will be label for contact words and
this will say message.

99
00:06:24.675 --> 00:06:31.210
Contact words, placeholder, your message.

100
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.390
However, this is not an input,
so let's just fix this up again.

101
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:37.360
I'm gonna keep the class ID and
placeholder,

102
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.980
and I'm gonna add a text area.

103
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:47.750
And that text area will have
the class of form control input.

104
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.025
Large, I also just noticed something.

105
00:06:50.025 --> 00:06:53.434
Form-control, take the dash
out after form-control and

106
00:06:53.434 --> 00:06:56.518
input-lg, this is actually
two separate classes.

107
00:06:56.518 --> 00:06:59.550
Form-control space input-lg.

108
00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.208
Do that in all the other instances.

109
00:07:01.208 --> 00:07:07.140
Form-control space input-lg.

110
00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.380
There we go, perfect.

111
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:14.310
Contact words, placeholder,
we'll say your message,

112
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.870
we're gonna have rows, 3.

113
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:22.801
And then after the row we're gonna have

114
00:07:22.801 --> 00:07:27.294
an input, the type will be submit.

115
00:07:27.294 --> 00:07:34.051
The class will be btn btn-info btn-lg and
pull-right.

116
00:07:34.051 --> 00:07:37.510
The value will be Get in touch.

117
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.700
And then an raquo, right, arrow quote.

118
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.060
Save that, check it out.

119
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:47.380
Right here in your contact page.

120
00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.380
There it is, there's the contact.

121
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.910
And so right now,
it obviously doesn't do anything but

122
00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:55.170
once we're in WordPress we're gonna use
a special plugin to allow us to do that.

123
00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:58.020
And that's it for our static site.

124
00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:58.990
All right, quick little overview.

125
00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:01.930
We have our homepage, looking good.

126
00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.290
We have the Moto window here.

127
00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:06.520
Pops up, great.

128
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:12.620
We have the blog page overview and
then the blog full post.

129
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.280
Comments.

130
00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.470
Contact form.

131
00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.130
Oh, one little thing.

132
00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:18.890
Quick fix, we need to fix this button.

133
00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:22.070
Drop it to your CSS,
it will be super quick.

134
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:25.610
Scroll up to your forms,
styles right here, and

135
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:29.060
after your input styles, we're going to
do a couple of quick things right here.

136
00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:38.246
We're going to select input, type, submit.

137
00:08:38.246 --> 00:08:42.614
And button[type="submit"].

138
00:08:42.614 --> 00:08:47.382
And then we're going to display

139
00:08:47.382 --> 00:08:53.565
inline-block; margin=bottom:0;

140
00:08:53.565 --> 00:08:59.938
font-size: 18px; Font weight bold.

141
00:08:59.938 --> 00:09:04.890
Line height, 1.33.

142
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.040
Text align, center.

143
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:11.180
White space, no wrap.

144
00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:14.690
Basically, I'm copying the styles
form the default bootstrap buttons,

145
00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:17.250
if you're wondering where I'm
getting these styles form.

146
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:18.560
Vertical align, middle.

147
00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.730
Cursor, pointer.

148
00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.200
Webkit-user-select, none.

149
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.645
Couple of more here,
this will be moz-user-select.

150
00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:35.315
And then just straight up ms-user-select.

151
00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:39.180
And then user-select, none.

152
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:40.689
So lots of user selects.

153
00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.010
Background image, none.

154
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:52.190
Border radius, 6 pixels.

155
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:55.100
Let's cross browser compatibilize this.

156
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.980
And moz-border-radius.

157
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:01.480
There we go.

158
00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:04.170
Save that.

159
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:05.590
Then we're going to copy
these one more time.

160
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:09.410
And give them some hover styles.

161
00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:13.450
So change this to hover and
add hover here as well.

162
00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:15.760
Great.
This will be outline none.

163
00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:16.830
Border none.

164
00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:18.328
Background triple a.

165
00:10:18.328 --> 00:10:21.589
Okay, save it.

166
00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:23.980
Give it a quick look.

167
00:10:26.184 --> 00:10:29.800
There we go, nice and decent.

168
00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:30.850
Now, back to our overview.

169
00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:32.890
We have our Resources page, it looks good.

170
00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:36.950
Contact page, looks good.

171
00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:42.400
All right, now what we're gonna
do is jump in to WordPress.

172
00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.880
We're gonna download WordPress the next
lecture, and we're gonna get started.

173
00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:46.965
