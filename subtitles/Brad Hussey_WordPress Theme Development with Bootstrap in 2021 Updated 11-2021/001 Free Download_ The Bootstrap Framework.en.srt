00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:01,330
Hey, everybody.
Welcome

2
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:03,950
back to Boost Your Income
with Bootstrap to WordPress.

3
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:08,380
This is a brand new section called,
I don't know.

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:08,900
What is it called?

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,090
Environment Setup,
Get Your Project Started.

6
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:16,560
And in this lecture,
we're going to be downloading Bootstrap.

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:24,846
[MUSIC]

8
00:00:24,846 --> 00:00:27,913
So in this course, we're obviously
gonna be using Bootstrap, so

9
00:00:27,913 --> 00:00:29,840
we're gonna need to download it.

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,924
And the easiest way of getting
Bootstrap is by downloading it from

11
00:00:33,924 --> 00:00:35,342
getbootstrap.com.

12
00:00:35,342 --> 00:00:39,284
All you have to do is click the Download
Bootstrap button right in the center of

13
00:00:39,284 --> 00:00:40,710
the screen.

14
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,493
But keep in mind that during the time
of the recording of this course,

15
00:00:45,493 --> 00:00:47,807
I'm using version 3.2.0.

16
00:00:47,807 --> 00:00:52,768
So if you are from the future and
downloading Bootstrap, and

17
00:00:52,768 --> 00:00:58,020
you see that that number is different,
keep in mind that the code

18
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,883
that Bootstrap supplies you,
or the framework itself, or

19
00:01:02,883 --> 00:01:08,650
the CSS classes, the styles,
the JavaScript, might be different.

20
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:12,680
It might not be that different, you might
still be able to use the exact same

21
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:19,141
classes and HTML markup that we're
gonna be using with version 3.2.0.

22
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:23,210
But in some cases,
they make some pretty drastic changes.

23
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,972
And to change component names altogether,

24
00:01:25,972 --> 00:01:29,261
they changed CSS classes,
they removed elements.

25
00:01:29,261 --> 00:01:32,855
So if you're just gonna be
downloading straight from here,

26
00:01:32,855 --> 00:01:34,810
then please keep that in mind.

27
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,140
You might need to make a few changes and

28
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,100
modifications if you are downloading
a much later version.

29
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,715
I do suggest trying it and
having the most up to date version,

30
00:01:46,715 --> 00:01:49,010
cuz that's always the best way.

31
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:54,220
But if you wanna start by using
the version that I have, or that I'm gonna

32
00:01:54,220 --> 00:02:00,080
be using throughout this course, then
you can download that version as well.

33
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:05,220
I'll supply it in the download section
of this lecture, and also in the next

34
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:09,620
lecture where we're gonna download
the full course files with everything.

35
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:14,420
I'll include the version
3.2.0 in there as well.

36
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,770
So just to wrap up what I just said there,
you could download Bootstrap.

37
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:22,920
I recommend using the latest version,
but it might be easier for

38
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,113
you during the duration of this
course to use version 3.2.0.

39
00:02:28,113 --> 00:02:31,720
You could download that in the download
section of this lecture, or

40
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,500
wait until the next lecture where you'll
get everything all in one bundle.

41
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:42,220
So go ahead and hit the Download Bootstrap
button, and I'll show you what you get.

42
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:47,673
So right here,
they give you three options for 3.2.0.

43
00:02:47,673 --> 00:02:51,560
You just get the Bootstrap version,
you get Source code, or you get Sass.

44
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,380
Nevermind Sass because that's using
a CSS compiler called Sass or less, and

45
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,109
we're not gonna be covering
that in this course.

46
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:03,605
This right here just gives
you the source less files,

47
00:03:03,605 --> 00:03:06,185
JavaScript font files and the docs.

48
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:10,820
This also requires a less compiler and
some additional setup.

49
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,100
Skip this one as well.

50
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:17,560
This is what we're gonna be focusing on,
right here, just the compiled and

51
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,830
minified CSS, JavaScript, and fonts.

52
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:24,060
No docs or original source files
are included, just the Bootstrap.

53
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,300
Go ahead and hit that button,
and then you'll be given a file,

54
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:36,970
a zip file that looks like this,
bootstrap-3.2.0.zip.

55
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,540
Again, if you're from the future,
you might have a different version.

56
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:43,530
This is what the source files
look like if you unzip that.

57
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:50,740
So you got a CSS folder with a bunch of
CSS, a fonts folder with some font files,

58
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:54,190
and js with a couple JavaScript files.

59
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,190
That's what we're gonna be using.

60
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:01,997
And again, you could download it right
from the source at getboostrap.com,

61
00:04:01,997 --> 00:04:07,566
or download 3.2.0 for the duration of
this course in the downloads section,

62
00:04:07,566 --> 00:04:09,761
or wait until the next lecture.

63
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:10,346
See you there.

64
00:04:10,346 --> 00:04:13,749
