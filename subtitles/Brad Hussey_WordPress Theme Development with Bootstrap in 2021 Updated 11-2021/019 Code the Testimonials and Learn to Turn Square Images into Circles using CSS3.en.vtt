00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.810
Hey everybody, welcome back to Boost
Your Income With Bootstrap to WordPress.

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.810
You may not have recognized me
with my freshly shaved face.

3
00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.880
This lecture is called Coding
the Testimonials Section.

4
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:19.220
[MUSIC]

5
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.320
What we're going to be doing now is
coding the Testimonials section right

6
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.770
here in our final static website.

7
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.090
You can see I have a Testimonials section.

8
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.428
Testimonials are highly effective in sales
pages if you're trying to sell a product,

9
00:00:31.428 --> 00:00:33.630
or a digital product, or a course.

10
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.923
In my case a course, and
right here I'm highlighting some of my

11
00:00:37.923 --> 00:00:42.170
featured testimonials from
some students of mine.

12
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.770
And I have a little graphic on the side.

13
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.050
In this case I have Brennan's actual face.

14
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.020
Here I just,
I'm hiding the identity of the people and

15
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.010
I'm just putting little avatars here,
cool little illustrative graphics.

16
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.737
And yeah, and
then I have a block quote and

17
00:01:00.737 --> 00:01:04.382
then the cite when you
cite the quote itself.

18
00:01:04.382 --> 00:01:06.515
All right, jump into to your code editor,

19
00:01:06.515 --> 00:01:10.510
scroll down to your Testimonials section
and give this section the ID of kudos.

20
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.720
That's what I want to call that.

21
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.690
All right and
in there let's do a container class.

22
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.450
Now I want to show you
something here with Emmet,

23
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.490
the plug in that I talked
about a few lectures back.

24
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.800
It lets you speed up your coding by
just using short little keywords and

25
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.000
then using a keyboard
shortcut to expand that.

26
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.092
So, I can do this and
just say container and

27
00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:34.840
it will give me a div with
the class of container like so.

28
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.880
But what if I want to go even further and
nest some additional divs or elements?

29
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.590
Well I can do that.

30
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.698
So right here,
I'm gonna add the greater than symbol and

31
00:01:46.698 --> 00:01:52.170
then class of row, so that's gonna
give me a child of the class of row.

32
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.000
So now if I just do that and
expand it, check this out.

33
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.520
So I've got a container and a div
the class of row all within each other.

34
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.420
And you can keep going and
going with that.

35
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.750
It's almost endless what you could do.

36
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.670
But right now,
I'm just gonna need to use these two.

37
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.850
It saves me time and
then I can just do this, of course, call.

38
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.120
This one will be small 8 cuz I'm
gonna center it in the middle with

39
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.660
an 8 column grid and give it some offset.

40
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.734
Call small offset 2.

41
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.200
And in there,
I'm going to add a level two heading,

42
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.370
let's give some space and
say what people are saying about Brad.

43
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.130
And let's give a little
HTML commentary and

44
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.520
say testimonial cuz
we're gonna have a few.

45
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.440
And so I just wanna be able
to keep track of those so

46
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.850
I don't get too messy with my HTML.

47
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.055
And let's try something here.

48
00:02:43.055 --> 00:02:45.180
I'm gonna give a div with
the class of row, but

49
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.780
also with the class of testimonial.

50
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.770
So using Emmet, if I just say .row and
.testimonial combined together,

51
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:53.920
expand that, there we go.

52
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.830
We've got a div with the class of row and
testimonial.

53
00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:57.470
That's awesome.

54
00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.380
And then within this,
I'm going to do a col-sm-4.

55
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.880
Make sure to close that up.

56
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.289
Image, I can use Emmet again to do that,

57
00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:16.800
assets/img/Brennan.jpg.

58
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.800
And this will say Brennan.

59
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.500
There we go.

60
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.012
And then after our col-sm-4,
we need to add to 12 or

61
00:03:24.012 --> 00:03:26.420
equal 12, so what is 12 minus 4?

62
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.470
8, col-sm-8.

63
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.670
And within there,
I'm going to add a block quote.

64
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.010
Boop.

65
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.630
There we go.

66
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.950
And I am just gonna copy and
paste this testimonial here.

67
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.860
I'm not sure I provided
testimonials in the copy deck,

68
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.240
however, all you could do here is just
add some gibberish or some lower ipsum.

69
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.230
My favorite is hipster ipsum.

70
00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.535
Check out hipster ipsum.com and
you can copy and

71
00:04:01.535 --> 00:04:05.430
paste some really interesting Ipsum text.

72
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.600
And then add a site tag
within the block quote.

73
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.010
And then I put an mdash, and then Brennan,
graduate of all of Brad's courses.

74
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.230
Brennan is awesome, he takes all of my
courses and he gives me shining reviews.

75
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.548
Thanks, Brennan,
if you're watching this video.

76
00:04:21.548 --> 00:04:22.218
All right.

77
00:04:23.628 --> 00:04:25.758
Now I'm gonna copy and paste this.

78
00:04:28.258 --> 00:04:31.499
I'm gonna add another testimonial, and

79
00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:35.851
let's change this one to Ben and
then the alt text will be

80
00:04:35.851 --> 00:04:41.050
illustration of a man with a mustache
cuz that is pretty accurate.

81
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.840
I'm gonna add the block
quote along with the site.

82
00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.720
Feel free to pause it and
type it all out or use some Bacon Ipsum,

83
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.710
Hipster Ipsum, Lauren Ipsum.

84
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:57.390
And the site, mdash Ben, graduate of build
a website from scratch with HTML and CSS.

85
00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:03.620
And then I'm gonna paste another
testimonial under that one.

86
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.330
Change this one.

87
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.302
This one is AJ.

88
00:05:08.302 --> 00:05:11.710
All text is illustration
of a man with a beard,

89
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.590
and then the block quote, right here.

90
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.850
I just wanna read this one
out cause this one's great.

91
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:17.660
Brad is amazing and

92
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.160
I honestly thing he's the best tutor of
all the courses I have taken on Udemy.

93
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.660
Will definitely be following
him in the future.

94
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.290
Thanks Brad.

95
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.170
AJ graduate of Code
a Responsive Website with Bootstrap 3.

96
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.970
Amazing.

97
00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.840
Thanks AJ.

98
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.330
And then we're gonna add another
testimonial below there.

99
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:38.821
And that will be, instead of AJ,
that will be Ernest,

100
00:05:38.821 --> 00:05:44.187
and the alt text for
that will be illustration,

101
00:05:44.187 --> 00:05:49.170
cuz I can leave that,
of a man with a goatee.

102
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:54.150
And then, The text

103
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.633
will be, Boop.

104
00:05:58.633 --> 00:06:00.929
And then the site will be Ernest,

105
00:06:00.929 --> 00:06:04.130
a graduate of Code Dynamic
websites with PHP.

106
00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.800
Save that.

107
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.100
And now check it out in your browser.

108
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.616
See what happens.

109
00:06:10.616 --> 00:06:14.450
Okay, so, couple things.

110
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.140
So far it looks okay.

111
00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.460
You can see a couple funny things here.

112
00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.530
Obviously, I have a broken image so
I must have typed something wrong.

113
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.550
The block quotes aren't styled
the same as the final site.

114
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.040
You see this is italicized and
it has no left border.

115
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.640
Brennan is a square.

116
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.840
It needs to be a circle.

117
00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.810
And you can see the site just is
clumped in with everything else, so

118
00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:40.730
you can't really tell
that who said this quote.

119
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.730
There's a little bit
of a space right here.

120
00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.010
And we didn't type that space.

121
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.200
And then we need some margin
in between all the quotes.

122
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.260
So let's fix those few things.

123
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:55.750
First, there's something here
in our HTML that I noticed.

124
00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:00.385
When I was copying and pasting, the second
and third and fourth, so on and so

125
00:07:00.385 --> 00:07:04.770
forth, testimonials, had the class
testimonial on the block quote.

126
00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:05.930
We don't need that there,

127
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:11.110
because we already have the testimonial
class here on the parent.

128
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.950
So we don't actually need that here,
so if you copied that from me,

129
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.560
delete that cuz we don't need it.

130
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.900
We just need the block quote itself.

131
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.010
So remove those.

132
00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.430
Just a little mistake on my part,
it's okay.

133
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.530
Clear them out,
make sure they're all gone.

134
00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:29.840
If you left them by accident, it's totally
fine, but we just don't need them.

135
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.740
Let's go ahead and
fix that other image here.

136
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.470
So I believe Ben might
have been the issue.

137
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.470
So Ben should be Ben.png, not jpg.

138
00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:44.090
That will fix that issue.

139
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:45.380
Let's check it out.

140
00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.295
All right, there's Ben so we're all good.

141
00:07:47.295 --> 00:07:49.830
So, let's do a few things here,
jump into CSS and

142
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:52.667
let's start by styling the kudos ID.

143
00:07:52.667 --> 00:07:56.830
It'll be text-align center,
see what that does.

144
00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:00.940
So it centers everything.

145
00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.560
Really the only thing that we
need centered is just this title.

146
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:08.057
But we're just centering everything and
then we'll put these things,

147
00:08:08.057 --> 00:08:11.090
these here back to
text-align left in a moment.

148
00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:15.967
All right,
under kudos we need to style testimonial,

149
00:08:15.967 --> 00:08:19.260
and that will be margin bottom 60.

150
00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.050
We need some space in between them.

151
00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:29.258
And those images,
testimonial image border radius 50% and

152
00:08:29.258 --> 00:08:37.146
because we are trying to make sure
this is cross browser compatible,

153
00:08:37.146 --> 00:08:42.586
we're gonna do webkit
border radius 50% and

154
00:08:42.586 --> 00:08:45.740
moz border radius 50%.

155
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.200
Save it check it out.

156
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.150
There we go.

157
00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:53.580
Now Brennan is a circle,
these guys are already circles so

158
00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.050
it doesn't really mater.

159
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.470
But, it's covered just incase you were to
put different images in here that were

160
00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:59.540
squares.

161
00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:00.438
Saves you the time.

162
00:09:00.438 --> 00:09:04.370
The reason why you'd wanna
do that CSS trick is because

163
00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:06.800
instead of going in Photoshop and

164
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:11.520
cropping this into a circle, you could
just use CSS 3 to mask it for you.

165
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:12.900
It's awesome.

166
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:13.930
All right, let's continue.

167
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:20.840
Now let's scroll up to our global
section and we're going to style our

168
00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:24.400
block quote,
because that's a type of graphic element.

169
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.700
We wanna style the block quote.

170
00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.560
Let's put those block quotes here.

171
00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:31.680
Just the end of our global.

172
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.900
We'll just keep tacking more stuff
here at the end of this CSS section.

173
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:36.440
So block quote.

174
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.492
We're gonna style our block quote.

175
00:09:37.492 --> 00:09:40.615
We're gonna say padding zero, border none,

176
00:09:40.615 --> 00:09:44.440
cuz we don't want that thick gray
border on the side, font style Italic.

177
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:54.005
Font, style, that's the problem Italic,
and text line left, that will fix that.

178
00:09:54.005 --> 00:09:56.880
Now, we need to also style the cite.

179
00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:00.750
Block quote cite tag.

180
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:01.760
Display blocks.

181
00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.610
And now that'll jump it
down on its own line.

182
00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:05.510
Color, let's put it triple seven.

183
00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.840
And margin 15 pixels in the top and

184
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.750
nothing anywhere else just to separate
it from the block quote itself.

185
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:14.670
And there is one more
thing that we need to do.

186
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:19.510
Do you remember that little space on
the very first line of the block quote?

187
00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:21.830
There was like a one space.

188
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.810
That's actually not in our text.

189
00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:26.270
We didn't add a space.

190
00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:30.620
What happens there,
is there is a before pseudo class that

191
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:36.050
gives some space to that section of
the block quote for some reason.

192
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:37.760
Just for an indentation or something, but

193
00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:42.900
we can remove that just by selecting block
quote and in the pseudo class before.

194
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.000
So it looks like this.

195
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.510
Put a colon and then before and that just
styles kind of like an empty invisible

196
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:52.640
element before the block quote and
then display none.

197
00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.340
So that removes the before
section all together.

198
00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:56.850
Check it out.

199
00:10:58.010 --> 00:10:58.530
There you go.

200
00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:00.120
There is our testimonials.

201
00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.600
There are our testimonials.

202
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.220
Better grammar.

203
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:05.180
All right, hang in there.

204
00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:12.780
Next section we're actually going to
style and code our sign up section.

205
00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:17.735
This really nice looking
paralex graphic background with

206
00:11:17.735 --> 00:11:21.586
some nice leading text and
a nice big button.

207
00:11:21.586 --> 00:11:22.386
See you there.

208
00:11:22.386 --> 00:11:25.729
