1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,680
Hey, friend, welcome back.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:08,550
So we've got a mess up here with all of the links hanging out here and the pool dots and allied dots

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,760
and this ugly little thing and an ax over there.

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,660
We got to make this look more like this and behave more like this.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,370
That's what we want to do.

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:15,870
Let's do it.

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,750
Here we go back here in our little line where he said more now.

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,380
Styles to come.

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,900
Get rid of that and let's continue from where we left off.

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,670
And because we've got a big chunk of code to right here, I'm going to try and be real efficient here

11
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,870
and not walk through.

12
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:34,530
Every single character will write the code out quickly and I'll explain any kind of unusual things that

13
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:35,640
happen as we go.

14
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,830
So we're going to do.

15
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:43,050
Main menu navigation L.I menu item has children Child's Locker A..

16
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,090
So again, pretty specific selector.

17
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,450
And that's going to have the padding right of 16 pixels.

18
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:55,470
And I have the important I don't know what this is called just important with with the exclamation point.

19
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,990
It just overrides any other style that might be styling this.

20
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,670
And we want to just make sure that the padding rate is 16 pixels.

21
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,820
Usually that happens when you're coding and your style is not working, so you just throw an important

22
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,300
in there.

23
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,850
It overrides whatever you're trying to do.

24
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:12,420
All right.

25
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:21,360
Next up, we got main menu navigation child selector L.I menu item has children, child selector a before,

26
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,100
before, as a pseudo element.

27
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,280
So we're selecting before, and that's going to have a few things here.

28
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,400
So we're going to have the font family of flat icon.

29
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,630
That's a flat icon font, Emily, that we brought in that flat icon font family we brought in.

30
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:42,720
And this a little bit of each HTML entity here, like the backslash F1 zero four is actually one of

31
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,560
the icons.

32
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:51,990
And in our files, I think if we went to like font flat icon HTML four to open that file up in a browser,

33
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,080
we'll actually see what each of them are.

34
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,820
And I believe you can also open CSS.

35
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,490
So yeah, so let's let's open that up in a browser.

36
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:13,580
So here's our flat, I can file that we that I provided in the project files, but you can also get

37
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,960
it at the flat acorn website.

38
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:26,300
And right here you can see if you want to use these styles or you can use a class or you can use the

39
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,650
HTML.

40
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:30,830
What is it called like?

41
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,090
A code?

42
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,080
Simple code.

43
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,450
The entity.

44
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,530
And I believe you'll find those in the course of the flat icons success.

45
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,250
So we've got menu close, right, arrow down, arrow so on, so forth.

46
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:43,600
See?

47
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,070
So that is what we're grabbing there.

48
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,560
So we're throwing it into here.

49
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:53,780
So f one zero four looks like we're grabbing the arrow down sign to navigate.

50
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,290
Cool.

51
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,250
There it is.

52
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,690
Position absolute right.

53
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:02,030
Zero font size 12 line height 34 Font White Font Weight 800.

54
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,750
All right, we're going to keep moving on here.

55
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:11,310
We're going to select the main menu navigation child selector ally.

56
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,050
You all in there.

57
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:19,610
We're going to have a handful of styles, one a position on absolute and negative.

58
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,910
Thirty left seventy pixels from the top.

59
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:30,870
We want the min width to be 150 pixels z index, to be 100 to override kind of be in front of everything

60
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,580
and the opacity to be zero.

61
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,920
We want it to not be visible right now.

62
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,290
And we will change that in an upcoming style.

63
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,060
We want the list style to be none because we don't want those little dots.

64
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,170
We want visibility to be hidden, display to be black.

65
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,290
And now what we're going to do is we're going to transition.

66
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:58,660
All point four seconds is let's actually change that to our variable VAR.

67
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,660
Dash Dash Transition Dash Dir.

68
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,190
OK, let's throw that in there.

69
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,230
And each of these instances.

70
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,040
Just to be consistent, why not?

71
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,530
Nobody will notice, but why not?

72
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,930
And then finally, padding 20 pixels top and bottom, 15 pixels left and right.

73
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,000
All right.

74
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,300
Let's add a couple more things, actually.

75
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,540
Background color.

76
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:33,450
That's going to be white and we're going to add a box shadow, which is going to have zero pixels,

77
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,220
zero pixels, 10 pixels.

78
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:45,930
Ogba GBA zero zero zero zero point one So pretty pretty like non opaque Mr word hard to see.

79
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:47,550
Lose my word said.

80
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,720
Hey folks, let's check it on the browser.

81
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,810
All right, so we've cleaned up, we've hidden the menu, that's what we did.

82
00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:01,020
Put that down, arrow, we've hidden the menu, the submenu, we can't see it right now because we haven't

83
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,640
done any styles to make it visible.

84
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,050
So let's let's get moving on that.

85
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:06,930
Let's move, move on.

86
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,970
Next up, we've got main menu navigation, child selector, ally child.

87
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,140
You call child ally.

88
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:20,610
So again, really specific and we're doing position relative width 100 percent border bottom one pixel

89
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:30,960
solid F9, F9, F9 So very, very thin and hard to see like hairline, that's kind of the ally in each

90
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,280
of the submenus.

91
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,850
So in under the ally, we want to make it look like this.

92
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,220
So you can kind of see here there's like a thin hairline.

93
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,020
That's essentially what we're making.

94
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:42,500
All right.

95
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,940
And then we want the last one.

96
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,990
So in the final one here, we want the last item like blog or contact in this case to have no hairline

97
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,940
on the bottom because it doesn't look very good if there is.

98
00:05:53,570 --> 00:06:01,760
And that doing this coming up, if we do main menu, we select that last child navigation, child,

99
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,630
ally, child, URL, child, ally and then colon.

100
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:09,470
Last child, it selects the last ally, which I showed you in that example.

101
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,610
And we're going to say border bottom.

102
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:12,980
None.

103
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:14,510
Cool.

104
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:14,980
All right.

105
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,290
Moving on, we got some more specific child selectors coming up here, folks.

106
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:24,260
Main menu navigation child ally child u l child, ally child a.

107
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:28,490
So basically, this is saying only this a.

108
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:36,180
Tag that as a child of the of the lie immediately before it, that as a child who you are a child of

109
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,340
the ally child of this, so it's very specific.

110
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:44,250
So we don't like select accidentally all tags within a list or something, and we're going to make that

111
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,180
position relative.

112
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,970
Display block.

113
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:54,600
We want the padding to be 10 pixels top and bottom, eight pixels left and right line height to be 24

114
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,200
pixels.

115
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,460
We want the font weight to be 400, font size to be 15.

116
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,240
We want to text transform that to capitalize.

117
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,060
In case you have any, you know, you spell it lowercase, you want to capitalize the first letter color

118
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,200
going to be two to two.

119
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,690
Let's see if we have that anywhere up here.

120
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:15,950
We don't know.

121
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,630
What we can do is we could just use colored arc.

122
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,220
Maybe we'll do that for our color dark.

123
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,510
We can use our variables.

124
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,760
And now we're going to do some transitions.

125
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:34,610
Transition all 500 milliseconds is to the Moore's web kit, Microsoft and opera browser fallbacks.

126
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,390
And then we're going to do another big child selector here.

127
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,620
Main menu navigation alive while I hover.

128
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:49,380
So on hover of this ally as a children of these, these the A.

129
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:55,670
So for hovering over the ally, we want to style this specific a link.

130
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,460
What we're going to do is we're going to make the color.

131
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:05,170
FDA zero zero and the padding left to be 10.

132
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:09,640
I mean, check if we have that as a variable FDA zero zero, it's the color yellow perfect.

133
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:14,680
So the color yellow save that.

134
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:20,410
Now let's see what happens in our version.

135
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,870
OK, nothing's happening so far.

136
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,680
That's OK.

137
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,710
It's all happening in the background.

138
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,030
OK, I need to make it appear.

139
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,760
So we still got a few more stores here.

140
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:39,400
All right, we've got main menu navigation legal ally with the class of menu item has children and then

141
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:43,220
that child a after pseudo element, big selectors.

142
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:49,340
Here it's going to be flat icon font and if one zero five is the content.

143
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,440
Position absolute.

144
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,730
We're going to go 15 pixels in the right, 14 pixels from the top.

145
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,540
We're going to do width and height.

146
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:07,310
The width is ten pixels, the height is 20 pixels display block and the color is going to be 01:58 or

147
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,430
let's use our dark color color dark.

148
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:17,090
Line height and font size, 20 pixel line height, 12 pixel font size.

149
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:24,550
Font weight is going to be normal, the text a line is going to be center and then the Z Index five

150
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,600
font weight 800.

151
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,130
OK, we're getting closer.

152
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,990
Closing in on this?

153
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,790
Let's see if anything happens here.

154
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:32,290
Refresh.

155
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,130
OK, we're not doing anything yet.

156
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,600
That's OK.

157
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,370
It's all happening in the background.

158
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:44,950
This will appear and once once we make it appear, then and then it will all start to to show all of

159
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:45,670
our hard work here.

160
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:52,940
And what I recommend is if any of this stuff is confusing to you because we would have the longest license

161
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:58,520
in the entire whole wide world if I were to explain every single line of this, I presume that many

162
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:03,950
of you watching have some CSI experience and if not, like, play around with it once.

163
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:09,860
Once you follow along and we make this menu up here, take some stuff out just like, you know, take

164
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,790
a whole swath of it out, you know, go Command X to cut.

165
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:19,610
And then, like, save it, see what happens and then paste it back in and see what happens to isolate

166
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,490
what each style does, that's a great way of learning, by the way.

167
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:23,870
All right.

168
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:24,830
So.

169
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,870
What do we got next?

170
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,340
Main menu navigation.

171
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,540
You, Ally menu item has children.

172
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:42,210
When you hover the child selector after it's thought the same style as this one, I don't know.

173
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,580
Let's check how Lionel Ally.

174
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,810
Menu navigation, this one looks a bit longer.

175
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,630
Oh, OK, well, this one's when we hover.

176
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,440
OK, perfect.

177
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:58,240
As soon as when we hover, we're going to just make the color of that.

178
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,160
A after pseudo element is going to be our bar.

179
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,790
Color dark.

180
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:15,030
Now we're going to do is we're going to position sorry, we're going to do main menu navigation, legal

181
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,170
ally you all.

182
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,720
So we're nesting here doing a lot of nesting.

183
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:25,380
That's going to be position absolute left 120 percent top zero percent.

184
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,880
That could also be zero virtually the same number.

185
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:34,740
And then the mean width of this element is going to be 150 pixels.

186
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,300
See what happens so far.

187
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,010
If anything's coming up, nothing yet.

188
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,010
It's a whole, very underwhelming so far.

189
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:45,400
When is that index 100?

190
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,410
List style.

191
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:48,910
None.

192
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,740
Save that.

193
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:52,260
OK.

194
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,520
Opacity zero display block.

195
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:05,770
When do some padding, background color and box shadows of 20 pixels top bottom, 15 pixels left right.

196
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:10,240
White background color block shadows zero zero 10 Najiba.

197
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:14,650
All zeros in our igby and then on the Alpha Channel zero point one.

198
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,600
Then finally, some transitions.

199
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,300
All 2.4 seconds is now, as you know, point four seconds.

200
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:29,100
It's close enough to our to our variable transition, dir.

201
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:29,720
So we're going to do that.

202
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:36,950
We're going to change it to VAR Transition Dir in our replace all.

203
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,150
OK.

204
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:43,450
Say that actually were good and.

205
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,990
Now we're getting closer to making this thing appear.

206
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:21,470
So what I'm going to do is actually I'm going to make it appear well, we're we're going to jump right

207
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:24,770
to that style where we make it appear and then we'll go back and do some finished styling so he can

208
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,310
kind of see our work because I have the benefit of, I know what this is going to look like.

209
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,920
And you're just kind of trusting the process here, which is great.

210
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:36,440
But let me let's let's make it appear, and then we'll come back to where we were here.

211
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,690
I want to jump ahead here.

212
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:43,640
I see more now, styles to come and I'll go down.

213
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,970
And so we're going to say main menu navigation.

214
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:57,660
Ally menu item has children hover and in the pool, so any navigation menu ally that has children,

215
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:04,500
so the class, we're going to select that URL when we hover on the fly that has that class and we're

216
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:10,440
going to do is do visibility visible opacity one and then display block.

217
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,580
Let's see what that does.

218
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,020
OK, so it made it appear it's looking pretty good.

219
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:22,980
And we're not getting a submenu here or sub submenu, but so far it's looking pretty good.

220
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:27,240
Now we need to do is go left zero percent.

221
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,100
Am I going to do border top?

222
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,290
Zero Pixels?

223
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,190
And importance to override any other border styles we have.

224
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,290
We're going to do some transforms.

225
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:48,100
So we've got to transform rotate x zero degrees and then Moore's Web Kit Microsoft, an opera.

226
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,480
Well, this one at the top.

227
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,230
All right.

228
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,030
So if that did anything.

229
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,000
Kind of more in the animation's camp.

230
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:02,820
All right.

231
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,250
Actually, this is what we're going to have, this is probably going to change.

232
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:14,240
Right now, we're rotating in to zero degrees, but eventually when we go back to our more nav styles,

233
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:19,560
we will probably actually add that rotation and this resets the rotation to zero.

234
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,950
So it might seem like this did nothing, but it will eventually.

235
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:31,950
OK, now let's select the submenu like the Sub Submenu, Main Menu Navigation Ally, Child URL child

236
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:36,590
alive with the class of menu item has children hover children, you ll cool.

237
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:41,390
We're going to another level deep here and we're going to do visibility.

238
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,630
Visible display block opacity one.

239
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,400
Top zero.

240
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:49,340
Kind of like the last one left one hundred percent.

241
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,390
Let's just see what happens.

242
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,760
It's probably going to make it work real.

243
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,120
Nice.

244
00:15:55,020 --> 00:16:03,060
And it mean in very cool satellite link style, but we're getting there now, what we also need to do

245
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,680
is our transforms.

246
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:12,470
So we got the Transform Rotate acts, and that's because eventually when we go back, we're going to

247
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,790
have some rotations in there.

248
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:20,420
And so it maybe rotates in and we're going to do our transition is going to have all 300 milliseconds.

249
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:23,000
So here's our transform style.

250
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,570
So transition styles save it.

251
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,350
We're going to keep going.

252
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:44,190
Big Selecter main menu child, you'll fly with the class, the menu item has children.

253
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:21,980
All right, let's go back up to our more now styles, and we're going to make all that happen again.

254
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:22,880
All right, so.

255
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:12,470
Now we're going to do is we're going to add back in here main menu navigation child, ally child, you

256
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,850
child, ally, child URL to class of from right?

257
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:20,580
And we're going to add left auto right.

258
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,390
Zero.

259
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,270
Main menu navigation.

260
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:29,720
A child's electors, loyal ally, you'll ally.

261
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:37,100
And this is going to have position relative width 100 percent border bottom one pixel solid F9, F9,

262
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,990
F9 All right.

263
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,150
From here.

264
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,730
Main menu navigation.

265
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:51,070
Todd Selecter, all the way through U L L IU, L L I would see the element of last child just like the

266
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:54,360
last one and we're doing border bottom.

267
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,260
None.

268
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,650
Just want to make sure that I'm not writing this again twice because I know that we.

269
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,200
We did last child up here somewhere.

270
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,370
No, I think we're good.

271
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,450
We're just selecting, I guess, further in the Sub submenu, so if we save and refresh.

272
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,810
Then we're adding the hairlines in under this perfect.

273
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:21,760
OK.

274
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:29,450
Now we're going to do is we're going to go into that submenu subsub menu and grab the AirTags.

275
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,200
So we got this big selector here.

276
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:33,400
I'll read it out.

277
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:40,130
Main menu navigation L.I, you'll ally, you'll ally a all child selectors.

278
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:46,420
And then we're going to have position relative display block and we're going to have padding.

279
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:51,010
Top and bottom is 10 pixels left and right, 18 line height is 24.

280
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,920
The font weight is 400.

281
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,480
Font size is 15.

282
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,640
As usual, text transform.

283
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,890
Capitalize the color.

284
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:04,690
We're going to make that VAR color dark, then padding left.

285
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,370
So we're overwriting that.

286
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,080
No.

287
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:20,550
And then some transitions transition all five hundred milliseconds is Mars webcams and oh all the same

288
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,390
for fallbacks.

289
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,370
OK, now save.

290
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,710
Maybe let's have a little look.

291
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:34,380
Now we're looking real nice now, it's not animating like this, so I think we should maybe take care

292
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,070
of that coming up.

293
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,040
Next.

294
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:40,590
We want.

295
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,050
Main menu navigation.

296
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,750
We're nesting pretty deep here.

297
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,180
I hover and a.

298
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:54,820
So we want to change that color to our VAR color yellow.

299
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,420
So when we hover on that submenu, the links in the sub submenu rather.

300
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:02,110
And then we got our main menu navigation.

301
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:07,960
We're digging deep into that subsub menu, the fly when you hover to a high.

302
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,340
In fact, I think it's exact same.

303
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:10,900
Yeah.

304
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,530
And then padding left.

305
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,430
10 pixels.

306
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:20,760
Came.

307
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,150
Check it out.

308
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,250
That's looking better.

309
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:29,970
There we go.

310
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,910
All right, so now we're going to do is we're going to dig into the that.

311
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:39,340
Submenu subsub menu again.

312
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:53,390
Now, here's another way of writing out that child selector where you have many, many, many, many

313
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:55,250
child selectors who do something like this.

314
00:22:55,490 --> 00:23:03,200
Main menu navigation and then on a new line child Lee child you call child Lee Child, you will child

315
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:07,850
play with the class menu item has children, child a after school element.

316
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:08,740
So you could do that.

317
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,610
And it's just some people like doing that.

318
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:13,320
Some some designers and developers like doing that.

319
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,210
It's easier to see.

320
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:17,870
Whereas this is a little dizzying, you know the all in one line to you.

321
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:26,480
And then we're going to do this is a font family flat icon content backslash F1 zero five.

322
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,300
It's going to be position absolute.

323
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:35,020
Ten from the top, ten from the right, eleven from the top.

324
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,250
Width and height.

325
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:40,100
Ten pixels or the width, 20 pixels for the height?

326
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:41,710
Let's check it out.

327
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,350
See what happens?

328
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:47,230
OK, I don't see much of a change here.

329
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:47,590
But.

330
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:53,650
Believe us icon, yeah, we're we're trying to add this icon there, so let's keep going.

331
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:08,460
I think it's because we need to go display block now, if we show it refresh and we still don't see

332
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:08,610
it.

333
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,300
Let's keep going.

334
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:13,120
Color, this is probably it, 277 to seven.

335
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:17,980
We could also go like this VAR dash dash colored dark.

336
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,070
And line height, 20 pixels.

337
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,440
Font size 12 pixels, font weight 800.

338
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:31,070
Text Align Center Z Index five.

339
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,330
Maybe this will make it show up.

340
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,530
I'm not seeing anything.

341
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,710
Main menu, navigation and lie.

342
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,530
Mean, let me just check my code here.

343
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:59,640
Well, let's keep going, actually, and then we'll isolate to see if this did anything, keep going.

344
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,240
So we're going to do is we're going to select the main menu navigation.

345
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:12,190
Child IU, L L IU, L L I menu item has children hover A. After pseudo element might be the exact same

346
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:14,260
selectors up here, let me just confirm.

347
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:30,290
OK, so this one is with without the hover, and this one is with the hover.

348
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:30,890
That's it.

349
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:31,390
OK.

350
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:32,810
It's always nice to make sure.

351
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:37,820
OK, so in this, this is where we're going to do a couple of things.

352
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,200
So let's bring this all back.

353
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:39,630
One.

354
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,310
Clean it up.

355
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:41,840
OK.

356
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,610
This is going to be color white.

357
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,360
OK.

358
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:49,960
This is where we're going to make some stuff happen.

359
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:50,440
Let's see.

360
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:03,070
Main menu navigation child Ally menu item has children, hover child, you all so in this one, right,

361
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,530
this is where we're going to make things appear.

362
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:13,140
Visibility visible opacity one display block left zero border top zero.

363
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:17,800
Important or decent transforms that rotate.

364
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,950
So I already did that were there.

365
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,950
OK, so let's check it out blog.

366
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:34,940
Ta ta da.

367
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,550
All right, well, we did do the styles cool.

368
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,480
So.

369
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:40,730
I'm thinking.

370
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:48,450
The suction here, let's just remove it and see if it did anything flat icon menu item has children.

371
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:53,340
It's possible that we out of these styles, but they're not showing up because we don't have that markup

372
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:53,670
in there.

373
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:08,730
So you don't.

374
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,960
All right, let's have a look.

375
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,410
And now it's looking really, really good.

376
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:23,280
OK.

377
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:21,050
I just want to show you something real quick here, I was just kind of reviewing my code and remember

378
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,240
we wrote these rotate acts now.

379
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:26,210
Currently, we actually don't do anything with that.

380
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:33,050
I think we might have wrote this when meaning we, as in behind the scenes, wrote this code and didn't

381
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:33,620
have a look.

382
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:37,430
We meant to use an animation, but we didn't actually incorporate anything.

383
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:43,640
So what this is saying is when you hover on this submenu, you know, put the rotate back to zero.

384
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:46,980
But the thing is is we don't actually rotate it anywhere.

385
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,960
We don't have it rotated.

386
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:54,470
So if you want to do something with this way, you can do is just select this one main menu navigation,

387
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:59,810
you know, limey menu item has children hover you all right before it.

388
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:09,980
Take the hover state off of it, and let's like actually transform it to start at, you know, certain

389
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:10,370
rotation.

390
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,720
So let's say, you know, like.

391
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:14,010
Forty degrees.

392
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:23,860
So now this, by default, is 40 degrees, but you don't see it until we hover and it actually is going

393
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,170
to rotate to zero, so let's see what that does.

394
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:31,180
Very subtle, almost like it kind of squeezes.

395
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,600
You can kind of see that if we would've made it more

396
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,740
drastic, let's say, like 90.

397
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,870
You can kind of see there, it's like rotating 90 degrees on the x axis.

398
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:56,110
You can also change Rotate X to rotate Y if you wanted to spend another way.

399
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:00,740
So let's search and replace everything, rotate x and we'll change it to rotate.

400
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,460
Why?

401
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,080
So what happens?

402
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:08,680
It looks kind of interesting.

403
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,540
You could also rotate.

404
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:12,900
Z.

405
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,740
Replace all.

406
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,120
So let's see.

407
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:19,380
That's interesting.

408
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:24,300
Kind of cheesy, but maybe what we can do is, like make it a little more subtle, so instead of 90

409
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,610
degrees, we can do something like.

410
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,050
20 degrees.

411
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,250
Just a little more subtle.

412
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:38,630
That's kind of neat, actually kind of think that's cool.

413
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,400
Maybe even more subtle, I'm all about subtlety.

414
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,770
It's like eight degrees, so it's going to hurt to replace.

415
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,640
20 degrees to eight degrees.

416
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,010
Yeah, it's kind of a neat.

417
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:53,580
Kind of a neat little thing, you could do the same thing with this one.

418
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,320
This one does a different animation.

419
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:56,580
It slides in from the right.

420
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,020
Maybe we'll leave it.

421
00:31:59,500 --> 00:31:59,830
Yeah.

422
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,900
OK, I'll be I'll be done in three minutes, OK?

423
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,080
No, I'm almost done, buddy.

424
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:18,060
I'm recording a video, so I need three minutes, three minutes, tell mom three minutes.

425
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,350
Since that time, I'm three minutes.

426
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,370
Illegally and recording video, I need you to go all the up and through the.

427
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:44,320
Let's see if we could do something with them, because right now we're not doing anything, so here

428
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,740
is that sub submenu.

429
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:51,200
We're in a place that same thing, but take the hover out so the current, the actor or the standard

430
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:57,560
state we're going to do like, we'll rotate it again from eight degrees, going to copy that style.

431
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:59,000
So just to show you here.

432
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,620
Main menu.

433
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,300
This is the sub submenu.

434
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,330
That we're selecting and this is its hover state.

435
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:09,740
So we're rotating on the z axis from eight degrees.

436
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,590
Let's see what happens.

437
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:13,120
That's neat.

438
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,610
I think that that's pretty cool.

439
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:20,340
And when they both like, go away, whoa, I like it, I like it a lot.

440
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,990
Good job on that one.

441
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:25,080
All right, and not as good for this lesson.

442
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,460
We tidy this up.

443
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:27,680
We cleaned up the menu.

444
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:31,470
We did a submenu subsub menu, lots of styles in there.

445
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,500
In their next video, we're going to take care of this mobile menu.
