00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.270
Hey, friend, welcome back.

2
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:08.640
Previously, on an episode of Bootstrapped, a WordPress 2.0, we coded the HTML up kind of the scaffolding

3
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.240
html for the blog index page of the articles.

4
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:22.290
And at the end of the episode, we realized that looking at a white wall of messy, really basic HTML

5
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.050
with minimal styling wasn't that exciting.

6
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.550
And we decided to switch gears and move to CC a little prematurely so that we can work with our HTML

7
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.990
while looking at something nice in tandem.

8
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.340
So that's how we're going to do.

9
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.440
We're actually going to start styling some stuff up.

10
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.430
Make this look a little better.

11
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.860
Head over to that favorite code editor of yours.

12
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.660
Hopefully, you've got your favorite drink in hand.

13
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.650
Appropriate for the time of the day and open up your style, the CSV file we got that lets me make this

14
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.590
little easier to see style.

15
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:59.750
Let's see SS real basic, real easy, real simple and at the top here you could see we're already linked

16
00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.940
up.

17
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.700
Make sure you're linked up real style sheet aircraft style.

18
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.640
That's SS and we're gonna head into that style sheet.

19
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.330
We're going to start doing some typography first to make it look nice.

20
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.900
Make the type look good.

21
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.840
Start with that body and we're going to go font family.

22
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.540
And remember how we added the entire font family?

23
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:16.980
We'll do that right now.

24
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.510
Font size is going to be 18 pixels.

25
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.040
Line height is going to be 28 pixels.

26
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.340
Real simple, you could use MS or REM's if you want.

27
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.750
I'm just going, I'm just going like this kind of hard coded.

28
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.670
Now one thing you could do is you could this is up to you.

29
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.990
You could do it anywhere you want.

30
00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.190
You can say at one point five am or just one point five, which is going to be one point five of the

31
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.550
font size one point five rim is going to be the route.

32
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:49.840
And so if you said body route was like 18 pixels, when you use RIM, it's always going to go off of

33
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.520
the route of the style of the the the tree, whatever it's called.

34
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.140
I forget it right now, but it's going to go to the route, whatever the route, font size is, which

35
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.430
is in this case, the body.

36
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.840
It is 18 pixels.

37
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:09.180
So if you were to do like paragraph font size, it's going to be, you could say like one rim what's

38
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.010
18 pixels?

39
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.390
If you said to rim, that's what 36 pixels, so on and so forth.

40
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:14.290
It's how that works.

41
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.700
So you could do it that way.

42
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.400
For now, let's just hardcoded.

43
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.930
You do whatever way you want.

44
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:27.340
OK, let's head over to that paragraph tag, and we're going to say that color is black triple zero

45
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.160
font weight 400.

46
00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.110
Let's style up our M emphasis color.

47
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.810
Let's go like this way to a to a two.

48
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.410
OK, now couple of things you can do here.

49
00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.580
Just a little side CC sort of tutorial here.

50
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:52.210
If you don't want to just hard code everything that you don't have to CC is kind of cool because you

51
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.830
can add like six variables.

52
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.970
Now, I don't think they're called variables, but that's essentially what they are.

53
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:06.070
If you just type, you know, colon root, then you can actually establish kind of variables that you

54
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.760
can pull from.

55
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.040
So colors, font sizes, font styles.

56
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.780
It works to establish a variable, you say.

57
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.140
Dash, dash and then the name of the variable.

58
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.790
Now a convention would be something like this.

59
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.200
Let's say font dash sans.

60
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.340
And that would be like your sans font family.

61
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.960
And let's say enter.

62
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.880
And then we'll just go like Helvetica as a backup in the font stack and then sans serif.

63
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:35.170
OK, so now we can do any time we want to use our font sans family instead of writing it out.

64
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.830
Hardcoded, you go font family to call that variable.

65
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:44.050
You say VAR and in parentheses your dash dash font, dash sense.

66
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.150
So now if I save that essentially font family for body is whatever I put in here.

67
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:56.590
And if I change this, you know, like to something like a really high quality font, then we can we

68
00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:57.130
can check it out.

69
00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:59.160
It looks.

70
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:05.770
I don't even have this high quality font available to me, which is too bad, huh?

71
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.240
Look at that one.

72
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.930
You get the idea.

73
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.420
Let's put in your back and check it out.

74
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:16.740
If I were to inspect this, I should see that my body has the the bar font.

75
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.230
And you can actually click on the variable value here and you can see it.

76
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:21.280
And it says What shift?

77
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.730
Click.

78
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.980
To replace the variable with a value can actually change that just in the in the inspector.

79
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.120
But there we go.

80
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.140
And where is that style if you just click H.M.?

81
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.250
You can see in the root.

82
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.470
It's actually establishing that font variable right here.

83
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.060
Perfect.

84
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.620
OK, let's create another one.

85
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.620
Let's make this even more, let's say, font size.

86
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.630
And this will be our route.

87
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.030
Font size, let's say 18 pixels.

88
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.800
And now instead of font size, 18 pixels, here we're going this.

89
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.550
VAR dash, dash font size now.

90
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:10.820
There we go, we had our font size 18 and the body is going to have the font size of variable 18 pixels

91
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.360
if I change that.

92
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.160
It's like twenty eight.

93
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.320
Well, it affects everything else.

94
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:17.250
See how that works.

95
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:25.380
OK, let's say 1.5 is the line height, which is essentially multiplying the root font size by one point

96
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:25.740
five.

97
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.230
You could also specify one point five rim.

98
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:35.450
Like that, or if you just said one point five is going to be 1.5 of the font size?

99
00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:41.180
Actually, yeah, 1.5 or 1.5 m, I believe these act the same.

100
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.370
It's the line.

101
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:48.490
It's going be 1.5 of what the local to that style.

102
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.000
So if you were to say like the paragraph, font size was like font size.

103
00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.330
Let's say.

104
00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:59.850
One REM.

105
00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.530
That's 18 pixels.

106
00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:14.790
You could also say, like zero point eight rim, then if we wanted the line height to be 1.5 of this,

107
00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.860
it might already be established there.

108
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.110
But you can override it and say line height.

109
00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.400
You can say one.

110
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:28.820
And and that's going to mean that it's going to go off of its local style, which is going to be the

111
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.920
point eight Rams, so point eight of 18 picks, though, so let's see if that math is right.

112
00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:40.310
So obviously doesn't look good, but I'm just kind of showing you here, so the font size is zero point

113
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:46.530
eight rim, which is, you know, 80 percent of 18 pixels, and the line height is one m, which is

114
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.960
going to be the same as this.

115
00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:54.780
So if that turns out to be like fourteen point four, then the line is four point fourteen point four.

116
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.750
You could see that just a little exercise there.

117
00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:00.460
It's going to take one point five.

118
00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.910
Let's keep going and then we'll add to our variables as we go.

119
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:14.530
Variables styles within EM font weight will make it a little heavier a link, skinny text decoration,

120
00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.950
non and transition.

121
00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.880
So this is for like when we do little animations.

122
00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.580
Point three seconds 0.3 seconds.

123
00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:24.100
A hover.

124
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:32.560
Or change the color and the color, or are you going to be using a two seven a six o or six zero rather?

125
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.940
And we could actually we're actually going to save that as a variable because we want to use that.

126
00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:37.810
We're going to like this.

127
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:44.800
I'm going to say color green could be, you know, brand green brand, primary brand success, whatever

128
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.210
you want to call it, this.

129
00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:49.840
So anytime you want to change that color globally, you can do that.

130
00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:51.220
So now.

131
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:54.220
It works now interesting here.

132
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:56.950
Watch that, so right here, I just noticed something.

133
00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:03.550
We have this right arrow that we use with H.M. Entity, but in the final it actually looks different.

134
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.690
And that's because the entire font, which is the entire font family were using.

135
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:16.480
If you just put the if you put a dash and a greater than sign, it actually just switches it to this

136
00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.150
kind of nice line arrow.

137
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.420
So let's actually do that.

138
00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:20.320
Go back to your HTML.

139
00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.840
You can search and replace if you want RMR.

140
00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:30.420
We use it a few times and just change it to dash greater than replace all save.

141
00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:37.510
Now, if we go back here, you could see it changes that arrow to like the nicer kind of arrow.

142
00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:40.450
That's because the entire font family does that render some headings?

143
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:44.440
And we're going to say the color for this is going to be after you, after you have to.

144
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.960
And that's going to be like a like a white, like an Off-White.

145
00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.200
And we're going to change that into a variable shortly, actually.

146
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:52.690
But we'll see font size for the H one.

147
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:59.800
We are 18 pixels is the is the root, so I'll say 3.5 REM, which is going to be three point five the

148
00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:09.190
size of the root font weight 800 margin bottom one REM and have it be rel- relative to the font size.

149
00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:13.070
I like that transition zero point three s.

150
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.430
And you know, if we use this more than once, let's make it a variable.

151
00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:16.870
Let's go like this.

152
00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:25.280
Make a global transition time, transition duration that might be variable, so say just dir.

153
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:26.870
Yeah, transition dir.

154
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:34.820
Let's just do that and we'll see zero point three s and anytime we have that bar Ashutosh Transition

155
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:35.690
Dir.

156
00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:36.670
Perfect.

157
00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:37.820
Copy that piece it out.

158
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.620
Save it should still work.

159
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:40.370
Yup.

160
00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:41.630
And there we go.

161
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:43.970
We've got to offer a blog that's going to change shortly.

162
00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:47.660
Once we do that gradient, H2 is going to have the color of triple three.

163
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:58.970
It's like a dark gray font size 2.5 rim font weight 800 margin bottom is going to be on RAM and watch.

164
00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:05.870
This transition is going to be Bar Dash Dash Transition dir.

165
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:11.720
And I just realized looking at my reference sheet, we don't actually have margin, bottom or transition

166
00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:12.380
and H1.

167
00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:13.320
I just got confused there.

168
00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.480
So each one is simpler.

169
00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.160
H2 has a couple of extra styles.

170
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:22.490
It's got two h three color is going to be triple three font size, it's going to be two ram font weight

171
00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:28.580
800 and margin bottom, let's say zero point nine RAM.

172
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:32.120
Now you notice here that we use the font weight.

173
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:35.660
A couple of times, a few times, actually.

174
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:40.310
So let's do this H1, H2, H3, font weight 800.

175
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.710
And we'll take font weight out for each of these.

176
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:44.270
So don't declare it every single time.

177
00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:45.470
Perfect.

178
00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.270
And then we've got triple three.

179
00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.720
Let's make that a variable color dark.

180
00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:58.250
OK, and then color light after you have two, you have to save now whenever we use this.

181
00:10:58.730 --> 00:10:59.750
Let's just make them variables.

182
00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:03.710
So it's easier to change if we ever want to change it, or if you want to change it to your own special

183
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:04.280
styles.

184
00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:05.480
Color light.

185
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.750
OK, and then this was going to be color dark.

186
00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:09.740
Same here.

187
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:16.610
Under our age four, we're going to say font size is going to be one point two.

188
00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.350
Rim font wakes me 700.

189
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.890
Save that.

190
00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:19.340
Check it out.

191
00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:20.450
That's looking better.

192
00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.770
Looking more like we're going for this navigations.

193
00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:25.640
A little bit gnarly.

194
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:26.790
Kind of want to clean that up?

195
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:27.810
Maybe the header, too.

196
00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:31.400
So let's dig into the styles for the for the navigation.

197
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:35.420
I'm going to specify the top nav here in a comment.

198
00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:43.280
Now we're going to do is we're going to say top navigation that's going to be position absolute width

199
00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.330
100 percent.

200
00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:51.240
And then we got mean dash menu, and inside of that, we have a class called navigation.

201
00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:58.730
OK, in that we're actually going to say position static sense, what we're going to do here is turn

202
00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:03.650
this whole thing into dropdowns session static margins zero.

203
00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:04.310
Keep going.

204
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:11.060
We're going to say main dish menu and navigation child selector.

205
00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:20.630
So only the fly the children ally of the navigation position relative or in a float at left margin right.

206
00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:24.080
It's going to be 35 pixels padding.

207
00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:27.680
We're going 35 pixels, zero 15 pixels.

208
00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:32.420
Now, if you're wondering where I'm getting these values, it's because I already know them.

209
00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:39.000
I also have a reference sheet because I can I can see the final result, but it's based off of the design.

210
00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:45.380
So when I designed this and figma, I designed it in a way that, you know, when we coat it up, we

211
00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:47.600
go off of, like, what space do we have?

212
00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:53.300
You know what spaces that I add in between each article and what are the spacing between each list item?

213
00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:56.300
So I'm getting those values from simply my design.

214
00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.550
You know, and it's relative.

215
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:59.450
I'm not real strict.

216
00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:00.940
I don't make my design.

217
00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:03.320
I don't code exactly my design.

218
00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.690
I kind of just design it roughly.

219
00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:11.990
And then as we coat it, I kind of, you know, I'm a little bit more loose with with the with the values

220
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.980
that I use for spacing.

221
00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.320
So if you want more spacing, less spacing, it's up to you.

222
00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:19.220
That's what's nice about this is you could do whatever you want with it.

223
00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:24.260
Now here we're going to say transition all these five hundred milliseconds.

224
00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:27.500
That's because we're going to do a transition when we hover.

225
00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.720
Now we've got to do the background stuff.

226
00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:34.460
So I'm going to copy that in and not background fallbacks, Mars, Typekit, Microsoft and opera.

227
00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:41.150
I believe browsers, that's the fallback for the browsers that don't do cool things and moving on.

228
00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:42.380
Main menu.

229
00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:45.200
Navigation l i.

230
00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:45.680
A.

231
00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:50.810
So all the links within the Ally Font Weight 600.

232
00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:54.770
Copy this here just to speed up some coding.

233
00:13:54.770 --> 00:14:00.740
So we got Eli Childs, Dr. Eli Colon, last child.

234
00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:04.580
So that basically means like last child to the last Eli.

235
00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.380
In this context?

236
00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:07.580
Margin, right?

237
00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:08.360
Zero.

238
00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:08.900
All right.

239
00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:11.270
Let's let's take a look at that and see what happens.

240
00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:12.260
We're we're getting there.

241
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:13.010
We're getting there.

242
00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:19.130
So the next on the stylesheet here is main menu navigation child selector Eli Hover and then child selector

243
00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:20.660
a comma.

244
00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:27.420
So this is a combination selector, main menu navigation ally with the class of current.

245
00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:32.900
So it's a child selector class of current in the child selector, a very, very specific selector.

246
00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:38.500
Opacity is one, and the color is going to be FDA.

247
00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:41.180
Oh, FDA, oh sorry.

248
00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:48.320
00, I keep saying oh for zero FDA, zero zero now that I think is like a pink or yellow, let's check

249
00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:48.560
it out.

250
00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:49.700
Yeah, it's yellow.

251
00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.390
So that's like the current one, what we're going to do.

252
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:59.330
So when you when you hover over an element within that submenu, we want blog or whatever the dropdown

253
00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:00.140
to hover as well.

254
00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:03.080
So you see what you're in contextual styling.

255
00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:08.720
Now I want to make that actual a global variable because we use that yellow throughout.

256
00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:10.100
So let's go up here.

257
00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:17.420
We're going to say color yellow and let's head back down and change that to a variable color yellow.

258
00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:23.300
Next up, we have the main menu navigation allié, so there's a child selectors as well, and we're

259
00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:28.130
going to position relative display block.

260
00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:33.320
We're going to make the color white text align center the line height.

261
00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.420
We're going to be specific and say 30.

262
00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.960
We're going to text transform each link to capitalize.

263
00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:44.060
So they capitalize the first letter with the letter spacing of zero.

264
00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:52.040
We're going to make the opacity one overflow hidden the font weight 400, the font size.

265
00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.600
We're going to be specific as well.

266
00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.550
We could be using our variable.

267
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:57.560
But in this case, let's just make it 16.

268
00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:04.430
And then we're going to transition any of the animations to all five hundred milliseconds with the ease.

269
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:07.160
This one's different than zero point three seconds.

270
00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:12.290
We're just going to say five hundred milliseconds for this animation, for our drop down, you know,

271
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:13.100
submenus.

272
00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.700
Then what we're going to do is we're going to do a combination selector here.

273
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:19.550
Main menu navigation child selector ally.

274
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:28.340
When you hover on it, child selector, a pseudo element after and not width is going to be 22 pixels.

275
00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.320
Now this is what it's looking like so far.

276
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:35.240
When you hover, it goes from white to the yellow in a nice, nice little transition animation.

277
00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:39.230
And we've got our dropdown here, which isn't doing anything yet, but we'll get to it.

278
00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:41.120
But what's bugging me now is everything's white here.

279
00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.560
It's hard to see see this text.

280
00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:47.390
So we're just going to kind of skip forward a bit and we'll keep going with the main menu and our next

281
00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:47.780
video.

282
00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:53.740
But let's just do the background there so that we can see, you know, our section are, you know,

283
00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:57.230
so we can see the main menu as we style it and then wrap this video up.

284
00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:02.820
So just for now, we're going to say more nav styles to come.

285
00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:06.560
And for now, let's just move on to like that title.

286
00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:13.880
Banner section, make it look a little bit nicer and have the class of Title Dash banner and we're going

287
00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:17.030
to make the padding 120 pixels and zero.

288
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:18.800
So top and bottom is 120.

289
00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:20.120
Left and right is zero.

290
00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:21.780
And now we're going to do a background.

291
00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:27.050
The linear gradient of I mean, this is really specific one to one point two degrees.

292
00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:30.370
That's just the the value I got from Figma.

293
00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:34.050
You could just say 100 degrees if you really want doesn't have to be that specific.

294
00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:42.170
And then EF five zero zero five seven at zero percent all the way to B-BBEE six b d nine to 100 percent

295
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:44.600
on a 100 degree angle.

296
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:52.460
We'll do one more thing here tidal banner subtitle selector and the color is going to be.

297
00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:59.110
F to C nine, four C, and that's it for the title banner.

298
00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:03.340
Let's see how that makes it look at so a lot nicer, as you can see there.

299
00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:09.370
You could play with the the gradient angle if you want, as well as this one hundred degrees, you change

300
00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:10.150
it to 120.

301
00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.490
See the gradient slightly changes angles.

302
00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:14.270
It's kind of hard to see there, but you get the idea.

303
00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:19.810
We did the nav with some basic styling here did a lot of work to kind of get a little bit further.

304
00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:23.680
But in our next video, we're going to keep going with this menu to make it look a lot better and make

305
00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.220
it work.

306
00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:24.700
All right.

307
00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:25.090
See there.
