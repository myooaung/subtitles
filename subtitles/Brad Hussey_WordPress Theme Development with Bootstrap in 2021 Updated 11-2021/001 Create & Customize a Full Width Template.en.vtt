00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.640
Hello, welcome back to Boost Your Income
with Boostrap WordPress!

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.920
This week we're gonna code a full width
template so we can make a contact page.

3
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.520
Those are important, right?

4
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:17.034
Yeah.
[MUSIC]

5
00:00:17.034 --> 00:00:21.090
Hey, now we need to make our full
width template for the contact page.

6
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.280
So that's pretty easy, straightforward.

7
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.090
So back to our WordPress site here.

8
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.560
We're gonna need to do is first create a
new page, and we're gonna call it Contact.

9
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.210
And just go ahead and
publish that for now, and

10
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.250
then we're gonna create a template
that we can choose here.

11
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.490
For this template, for this page.

12
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.870
Head back to your code editor and
create a New File and

13
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.298
call it page-fullwidth.php.

14
00:00:47.298 --> 00:00:48.715
Open that up.

15
00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:52.457
We're gonna start you off here by,

16
00:00:52.457 --> 00:00:58.193
opening up a PHP script,
closing that off right here,

17
00:00:58.193 --> 00:01:02.931
and then in here we need
to make sure to display

18
00:01:02.931 --> 00:01:08.567
the Template Name and
that is Full-width Template.

19
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.070
So word press can grab that and
display it on the front end of our editor.

20
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.070
And then we need to get_header,
because that's important.

21
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.370
And then down here we need to go ahead and
get_footer.

22
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.410
Great, so that's the basis of our
template, and we need to just grab our,

23
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.760
well let's go to our static site and
grab the contact HTML.

24
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.440
So all I need to grab is the container,
and the information within here,

25
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.770
and that's it, and then go back
to full width page, paste, and

26
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.070
then we're just gonna do some clean up,
because we don't need all of this stuff.

27
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.570
So for the first part, we're going
to want to grab the feature image,

28
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.170
and we don't actually have
it in our mark up here.

29
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.650
So we need to go back to our contact here
and grab that feature image, there we go.

30
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.610
Make sure that feature image is
right here at the very top and

31
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.850
here we're just going to make
sure that this is dynamic.

32
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.629
We're gonna check before anything else,

33
00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:18.370
php if has_post_thumbnail.

34
00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.350
We know how to do that.

35
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.077
Great.
And

36
00:02:21.077 --> 00:02:24.633
then we're gonna have
an else after this php, else.

37
00:02:24.633 --> 00:02:28.390
We'll make sure to close that and
then open it back up again.

38
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.310
And we're gonna say this
is the fallback image.

39
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.660
We're gonna want the featured image and
we wanna be able to have a fallback image

40
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.700
should they decide not to
upload the featured image.

41
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.870
So copy this again, paste it in here.

42
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.624
So what we wanna do now is make this
dynamic, so we're gonna do what we did

43
00:02:47.624 --> 00:02:52.883
before where we put an inline, well a
style in the section tag as an attribute.

44
00:02:52.883 --> 00:02:58.673
And it's pretty straightforward, we
just need to grab the attachment URL for

45
00:02:58.673 --> 00:03:03.070
the specific feature image that
was uploaded to this page.

46
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.960
So let's do it up here.

47
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.030
We're gonna get a thumbnail URL.

48
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.630
Now, we do that as
WordPress-get-attachment.

49
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.570
Sorry, not dash,
underscore WordPress_get_attachment URL.

50
00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.486
And in here we need to get_post_thumbnail

51
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.870
ID in there, post ID.

52
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.220
And that should get us what
we need in that variable.

53
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.833
And then down here,
we just need to after our well,

54
00:03:41.833 --> 00:03:43.998
let's just put it after our class.

55
00:03:43.998 --> 00:03:49.406
Style and in the style we just have

56
00:03:49.406 --> 00:03:54.073
to say, background:url.

57
00:03:54.073 --> 00:03:58.740
In our strings, single strings cuz
we're already inside double strings,

58
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.575
php echo, and then the variable,

59
00:04:05.575 --> 00:04:10.380
thumbnail_url.

60
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.602
And that should be it.

61
00:04:16.263 --> 00:04:19.306
No repeat that's important and

62
00:04:19.306 --> 00:04:25.730
then we're gonna say background
size cover and that is all.

63
00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.180
Okay.
And then here, this is actually gonna be

64
00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.480
the title php the_title with that php tag.

65
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.325
And then down here,
we're just going to leave this as is,

66
00:04:35.325 --> 00:04:40.630
cuz it it's a fall back image,
except we're gonna have php the_title.

67
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:41.900
Great.
And then down here,

68
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.310
we just need to make this dynamic.

69
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.680
Pretty straight forward.

70
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.010
We're going to take everything outside of,
or inside of main content.

71
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.680
So we're gonna get rid of
everything inside of main content.

72
00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.340
Cuz that will be dynamic,
using plug ins and such.

73
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.831
Except right here,
we need to be able to grab the post.

74
00:05:07.831 --> 00:05:10.870
So php we're gonna set a while loop here.

75
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.821
And this will be while have posts.

76
00:05:19.393 --> 00:05:26.140
And then this would just be the post,
we've done this many times before.

77
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.970
You can copy and paste it from
the other templates we've done or

78
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.000
feel free to hand code it with me.

79
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.630
This is the end of the loop.

80
00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:36.130
Great.

81
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.920
And then in here, we need to just put the
content, cuz that's what's gonna go there.

82
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.270
And make sure that has an underscore.

83
00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.140
There we go.

84
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.310
And that should be everything.

85
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.920
Let's make sure container, row, content.

86
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.840
And then we have our section,
close the section,

87
00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:02.381
close content, close the row,
and then the container.

88
00:06:02.381 --> 00:06:07.730
Save that and
let's go back and refresh this

89
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:13.140
contact page, choose the template,
forward the template, update.

90
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.850
And view that page and
see if it is looking like it should.

91
00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.580
Pretty much,
we just don't have the content.

92
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.810
So what does the content say here?

93
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.490
Have any questions with the course?

94
00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:24.450
Copy that.

95
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:27.020
Paste it in here.

96
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.510
Give it an update.

97
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:30.360
See what it looks like.

98
00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.010
There's the text.

99
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.555
It's just small paragraph.

100
00:06:34.555 --> 00:06:37.220
The way to fix that is
to make it a lead text.

101
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:42.685
And in WordPress, you can actually click
text and edit as HTML, right here.

102
00:06:42.685 --> 00:06:46.466
So we're just going to say paragraph,
class of lead and

103
00:06:46.466 --> 00:06:50.980
then close that paragraph tag, and
then you can go back to visual.

104
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:55.630
Update, refresh that contact.

105
00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:57.840
And there you go.

106
00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.010
And one quick note about
the text tab here.

107
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:00.760
It is there for

108
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.530
your convenience to be able to
update any certain mark up in HTML.

109
00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.390
Sometimes HTML gets added in there by
accident, you wanna get rid of it.

110
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:09.560
Here is where you can do that.

111
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.360
For any editors, like your client
who maybe they don't know HTML,

112
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.560
try to avoid doing things that requires
them to do anything in the text editor,

113
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.420
the text tab, because you need
to know HTML, and you can really

114
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:29.310
break something unless you are advanced
and skilled like you my friend.

115
00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.040
There's the Contact page.

116
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.870
Now, all we need to do
is add the contact form.

117
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.020
And we're gonna use a really cool plugin.

118
00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.230
I'm gonna show you that
in the next lecture.
