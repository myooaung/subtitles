Hey guys, welcome back to Boost Your
Income with Bootstrap for WordPress.

2
00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.938
In this lecture I'm gonna show you
how to install WordPress like a pro.

3
00:00:06.938 --> 00:00:09.504
She ma.

4
00:00:09.504 --> 00:00:17.658
[MUSIC]

5
00:00:17.658 --> 00:00:21.600
So, here we are in our C panel and we're
going to install WordPress like a pro.

6
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.750
What is like a pro?

7
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.510
Well, professionals install
WordPress efficiently,

8
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.530
and make sure of the security, and
they don't want to waste time.

9
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.300
So there are a couple ways of doing that.

10
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.400
I touched on them in the previous lecture.

11
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.460
You can do that using the WordPress Wizard
and install WordPress pretty quickly, or

12
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.770
you can use database tools.

13
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.680
You use MySQL and PHP MyAdmin,

14
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.450
much like the way we did it when
we installed WordPress locally.

15
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.010
But what we're going to do,
because it's efficient, is use

16
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.350
in the home setting here under
website Install WordPress.

17
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.400
Let's go in here and make sure we
can install WordPress efficiently

18
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.730
in a timely manner and with security.

19
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.570
The reason why we're gonna do
this is because it's quick,

20
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.070
it installs WordPress fast.

21
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.220
Should we decide to change our mind and do
it this way with FTP upload the site via

22
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:20.290
FTP, it might take quite a while because
the WordPress package is quite large and

23
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.000
it takes a long time to upload over FTP
depending on your internet connection.

24
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.810
If you have a blazing fast fiber
optic internet connection,

25
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.060
you won't have any problem but
if you have a slow internet connection,

26
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.070
manually uploading WordPress over FTP,
it's going to take you a long time.

27
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.170
When you go this route,
WordPress is installed super fast, and

28
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.930
then all you gotta do is
install your theme in there and

29
00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.350
make sure everything's up to date and
all the settings are correct.

30
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.820
So it's pretty straightforward.

31
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.780
So let's install WordPress.

32
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.030
In here, you need to select which
domain you'd like to install to.

33
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.230
I am going to use
BootstraptoWordPress.com and

34
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.170
I'm going to install it in the root here.

35
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.020
You can choose a directory, if you'd like.

36
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.130
Check the domain,
make sure we're all good.

37
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.240
Now we're going to want
to show advanced options.

38
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.090
So give the site name, menus are named,

39
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.210
this needs to be done correctly the first
time because you can't really change it,

40
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.800
although you can in the database,
but on the front end, you can't.

41
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.310
So choose a good domain username.

42
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.470
I'm gonna say Bootstrap admin and
choose a good password, a nice secure one.

43
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.660
Make sure to automatically create
a new database for this installation.

44
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.070
Go ahead and click that you've
read the terms and conditions,

45
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.150
considering you agreed to them and
hit Install Now.

46
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.730
All right, here we go.

47
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.130
They're setting up WordPress for us.

48
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.070
You could see the progress bar up here,
give you the details, if you want.

49
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.400
This should take a few minutes,
maybe less.

50
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.850
We'll check back here when we're
done installing WordPress.

51
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.190
There we go, the install is complete.

52
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.740
You can hit view credentials to make sure
you have all the right credentials like

53
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.760
your admin, your menus, and your password
but you should know your password.

54
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.920
Then all you need to do is go to
your domain that you installed.

55
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.170
So for
me BootstraptoWordPress.com/WP-admin.

56
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.540
That'll take me to my login screen,
where I'm gonna login with my username and

57
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.930
password, and
here we are in the live dashboard.

58
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.600
Basically, all we need to do
now is install and configure

59
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.030
our custom WordPress theme because right
now, this is all the site looks like and

60
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.350
is not quite the site we're trying to
build, or that we've already built.

61
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.110
So hang in there.

62
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.680
The next lecture, we're gonna install and
configure our custom WordPress theme.

63
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.221
See you there.

64
00:03:39.221 --> 00:03:41.795
