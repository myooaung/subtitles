Hey friends.

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,400
Welcome back to Boost Your Income with
Bootstrap to WordPress with Brad Hussey.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,650
Should I call the course that?

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,460
Maybe too many Bs.

5
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,800
This lecture I want to introduce
you to an amazing plugin called

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,820
Custom Post Types UI.

7
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:16,886
Check it out.

8
00:00:16,886 --> 00:00:25,563

9
00:00:25,563 --> 00:00:30,430
Other amazing plugin for you guys here,
it's free, which is amazing.

10
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:37,570
And the other part is, it's gonna help you
when it comes to creating custom posts.

11
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:38,920
And that's what it's called.

12
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,810
It's called custom post types UI.

13
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,930
Post Types UI and
UI stands for User Interface.

14
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:51,390
And the reason why we're using
this plug-in is it's an admin

15
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,060
user interface for creating custom post
types and custom taxonomies in WordPress.

16
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:00,810
So what that means is over on our left
side, these are called post types,

17
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:05,620
Pages Comments, Posts,
those are posts types.

18
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,490
So on WordPress you are limited to
posting pages and posts and for

19
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:14,400
people who are using WordPress for
the first time as a CMS, they kind of get

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,190
a little worried and think like oh,
this isn't like Drupal or Joomla.

21
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:22,140
Or expression engine where I
can have these advanced and

22
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,390
custom fields that aren't just
limited to blog posts and pages.

23
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:29,270
What if I want to have
things like team members?

24
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,765
What if I want a team member post type.

25
00:01:31,765 --> 00:01:35,155
What if I want a portfolio post type?

26
00:01:35,155 --> 00:01:37,415
And the good news is, you can do that.

27
00:01:37,415 --> 00:01:40,375
And you don't actually need
custom post types UI to do it.

28
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:43,645
You could do it in the back end
programming it using your functions like

29
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,605
PHP file, but that's not what we're
going to be doing in this course.

30
00:01:46,605 --> 00:01:49,395
This course is all about efficiency, and

31
00:01:49,395 --> 00:01:55,640
getting it done efficiently and
quickly and the best possible way.

32
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,490
And now for those of you who want to
learn a little bit more about how you can

33
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,760
hand code and hand program custom
post types, then totally go for it.

34
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,200
I know how to do it and I've used it
a little bit, but in all honesty,

35
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,350
I'm a full-time, paid web developer and

36
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:17,600
I've used custom post types in every
single WordPress site that I build and

37
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,210
I don't hand code them.

38
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,780
It's not efficient.

39
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,670
If I'm just doing it for practice,
then sure, totally, just so

40
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,620
I can get a grasp on how it works.

41
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,760
But if I'm trying to create websites fast,
then I'm not trying to be a hero here.

42
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,410
I don't need to reinvent the wheel.

43
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:37,100
Custom post types creates
a really simple user interface to

44
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,130
add those to your website.

45
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:40,850
So it's great.

46
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,070
So go ahead and
install Custom Post Types UI.

47
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,960
That'll show up down here,
once you activate it.

48
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,770
Here we go.

49
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,530
CPTUI, Custom post types UI.

50
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:56,325
Basically I'll just show you the UI,
you can add a new custom post type.

51
00:02:56,325 --> 00:02:59,320
And here you can create
a post type name like, movie.

52
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,640
The label that'll show up on the side bar,
like movies the singular label movie.

53
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,630
So, basically,
you need to add all this information so

54
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:10,260
that it creates a custom post type,
and then you can go ahead and

55
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,630
see in the sidebar your
new custom post type.

56
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:19,340
And then, what you will do is hook
that in with advanced custom fields

57
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,800
to have your own custom field.

58
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,940
So if you had a movie custom post type,

59
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,640
you'd wanna have something like movie
title, movie rating, movie description,

60
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,500
movie link, link to download,
things like that.

61
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,590
And then you do that with
advanced custom fields.

62
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,710
So when you use custom post types and

63
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,580
advanced custom fields together,
you're literally unstoppable.

64
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:43,080
You can create whatever you want in
WordPress, and that's why I'm so

65
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,650
excited to show you this next lecture.

66
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:48,230
So, hang in there.
