Hey, friend, welcome back.

2
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.360
One thing you need to make sure to do before you deploy any code is to just validate make sure things

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:06.810
are good.

4
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.650
Sometimes we can make a little mistake and our code editor might not let us know.

5
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.620
Some code editors don't even tell you if you've made a mistake.

6
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.790
And I know one Adam.

7
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.120
We can install some plug ins and packages and stuff to maybe validate or code.

8
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.000
But here's a little trick that I like to do just to quickly format and make sure that my code is valid.

9
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.150
Simply go to code Pendejo and just create a new pen.

10
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.990
It's free.

11
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.680
You can sign up for a free account, or you can just quickly just start coding.

12
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.580
And this is what I do often is I'll just grab my code.

13
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.350
So here's my HTML and my index file.

14
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.640
I'm going to paste it in HTML and under here under the little gear icon.

15
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.650
Sorry, rather the little dropdown.

16
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.420
You can format the HTML to make sure everything is indented and tabbed properly.

17
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.760
And you can also analyze the HTML for any issues, and it will analyze it and show you if there's any

18
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.180
problems.

19
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.960
And I see one here.

20
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.860
It's a special.

21
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.000
Characters must be escaped.

22
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.910
And so it's referencing the greater than sign we put here because in the interface font, as you probably

23
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.980
recall, this will generate it will automatically look for this and create a nice arrow now in each

24
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.420
HTML.

25
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.020
This could create some problems.

26
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.010
It looks like we, you know, our we mistakenly haven't closed the tag or something like that, and

27
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.520
most browsers will probably just deal with this.

28
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.740
But in some cases it might actually create an issue.

29
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.980
So if we go back to our code editor, we can search and replace these greater than signs with the actual

30
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.660
HTML entity greater then.

31
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.740
So just find that instance of the dash and the greater than sign and just put a dash and then ampersand

32
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.100
semicolon and replace all of those.

33
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.660
Now, that might have been a bad idea, because we do have a greater than sign in our comment, and

34
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.330
so it's basically just director comment, so undo that.

35
00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:02.070
And instead of search and replacing everything, we're just going to find the instances where we do

36
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.870
this in this area so we can just manually replace those.

37
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.290
Or if you did still want to find and replace, you could find it more specifically because by choosing

38
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.590
the.

39
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.100
Basically, it's right before the closing tag, so we can select that and know that it's only going

40
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.560
to select these four here.

41
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:31.710
So if I do that and then paste it here, but replace this greater than sign with Ampersand GTI Semicolon

42
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.310
and leave the closing tag that should solve the problem.

43
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.830
So if we save that, it should still work.

44
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.740
Yes, you could see that it still works totally fine.

45
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.590
It still generates the proper arrow.

46
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.430
But now we should recheck in Code Pen.

47
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.030
And it probably won't give us any issues.

48
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:52.050
All right.

49
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.320
So it's not giving us issues for the greater than sign anymore.

50
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.260
But now we're saying do not mix tabs in spaces for indentation.

51
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.630
So we really wanted to fix that.

52
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:08.060
What we can do is maybe go for manage HTML and then analyze again couldn't find any error.

53
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.350
So now we can copy this, paste it back in our editor and we know that now this is fully valid.

54
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.250
HTML Now we'll do the same thing for the widgets that each HTML.

55
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.300
I'm going to copy all of that.

56
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.440
Paste it in here.

57
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.670
I'm going to format and then I'm going to analyze, see if there's any issues.

58
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.690
And we do have that greater than issue again.

59
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.830
So what we'll do is we'll go back here and I believe that is right before closing a tag.

60
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:33.690
So we'll do the same thing.

61
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:34.510
Just find replace.

62
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.100
And there we go.

63
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.760
It's done that.

64
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.900
Copy this.

65
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.490
Replace it back in here.

66
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.940
Analyze, we've got the tabs and spaces issue, so let's just format perfect.

67
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.490
So now we've got validated HTML for the widgets that.

68
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.570
We can do the same thing for our styles.

69
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.820
So we just copy our styles.

70
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.750
So in style, that's easy.

71
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.710
Head over to Code Pen and we can paste it in the CC.

72
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.170
And what we'll do is we will.

73
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.890
Analyze or see us for any issues and see if anything comes up, it looks like something came up here.

74
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.150
Unexpected?

75
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:11.250
Unknown.

76
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.020
Property color.

77
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.540
Oh, so I didn't realize that we actually have a typo, so let's fix that.

78
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.240
See if there's any other issues.

79
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.870
Well, scroll through, look for any red kind of alert banners.

80
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.830
It looks like everything is really good, so we'll clean up this white space at the bottom.

81
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.900
I'll format the CSC.

82
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.010
Copy it.

83
00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.090
Paste it back in here.

84
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.590
And now we have fully valid CC.

85
00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.120
And finally, we could do the same thing with our JavaScript.

86
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:47.120
So copy our jQuery here and paste it in the jazz section of Code Pen.

87
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.690
And you can do things like jQuery.

88
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.420
And then what we can do is then analyze jQuery.

89
00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.420
Apparently, we're missing a semicolon right here.

90
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.500
OK?

91
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.090
After the dropdown button.

92
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.090
Anything else we now analyze again?

93
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:06.230
Perfect.

94
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.570
We can format copy that.

95
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.130
Put it back in our main script.

96
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:11.270
Save.

97
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.920
Now we know that our HTML, CSS and JavaScript are fully valid.
