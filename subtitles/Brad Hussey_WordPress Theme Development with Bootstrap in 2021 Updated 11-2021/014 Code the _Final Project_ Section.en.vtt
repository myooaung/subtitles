00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.396
Oh hey, everybody welcome back to Boost
Your Income with Bootstrap to WordPress

2
00:00:04.396 --> 00:00:07.090
this lecture is called Code
the Project Features Section.

3
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:14.670
[MUSIC]

4
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:15.510
Sorry about that.

5
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.520
All right everybody, welcome back
this is going to be an easy lecture.

6
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.770
It's just gonna be coding this
Final Project Feature section right here.

7
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.060
Very simple, just some text.

8
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.020
We're gonna use the same concepts
we've used in the past few lectures.

9
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.210
Just a few extra graphics here,
nothing crazy special.

10
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.090
But worth it, so let's do it.

11
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.520
Jump in your code editor, scroll down to
the PROJECT FEATURE section that you set

12
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.200
up here in your index.html file.

13
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.020
Let's do this,
we're gonna start off as usual.

14
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.292
Give that an ID of project-features.

15
00:00:48.292 --> 00:00:52.270
We're gonna add a little
comment at the bottom here, so

16
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.532
we know where our section ends.

17
00:00:55.532 --> 00:01:00.740
We're gonna give a div with a class of
container, why you should know why?

18
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.770
And inside here, we're gonna start off
with something a little bit different.

19
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.950
Usually, we will add a section
header as you could see up here.

20
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.110
Because the section header,
we have it styled so

21
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.550
that it's always text align center.

22
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.900
But the difference between this section,
the project feature section and

23
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.920
the other sections is the entire
section is text align center.

24
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.370
Not just the header, like up here.

25
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.760
We have everything text align center.

26
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.920
So instead of just having extra mark up,
and

27
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.380
have this be a section header,
why not even add the section header and

28
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.500
just have the whole project features
section be text align center.

29
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.840
No that's what we're going to do.

30
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.780
If you were curious.

31
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.900
So we are just gonna jump
right in to level two heading.

32
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.760
Final project features.

33
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.170
And below that, we're gonna have
a paragraph with a class of lead.

34
00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.050
See what I did there?

35
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.320
I have a little plugin in my
coda to I want to show you.

36
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.240
I'm excited about this one.

37
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.220
Plugins, Emmet.

38
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.078
It's called Emmet.

39
00:02:06.078 --> 00:02:10.090
And it let's you do
a bunch of code boosting,

40
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.570
I would think, I'd like to call it.

41
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.760
It kind of supercharges your coding,
your HTML on your CSS.

42
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.860
So you could just put abbreviations, and

43
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.520
you can expand them with just
a couple keyboard shortcuts.

44
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.525
So instead of me writing this out,

45
00:02:24.525 --> 00:02:30.130
look at how long this is gonna take
[SOUND] too long, way too long.

46
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.090
What was that, five seconds?

47
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.910
Check this out, ready?

48
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.834
[SOUND] Oh, done.

49
00:02:35.834 --> 00:02:36.714
See?

50
00:02:36.714 --> 00:02:39.460
Cool, so paragraph class of lead.

51
00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.980
See that?

52
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:40.860
Boom.

53
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.470
So in here,
we're just gonna add some text.

54
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.544
You should have the copy that I've
provided in the course files section,

55
00:02:46.544 --> 00:02:49.050
should be in section D
under Miscellaneous.

56
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.550
Copydoc, you could just copy the text and
just paste it in.

57
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.112
So couple, basic formatting things
in here, like a strong tag and

58
00:02:56.112 --> 00:02:59.880
an emphasis tag, you can go ahead and
play around with that yourself.

59
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.525
Again, the copy isn't the important
part of this course, it is

60
00:03:03.525 --> 00:03:08.130
learning how to code, learning how to do
WordPress, and making money doing it.

61
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.120
Okay, here we go.

62
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.590
Next up, we have a div the class of row.

63
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.300
Watch this.

64
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.220
Row, boom.

65
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.250
Div the class of row.

66
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.080
And in here we're gonna have call,
small, four.

67
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.530
Do you see how fast that was?

68
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:25.220
That's amazing.

69
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.260
So I hope you're using quota too,
because then you can keep up with me.

70
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.190
I've had a lot of people be like whoa,
Brad, you're so fast.

71
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.850
I like it and hate it at the same time.

72
00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:35.980
I think it's just my style.

73
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:36.940
I like coding fast.

74
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.070
I know you're trying to learn from me, and

75
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.360
if you're trying to keep up,
sorry about that.

76
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.560
But that's why you have a pause button.

77
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.750
And if you have Coda,
you could probably keep up with me.

78
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.110
So I'll try and slow certain things down,
but certain things I'm gonna be ruthless,

79
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.170
and I'm just gonna be as
fast as I possibly can.

80
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.925
And just make you sweat.

81
00:03:55.925 --> 00:03:58.560
Cuz that's how I like to do it, row, boom.

82
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.540
Check this out, col boom,
small forward, done.

83
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.140
Look how much I just coded.

84
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.030
Sorry about that, I'm getting excited.

85
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.530
All right.

86
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.861
So inside your col small four,

87
00:04:09.861 --> 00:04:14.404
you're gonna have an image source assets,

88
00:04:14.404 --> 00:04:20.560
img/icon-design.png alt and
this will just be design.

89
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.415
And then a level three heading,
we're gonna say,

90
00:04:27.415 --> 00:04:31.330
sexy ampersand Modern Design
why ampersand?

91
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.620
Why this HTML entity?

92
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.760
Because if you just put the actual
ampersand, it's not good coding practice

93
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.470
because sometimes your browser can't read
that and will just put some funky text.

94
00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.120
So this encodes that to the HTML entity,
so it can read it properly.

95
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.850
If you don't fully understand why,
take my HTML TSS course, and

96
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.290
I tell you all about it.

97
00:04:53.290 --> 00:05:00.596
All right, in this part is you
get to work with a modern,

98
00:05:00.596 --> 00:05:07.130
professional quality
design ampersand layout.

99
00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.550
All right, and
then that's the end of that column.

100
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.450
So now, all you're gonna have
to do is just copy this column.

101
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:20.136
Paste it a couple more times,
cuz we have 4, 8, 12 equals 12.

102
00:05:20.136 --> 00:05:22.045
3, 4s is 12, and so

103
00:05:22.045 --> 00:05:27.586
3 then means there's gonna be
technically 3 columns side by side.

104
00:05:27.586 --> 00:05:31.080
And in here we're gonna
change this to icon code and

105
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.818
this one will say code instead
of design and then here,

106
00:05:34.818 --> 00:05:39.380
I'm just gonna do some copying and
pasting to save me some typing.

107
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.190
Quality HTML5 and CSS3, and
then the text will be, you'll learn how

108
00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:52.548
to hand-craft a stunning website with
valid, semantic and beautiful HTML5, CSS3.

109
00:05:52.548 --> 00:05:54.750
Ain't that right?

110
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.305
And the last one will be,
easy to use CMS because we

111
00:05:59.305 --> 00:06:03.660
are gonna be learning to
code a WordPress site.

112
00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.210
Allow your clients to easily update their
websites by converting your static website

113
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.140
to dynamic websites using WordPress.

114
00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.690
Cool.

115
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:14.440
Save that section,
check it out and your work.

116
00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:16.460
Let's see here.

117
00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.530
Final Project Features.

118
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:19.660
Hey, it's looking pretty close.

119
00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:20.739
Let's look at the final site.

120
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.570
You see the difference?

121
00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:23.320
It is centered.

122
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.580
So very easy.

123
00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.360
Go to your CSS, and
here in your layout section.

124
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.006
Let's put it under your course features.

125
00:06:31.006 --> 00:06:36.644
Let's go project-features

126
00:06:36.644 --> 00:06:40.680
text align center.

127
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.640
And that's it.

128
00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:42.870
Save it, check it out.

129
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:46.750
Boom, there it is.

130
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:47.480
All right.

131
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.140
Hang in there.

132
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.330
Don't go anywhere because
in the next lecture,

133
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:55.080
we're gonna jump right into the following
section, which is the course introduction.

134
00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.360
Never mind about the broken video here.

135
00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.270
We'll fix that with our little
semi-parallax background

136
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.500
here in the background.

137
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.670
All right.
See you there, friends.

138
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:07.319
