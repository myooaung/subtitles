5
00:00:21,372 --> 00:00:24,790
All right, let me tell you the difference
between static and dynamic websites.

6
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:27,973
You probably already know the difference,
but if not let me clear it up for you.

7
00:00:27,973 --> 00:00:32,605
Static websites are basically
brochure websites.

8
00:00:32,605 --> 00:00:35,631
They're coded in HTML, CSS,
they're just hard coded,

9
00:00:35,631 --> 00:00:37,683
there's nothing dynamic about them.

10
00:00:37,683 --> 00:00:43,138
They're .HTML pages using
CSS to style the website.

11
00:00:43,138 --> 00:00:47,728
You have hard-coded text it's
literally typed in your code editor,

12
00:00:47,728 --> 00:00:51,793
saved in an HTML file,
thrown up on a website that's static.

13
00:00:51,793 --> 00:00:56,640
Static means it is still nothing changes
about it, unless you manually change it.

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,445
Dynamic on the other hand is something
that's living, and breathing.

15
00:01:01,445 --> 00:01:06,288
The information is pulled from a database
that's is updated by a user whether

16
00:01:06,288 --> 00:01:10,161
it's yourself, or
your client,or a friend, a colleague,

17
00:01:10,161 --> 00:01:13,510
team member it's living, and breathing.

18
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:19,134
It can auto update itself depending
on the type of programming

19
00:01:19,134 --> 00:01:23,687
language you use, and
it's a lot more valuable.

20
00:01:23,687 --> 00:01:28,687
Static websites, if you deliver that to
a client you need to keep updating that

21
00:01:28,687 --> 00:01:33,430
yourself, your client can't have
the convenience of doing that.

22
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,194
Dynamic websites,
your client can update those,

23
00:01:36,194 --> 00:01:40,577
because it's using a Content Management
System that's incredibly valuable.

24
00:01:40,577 --> 00:01:45,099
Your client will see way more
value in that, and it's better for

25
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:47,620
you because you can charge higher.

26
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,919
Also there are certain things that
static websites simply can not do,

27
00:01:51,919 --> 00:01:52,800
it's impossible.

28
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,757
For example Facebook,
that's fully dynamic there's no way that

29
00:01:57,757 --> 00:02:03,130
there's a team of 1000 developers
always updating the website.

30
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:07,030
You can't do that, plus you're the one
updating your status, or adding pictures.

31
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:11,962
It's impossible for a developer at
Facebook to magically know what you

32
00:02:11,962 --> 00:02:15,509
just added, and
then quickly create an HTML page.

33
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:20,210
It doesn't work like that that's
impossible, that's why its dynamic.

34
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,784
So dynamic websites are way more
valuable than static websites, so

35
00:02:23,784 --> 00:02:25,798
you're gonna wanna know how to do it.

36
00:02:25,798 --> 00:02:29,890
All right, now that we've covered why
you should be learning Bootstrap, and

37
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:30,580
WordPress.

38
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:35,701
And how using them can significantly
increase your efficiency in your business,

39
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:38,298
and increase your income.

40
00:02:38,298 --> 00:02:41,036
Let's jump into a totally new section, and

41
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:45,620
start getting into more of the details
of developing our website.

42
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,935
So the next step is
Information Architecture, and

43
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:52,571
why you must start your website
with a sketch see there.

44
00:02:52,571 --> 00:02:55,979
