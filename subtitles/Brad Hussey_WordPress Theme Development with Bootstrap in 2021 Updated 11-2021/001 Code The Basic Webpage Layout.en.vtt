00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.510
Hey, everyone, welcome back to Boost
Your Income with Bootstrap to WordPress.

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.099
We're entering another new section
here call Bootstrap Templates.

3
00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:11.740
This lecture is called Coding
the Basic Webpage Layout.

4
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:19.940
[MUSIC]

5
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.390
Okay, so what you're gonna want to do now
is open up your code editor of choice.

6
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.880
Mine, as always, is Coda 2.

7
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.230
If you are a regular student of mine,
you will know that I sing its praises

8
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.590
regularly because it saves me hours of
time and therefore it saves me hundreds,

9
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.130
if not thousands of dollars
by this point in my career.

10
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.430
I use it daily, I use it hourly.

11
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.330
It makes me money and it saves me money.

12
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.910
It is an amazing code editor.

13
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:46.720
If you are using a Mac,

14
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.440
i highly suggest it, you can check
it out at bradhussey.ca/coda2.

15
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.490
Otherwise, if you are on a PC if
you have a code editor of choice,

16
00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.590
you can go ahead and open that up.

17
00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.620
One that I recommend is Notepad++.

18
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.860
There are a few other ones as well.

19
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.699
And for
Mac there are other free options as well,

20
00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.480
like TextWrangler and
other things like that.

21
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.652
So open up your code editor and
make sure to open up your B2W folder and

22
00:01:11.652 --> 00:01:13.890
your code editor right here.

23
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.070
I have it queued up, B2W, and

24
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.000
you'll see here that I've already
created an index.html file.

25
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.320
Go ahead and do that,
and open up that file.

26
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.740
And right here we're gonna start
coding our basic HTML layout.

27
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.720
The first thing in any HTML file is the
doctype and because we're gonna be using

28
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.260
HTML5, the doctype is very simple and
looks like this.

29
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.160
Perfect.

30
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.999
All right, if you're using Coda 2 you can
use a few keyboard shortcuts to speed

31
00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.810
up your coding.

32
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.491
Like I said, I use Coda 2 because it
helps me save time with typing and

33
00:01:44.491 --> 00:01:48.149
writing the same things over and
over and over again.

34
00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.290
So bear with me with the speed of this.

35
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.630
You can go ahead and pause.

36
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.580
That's what's great about this,
we're using video.

37
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.600
Go ahead and pause if you can't keep up.

38
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.710
If you're using Coda 2, then follow
along like the ninja that you are.

39
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.470
Basic page.

40
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.660
Boom, there it is.

41
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.920
So we have our HTML, head and
body, so basic HTML layout.

42
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.300
Right here, let's just write out
Bootstrap to WordPress in our title.

43
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:22.270
And within our head, we're just gonna add
a few meta tags and things like that.

44
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.540
Because we're gonna be utilizing them
once we turn this into a WordPress site.

45
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.580
Okay, so let's just add them
up here at the very top.

46
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.730
Meta, http equiv equals content-type.

47
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.905
And then content, text, HTML.

48
00:02:39.905 --> 00:02:44.729
Charset equals

49
00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:49.190
UTF dash eight.

50
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.790
This is just basically
just giving the browser

51
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.530
some extra information about our webpage
and the content that we're serving up.

52
00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.510
If you want to research these,
no problem, go ahead.

53
00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.780
But otherwise just add them in.

54
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.990
It's all good.
It won't hurt if you don't add them,

55
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.396
but it's always nice to add them.

56
00:03:08.396 --> 00:03:10.428
All right.

57
00:03:10.428 --> 00:03:14.919
Meta, name, viewport.

58
00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:19.929
And the content of this will be width

59
00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:28.119
equals device dash width comma
initial scale equals one.

60
00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:34.178
Okay so that meta tag is for the viewport
so when we make this responsive this

61
00:03:34.178 --> 00:03:39.190
will tell the mobile devices the width and
the initial scale.

62
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.940
Meta name, description, content,
leave this one empty because we're going

63
00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.880
to be updating this dynamically
in WordPress when we get there.

64
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.520
Next one meta name.

65
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.380
Whoops.

66
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.534
Meta name author.

67
00:03:57.534 --> 00:04:01.210
Content same,
this will be updated in the WordPress.

68
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.782
We are going to add a link tag for

69
00:04:05.782 --> 00:04:09.990
our rel icon, this is for

70
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:15.140
our faicon we'll add
this a little bit later,

71
00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:21.640
unless in our assets folder
we already have our favicon.

72
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.601
There it is.
Okay, so all we'll need to do here is just

73
00:04:25.601 --> 00:04:28.860
say assets/img/favicon.ico.

74
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:36.260
So that will give us the little favicon
graphic in the address bar of our browser,

75
00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:42.100
or when you bookmark
the webpage on your browser.

76
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.285
We already have title, and

77
00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:49.999
then let's add HTML5 shiv respond JS.

78
00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:55.220
So those things are basically,
let me explain them here.

79
00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.143
HTML 5 shiv and respond JS basically
gives IE 8 support of HTML5 elements and

80
00:05:00.143 --> 00:05:04.210
media queries which we will
be using with Bootstrap.

81
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.670
It's going to tab this in here.

82
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:10.060
So right here this is a conditional
comment for Internet Explorer nine.

83
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.240
It's basically an HTML5 comment that
only Internet Explorer can read because

84
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.490
Internet Explorer sucks.

85
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.250
Just to put it nice and simple.

86
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.420
If less than IE 9.

87
00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:26.600
So this is saying okay IE nine and
up, they're okay.

88
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.160
Don't use this.

89
00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.020
But if you're less than IE nine it's
going to serve up a couple scripts here.

90
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.620
So script source is the html5shiv.

91
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.320
JS here, and the respond JS.

92
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.300
So this will just help IE 8
have support of HTML5 elements.

93
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.970
So, go ahead and pause the video if
you haven't already typed this out and

94
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.100
add that in there.

95
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.940
Otherwise you can open up the course files
and open up the index file and check out

96
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.406
the head and then just copy this section
out to make sure you don't have any typos.

97
00:05:58.406 --> 00:06:00.462
All right.

98
00:06:00.462 --> 00:06:02.520
Moving on.

99
00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.430
Down here in our body, this is where
we're going to add a few more things.

100
00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.030
Just some basic webpage layout things.

101
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.530
All right.

102
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.620
So we're gonna add an HTML5 header.

103
00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.030
And we're not going to add
all the content right now,

104
00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:22.030
we're just going to add the markup,
so that we can add the content and

105
00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.880
the rest of the markup a little bit
later in the upcoming lectures.

106
00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:31.788
So we have the header, let's go ahead and,

107
00:06:31.788 --> 00:06:37.790
after that give some space and
we're gonna add a section tag.

108
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.340
And that will be for the hero.

109
00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.940
And I'm just gonna start adding
some HTML comments as well.

110
00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.346
HTML comment looks like this.

111
00:06:47.346 --> 00:06:52.498
Because I'm using Coda,
I have a little comment.

112
00:06:52.498 --> 00:06:57.170
Keyboard shortcut htmlcomment.

113
00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:58.870
Right here, I'm just going to say hero.

114
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.130
So I just have a really clear
html flag to see the sections.

115
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:07.330
It's kind of nice for layout and
for seeing where I am.

116
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:08.810
Organization.

117
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:13.994
All right so, we're gonna go
down to the next section and

118
00:07:13.994 --> 00:07:20.849
that will be our
htmlcomment Opt in section.

119
00:07:22.269 --> 00:07:25.489
And that will also be a section tag.

120
00:07:29.608 --> 00:07:33.755
And after that we have
another html comment and

121
00:07:33.755 --> 00:07:37.700
that will be
the Boost Your Income section.

122
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:44.040
And that would again,
another HTML5 section tag.

123
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:50.809
After that, we have

124
00:07:50.809 --> 00:07:56.435
the Who Benefits section.

125
00:07:56.435 --> 00:08:01.340
Okay.

126
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:06.367
Then we have our

127
00:08:06.367 --> 00:08:15.280
Course Features section.

128
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:23.290
After that we're gonna add
our Project Features section.

129
00:08:30.151 --> 00:08:34.951
Then the Video Featurette section.

130
00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:46.380
Then the Instructor section.

131
00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:58.820
After the Instructor section,
we have a Testimonials section.

132
00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:11.482
After Testimonials,

133
00:09:11.482 --> 00:09:16.120
we have a Sign Up section.

134
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:27.279
After our Sign Up section,

135
00:09:27.279 --> 00:09:31.259
we have the course footer.

136
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:40.164
And that will be in HTML5 footer tag, so

137
00:09:40.164 --> 00:09:43.890
we can be as semantic as possible and

138
00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:48.320
give as much meaning
to our HTML as we can.

139
00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.190
After our footer.

140
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:53.650
So this is the layout for the home page.

141
00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:57.230
It's obviously got a lot of content,
as you've already seen.

142
00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:58.369
We've got a lot of sections.

143
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:05.010
Let's get another HTML5 comment here,
html comment, header, perfect.

144
00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:10.910
At the bottom, after our footer,
we have the pop-up, or modal window.

145
00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:16.610
For those of you who have been following
along for a while, I've had a few students

146
00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:21.540
say hey Brad, you're saying modal wrong,
you're saying 'mo-dal." I don't know if

147
00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:25.570
I have a funny accent or something,
but I used to always call it mo-dal.

148
00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:27.200
Because it just sounds fancier.

149
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:33.330
Modal just sounds sloppy, but I'll
call it modal because I like you guys.

150
00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:34.370
All right.

151
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.030
Htmlcomment.

152
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:38.300
We're gonna add the modal here.

153
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.110
And this is gonna be a div.

154
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:41.960
Just leave that for now.

155
00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.610
We'll fill that in when it comes up.

156
00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:46.050
Let's leave it at that for this lecture.

157
00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:49.094
In the next lecture, we have a couple
more things we have left to do for

158
00:10:49.094 --> 00:10:52.190
this specific file, and then we're
gonna jump into the next part, so

159
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:53.729
I'll see you in the next lecture.

160
00:10:53.729 --> 00:10:57.119
[MUSIC]
