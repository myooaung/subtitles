1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,770
Welcome back, friends, let's take care of this mobile menu navigation thing up here.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,320
All right back in the code editor, we're going to continue here.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,030
And let's start out by styling out the mobile menu.

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,600
That's mobile dash menu class.

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,500
Let's just make sure that's the case over here in our markup in the index card.

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,860
Hey, HTML.

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:21,800
Don't know.

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:22,650
I just did that.

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,300
Where are we?

10
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,890
Menu item is our mobile menu.

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:27,420
There we are.

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,990
Class mobile menu service style.

13
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,160
This baboy parade here could change.

14
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:33,120
All right.

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,740
So mobile menu is the class and we're going to style that up.

16
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:45,750
We're going to start by doing position fixed and it's going to be right zero top zero.

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,800
The width is going to be 300 pixels.

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,980
We're going to do padding right of 30 pixels and max width of 100 percent.

19
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,750
That's for when we view it.

20
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,820
In mobile view, we want the max width to be 100 percent and padding right 30 pixels.

21
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:08,430
Want that height to be 100 percent opacity.

22
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:14,560
To be zero visibility hidden because we don't want to see it right now.

23
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:22,670
And Z index to some really high number like nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine.

24
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:27,010
That many nights and then we're going to do is we're going to say more menu visible.

25
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,750
So this is a class that gets added.

26
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,350
That's going to be overflow hidden.

27
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,010
OK.

28
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,220
Mobile dash menu visible.

29
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,330
So this is when it's added.

30
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:45,700
And then the mobile menu, we're going to say opacity one and visibility visible.

31
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:49,150
Target the mobile menu and menu backdrops.

32
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,940
That's the backdrop that we want to appear.

33
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,790
That's going to be positioned fixed, right?

34
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,200
Zero top zero.

35
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,650
The width and height are both going to be 100 percent.

36
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,430
We want that z index to be one.

37
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:11,980
And then we want the background itself to be R.G. be a so that's the RG B and then a four alpha channel,

38
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,670
zero zero zero and then point nine in the alpha channel.

39
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,220
And then we're going to do a little transform here.

40
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:26,950
So we want Transform Translate X one hundred and one percent and then have the back back ups their web

41
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,570
kit, transform an MMS transform.

42
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:34,540
And then we want transition to be all 0.4 seconds ese.

43
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:39,250
And as I recall, we had a variable for that transition dur.

44
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,480
So let's take care of that.

45
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:47,740
And instead of point four, we're going to use our VAR Dash Dash transition dash dur.

46
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:48,820
You.

47
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,400
He's there.

48
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:58,360
We go back the backups, though the fallback s'mores webcams and oh for transitions and those four seconds

49
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,940
replace those with transition dir.

50
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,760
The way I'll do that is just point four seconds.

51
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,250
Change replace all done.

52
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:14,170
OK, now we want to keep going with this menu backdrop, so probably won't see anything now perfect.

53
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,970
But we want to now target the mobile menu visible.

54
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,370
So that's one that causes added mobile menu.

55
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:28,680
Menu backdrop Inside those styles, we want opacity to be one invisibility to be visible.

56
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:35,140
And we want some transitions, so transition all 0.7 seconds.

57
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,200
So just a little bit longer, maybe we'll check that out after see if it really matters.

58
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:44,410
Maybe we'll go back to our Our Transition dir, but we'll we'll we'll stick with this for now and then

59
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,540
back fallbacks.

60
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:51,530
And then we want the transition itself, all we got, the transition, we want the transform.

61
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,440
To be translate x zero.

62
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,220
So this is where it ends up.

63
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:01,700
Here we go.

64
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,400
And the fallbacks always good to have that.

65
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,400
OK, now we're going to do the mobile menu.

66
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,670
Menu box.

67
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:09,950
So what is that?

68
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,090
Check it out.

69
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,370
Mobile menu.

70
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,480
Menu box.

71
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,770
I don't know if we see that yet.

72
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,900
Probably because we don't have any.

73
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,120
Anything in here yet?

74
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,330
Well, what will get there?

75
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:32,600
This is a style that won't do anything for now, but I presume we're going to be adding that afterwards

76
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,620
with maybe Jake weary.

77
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:42,610
All right, so for the mobile menu menu box, we've got position absolute left, zero top zero width

78
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:48,950
and height or both 100 percent max height, 100 percent overflow.

79
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,060
Why is going to be is 100 percent.

80
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,460
Sorry, I'm an auto.

81
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,110
The background is going to be white.

82
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,490
Or f f f.

83
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,690
Padding is going to be zero Z Index five.

84
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,590
Opacity.

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,430
Let's make that zero visibility hidden.

86
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,500
Border radius.

87
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,040
Zero.

88
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:25,890
And then transform Translate X one hundred and one percent and then Web kit transform it kind of back

89
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,560
fallbacks.

90
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,730
There you go.

91
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:31,750
Now, before we go any further because we're going to be doing a lot of styling where you're not going

92
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,580
to see anything and that's not really that fun.

93
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:41,290
Basically, what's going to happen here is in our navigation and here right now, there's nothing there.

94
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:47,470
There's no elements, there's no navigation whatsoever in our markup, as you can see here in our mobile

95
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:47,830
menu.

96
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,150
We literally have just a shell markup shell and there's nothing there.

97
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,700
There's no navigation.

98
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:59,710
Well, and that's because we don't want to create two separate navigation where there's one code it

99
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,700
up in mobile and one code it up and up.

100
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:06,340
Here in the in the desktop version, we want to use the same one.

101
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:11,080
And that's what's going to ultimately happen in our in our WordPress site.

102
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:17,380
So we're going to use a little jQuery to take what's in this menu to add it into this menu kind of add

103
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,430
into this shell.

104
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,560
So this is the reason why right now you can't see anything.

105
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:28,870
But in our final markup version, you can see here when we go smaller, our hamburger icon appears and

106
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,910
then we've got the same navigation.

107
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:39,270
In our mobile menu that is in our desktop menu, so the desktop menu content simply disappears and finds

108
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,490
its way in here, which is what we're doing.

109
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:49,080
So why don't we maybe play around with a little bit of jQuery and add this in our little mobile menu

110
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,940
so that we maybe have some content to work with?

111
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:51,570
Let's try that.

112
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,400
So in your.

113
00:06:54,570 --> 00:07:00,570
Assets, we have jobs open up, main script, so main script is where we're going to write our jQuery.

114
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,790
And because we have jQuery added into our index and our head, actually no in the foot, in the bottom.

115
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,670
Before the closing body tag, we have j query right here.

116
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,320
That means we can use jQuery.

117
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:19,710
We're going to start it by opening up with function in the parentheses.

118
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,140
Put a dollar sign after that.

119
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:27,060
Make sure this is where you want to make sure you get this code right kind of right out the gate.

120
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,320
Otherwise, you're gonna have some issues.

121
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,110
So this is kind of how you fire up jQuery.

122
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,990
One of many ways there's a few ways of doing it, actually.

123
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,730
This is this way we'll work out here.

124
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:44,850
So in parentheses, you are opening parentheses here, function and then another opening parentheses.

125
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:52,620
Dollar sign closing parentheses and then curly quote our curly bracket.

126
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:54,920
Give it a little space.

127
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,390
Closing curly bracket.

128
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,500
Close parentheses.

129
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,760
Open parentheses.

130
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,230
jQuery close parentheses.

131
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:00,890
Semicolon.

132
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,780
That's how you kind of fire this up.

133
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,540
We're going to tell it to use strict.

134
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,660
And then this is where we are going to get started.

135
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:19,730
This we're going to start writing our jQuery ad. The content of the navigation into the mobile nav,

136
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,610
so let's say.

137
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,110
Mobile nav just.

138
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,640
Go from here, and we'll say, if so, make sure you get this code right.

139
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:36,330
It will be in the final resources if you want to download it and install it and in parentheses here

140
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:42,660
and then in single quotes or double quotes cost mobile dash menu.

141
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:46,860
Then what we want to do is outside of this, select its length.

142
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,690
And then inside of here.

143
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:59,760
We're going to write some stuff, so we're going to establish a variable VAR, call it mobile menu content

144
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,870
like Cell Equals and then we're going to select.

145
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,050
The.

146
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,840
I'd have top dash navigation.

147
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:18,250
And then the class of navigation, and I'm going to grab its HTML.

148
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:25,470
All right, so that variable is going to be there with the HTML of this selector, of that element.

149
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,570
Then we want to select.

150
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:36,230
Mobile menu navigation.

151
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,240
And then we're going to append.

152
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,850
The variable mobile menu content.

153
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:47,720
Make sure that code is right.

154
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,180
After that, we want to.

155
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,360
Select sticky header navigation.

156
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,440
And we want to append.

157
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,840
Mobile menu content.

158
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:19,150
Another line we want to select mobile dash menu, a close button, close dash between.

159
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:27,200
And we want to kind of bind an on function here on Click.

160
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:33,210
So this means on clicking the closed button, we're going to open up the function here.

161
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,580
Whoa.

162
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,760
That's not how I use my function function.

163
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:37,920
OK.

164
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,230
And the function is going to be.

165
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:47,980
Selecting the body tag, remove the class.

166
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:55,690
Mobile dash menu Dash visible.

167
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,460
OK.

168
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:06,680
And then make sure you have that closing semicolon, so be very mindful to make sure that each character

169
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:11,930
is is written properly here because in jQuery and JavaScript, in lots of different programming languages

170
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:21,620
outside of this, if you simply miss closing semicolon or or closing curly bracket like things will

171
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,990
break and not work for you and will be very frustrating.

172
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,860
So the good code editor will let you know if there's like an error.

173
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:37,120
If you have might have to turn on validation in your code editor, but that is important.

174
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:43,120
OK, so this is the mobile nav hide show.

175
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,820
And adds the content as well, so maybe we'll see if something happens.

176
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:57,570
And we don't have anything in there right now, because I think we need to add our yeah, we need to

177
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,080
add.

178
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,940
Maybe we'll check to see if it's even in our mobile now.

179
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:05,670
Mobile menu.

180
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,490
We have our content here, as you can see.

181
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:16,430
So, yeah, our content is there, so maybe we'll go to our styles.

182
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,600
And let's end the.

183
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,840
Styles where we hide.

184
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:24,700
Visibility.

185
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,780
Let's make it appear just so we can see, so we're going to do is save.

186
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:37,750
And a high this opacity and visibility, you're going to comment that out and then also menu backdrop,

187
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,960
no menu backdrop right here that's visible, OK?

188
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,090
Menu box.

189
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:48,930
Opacity and visibility are going to comment that out safe, see if we can see anything.

190
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,010
Yes, so we can.

191
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:54,690
So now we can start styling this to to look better.

192
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:00,000
So at least we can see it while we're styling, and then we'll go back and hide those so that we can

193
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,210
toggle it on and off based on the viewport size, viewport size.

194
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,260
All right.

195
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,800
Let's keep going with our styles, and we'll come back to jQuery when we need to.

196
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:17,360
All right, after the menu box, we're going to say mobile menu visible.

197
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:26,020
Mobile menu and menu box, so in there are capacity is going to be one.

198
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:29,100
Visibility is visible.

199
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:30,600
OK.

200
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,790
And then we're going to do some transitions.

201
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:43,710
It's going to be transition all 0.7 seconds is ad your usual fallbacks and then we want the Transformers

202
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,760
to be there as well.

203
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:49,770
So web kit transformers and then the Transform Translate X zero percent.

204
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:59,300
So now what we'll do is we'll style the close button that little X, so that's a mobile menu, close

205
00:13:59,300 --> 00:13:59,610
button.

206
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,650
Those are both classes.

207
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:05,300
We want the position to be absolute top and write 15 pixels.

208
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:07,430
Line height.

209
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,760
30 pixels and the width, 30 pixels.

210
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,970
Text align center.

211
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:19,600
We want the font size to be 26 pixels.

212
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,240
Color is going to be like a dark.

213
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,950
So let's find a variable.

214
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,020
I think we have color dark.

215
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:26,740
Yes.

216
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:34,030
We're going to say the color is vare colored dark.

217
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:42,050
Well, the cursor to be a pointer, does that an X to be 10, and it would make sure all your transitions

218
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,310
and transforms are in place.

219
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,430
So we're going to say Typekit transition all point five seconds.

220
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,880
Let's use our VAR.

221
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,980
Transition Dash, do you are?

222
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:02,120
And then our transforms are going to go Web could transform me, transform and then the standard transform

223
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,040
translate, why minus 50 pixels?

224
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:05,240
OK.

225
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,480
Let's check it out, see if something's happening.

226
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,770
All right, so we made it disappear.

227
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,090
Is do mobile menu mode menu.

228
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:19,180
Sorry, mobile menu, visible mobile menu and the close button.

229
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,300
Just for when it's visible.

230
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:26,970
We want the transforms.

231
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:34,250
Translate why zero pixels, so we want it to go to zero, so that's going to make it rotate?

232
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,270
I believe.

233
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:42,830
Then we want our mobile menu close button on hover opacity to be point five.

234
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,740
Now let's start styling that navigation to make it look better.

235
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,390
Right now, it looks pretty messy.

236
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:57,380
Mobile menu navigation that's going to have position relative padding top 50 pixels display block.

237
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:05,350
And border top one pixel solid GBA is going to be all zeros and the alpha channel zero point one came.

238
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:14,170
Then we want our mobile menu navigation ally to be positioned relative display block and the same thing

239
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:17,890
instead of border bottom or instead of border top, it's going to be border bottom.

240
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:21,180
One Pixel solid TBA Black.

241
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,500
Zero zero zero zero point one.

242
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,260
OK, let's check that out.

243
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:27,520
We're getting there.

244
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:34,180
But now, as you can see, there's kind of a bit of a mess here of of borders in this sub menu and the

245
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:34,990
sub submenu.

246
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,130
We're going to clean that up.

247
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:45,800
What we're going to do is we're going to select the mobile menu navigation l i child, you l child,

248
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,880
ally, last child.

249
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,270
And that's just simply going to be border bottom.

250
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:49,760
None.

251
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:52,640
And then.

252
00:16:54,570 --> 00:17:00,720
Mobile menu, navigation, ally, child, ul child, like first child, and that's going to be border

253
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,660
top one pixel solid.

254
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,030
Zero zero zero zero point one in the RGA, check it out.

255
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,230
There we go.

256
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:19,060
Now, the reason why we do this, let me just show you, is it's really quite hard to see.

257
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,540
Let's add it back and see if we can see it.

258
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:24,240
It adds it right here at the top of where it's a single post.

259
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,290
So that's just because we have no and this is the last tiled.

260
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,400
And so we got rid of the border bottom.

261
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:36,240
So we're just going to say first child on the submenu and add a border on the top.

262
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,200
So that's what we did there.

263
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:39,910
Team beauty.

264
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,320
All right, moving on.

265
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:48,190
We're going to like mobile menu navigation ally child selector A, so the tags that are a direct child

266
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,240
of the fly.

267
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:57,640
And we're going to take that position relative to display block line height 24 pixels and padding 10

268
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,830
pixels on the top bottom 20 pixels left right font size is 15 pixels.

269
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,360
Let's make the color VAR color dark.

270
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:15,060
Techs, Transformers going to be capitalized and then we want to do our transition to be.

271
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:24,350
All 0.5 seconds is or if you fancy, make that a variable just for fun transition der ease.

272
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:32,000
And then make sure you have fallbacks, so that'll be webcast miles, so on and so forth.

273
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:33,740
There we go.

274
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:45,200
Now we're going to do is we're going to select the the current the mobile menu navigation ally, the

275
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:51,050
class of current and then child, select the A and then a comma to combine another selector.

276
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:55,490
And that's going to be a mobile menu navigation L.I child selector, a hover.

277
00:18:55,910 --> 00:19:00,560
So when we hover over an ailment, we want the color to be.

278
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,280
E f one, f two, two.

279
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,340
Let's see what that looks like.

280
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,480
That's kind of like that pink red.

281
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,770
Color, let's capture that color in a variable.

282
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:20,480
We're going to say Dash, Dash, color red.

283
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:22,740
There we go.

284
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:28,550
And now all we can do is just capture that in a variable and any time we want to change that, we can

285
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,720
do so easily.

286
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:37,100
Thus far, Dash Dash, Color, Dash Red Save works brilliantly.

287
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:37,700
Perfect.

288
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:45,560
Carrying on, we're going to do mobile menu navigation alive with the class menu item has children and

289
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,220
then the drop down button position.

290
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:49,970
Absolute.

291
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,270
Right, zero top zero width is 44 pixels, height is 44 pixels.

292
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:04,890
Text align center font size 16 pixels line height 434 pixels color.

293
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,200
You could put a dark gray.

294
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:15,150
I'm just going to use our variable is going to be VAR Dash, Dash, Color Dash Dark.

295
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,820
Save the cursor pointer just for a user experience z index.

296
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,480
Five.

297
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,410
Save that.

298
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:23,580
Keep going.

299
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:30,360
Mobile menu navigation ally with the class menu item has children.

300
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:38,220
Class drop down button and then the after pseudo element content is going to be just a empty string.

301
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,620
That's what we do, and we want to make the pseudo element appear on the screen and appear like it's

302
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,790
a real element.

303
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,700
Position absolute left is going to be zero.

304
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,620
Top is 10 pixels.

305
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,820
Width is going to be one.

306
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:58,200
Pixel height is 24 pixels.

307
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,670
Border left?

308
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:04,980
We're making that one pixel solid our GBA zero zero zero zero point one.

309
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:12,990
Then, when we want to select the mobile menu navigation i child selector u l comma mobile menu navigation

310
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:18,690
child u l child l i child ul display none.

311
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,940
OK, that hides that submenu there.

312
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,930
It hides all the sub menus rather.

313
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:32,430
Now there are a couple of styles that we didn't add and that was nav bar open.

314
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,640
We want that to be position relative display none.

315
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:42,720
Background color unset padding zero border.

316
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,170
None.

317
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:56,020
Position absolute right, thirty two pixels, top zero pixels and then nav bar open flat icon colour

318
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:06,400
white display block font size 30 line height 40 knots pixels cursor pointer padding 18 pixels top bottom,

319
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,600
zero, left and right.

320
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:11,200
And I'm going to move those actually before all these mobile menu styles.

321
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:24,910
There we go and say that we were going to need to go back to our JavaScript.

322
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:34,350
And we've got to add some some dropdown button toggling kind of functionality in here.

323
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,540
So inside of our if statement.

324
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:46,810
Right here, we are going to keep going after this last bit of code here, and we're going to add,

325
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,910
let's say, drop down button functionality here, and that's going to look like this.

326
00:22:54,470 --> 00:23:03,980
Mobile menu, ally with the class of menu item has children drop down dash button.

327
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,430
And then we went on.

328
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:08,280
Click.

329
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,880
And then function.

330
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:25,520
And we're going to select this, which is the very element we are clicking on, engaging with previous

331
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:32,570
you allies or selecting the previous you you'll slide toggle at five hundred, which means milliseconds,

332
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:33,650
OK?

333
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:37,400
After that, we're going to do the menu toggle button.

334
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:46,170
And we're going to select mobile nav toddler.

335
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:53,080
On Click Function.

336
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,120
We're selecting the body.

337
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,960
We're going to add the class.

338
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:09,080
Mobile menu visible, you remember we styled some styles with this class, well, this is where the

339
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:14,030
class gets added, so now the styles can actually start doing something once that is added.

340
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,620
And then we're going to do the menu toggle button here again.

341
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,050
And we're going to say mobile dash menu.

342
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:27,450
Menu dash backdrop.

343
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:35,220
Coma Mobile Dash menu closed Dash BTN.

344
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:40,930
On, you guessed it, click function.

345
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,440
Inside the function.

346
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:49,070
We're going to select body.

347
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:59,220
Remove class mobile menu visible so that we want to remove that class when we click on the close button

348
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:05,070
so that those styles can then disappear, so we can't really see much because we still need to add some

349
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,280
more styles like media queries to make things display.

350
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:14,130
And we're making this thing just display right now, but we actually need to hide it for now and then

351
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:16,950
we can make it appear again properly.

352
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:21,120
So those commented out styles that we added, Let's find them.

353
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,400
Right here, opacity and visibility hidden under the mobile menu menu box.

354
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,880
We're going to uncomment that and there was another one.

355
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:40,790
Under mobile menu itself, opacity, visibility, hidden uncomment does so now should disappear.

356
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:48,620
And now what we need to do is we need to make the that kind of option the hamburger icon up here so

357
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:52,640
that we can start engaging with this JavaScript that we're writing or jQuery that we're writing.

358
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:59,070
So in our success before the navar open style here.

359
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:07,360
We're going to select the main menu child selector you'll ally with the class menu item, has children

360
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:11,470
dropdown button and their position absolute.

361
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:21,170
Right, 10 pixels, top six pixels, width and height are both going to be 30 pixels and then text align

362
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:33,590
center color, white line height 28 pixels border solid one pixel triple f background size is 20 pixels.

363
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,050
Pointer for the cursor.

364
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,370
Z Index five display, none.

365
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,970
We don't want that to appear just yet.

366
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:44,790
And then big Selectric coming up here.

367
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:53,490
Main menu class child selector you'll ally with the class menu item has children dropdown button i with

368
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:59,310
the class flight icon Arrow Down Sign to navigate and then the before pseudo element.

369
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,240
We're going to say font size one hundred pixels.

370
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,320
OK, so now we need to add some.

371
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,020
Media queries now.

372
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:17,020
You can add them at the very bottom of your styles, but a convention that I learned a little while

373
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:22,540
back was to just keep your media queries where you have the styles so that you don't have them separate.

374
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,460
It just makes a little bit more sense to me.

375
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,200
You can do whatever way you want.

376
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,150
That's the way I like doing it.

377
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,740
So we're going to do media.

378
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:37,060
So at media only screen and max with 768 pixels pixels, that's kind of like landscape phones or, you

379
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:37,150
know.

380
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,940
Tiny tablets or something like that.

381
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:43,420
Basis, just like a medium sized, small ish screen.

382
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:54,390
All right, we're going to select Top Dash Navigation I.D. and then top menu class in the same select

383
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,260
of their display, none.

384
00:27:56,770 --> 00:28:02,230
We're going to override or override any other styles that might keep it visible.

385
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:05,410
So this is going to force the property to override any other declaration.

386
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:11,140
That's what the important is for visibility hidden just to make sure it's not displaying anywhere.

387
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,640
Then we want to say NAV Bar, Dash Open.

388
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:25,180
We want the opacity to be one, visibility to be visible and then display inline block.

389
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:28,960
All right, save that.

390
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:29,710
Let's check it out.

391
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,340
See if that does anything around here.

392
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:33,700
Perfect.

393
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,980
See what happens is the nav.

394
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,920
And shows the hamburger icon.

395
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:42,020
Let's see what happens if you click it.

396
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:47,200
So nothing is happening on the screen.

397
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:52,630
But check the code out down here when I click it, see what's happening?

398
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,820
Blog mobile, my invisible blog.

399
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,650
Blogging and many visible blogs.

400
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:57,700
So it's toggling.

401
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,590
So our classes are working in our jQuery.

402
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:06,820
So in the final version, if I click this slides out, looks good, but in our version, something's

403
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,610
going on here.

404
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:10,090
It's toggling the class, but it's not toggling the styles.

405
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:11,970
All right.

406
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:15,430
What I just found here is critical issue.

407
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,260
So in our mobile menu.

408
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:24,220
I noticed that we styled quite a bit this menu box.

409
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,320
But it wasn't quite working.

410
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:31,660
I thought it was because the have been something I thought, we're going to add the subject, but when

411
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:39,280
I investigated my email, I realized that our nav element was supposed to have the class of menu dash

412
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,230
box.

413
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:50,040
That's why our styling wasn't working, so let's just see if something happens when we go back.

414
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:50,910
Refresh.

415
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,280
Close this.

416
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,330
All right, so we're still not seeing something so.

417
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:03,950
We're getting there, so I made a mistake in that I didn't add the cost menu box.

418
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:09,710
So now I just need to do a little digging to find why isn't that appearing three hours later?

419
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:16,100
OK, so upon investigating spending considerable amount of time debugging my CSC code and referencing

420
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:21,230
it with the final version, you may have already caught this a long time ago, but I found the issue

421
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,940
was a simple typo.

422
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:30,710
Right here, mobile menu visible, which obviously is not a class visible.

423
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:37,990
Now, when I save our menu works splendid, Lee, splendidly.

424
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,580
Look at this, it's incredible.

425
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:46,750
And if I go back to full size screen, here we are with our nice kind of drop down animations, mobile

426
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,790
menu animation.

427
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,900
It is brilliant.

428
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:59,650
OK, now that we got that sorted out to back to our script drop down toggle, we're going to say if

429
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:03,970
and then we're going to go with the pound sign, another opening and closing parentheses.

430
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:07,130
We're going to select class main dash menu.

431
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:12,910
Ally with the class of menu item, Dash has Dash children.

432
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:21,600
You will length went the length of that open curly bracket, close curly bracket inside of that if statement,

433
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:30,030
we're selecting main dash menu along with a class of menu dash item.

434
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:40,320
Dash has Dash children and we want to append this HTML so div with the class of and then because we're

435
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,740
using single quotations to open up this section.

436
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,600
Inside of that, we need to use a double quotation.

437
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,040
You always have to toggle between the two.

438
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:52,020
So if I were using double quotations here, oh my goodness, right here and I added the div with the

439
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,230
class, I need to use single quotations on the inside.

440
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:56,850
Just a little tip.

441
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,410
You probably already know that, though dropdown dash button.

442
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:13,920
Or BTN, OK, and inside that div, we have an I with a class of flat icon and flat icon Dash Arrow

443
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:18,510
Dash down Dash signed Dash to Dash Navigate.

444
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:24,240
OK, close that I tag and close that div tag.

445
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:29,730
There we go after that, make sure you have your your parentheses or your semicolon rather.

446
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:33,840
And then now we want to add the drop down button.

447
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:38,910
That's going to be selecting the main course of main menu.

448
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:46,980
Ally menu item has children and dropdown dash button on click function.

449
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:47,970
This.

450
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:56,910
Preve private for previous the previous u well, we want to slide toggle at 500 milliseconds and then

451
00:32:56,910 --> 00:33:03,150
we want to disable the dropdown parent link so it stops working when it's in this view.

452
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:11,550
We're going to select main dash menu navigation ally menu item has children, child selector, a comma

453
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:14,460
class of hidden dash bar.

454
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:18,240
Class of side dash menu.

455
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,800
Ally menu item has children.

456
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,460
Todd's lecture a on click function.

457
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,620
Open that up properly.

458
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,400
And then we want to go E for the event.

459
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:41,030
And then prevent default, so that just prevents the default functionality, which is a click to navigate

460
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:43,340
the link, but this will prevent that cliff from working.

461
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,360
Save it.

462
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,470
Let's see what happens.

463
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:54,840
And here is our little down navigation, click it, nice, click it.

464
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:55,950
Nice.

465
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,090
Now, I believe.

466
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:02,410
That is working the same, and it's looking the same.

467
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,070
Beautiful.

468
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:11,860
All right, so we did our header, the nav with our nice animations in the submenu sub submenu and then

469
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,550
when we.

470
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,340
Are in a mobile view.

471
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,600
We have our.

472
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,950
Dropdown navigation.

473
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,080
Brilliant.

474
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,160
That looks so good.

475
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:31,110
And that is all of our styles for the navigation menu, dropdown submenus and the mobile menu, that

476
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,890
was gigantic lesson.

477
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:34,040
Let's move on.

478
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:36,200
We're going to get going into the rest of the content here.
