1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,080
All right, friends, we are going to go ahead and code this bigger call to action box.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,130
We need to come up with a great name for it.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:13,050
So let's head over to our code editor and in our widget study team, we're going to style up the markup.

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:20,910
So make sure outside of those three four column or one to three text cards that we just created, you'll

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:21,930
see the row.

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:28,020
We need to make sure we're outside of that row, and I'm just going to add a div with the class of spacer.

7
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,540
Remember how we styled that up in our previous lesson?

8
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,170
Now what we're going to do?

9
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,070
Give ourselves a little space in their little room to work.

10
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,630
Work it.

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:44,190
We're going to add a dinner with the class of row your boat and then actually don't write row your boat,

12
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,330
you'll break everything, but you know, little jokes here and there just to keep everybody happy.

13
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,470
Happy little jokes.

14
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,190
David the class of Col., M.D..

15
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,030
12.

16
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,590
We could just assume 12, I mean, it doesn't really matter.

17
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:07,930
The point here is a dinner with the class of S. Let's call it call to action all one big class and then

18
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:12,940
Dave with the class of overlay and inside of that overlay, we're going to have a David, the class

19
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,680
of overlay dash image.

20
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:19,060
And inside of that div, we are nesting.

21
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:27,240
Image source assets, slash images, slash card dash date dot PG.

22
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,510
Let's say illustration is the alt descriptor there.

23
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,350
OK, now outside of that overlay.

24
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:40,690
Tag, we want another div with the class of overlay dash bag.

25
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,520
That's an empty tag.

26
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:43,870
Nothing in there.

27
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,220
So just keep it like that.

28
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,240
This is what it looks like.

29
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,080
A little bit of space.

30
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,470
We're going to add a paragraph tag.

31
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,980
And we're going to give that the class of sub Dash title.

32
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,460
And this is where you have that kind of eyebrow effect.

33
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:05,970
I was going to say join 49000 students and then a level two heading, say, bootstrap to WordPress 2.0

34
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:11,550
with Brad Hussey, another paragraph tag tag with just whatever you want.

35
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,740
Again, this is going to be dynamic, but we're just going to put some some text in there.

36
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,340
Whenever he wants a trough, just the pound sign.

37
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:27,140
Class BTN space, BTN primary primary.

38
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,450
Primary primary and in there.

39
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,000
Join now and then because we're using the interface and family just dash greater than sign, and it

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,030
will automatically convert that to a nice, happy little arrow.

41
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,950
Okay, save that, I must say.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,690
Have a look.

43
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,890
Here we go.

44
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,270
We are looking basic.

45
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,280
Let's make it look.

46
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,930
Next level, go to your styles.

47
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:57,360
That success or style don't ciusss and after your text card styles and that some space here for the

48
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,090
section call to action.

49
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,740
We're going to position that bad boy relative with the text align center.

50
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,420
The border radius is going to be four pixels padding.

51
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:17,580
We're going going 90 pixels top and bottom and 100 undead on the left and right.

52
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,290
And then the margin.

53
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,720
We're talking 20 picks anada 20 picks not out.

54
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:24,450
Check it out.

55
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,790
There we go, looking better already.

56
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:30,420
Next, we need to select the section dash you don't want.

57
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:35,790
Just copy and paste this so much typing and overlay dash bpg.

58
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,200
What are we doing there?

59
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,440
We're going to position that absolute top zero left zero.

60
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,540
We want the width.

61
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:53,620
To be 100 percent, the height to be 100 percent and z index negative to you, Americans might call

62
00:03:53,620 --> 00:04:03,550
this Z index, but the trick here with Z Index using the word Z versus Z is C listen a little background

63
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:03,740
here.

64
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,590
This has nothing to do with coding, just some literal grammar semantics based on geographic location.

65
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:12,400
As a Canadian, you might think that I would always say Z, I don't.

66
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,400
In fact, sometimes I say Z, sometimes I say Z.

67
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,870
It's not a uniquely.

68
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,970
All Canadians say Z sort of thing.

69
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:28,840
I say Z when there is a, let's say, for example, a vowel after the letter Z, it's easier to say

70
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,170
Z index than it is to say Z Index.

71
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,690
Z Index is like you're trying to sound like a cheesy French Accent Z index.

72
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,690
When we say Z Index, it's just easier.

73
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,560
Just bounces.

74
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,110
Just a little top tip there for you, folks.

75
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:52,360
Back to CC border radius 40 pixels and we want that background color to be true.

76
00:04:52,630 --> 00:05:00,820
That's the sound that is the hex code for the sound effect of like Star Wars guns two.

77
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,940
Oh, sorry, folks, just kind of enamored today.

78
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:04,540
There we go.

79
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:04,850
Save it.

80
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,220
Let's have a little check, Jackie.

81
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,870
Nice.

82
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:12,670
So that's a background yellow background gradient there, not gradient the background effect.

83
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,170
Set background.

84
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:18,160
You know, it's not a shadow, but we kind of pretended it to be shadow.

85
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,910
So that's it there.

86
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,910
So we're calling it the overlay bag.

87
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,850
Well, perhaps we could call it the underlay bag.

88
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,300
Why don't we do that?

89
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:31,000
Let's call it the underlay, because it's it really is an underlay underlay big.

90
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:36,410
Change that to the underlay, big works now we have a better name.

91
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,250
Perfect.

92
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,350
All right, now we're going to do is we're going to S. Call to action overlay.

93
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,020
And it's going to be position absolute top top zero left zero.

94
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,780
We want it to be width and height.

95
00:05:51,800 --> 00:06:01,190
One hundred percent Z Index C Z Index, not Z Index negative one border radius 40 pixels.

96
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,780
We want that overflow to be hidden and we want a linear gradient.

97
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:14,300
So background, we're going linear gradient and it's going to be 100 degrees.

98
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:19,630
And then five eight five zero zero five seven.

99
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:28,770
That's the color stop zero percent and then we're going comma maybe six between nine at 100 percent.

100
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,440
Color stop.

101
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,940
Don't forget your semicolons.

102
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,940
Transform, rotate.

103
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:38,620
Let's go like three fifty eight degrees.

104
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,170
Save it, Kitao.

105
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,620
See how we kind of twisted that front container a little bit.

106
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:51,130
All right, now, we've got a problem here with some contrasty it's hard to read.

107
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,270
All right, we're going to go S. Call to action, overlay image image.

108
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,860
There's the selector right there.

109
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,450
Feel free to just type it all out.

110
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:05,150
And we're going to go width 100 percent height auto.

111
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,340
Opacity zero point five.

112
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:16,820
And that's going to make that image just a little, you know, going to look like that pretty sketchy.

113
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,570
Let's fix it.

114
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,460
S. Call to action overlay image.

115
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:31,490
So this is without the image specifically, we're going to say position, absolute transform, rotate.

116
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:41,030
And now it's going to be 18 degrees border radius, 20 pixels overflow hidden.

117
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:48,530
And we're going with 30 percent left negative, four percent bottom negative 50 percent and the transition.

118
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,560
And you got it.

119
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:53,120
We're doing our VAR transition dir.

120
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,110
Check it out.

121
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:57,530
Look at that and just poking over in the corner like a little cutie pie.

122
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,870
Now we're going to select on hover.

123
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,940
We want to give it a little effect.

124
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,490
So the same selector.

125
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:08,330
But the trick here S. Call to action when we hover over the section, call to action.

126
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,050
We want to select the overlay image and we're going to transform.

127
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,510
Twenty one degrees.

128
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,410
What was transform rotate 21 degrees?

129
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,450
And save.

130
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,510
When we hover.

131
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:33,360
But you see how it kind of does that little jiggle get finally, just that texts hard to read.

132
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:40,050
It's make it white, so select all of that text in there section.

133
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:40,710
Call to action H.

134
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:48,390
Two S. Call to action subtitle section call to Action P Color White, But there it is.

135
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,520
And I actually want this to be a different color.

136
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,870
That's the subtitle.

137
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,060
So let's go.

138
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:59,820
Let's make it like section call to Action subtitle.

139
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,610
We're going to say color, VAR Dash, Dash, Color Yellow.

140
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,470
Do we have that set up in as a variable?

141
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:07,980
We do.

142
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:08,880
All right.

143
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:09,750
Check it out.

144
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,210
Boom, that looks nice.

145
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,160
I like it very much.

146
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,930
And that was good.

147
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,330
Good job in the next one, we're going to keep going.

148
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,560
Doolittle quote looks like this needs some styling or make that look a little nicer.

149
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:26,130
And then we're done with our widgets and onwards and upwards.

150
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,160
Adios.

151
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:27,420
Bye.

152
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:27,840
Bye.

153
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,470
Salu.

154
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,600
Joe it.

155
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,150
There she.
