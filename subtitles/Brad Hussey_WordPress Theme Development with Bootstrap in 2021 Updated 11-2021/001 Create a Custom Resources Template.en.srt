Hey, welcome back to Boost Your Income
with Bootstrap to WordPress, and

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,547
the selector we're gonna be
creating a resources template.

3
00:00:06,547 --> 00:00:15,023

4
00:00:15,023 --> 00:00:16,165
Hey everyone, we're back.

5
00:00:16,165 --> 00:00:19,820
So now what we're gonna do
is create a new page and

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,550
template in our WordPress theme for
our resources page.

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,160
So here is the resources
page on the final site.

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,820
And you can just see it's
pretty straightforward.

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:35,030
We've got kind of a header up
there with a feature image.

10
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,000
Some full width text and

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,850
a grid of resources that ideally
will be easily updatable.

12
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:47,150
And you can add and remove them as
you wish, or as your client wishes.

13
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,580
That's the idea here.

14
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:52,020
So, in our WordPress site we
don't quite have that yet.

15
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,850
So, what we need to do, before we do
anything, is head back to our dashboard.

16
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,000
And, head to pages.

17
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:04,410
And we're gonna add a new page, but
first I noticed in the menu there,

18
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:09,160
we had a sample page link,
which is no longer there.

19
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,050
So just remove that from your menus.

20
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,530
And what I'm also gonna do
while we're here in menus,

21
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,800
is I'm just gonna auto add new
top level pages to this menu.

22
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,800
So we don't have to keep
doing this every time.

23
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,660
The downside of automatically adding new
topical pages is that if you are a little

24
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:29,200
over eager and add a lot of topical pages,
your menu can get cluttered and

25
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,690
can eventually break.

26
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,480
But if you know you're only gonna have
four, five pages, you should be good.

27
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,040
Okay, back to your pages.

28
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,220
We're gonna add a new page.

29
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,660
And we're just gonna call this resources.

30
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,550
And leave it as is for now.

31
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,680
Just go ahead and hit publish,
because right now we only have

32
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,510
default template and the home page,
so I'm gonna publish that.

33
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:53,680
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna
create a new template specifically for

34
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,500
resources.

35
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,200
Head back to your code editor.

36
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,250
And the first thing you're gonna
wanna do is create a new file and

37
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:05,224
call that page-resources.php,
kinda like what we did for the page-home.

38
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,540
Go ahead and open that up and
of course it's gonna be blank and empty.

39
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:16,990
But what you're gonna wanna do is
start off with a php script and

40
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:24,630
then let Word Press know with a php
comment, what this template is called.

41
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,690
And you just do it like this.

42
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:33,820
Template mean resources, page.

43
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,680
Now, the comment can look like this.

44
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,860
You don't want it to be so,
take so much space.

45
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,480
It doesn't have to have a specific
formatting as long as it is a comment.

46
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,690
There we go.

47
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:48,040
So now, if I go back to our dashboard and
I refresh this page,

48
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,762
I should be able to choose Resources
page from the template drop-down.

49
00:02:52,762 --> 00:02:57,197
If I go ahead and update that,
I'm gonna have nothing to view,

50
00:02:57,197 --> 00:03:00,230
it's gonna be an empty page.

51
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,830
But we know it works.

52
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:07,140
So, why don't we just grab that
static content from the HTML file?

53
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,110
The resources.html from your static site.

54
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,220
And put it into our resources page.

55
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,920
So you only need to
grab from feature image

56
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,800
because we already have the header and
the footer.

57
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,810
So grab from feature image all
the way down until you get to

58
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,130
the end of the container.

59
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,870
So just before sign-up section
cuz sign-up section and

60
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,590
footer, they are included in the footer.

61
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:34,640
Go ahead and what we're gonna
do is paste that right here.

62
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,510
There we go.

63
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,470
We should have everything now.

64
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,030
Now, it's all static, if I save that, and

65
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,530
just give it a little check here,
I should see some really ugly content.

66
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,280
Great.
Well, it's connecting,

67
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,660
so it's pretty straightforward
from this point.

68
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,560
I'm gonna leave that for the next lecture,
I wanted you to have a little break from

69
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,230
the previous one, and yeah,
I'll see you in the next one.

70
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,060
We're going to start
making this more dynamic.

71
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:00,769
Awesome.
