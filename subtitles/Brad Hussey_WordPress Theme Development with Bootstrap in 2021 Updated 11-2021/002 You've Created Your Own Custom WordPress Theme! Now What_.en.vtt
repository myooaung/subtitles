00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.710
Hey everyone, welcome back to the final
lecture of Boost Your Income with

2
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.500
Bootstrap to WordPress,
congratulations, you did it.

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.890
This was a big course, and if you made it
this far, super, super congratulations.

4
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.730
You're awesome, a very talented,
and skilled web developer.

5
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.530
I know this course was pretty challenging,
it was challenging for

6
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.410
me to make, and I wanted to make
sure it was perfect for you.

7
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.370
It's a work in progress always,
meaning I'm gonna be adding more valuable

8
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:32.510
content as time goes on, making the course
bigger and bigger, and more valuable.

9
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.500
I'm gonna try my best to keep everything
up to date, so that you new students

10
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.830
have the ability to learn
with the latest software and

11
00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.572
WordPress and Bootstrap and
everything like that.

12
00:00:44.572 --> 00:00:49.280
So, without further adieu I wanted to
give you a few tips and resources and

13
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.780
what you need to do from here.

14
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.760
So given that you've
learned all these skills,

15
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.240
maybe you've done
the course a couple times.

16
00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.630
Maybe you've done the famous Brad Hussey
pause and rewind, I hear that

17
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.770
a lot from new students out there who
are a little bit stressed by my speed.

18
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.920
That's my challenge,
I like to be fast to challenge you.

19
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.770
So from this point,
there's a lot of stuff that you can do.

20
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.770
If you're a total beginner,
you could go back and do the course again,

21
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.620
you could take notes in the certain
parts of the course that maybe was

22
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.460
a little bit too challenging and
you wanted to revisit.

23
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.650
If you're intermediate level, or maybe
you just blasted through the course and

24
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.130
you learned so much and
you hit the ground running.

25
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.730
That's my goal,
that's what I want you to be.

26
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.170
I want you to be hitting the ground
running, whether you are a total beginner

27
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.400
or you are an expert and if I helped you
become an expert, then that's amazing.

28
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.210
That's exactly what I'm trying to aim for
here.

29
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.500
Now that you have such a valuable skill,
coding custom WordPress themes with

30
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.780
Bootstrap, you can do a lot,
you have options.

31
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.420
You could create your own website,
create your own portfolio website.

32
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.700
If you're a graphic designer, you could
start taking on web design projects

33
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.470
rather than just graphic design projects
and increase your income significantly.

34
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.020
I'm talking 1, 2, 3, 4, $5,000 a month.

35
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.470
If you're a busy graphic designer and

36
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.970
you're outsourcing a lot of your
web design to different developers,

37
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.670
you could do that yourself and
you could double your income each month.

38
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.240
If your a web developer, like me, as soon
as I started taking on WordPress projects,

39
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.680
as soon as I learned how to code
custom WordPress websites and

40
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.810
I started taking those on, I started
making way more money then I did before.

41
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.950
Before I was just doing some basic
websites using static HTML and

42
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.257
I would get people to do the WordPress for
me and I paid them to do it.

43
00:02:36.257 --> 00:02:41.834
But now that I'm able to do it myself,
that's a huge asset to my business and

44
00:02:41.834 --> 00:02:44.895
I am able to make a lot
more money doing it.

45
00:02:44.895 --> 00:02:49.260
And that's why I want to pass that on
to you because you can have that skill.

46
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.970
Now that you do, you can start
charging more money for your services.

47
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.180
You could start a business
as a web developer

48
00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.980
who develops custom WordPress websites.

49
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.890
You could sell your themes on
marketplaces like Theme Forest.

50
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.670
There's a lot you can do.

51
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.010
So we're not done.

52
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.550
This course is gonna keep growing and
I'm gonna be here to help you, do my best.

53
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.710

thanks so much for taking the course.

69
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.810
Before you go,
I want to ask a quick favor of you.

70
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.540
If you made it this far, you clearly
put a lot of time and effort into this.

71
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.440
I put a lot of time and
effort into this course, as well.

72
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.120
It's taken me about eight months
of hard hardcore work and

73
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.880
I've been working full time as
a freelance web developer, as well.

74
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.890
I'm also a father and I have a family.

75
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.715
So, I'm pretty busy and I'm here
recording these lectures hardcore and

76
00:04:42.715 --> 00:04:44.920
trying to give you the most value I can.

77
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.350
So, if you could just take a few moments
out of your day, it should only take about

78
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:55.030
a minute, please rate and review
the course, and share it with somebody.

79
00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.560
You have to know somebody out there
who could benefit from this course.

80
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.900

share it on your Twitter account,
