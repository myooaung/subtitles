1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,350
Hey, friend, welcome back.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:06,390
We're going to start coding up these little excerpts right here, and that's going to be easy because

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:12,000
we just have to make one and then duplicate it just for, you know, for the template purpose of the

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,890
template, obviously in WordPress.

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,680
We won't be hard coding each individual one.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,110
We just code one and then that will act as the template.

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,630
And it will repeat as many times as we have blog posts.

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,280
And then we're also going to code this little snippet up and then just a footer copyright section.

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,090
Very simple.

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,200
So let's see how quickly we can do this in our code editor here.

11
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:40,170
We have finished off and in the previous section with the Subscribe bar and I believe the title banner.

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:40,650
Yes.

13
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,190
So now let's let's go down below our section here.

14
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:44,790
What's that?

15
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:53,430
A div with the class of contents dash area and then a div with the class of container, div with the

16
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:58,650
class of row and div, and this is going to have a few utility classes.

17
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:05,400
This is going to be called Ash M.D. Dash eight four eight column grid that breaks at the medium screen

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,360
size Offset Dash, M.D., Dash two.

19
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,910
And so this is kind of like what we did previously where we had our title banner and we had the call

20
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:20,880
M.D. Tan and an offset of one so that we could, you know, make this section not a full width.

21
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,550
Well, we're going to do that even more with the content area.

22
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:28,740
We want the contents to only be eight columns, but we want it to be centered in the screen.

23
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:36,870
So we're going to offset it by two so that there's two empty spaces beside on the left side of the 800.

24
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,260
And then obviously there's two empty spaces on the other side.

25
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,250
We just don't have to write it.

26
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:43,260
All right.

27
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:50,720
And then we're going to have a small screen call, Sam Dash 12, Offset Dash Sam Dash zero.

28
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:56,990
Now I'm going to test something here as overflow hidden as well utility class.

29
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,610
Now, normally I wouldn't write these call Sam 12 and offset some zero.

30
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:06,980
That's kind of like saying when we break, when we do call Medium 8s, when we get to the small screen

31
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,330
size of below medium.

32
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,420
Then do this.

33
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,010
But I believe the reality is is we don't need to put these.

34
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:22,990
Because once we get to the medium screen size, the fallback is a 12 column full width anyway, so I

35
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,020
mean, we can test that.

36
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:31,660
Let's go to the final version right here and we can just like, inspect and just test my hypotheses

37
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:31,960
here.

38
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,260
And so the idea is as we make this smaller.

39
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,210
And here's the small screen size coming up.

40
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,940
It breaks to 12 right there.

41
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:49,140
OK, so what I'm thinking is what if we just removed, call us 12 and offset in zero?

42
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,390
All right, so I've removed it.

43
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,860
I just have call medium eight offset medium 12 or two.

44
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,290
And let's just see if it does.

45
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:01,640
Yeah, so it does it anyway, so because of the medium break point, it goes forwards anyway.

46
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:09,800
So you can put these if for some reason you wrote suggests that overall, you know this, if you only

47
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:15,170
had this and you had some success that overall, you know the column size and the small screen, then

48
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,370
maybe this would be valuable.

49
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,990
But honestly, let's take that out.

50
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,130
You don't really need it.

51
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:26,120
OK, so then inside of that's we're going to have an article, the class of post, and then we're going

52
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,590
to have a dev with the class of meta for like content like date and stuff.

53
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,000
So span tag.

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,700
And let's just say, I don't know, let's do today, like September 24 in WordPress, this is going

55
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:43,730
to be dynamic anyway, outside of the meta and a half inside of that, we're going to have a level two

56
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:46,520
heading and then blog post title.

57
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:50,570
So that's so that the full H2 is a link like that.

58
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,700
We can also put the link inside the H2.

59
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:55,430
I guess we'll come to that when we come to it, when we get to WordPress.

60
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:00,620
We can always change our markup later paragraph tag with the class excerpt.

61
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:06,230
And then let's just put some lorem ipsum in there so that we can have kind of something to view.

62
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:16,780
And after that, we got another attack, and we're going to say class, read more and then read the

63
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:21,670
full post, and I'm going to say Right, Arrow?

64
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,250
Let's see if that's coming up.

65
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:24,850
Here we go.

66
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,590
Well, it's pretty decent, actually.

67
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,720
I'm actually, you know what?

68
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,570
I want this a tag to be inside the Level two heading.

69
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,430
I think it's just more proper HTML.

70
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,680
It could work either way, really.

71
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,270
But essentially, we want this H2 to be a link.

72
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:46,990
So all you're really going to do now is just copy this post, maybe one to say three for like that.

73
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,190
Let's see what it looks like.

74
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:49,330
Perfect.

75
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:55,660
Now what we can do is we can use utility classes to give us some margin in between.

76
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,850
We can also hand code the CSC, but it's going to show an example.

77
00:04:58,850 --> 00:04:59,560
It's really up to you.

78
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:05,020
You don't have to follow this exactly, especially if you know some CSIS bootstrap XSS utility classes.

79
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,260
You really can do whatever you want here, but I'm just going to show an example.

80
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:15,780
Let's say each post we wanted to have like margin, you know, top and bottom of a certain amount,

81
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,370
just give it some space in between, we could say.

82
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:24,970
So we say that on each of them and four in my Dash four, and that's margin y axes.

83
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,000
The fourth of the styles.

84
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,910
So it's probably, you know, a certain amount based on the spacer and bootstrap.

85
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:41,530
So if I were to go to like bootstrap men, dot CC and I went to like M y Dash four to find it.

86
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,890
Here it is my fourth margin one point five m.

87
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,820
Am I five is three RAM?

88
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,780
You can you get the idea there that's that's the utility classes there.

89
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:53,460
Let's see what that looks like.

90
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,620
So it gives everything some breathing space there.

91
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,260
You know, you can do it that way.

92
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,220
What if we just search and replace them with four, four and y five?

93
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:02,910
Let's try it.

94
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,240
Little more breathing space.

95
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,560
You could do it that way if you want.

96
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:12,690
You know, we're going to do this in CSI anyway because this has got a lot of breathing space, but

97
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,210
that's just one way of doing it if you want.

98
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,520
That's just kind of an example.

99
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,860
OK, so those are excerpts.

100
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:19,500
That's all.

101
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,100
Now we're going to do is put our little foot or call to action.

102
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,860
This is going to be a global section on each of the pages.

103
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,290
So let's go down here and this is the content area.

104
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,540
So outside of the content area, what's nice about Adam is that it underlines the closing div tag so

105
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,290
we could find it and we're going to add a footer tag.

106
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:46,140
And the footer inside of that is going to have a div with the class of footer dash call to action text

107
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,330
center.

108
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,330
So utility class.

109
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,220
This will be a custom class that we'll use to target later in our casts.

110
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:59,310
David, the class of container div with a class of row, it's a bootstrap class div and this is going

111
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,830
to have some utility classes for our column.

112
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:12,000
So call Medium H or call MDA eight Offset Dash, M.D. Dash to perfect overflow hidden.

113
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:19,080
See Utility Class Bootstrap CSC and see what overflow dash hidden does.

114
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:27,340
So literally just excess overflow hidden as the style, so that's like if the text like a long link

115
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:33,160
or something like that overflow outside of the container you can hide it really is probably not that

116
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:41,260
necessary, but it's kind of a safeguard paragraph tag class of sub dash title during the course and

117
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:47,350
then level two heading, we can say bootstrap to WordPress 2.0 paragraph tag.

118
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,090
And then just like learn how to design and build custom beautiful and responsive WordPress web sites

119
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,970
and themes for beginners in 2021 and beyond.

120
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:59,410
Because let's be honest here, you might be looking at this in the future, and this should still be

121
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:03,010
relevant, whether it's 2022 or so on and so forth.

122
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:10,900
A HSF class BTN, BTN Primary, those are bootstrap classes.

123
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:16,840
Join now and then RR, which is unity for the right arrow.

124
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,280
Right Arrow can also do left arrow la ra.

125
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,110
And finally, we'll just add our copyright.

126
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:32,350
We're going to keep that within the footer outside of the last div here, div with the class of copyright

127
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:35,920
and text center and then paragraph tag.

128
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,450
Let's just say copyright.

129
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,770
Right side studios ink.

130
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,180
Whatever you want there, you can put your name.

131
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,440
There we go.

132
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,450
And that is the footer.

133
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,980
I believe I got that right.

134
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,160
Actually, I just noticed I want to move this entire footer.

135
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:56,030
Outside of these debates, so this this last debate here is, I believe, a container.

136
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,840
Let's find it.

137
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:57,710
Yeah, it's that.

138
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,370
OK, we got something going on here.

139
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,560
We must be missing a closing div tag.

140
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,810
So this is I could edit this part out.

141
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:10,820
But the reality is, is this is what happens with web development and designing and building websites.

142
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,900
You're going to have the stuff happens.

143
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,110
So I'm going to show you in real, real, real time here.

144
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,920
So basically, I want this footer outside of the last div.

145
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,880
So you know, this is what I would have done.

146
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:26,480
Like that, but something's up here when I clicked on this last div.

147
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,810
I see that it's saying that the opening one is the top navigation, and that's not right.

148
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:38,170
That's not what I want because top navigation should essentially close after this.

149
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:45,300
And I believe that's the problem, so this is this is how we deal with this, so we got our mobile menu.

150
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,210
And we actually want to close.

151
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:54,260
The We Don't Want Tidal banner inside of the top navigation.

152
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:56,900
And container.

153
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,830
Should close.

154
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,300
Not way down here.

155
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:01,230
So there we go.

156
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,220
So let's take these last two.

157
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,840
Just cut them out.

158
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:08,020
And let's put them after the mobile menu.

159
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:17,290
OK, so there we go, so now this closing div is going to be the opening div of let's see, let's start

160
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:17,970
with top now.

161
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,420
Todd, now perfect.

162
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,490
This next one should be.

163
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,180
Container perfect.

164
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,310
And then the rest is is good.

165
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:28,750
There we go.

166
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,330
Perfect, OK.

167
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:34,160
And then this section, we can probably indent this whole thing back one.

168
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,610
So that just lines up nicer.

169
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:43,070
I'm going to hold command and then the left square bracket a couple of times and atom usually that works

170
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:47,750
with most code editors, so you can move and tab in entire sections.

171
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,630
OK, so there we go now.

172
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:56,810
Our markup looks good, so we had a little bit of incorrect markup there for a bit where the top nav

173
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:01,280
was wrapping everything and we would have found that eventually as we were styling.

174
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:05,030
But it's good that we found it now because it probably will cause some headaches later on.

175
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,790
And that looks good to me.

176
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,080
Space that out a bit more.

177
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,100
That's looking good and not if we check it out.

178
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,330
Looks like this.

179
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,020
So here we go.

180
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:15,740
We've got markup.

181
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:20,000
Obviously, the navigation looks like a total horrendous mess, but we'll get there.

182
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,050
Perfect.

183
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,560
OK, so basically we can go a couple of ways here.

184
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,600
We can keep going and and add our code for the rest of these other ones.

185
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,740
But part of me is wondering if I kind of want to jump ahead a little bit and then come back.

186
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,020
Maybe we style it up in our next video.

187
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:40,220
Make our CSR kind of do some nicer stuff so that we're looking at something a little more inspiring

188
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:45,140
because this to me makes me want to quit because it's pretty, pretty bad.

189
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,270
Uh, obviously the markups good.

190
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,200
But the styles are bad.

191
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:48,730
So you know what?

192
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:54,200
I convince myself just now in real time next VIDEO Folks, we're going to make this look really pretty.
