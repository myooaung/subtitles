00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.650
All right, friends, welcome back.

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:06.150
We are going to style up a simple little block quote to make it look nice, and that's about it for

3
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:06.750
this lesson.

4
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.430
Head back to that code editor, yours.

5
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.200
And what we're going to do is we're going to create a new font family variable.

6
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.780
So right now we're using the entire font family, which is a sans serif or sans serif if you want to,

7
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:19.740
you know, go that way.

8
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:28.010
And what we're going to do is going to say Dash Dash Font Dash Sleeve, which is a cerra font and a

9
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:28.550
colon.

10
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.810
And what we're going to do is we're going to use the system fonts for kind of a font that works for

11
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.520
everybody to just fall back to the system serif style font family.

12
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.570
So go to your browser and then go to System Font Stack dot com and we're gonna use system fonts.

13
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.470
So web fonts lets us hear what fonts were great when most computers only had a handful of good fonts

14
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.360
thanks to font creation and buying by Apple, Microsoft, Google and other folks, most computers have

15
00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.960
good, no great fonts installed, and they're a great option if you want to to not load a separate font.

16
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.010
So I like doing this for my websites.

17
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.300
Hamas.

18
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:10.110
I need a specific font that works best with the brand, but you can just use basic system font stack,

19
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.540
so sont sans serif font family right here, a Sarah Font family here and a modified family.

20
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.170
So just copy this and use that as your font families if you want to use system fonts and have nice looking

21
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.620
fonts.

22
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.470
So we're going to get a serif style font family here.

23
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.550
So instead of copying all this, I'm just going to grab the kind of the value right here and in this

24
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.670
font serif variable paste that in.

25
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.610
And now we've got a kind of serif style font variable that we're going to use.

26
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:42.180
All right.

27
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.380
So now that we've got the variable in there, we need to head over to our widgets that each HTML and

28
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.750
actually add some markup that we want to style.

29
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.400
So let's just add a little spacer in there to give some space.

30
00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.080
And then we're going to do a div with the class of row div in the class of Call Dash, M.D., Dash 12,

31
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:09.390
the Deb with the class of testimonial wrapper and then a block quote with the class of testimonial inside

32
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.400
of that paragraph tag with, just like, you know, lorem up some or something, that's where the the

33
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.200
quote content goes.

34
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.170
And inside of the bloc quote itself, you can put a site.

35
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.700
Tag and then to say, like James John and then a span tag and inside of that, I'm going to say, close

36
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.650
this man tag, make sure you do that inside of there.

37
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.470
Just going to say like slash student like who they are, you know, or their organization or whatever.

38
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.430
So now we've got some basic markup to work with, which looks like this.

39
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.800
Now we're going to style it up.

40
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:55.070
Go to our style that CSC and typography somewhere in the typography general area of your styles and

41
00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:01.910
CSC, we're going to select the testimonial tag sorry class.

42
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.330
And we're going to do the font family, VAR Dash, Dash, font serif.

43
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.820
So that's that serif style font family font size is going to be one point eight rim.

44
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.940
On style italic.

45
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.950
Text align center and then line height one point five.

46
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.510
Save it, looking pretty darn good so far.

47
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.170
But I want to change up the site here, so all we got to do with that.

48
00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.420
It's a testimonial.

49
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.740
And then site.

50
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:42.410
This we're going to switch back to the sans serif on family so far, family VAR font sans font weight

51
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:50.110
is going to be 600 font size, 1.2 ram a little bit smaller and then font style is going to be normal.

52
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.650
We don't want it to be italic.

53
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.360
Pool and I want this student to be a different color than James John.

54
00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.820
So like whatever their association is, their company, their position sites span, we've had this ban

55
00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.520
tag inside the site tag.

56
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.450
We're going to say color like it to a two to don.

57
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.170
There it is.

58
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.760
That's it.
