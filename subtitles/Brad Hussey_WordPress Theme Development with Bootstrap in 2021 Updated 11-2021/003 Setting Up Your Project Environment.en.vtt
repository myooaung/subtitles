Hey, folks.
Welcome back to boost your income with

2
00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:03.220
Bootstrap to WordPress.

3
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.955
This lecture is called setting
up your project environment.

4
00:00:05.955 --> 00:00:10.297
And in this video, we're going to be
setting up our project environment.

5
00:00:10.297 --> 00:00:19.887
[MUSIC]

6
00:00:19.887 --> 00:00:24.360
Okay, so now what we're gonna do is we're
going to set up our project environment,

7
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.825
so there's a few things we're gonna
need to do to start coding our

8
00:00:27.825 --> 00:00:29.337
static bootstrap website.

9
00:00:29.337 --> 00:00:33.713
By this point, you should have
already downloaded the course files.

10
00:00:33.713 --> 00:00:37.736
In the previous lecture, I gave you a link
that you could download the course files.

11
00:00:37.736 --> 00:00:43.046
So basically here we're going to
create our from scratch project,

12
00:00:43.046 --> 00:00:48.742
so I went ahead and created a blank
folder here on my desktop called B2W.

13
00:00:48.742 --> 00:00:52.643
You can call it whatever, but I just
called it B2W for Bootstrap to WordPress.

14
00:00:52.643 --> 00:00:55.360
I'm gonna open that up and
you'll see here that it is empty.

15
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.460
There's nothing in the folder.

16
00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.730
Right here in my other tab,
I have within my course files,

17
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.040
in the final static website folder,
I have B2W static.

18
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.315
Right here I'm just going to use this as
a little guideline to make sure I have

19
00:01:11.315 --> 00:01:13.865
my project environment set up correctly.

20
00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:16.905
So you can do the same, or
you could just follow along with me, and

21
00:01:16.905 --> 00:01:20.085
you should be good to go for this step.

22
00:01:20.085 --> 00:01:24.510
So we need to go ahead and create
an assets folder in our blank project,

23
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.564
because right here in the static one,
we have an assets folder.

24
00:01:28.564 --> 00:01:34.893
So go ahead and create an assets folder,
and in our course files,

25
00:01:34.893 --> 00:01:39.381
open up the Download Bootstrap
folder here and

26
00:01:39.381 --> 00:01:43.076
unzip the bootstrap zip folder here.

27
00:01:43.076 --> 00:01:46.768
That is the 3.2.0 version of bootstrap.

28
00:01:46.768 --> 00:01:50.859
So inside this folder,
we have a CSS, fonts, and js.

29
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.605
Sorry, CSS, fonts, and js folders,
go ahead and take those and

30
00:01:55.605 --> 00:01:59.570
just drag them right into your assets
folder for your blank project.

31
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:00.680
I am gonna do that right here.

32
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.110
I'm just going to delete that because
I don't need that right there,

33
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.480
keep the zip file, all good.

34
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.923
Here we go.
So, inside my B2W folder, I have an assets

35
00:02:09.923 --> 00:02:15.742
folder, and the Bootstrap files,
so the css, fonts, and js.

36
00:02:15.742 --> 00:02:17.170
Now I want to do a few things here and

37
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.550
just clean this up because I don't
really need all of these files here.

38
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.610
You can keep them if you'd like but
I'm just gonna get rid of some of these.

39
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.620
So I don't need the theme.css,
because as you can see,

40
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.360
they've also included a theme.min.css.

41
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.420
Min means it's minified, so as you can
see here, I'll give you a preview.

42
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.220
It looks like a bunch of gibberish,
a big mess.

43
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.720
It's all the CSS with all the white space,
all the returns and

44
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.230
everything taken right out.

45
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.164
Here's the theme version,
everything's all readable.

46
00:02:47.164 --> 00:02:51.303
But we don't need it to be readable
because we're gonna be making our own CSS

47
00:02:51.303 --> 00:02:54.036
and we're not gonna be
modifying this CSS at all.

48
00:02:54.036 --> 00:03:00.375
So get rid of the theme.css and
the map files there.

49
00:03:00.375 --> 00:03:02.681
Same with this,
I don't need the css.map or

50
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:05.510
bootstrap.css because we
have a minified version.

51
00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.765
So here we go, nice,
clean css folder theme.min.css and

52
00:03:09.765 --> 00:03:12.584
min.css, that's what we need here.

53
00:03:12.584 --> 00:03:16.925
Let's just go over here to our,
Final Static Website.

54
00:03:16.925 --> 00:03:18.737
Make sure we're doing all right.

55
00:03:18.737 --> 00:03:22.550
Okay so good, we've got those two
folders in there, custom.css and

56
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.010
font-awesome we won't be touching on
until a couple lectures from now.

57
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.740
So we're good for
css folder, fonts folder.

58
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:30.650
We should be good here.

59
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.960
Everything's all good, img folder,
take the img folder and

60
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.140
just copy it into your assets folder
cuz we're gonna need those images.

61
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.910
So I should now have the images folder
with all of the assets I will need, and

62
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.130
then js.

63
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.320
Have a little look.

64
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.220
Okay, looks like we're good.

65
00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.074
We have bootstrap and
min.js, jquery and main.js,

66
00:03:53.074 --> 00:03:58.290
we will be adding in a future lecture,
so don't worry about that.

67
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.540
So it looks like we
have our assets folder.

68
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.232
And then in here we have our Bootstrap
files that we downloaded for

69
00:04:06.232 --> 00:04:07.781
Bootstrap 3.2.0.

70
00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:12.130
We've got css, deleted a couple of files
that we don't need, fonts are good,

71
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.190
we didn't touch that.

72
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.340
We added an images folder
to the assets folder here.

73
00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.330
And js, we're good to go.

74
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.210
So basically that's it,
we've setup our project environment.

75
00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:25.082
Hang on tight because in the next lecture
we're actually going to create our index

76
00:04:25.082 --> 00:04:27.116
file and start coding, my favorite part.

77
00:04:27.116 --> 00:04:30.784
See you there.
