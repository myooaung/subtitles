Hey, everybody, welcome back to Boost
Your Income with Bootstrap to WordPress.

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:04.810
This lecture is called,

3
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.510
Code the "Featurette" Section and
Embed a YouTube Video.

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.144
Awesome.
Check it out.

6
00:00:18.737 --> 00:00:22.382
All right guys, here is the section
we're gonna code in this lecture,

7
00:00:22.382 --> 00:00:25.510
the course introduction,
or the video featurette.

8
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.030
It has a background here that is fixed,
so not necessarily parallaxed.

9
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.355
You can make it parallaxed if you want,

10
00:00:30.355 --> 00:00:32.540
cause you know how to
do that at this point.

11
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.350
However, the background is just fixed,
so it kinda gives that similar effect.

12
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.620
And the video is embedded via YouTube.

13
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.870
And I'll show you how to do that.

14
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:43.990
So let's jump into our code.

15
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.340
Go down to the video featurette
section and let's get coding.

16
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.678
Section id of featurette and then we're
gonna have a little comment down here.

17
00:00:53.678 --> 00:00:54.178
Whoops.

18
00:00:57.556 --> 00:01:05.690
And then in here were gonna
do a <div class="container">.

19
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.149
And within here we'll do a row.

20
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.460
And then </div> A bootstrap column.

21
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.460
And we're going to center this, so
it's not going to be necessarily.

22
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.120
We're only going to have one,
eight column grid here.

23
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.560
But we're going to add an offset of two.

24
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.160
So call, small, offset two.

25
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.150
So it kinda gives a smaller width,
but it's centered.

26
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.072
Level two heading,
watch the course introduction.

27
00:01:40.072 --> 00:01:44.880
All right, and now we're gonna
have to add the embed code,

28
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.620
which is an iFrame, and what you can do
is just head over to your browser, and

29
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.020
navigate to youTube.com/Hussy17,
that is me.

30
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.070
My YouTube channel.

31
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.650
Please subscribe.

32
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.710
And click on Videos.

33
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.400
And then one of the latest videos here,
depending on when you're watching it,

34
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.900
will says Boost Your Income with
Bootstrap to WordPress, coming soon.

35
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:05.830
Click on that video.

36
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.400
And then if you scroll
down you should be able to

37
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.740
hit share and then embed and
that gives you the embed code.

38
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.620
So copy that embed code.

39
00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:27.120
Maybe uncheck this share with playlist so
just don't have this playlist check box.

40
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.330
And just copy the embed code here.

41
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.780
Okay, head back to your code editor and
paste that embed code.

42
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.530
And we're just gonna do
a little bit of a tweak here.

43
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.610
So instead of width 560,
we're gonna say width 100%.

44
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.030
That means the iframe will be
the full width of the column,

45
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.560
the eight column section
that we're within.

46
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.420
And the height will actually be 415.

47
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.190
Now if we save this and check this out,
you'll see it kind of worked,

48
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.990
but it also kind of didn't work.

49
00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.150
So here's our course introduction and
the video looks like it can't be found and

50
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.280
that's because, if you're just in,
if you're not using a local host or

51
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.090
a server and you're just using static
HTML which we are in this case just

52
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.010
hosted here on my desktop, then it
can't find this file for some reason

53
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.780
because we're not technically connected
to the internet through this or a server.

54
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.740
So here's the issue, you can see source
and it doesn't have http or https.

55
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.790
It just has the double forward slashes and
that's because when you're on a server or

56
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.400
when you're live.

57
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.770
Then depending on what
YouTube can serve up.

58
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.470
What their able to serve up HTTP or HTTPS.

59
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.480
This just says hey whatever you can
serve up whether it's secure or

60
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.470
not just send it my way.

61
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.550
And this just lets YouTube decide
what version they want to serve up.

62
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.010
But when you're just using
static HTML on your desktop.

63
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.360
Then this doesn't really work.

64
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.500
So just to see the video, add http or

65
00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.340
https, and then a colon,
and then save that, and

66
00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.470
now your video should work on your
static version of your website.

67
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.760
However, you're not going to need
that http Colon when you're coding

68
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.150
this in your WordPress site, cuz you'll
be hosting this on your local server.

69
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.800
And you won't need to do that because it
will work by that point kind of like this.

70
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.005
This is my local host.

71
00:04:25.005 --> 00:04:25.955
And it works.

72
00:04:25.955 --> 00:04:28.825
And I'm just using the forward,
the two forward slashes.

73
00:04:28.825 --> 00:04:32.855
So you can leave it in now,
the HTTPS or you could take it out so

74
00:04:32.855 --> 00:04:35.385
you can remember later to remove it.

75
00:04:35.385 --> 00:04:37.825
But let's leave it right now
just cause it looks nice.

76
00:04:37.825 --> 00:04:38.415
Okay.

77
00:04:38.415 --> 00:04:39.025
Let's jump back in.

78
00:04:39.025 --> 00:04:43.439
Now that we have the HTML coded we
just need to do a little bit of CSS.

79
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.570
And if you just under your project
features add a little bit of CSS for

80
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:56.910
the featurette, and
that will be fairly simple.

81
00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.545
Background url,

82
00:05:00.545 --> 00:05:08.010
../img/stuff-bg.jpg.

83
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:14.160
Make sure to close that with the string,
and that is an image in our image folder.

84
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:21.680
And then 50%, 100%, that means center and
top, I believe, or center and bottom.

85
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.070
Repeat fixed.

86
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.910
You can play around with that and
see what it does.

87
00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:26.799
Let's just try this.

88
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.760
Save that and let's just see what happens.

89
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.070
Okay so there it is.

90
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.680
And now if I scroll it stays there.

91
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.780
Now let me just shrink my window.

92
00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.710
Do you see how the background
doesn't change?

93
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.110
Like it doesn't change size.

94
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.600
It doesn't scale with
the width of the browser.

95
00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.920
And we're gonna want to do that.

96
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.550
So, all you need to do is go background,
size and cover.

97
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.820
And that will solve that issue for you.

98
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:54.330
So, check it out.

99
00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:04.590
See how it makes sure the image is, up to
a certain point, it kind of scales it.

100
00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:05.350
So this is so

101
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.930
if you have a really large desktop,
it will scale that background image.

102
00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.004
The height and the width of it.

103
00:06:12.004 --> 00:06:15.515
And now text align center and

104
00:06:15.515 --> 00:06:20.050
color:white because that level two

105
00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:25.130
heading is dark and now should be white.

106
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:25.630
Check it out.

107
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.490
And there it is is.

108
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.210
There is our semi paralax background,
our fixed background.

109
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.820
Gives us a neat little affect,

110
00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:37.870
almost like a page folding effect with
the paper coming up above the background.

111
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.240
It looks good.

112
00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.980
And that's it for this section.

113
00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:47.040
And don't go anywhere because in the next
lecture we're going to start coding this

114
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:52.260
jumbo section down here with
Elvis Brad and some cool things.

115
00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.810
There are some cool little things here in
this section that you're gonna like doing.

116
00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:01.450
These are CSS circles with icon font so
this is actually kinda special here.

117
00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:07.160
And these things are circles as well
using CSS3, I think you'll like it.

118
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:07.696
See you in the next lecture.

119
00:07:07.696 --> 00:07:10.401
