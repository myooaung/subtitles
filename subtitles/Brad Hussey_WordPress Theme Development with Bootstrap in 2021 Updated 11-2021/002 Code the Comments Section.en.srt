00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,940
Hey everyone.
Welcome back to Boost Your Income with

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,110
Bootstrap to WordPress.

3
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:09,460
In this video we are going to code and
style our comment section in our blog.

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:18,090
[MUSIC]

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,530
All right, so
it's time to code our comments section.

6
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,570
Now, one thing to note before we start.

7
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,410
I wanna show you what it looks
like here in the static version.

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,830
It's very simple and I,
on purpose, left a few things out.

9
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:35,050
Because in WordPress, the comments
section, when you add the comments,

10
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,830
it's dynamic, and a bunch of information
is added by default by WordPress.

11
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:43,506
Such as profile pictures,
the time that they posted,

12
00:00:43,506 --> 00:00:48,320
their comment, reply links, and
all these things like that.

13
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,170
Things that I didn't really want
to code in the static site.

14
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,710
It's kind of a little redundant,

15
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:57,600
because we don't have to really
code it when we get into WordPress.

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,560
Because it's already built out.

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,690
And all we have to do is style it.

18
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,760
So just wanted to give you a little.

19
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,890
Something to look at and just to get
familiar with how the comments work.

20
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,550
So I'll show you the blog post
here in the final WordPress site.

21
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,880
And at the bottom you
can see the comments.

22
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,522
They look a little different from
our comments here, as you can see.

23
00:01:16,522 --> 00:01:20,700
So you can see there's a profile picture,
and

24
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,220
then Brad -- says,
the date stamp, comment, reply link.

25
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:25,750
Things like that.
So

26
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,420
you can see the general styles are there.

27
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,750
And the comments,
they look a little different.

28
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,760
So that's why I'm not going to worry
too much about how they look on

29
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,810
the static site.

30
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:38,080
Because they will be
different in the final site.

31
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,390
At the bottom,
the form looks essentially the same.

32
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,670
So that's important.

33
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,370
So why don't we just jump in and
start coding.

34
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:48,870
All right.
Here we go.

35
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:50,590
Code editor.

36
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:59,190
Go back to your post.html and
under main, so right here, under posts.

37
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,870
That's where we're going to want
to add our comments section.

38
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:07,750
So, start off by adding a </div>
with the ID of comments.

39
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:18,700
And within there, we're going to add
a </div> with the class of comments wrap.

40
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:25,310
Okay.

41
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,140
And then we'll have a level three heading.

42
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,050
And I'm just going to say four comments.

43
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,210
Right here is where the text
is basically whatever it says.

44
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,380
Three thoughts on whatever.

45
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,170
You know, yada, yada, yada.

46
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,740
So we're just going to
put generic text there.

47
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,810
So, here's just a little flag
to make you remember this.

48
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:48,328
These comments will have an image and

49
00:02:48,328 --> 00:02:53,437
more information when we use WordPress.

50
00:02:53,437 --> 00:02:55,066
All right.

51
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:07,224
After here, let's add an ordered list
with the class of comments-list.

52
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:14,400
And I'm trying my best here to
use actual WordPress markup.

53
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,830
So that we could style it properly.

54
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,320
We don't have to change our styles
too much, once we get into WordPress.

55
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,420
Now let's add a list item
with the class of comment.

56
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,040
Okay.

57
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,900
And in here we will say.

58
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,410
Let's just go.

59
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,430
For our own sake here.

60
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,373
We're going to add level four heading and

61
00:03:35,373 --> 00:03:41,892
say John Smith.

62
00:03:41,892 --> 00:03:43,193
Let's have a small tag.

63
00:03:49,081 --> 00:03:51,610
We'll have a bullet there.

64
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,520
Let's say August 12th.

65
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,020
Not even today's date.

66
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,970
Just making one up.

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,200
And then a </div> with
the class of comment.

68
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,282
Body.
Make sure there's a dash there.

69
00:04:07,222 --> 00:04:08,244
Great.

70
00:04:10,182 --> 00:04:11,135
Whoops.

71
00:04:16,242 --> 00:04:19,450
Within there, we'll have a paragraph tag.

72
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,910
Well, let's just put some
lorem ipsum in there.

73
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:22,750
Good enough.

74
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,420
And then within this list item,
these are gonna be replies.

75
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:33,040
We're going to have another unordered
list with a class of children.

76
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:40,270
And that will have a list item
with the class of comment.

77
00:04:46,608 --> 00:04:50,295
Okay.
And then we'll have another level four

78
00:04:50,295 --> 00:04:51,850
heading.

79
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,647
And let's say Chris McCooper.

80
00:04:55,647 --> 00:04:56,956
Small tag.

81
00:04:56,956 --> 00:04:59,976
And then a bullet here.

82
00:04:59,976 --> 00:05:02,860
August 12, 2014.

83
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:06,692
And then we're going to have comment body.

84
00:05:06,692 --> 00:05:09,380
Lorem ipsum.
Just copy this and paste it in.

85
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,230
Remember, it's not really that important.

86
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:14,130
This section, cause we're going to be
a little bit different in Word Press.

87
00:05:15,928 --> 00:05:16,764
Here we go.

88
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:24,666
And within Chris McCooper's list item,

89
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:29,020
we're gonna have another nested,
ordered list.

90
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,030
The class of children.

91
00:05:34,071 --> 00:05:36,070
And we'll have a list item with a comment.

92
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,530
So let's just copy.

93
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,770
Well no, let's just type it out here.

94
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:46,093
List item with class of comment and

95
00:05:46,093 --> 00:05:48,499
within there,
we'll have another level four heading.

96
00:05:48,499 --> 00:05:49,013
Whoops.

97
00:05:49,013 --> 00:05:49,820
Level four.

98
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,220
This will be Johnny Dee.

99
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:58,610
A small tag here with a bullet.

100
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,270
Say August 12, 2014.

101
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:08,883
After that we'll have comment-body.

102
00:06:13,553 --> 00:06:16,930
And then we'll have just
another paragraph tag there.

103
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,910
With some lorem ipsum.

104
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,530
Here we go.
And

105
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:28,075
after Our, I believe,
list item way out here.

106
00:06:28,075 --> 00:06:31,604
Before the end of comments-list.

107
00:06:31,604 --> 00:06:37,580
Let's just add one more list
item that's not a child.

108
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,948
This will be a top-level list item.

109
00:06:38,948 --> 00:06:41,370
</li> comment.

110
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:46,003
And this will be level four heading.

111
00:06:46,003 --> 00:06:48,441
This one will be Jane Smith.

112
00:06:50,807 --> 00:06:51,645
And again.

113
00:06:52,921 --> 00:06:54,002
Bullet.

114
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:58,785
August 9, 2014.

115
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:03,405
And then comment, body.

116
00:07:03,405 --> 00:07:07,260
In there, we'll have just some
generic lorem ipsum again.

117
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:11,875
Paragraph, lorem ipsum.

118
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,953
All right.

119
00:07:13,953 --> 00:07:15,760
Save that.
Let's see what that looks like so far.

120
00:07:18,341 --> 00:07:21,930
More comments, John Smith,
Jessica Cooper, Johnny D, Jane Smith.

121
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:22,480
There we go.

122
00:07:25,383 --> 00:07:29,005
And now, after our comments list.

123
00:07:29,005 --> 00:07:31,430
So we're gonna have our
leave a comment form.

124
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,860
So let's have an ID.

125
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,016
</div> with the ID of leave-comment.

126
00:07:37,176 --> 00:07:42,690
And that will look a little like this.

127
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,042
Level three.

128
00:07:44,042 --> 00:07:50,350
Leave a comment, form,
and a paragraph tag here.

129
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:58,000
Your email address will not be published.

130
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,430
Required fields are marked.

131
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,160
Span tag with the class of required.

132
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,885
And a little asterisk.

133
00:08:10,885 --> 00:08:12,800
Okay.

134
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,020
After that paragraph,
another paragraph tag.

135
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:22,800
This one will have the class
of comment-form-author.

136
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,550
We'll have a label.

137
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,280
Let's not add a four there.

138
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,460
You can if you want, but
WordPress does all this.

139
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:35,630
Name, input with the ID
of author in the type.

140
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,240
We'll do this here.

141
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,030
Text.
There we go.

142
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,218
Copy this again.

143
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:46,450
Instead of comment-form-author,
this will be comment-form-email.

144
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:51,120
Again change this to email and
then down here, actually we don't need.

145
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:58,975
Let's add, because we did an ID here,
I just realized,

146
00:08:58,975 --> 00:09:02,840
let's do a for, might as well,
author, for author.

147
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,390
Again, these don't really matter how
you code this out because it's gonna be

148
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,270
a little different in WordPress anyway.

149
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:13,250
Label for email and
then this one will be email.

150
00:09:17,427 --> 00:09:18,400
Copy this out.

151
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,760
Paste it below that one.

152
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,578
This one will be comment-form-URL.

153
00:09:23,578 --> 00:09:29,470
Website not required.

154
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,030
This will be for URL.

155
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,610
Type will be URL.

156
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:40,930
Let's change this type to email
up here cuz, be more semantic.

157
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:41,730
ID URL.

158
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,461
Another paragraph tag.

159
00:09:43,461 --> 00:09:46,070
Comment-form-comment.

160
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:49,130
And this will say comment.

161
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:56,340
Technically that would be required for
comment.

162
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:00,071
And this will be instead of an input,
textarea.

163
00:10:00,071 --> 00:10:04,768
Let's put the name.

164
00:10:04,768 --> 00:10:05,360
No.

165
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,850
WordPress will do all that.

166
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:08,150
ID.

167
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:12,020
Comment, take out calls and
rows, or let's play with this.

168
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:12,580
Calls 45.

169
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:17,010
Rows 8.
Textarea, good.

170
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,040
And then one more paragraph tag.

171
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,240
Class of form.

172
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,790
Submit.

173
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,900
And then this will be an input.

174
00:10:28,907 --> 00:10:31,840
The type will be submit.

175
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,520
Name will be submit.

176
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,220
Okay.
Give that a save.

177
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,300
Check it out.

178
00:10:42,655 --> 00:10:44,270
There's our form.

179
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,070
Pretty simple.

180
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,700
Now let's go into CSS and style it up.

181
00:10:50,731 --> 00:10:54,210
Scroll down to your comments section,
right here.

182
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,160
We gave a little spot here.

183
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,330
And we're going to start
down here at the bottom.

184
00:11:00,636 --> 00:11:02,710
And start styling our comments.

185
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:06,235
So we're gonna select ID comments,
then H3.

186
00:11:06,235 --> 00:11:07,383
Text-align center.

187
00:11:07,383 --> 00:11:09,045
We want to center that up.

188
00:11:09,045 --> 00:11:10,316
Comments H4.

189
00:11:10,316 --> 00:11:12,011
Font size 1.3em.

190
00:11:12,011 --> 00:11:17,136
That means it'll be,
I guess you could consider

191
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:23,180
that 130% larger than
the default font size.

192
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,670
Font.
The font size,

193
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:28,785
if you were to say is 12 pixels,
1em is 12 pixels.

194
00:11:28,785 --> 00:11:34,490
1.3em is, I believe that would
count as 30% larger than 12 pixels.

195
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:36,310
So whatever that equals out to.

196
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,670
It's just a little bit of math.

197
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,295
It's a bit larger than default font size.

198
00:11:40,295 --> 00:11:42,973
Comments ol.

199
00:11:42,973 --> 00:11:45,876
List style, none.

200
00:11:45,876 --> 00:11:47,584
Padding 0.

201
00:11:47,584 --> 00:11:49,120
Margin 0.

202
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,044
Comments ol li.

203
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:59,856
Background, I'm gonna use some RGBA 000.

204
00:11:59,856 --> 00:12:04,149
And then 0.02.

205
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:09,850
That's very small,
very tiny alfa transparency.

206
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:13,100
So, it's basically black but
very, very transparent.

207
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,740
You can change that if you
want to a solid color.

208
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,850
But, I just wanna do this, because I
wanna show you what we're gonna be doing.

209
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,320
It's a little bit of a magic trick.

210
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:29,205
10 pixels, 20 pixels, margin, 10 pixels,
0 so 10, top and bottom, 0 left and right.

211
00:12:29,205 --> 00:12:32,680
Webkit-border-radius will be 4 pixels.

212
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:39,364
Let's do moz-border-radius 4 and
straight up border-radius 4.

213
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,750
And then border will be solid one pixel.

214
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,225
RGBA 0, 0, 0, 0.03.

215
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:54,304
So just a little darker
than the background.

216
00:12:54,304 --> 00:12:58,510
And now let's style comments.

217
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,510
ol li and then ol, the class of children.

218
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,050
So we're selecting those children.

219
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,290
Padding 0.

220
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,328
The style none.

221
00:13:05,328 --> 00:13:11,390
Font size 0.96M.

222
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:16,080
So just under the default font size.

223
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:21,550
And the reason why I'm using ems
is because with each child within,

224
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:26,030
that's nested, so with each reply the font
size will gradually get smaller just by

225
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:31,750
a little bit, by 4% I believe.

226
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,215
And then we're gonna style,

227
00:13:33,215 --> 00:13:43,215
leave-comment.

228
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,120
And this will say margin, 40 pixels, 0, 0.

229
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,240
Padding will be 20 pixels, 0, 0.

230
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,710
Border top, solid, 1 pixel, EEE.

231
00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:01,580
Now, let me just explain here why I
use RGBA, here, in the background.

232
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,050
And why I'm using this.

233
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:07,880
Because, with every li that's
nested within another li,

234
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,270
the background is gonna
get slightly darker.

235
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:17,970
Because we're using a transparent
background that is 2% alpha transparency.

236
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:22,170
So it's going to slightly get darker and
darker as it stacks on top.

237
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,400
So if we save that,
I'll show you what that looks like.

238
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,990
Here we go.
You can see, hopefully you can see,

239
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,640
that the background is getting
slightly darker with each reply.

240
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,180
So, this has a cool cascade effect.

241
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:37,810
Like that.
Now,

242
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,750
we're just going to do one more
thing here with the comments.

243
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:45,850
Scroll back up to the very very top of,
blog.

244
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:52,046
And in there, we're going to add,
after the widget,

245
00:14:52,046 --> 00:14:55,130
the ID of comments.

246
00:14:55,130 --> 00:15:02,520
And then down here after post body, we're
gonna add comments and then comments-wrap.

247
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,610
Save that.

248
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:06,520
That will give you this look right there.

249
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,170
Boom.

250
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,900
So now you can see the background
a little bit better,

251
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,530
as they cascade within each other.

252
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:11,760
Kinda has this cool effect.

253
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,740
And you see the font size
gets slightly smaller.

254
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:21,420
Same happens on the default or
the final WordPress site.

255
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:25,350
You can see cascades font size just
gets a little bit smaller, and

256
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:29,470
the background just gets a little
bit darker with each new reply.

257
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,410
Cool, that is it for the comment section.

258
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,370
You did it.

259
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:37,912
You did the blog, the overview, and
the blog detail, the full post.

260
00:15:37,912 --> 00:15:38,690
All right.

261
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:39,750
So hang on tight,

262
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:45,320
because in the next series of lectures
we're going to be coding a lot more.

263
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,880
Much more, in fact.

264
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,108
But the next few lectures will
be about the resources section.

265
00:15:50,108 --> 00:15:55,510
And I will explain to you why resource
pages are incredibly important for

266
00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:00,629
your blogs, your client websites,
personal websites, your niche websites,

267
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,640
your company websites, if I didn't all
ready say that, and why they will be

268
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:10,330
beneficial to you, your customers, your
clients, and how they can make you much.

269
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,813
See you there.

270
00:16:11,813 --> 00:16:15,279
