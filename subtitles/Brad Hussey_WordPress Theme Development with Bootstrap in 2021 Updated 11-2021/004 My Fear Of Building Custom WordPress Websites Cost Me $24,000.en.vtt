Hey everybody welcome back to Boost Your
Income with Bootstrap for WordPress.

00:00:02.486 --> 00:00:06.748
This lecture is called
How My Fear of Building

3
00:00:06.748 --> 00:00:11.803
a Custom WordPress Website Cost Me
$24,000.

4
00:00:11.803 --> 00:00:19.757

5
00:00:19.757 --> 00:00:25.390
All right, so let me tell you a little
story about me and my career.

6
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.910
So basically when I started building
websites, I was fresh out of college.

7
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.830
I just learned how to design and
develop websites.

8
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:43.440
So I would design a website in Photoshop
and then I would slice up that design and

9
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.960
turn it into an HTML CSS and
JavaScript website.

10
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.490
I knew a little PHP so
I would make it a little dynamic.

11
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.880
Just to save me some time I would have
some global headers, footers, and

12
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.120
sidebars.

13
00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.670
Maybe a dynamic date.

14
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.470
Maybe even a contact form.

15
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.310
I knew a little bit.

16
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.990
I was pretty good at what I
knew which was HTMLs, CSS,

17
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.010
JavaScript and PHP, and
designing in Photoshop.

18
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.510
And I was pretty good at getting clients,
too.

19
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.500
I would get clients that would want me to
build their websites, and it was great.

20
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.280
I was fresh out of college, and I was
looking for some work, and so as a side

21
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.230
job, I would take on a couple clients and
do a few HTML and CSS websites.

22
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:35.300
And the budgets save me
anywhere from $500 to $1,000.

23
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.440
Maybe the biggest one I would do would
be $1200, and that was pushing it.

24
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.020
Because I was just starting, and
it was just a side business.

25
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.530
And I was looking for a job,

26
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.090
and I eventually got a job
at a full time studio.

27
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.020
So it was, it was kinda just on the side.

28
00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.170
And I didn't have expert level skill,
but I was pretty good at the business

29
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.650
aspect of it and getting work and
delivering pretty good quality websites.

30
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.590
However I started getting
requests from clients,

31
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.080
my current clients and some new clients.

32
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.060
Word of mouth started kind of happening.

33
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.330
I started getting some new referrals
from my older clients, and

34
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.230
they'd say I want a website.

35
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.570
I want like a website where I can update
it myself really easily, some blog posts.

36
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:31.270
I want to be able to add
certain features and

37
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.190
do that stuff myself,
can you do that for me?

38
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.150
And then I knew from my experience
in college and from obviously

39
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.420
working as a freelancer,
freelance web designer and web developer.

40
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.830
I knew that that meant I
needed to know WordPress or

41
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.640
other content management systems.

42
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.290
But I knew WordPress was the most popular.

43
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.820
So I didn't know how to do it, and it
scared me because I remember at one point

44
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.900
I looked into it and
was like holly molly, I can't do that.

45
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.940
That's way too advanced for me,
I don't want to learn that.

46
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.070
It's scary.

47
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.130
So I'm just not gonna touch it.

48
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:18.380
And so I get these requests and I would
just have to say, sorry I'm too busy.

49
00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.830
I can't take on that project right now.

50
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.480
But really all I was saying was,
I don't know how to do that and

51
00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.100
I don't wanna take on a project
that is gonna stress me out and

52
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.670
I'm gonna under deliver or
not be able to deliver at all.

53
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.490
That makes me look bad.

54
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.980
But I realized I was just losing
out on work, and lots of work,

55
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.316
cuz I started getting requests all
the time, on a regular basis every month,

56
00:03:40.316 --> 00:03:42.910
I got people saying I'd love for
you to do my website.

57
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.640
My friend or my colleague, you did
their website before and they loved it.

58
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.790
I'd really love to work with you.

59
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.350
I just want it to have x, y, and

60
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.630
z, and x, y, and
z is usually update my website myself.

61
00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:00.480
Add certain features myself and
have a blog, or something like that.

62
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.260
And I was, I just couldn't do that.

63
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.600
And I was afraid.

64
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.310
My fear got in the way of me
taking my business to a new level.

65
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:16.540
And in hindsight when I look at that,
the amount of money that I lost out for,

66
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.860
it was probably about a year where I just
avoided WordPress projects altogether.

67
00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.780
Was I would say in
the ballpark of $24,000 and

68
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.860
the reason why I say that is because I was
working before in the smaller budget range

69
00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.483
like I would say average $1,000 websites,

70
00:04:35.483 --> 00:04:40.100
but WordPress is totally different when
you're developing custom WordPress

71
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.300
websites even as a beginner
WordPress developer,

72
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.250
you shouldn't be charging any
less than a couple of grand for

73
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.200
a WordPress project, because it's
a lot of work that goes into it.

74
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.900
There's a lot of details.

75
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.380
You're delivering high value,

76
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.250
and the reason why you should be charging
higher is because they're not gonna

77
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.049
be coming back to you as often because
they can update the website themselves.

78
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.250
When you do just static HTML sites,
they gotta keep coming back to you and

79
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.210
say, I have a new team
member in my dental clinic.

80
00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.600
I need you to add a new page or
can you add this article?

81
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.020
Or I wanna add more pictures.

82
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.370
Here are the pictures, can you add that?

83
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.840
And then you, they keep coming back to
you so you charge them your hourly rate.

84
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.000
And it is an ongoing sort of maintenance.

85
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.860
But with WordPress, they can add pages,
they can add blog posts,

86
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.140
they can add widgets, they can add
contact forms, they can update,

87
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.860
they can delete stuff, they can do
a whole bunch of stuff by themselves,

88
00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.060
so that's work that you're not getting.

89
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.300
So for them it's incredibly valuable.

90
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.230
So you should be charging more,
they're just worth way more.

91
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.910
And 2,000, that's at the bottom end.

92
00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.393
So as a beginner,
I estimated that I would be a beginner

93
00:05:47.393 --> 00:05:51.575
WordPress developer by that if I
were accepting those projects.

94
00:05:51.575 --> 00:05:54.439
And I would probably be
charging about $2,000.

95
00:05:54.439 --> 00:06:00.673
So that's $2,000 every month
that I was missing out on.

96
00:06:00.673 --> 00:06:04.720
Which means $24,000 in a year.

97
00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.750
I totally missed out on.

98
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.230
And I realized that's not,
that's not gonna work for me.

99
00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:14.010
If I want to grow as a business person,

100
00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.970
as an entrepreneur,
I want to grow in my career.

101
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:23.820
If I want to spread my expertise and
grow my client base if

102
00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.670
I wanna make a living off of this,
I need to be doing Wordpress projects.

103
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:32.760
And at this point, I would say 95%
of the freelance work that I get

104
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.660
is WordPress,
just exclusively WordPress, and

105
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.650
other content management systems
that are more advanced, so

106
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:48.430
when I committed to learning WordPress I
boosted my income significantly.

107
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:53.260
I made way more money every single
month to the point now where

108
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.482
if I just didn't do WordPress projects
I probably wouldn't be able to have

109
00:06:57.482 --> 00:07:02.990
a smooth running, successful freelance

110
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:08.100
business because when I look at my
invoices most of them are WordPress or

111
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:12.500
WordPress related projects,
whether that's updating WordPress site or

112
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:17.830
developing a totally custom
CMS driven with WordPress,

113
00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.710
so I don't want you to make the same
mistake if your at the beginning of your

114
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:26.690
career and your getting emails saying
like, can you develop a website for me and

115
00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:30.990
I wanna be able to do this and
that and that's for sure WordPress or

116
00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.720
I could that should be done in
WordPress and you have to decline it or

117
00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.610
send it to a friend or pay a friend to
do it, you're missing out on money.

118
00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:41.400
You're missing out on a couple grand,
three grand,

119
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:46.100
four grand even depending on how
big the site is for a project.

120
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.380
And if you're getting regular requests,
you're missing out on thousands of dollars

121
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:53.560
and you could be incredibly successful
making a lot of money building custom

122
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:57.970
WordPress websites, so
don't make the mistake that I did.

123
00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:02.160
Lean WordPress let me show you.

124
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.090
I'm showing you from an angle
that this can make you money.

125
00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:09.690
I'm not just showing you
from WordPress is great,

126
00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:13.670
its fun to learn, and
you can amp up your development skills.

127
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:16.356
No.
That's not what I'm trying to show you.

128
00:08:16.356 --> 00:08:20.781
I'm trying to show you learning this,
this is gonna rock your world,

129
00:08:20.781 --> 00:08:26.031
this can improve your career greatly or it
can allow you to start a brand new career,

130
00:08:26.031 --> 00:08:28.660
and that the angle I'm taking with this.

131
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.290
So the amount of money that your paid for

132
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:34.170
this course is nothing at all,
it's pennies compared to the amount of

133
00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:37.940
money that you will be be able to make
with the skill that I'm giving you.

134
00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:40.080
So high value is what
I'm going to give you.

135
00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:43.270
All right, see you in the next lecture.

136
00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:47.550
Where I'm gonna drive the point home
about static versus dynamic websites.

137
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:50.310
If you're still not convinced
that dynamic WordPress

138
00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:53.540
driven websites is better
to just hand code HTML.

139
00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:54.800
Static stuff,

140
00:08:54.800 --> 00:09:01.010
then I'm gonna drive that home to make you
fully understand what you should be doing.

141
00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:01.715
Static versus dynamic.

142
00:09:01.715 --> 00:09:02.330
See you there.

143
00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:06.689
