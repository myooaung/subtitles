Hey guys welcome back to Boost Your Income
with Bootstrap to WordPress.

2
00:00:02,828 --> 00:00:06,562
This is a cool lecture,
I'm gonna introduce you to an awesome,

3
00:00:06,562 --> 00:00:09,199
free plugin called Advanced Custom Fields.

4
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:18,025

5
00:00:18,025 --> 00:00:23,210
All right, amazing plugin, advanced
custom fields so that's what it's called.

6
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:27,990
Basically, everything that we
just did in our dashboard for

7
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:33,520
the custom fields, advanced custom
fields takes that process and

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,020
makes it way more intuitive,
way easier to work with.

9
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,490
It's better for you as a developer and
it's better for

10
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:47,470
your client when they're in the dashboard
and trying to update their content.

11
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:52,780
Essentially, what advanced custom fields
lets you do instead of just having,

12
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,020
when you add a new page and

13
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,310
you have a new template like we
created our home page template.

14
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:02,960
Instead of just having our text bar and
our big text box, or our text field and

15
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,478
a big text box and then some custom
fields, you can totally modify

16
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:13,810
the input that you can have on your pages.

17
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:18,550
So instead of just text field,
text box, you can have text field.

18
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,580
You can have an image.

19
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,730
You can have custom text fields,
custom text boxes, radio buttons.

20
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:30,120
All these sorts of things that allow you
to customize what you want to have on

21
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:35,340
the front end of your site rather than
just using this to put into some HTML.

22
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:42,360
So you'll see what I mean as we start
going through and using custom fields,

23
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,800
advanced custom fields.

24
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,570
But here's the website.

25
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,530
And the best part about it is it's free.

26
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:49,970
Totally free.

27
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:54,090
And I've used the free version
on a handful of sites.

28
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,810
Probably about 15 or
20 sites at this point.

29
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,760
Maybe that's more than a handful.

30
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,200
And I've never looked back, it's amazing.

31
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,360
The only thing is that
if you want even more

32
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,130
power and customization,
you could get the pro version.

33
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,420
And it's really not that expensive, and

34
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,290
like I said it's not
It's not required at all.

35
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,780
I think it's, so

36
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,860
the personal license is 25 bucks,
Australian, so it's really not a lot.

37
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,060
And I've only used
a personal license once.

38
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:33,020
I bought one personal license on a certain
site, and it lets you do certain things

39
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:39,080
like repeater fields and gallery fields,
flexible content options pages.

40
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,810
Stuff that you don't need to do yet.

41
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,590
And when you get to that point,
you'll know.

42
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:50,540
You'll think oh, you know what, it'll be
so great to have the ability to do this.

43
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,220
Like have a repeater section.

44
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,820
But it's not required and it's most
certainly not required for this course.

45
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,670
Although if you want to get it, and you
think, aw man, I'm totally gonna get this,

46
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,490
it's amazing, I know, I'm gonna use that.

47
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,540
Then go ahead.

48
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,910
It's great.
It works seamlessly with the free version.

49
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,900
So you don't need to worry about that.

50
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:17,920
So basically go ahead and download the
free version of advanced custom fields.

51
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,770
You can do it right here.

52
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,273
You can hit Download & Install.

53
00:03:20,273 --> 00:03:21,561
It'll take you to the plugin directory.

54
00:03:21,561 --> 00:03:25,680
So you can just download it right here, or

55
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,920
what would be better is just
going straight to your dashboard,

56
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:38,530
going to Plugins > Add New and
search for Advanced Custom Fields.

57
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:42,500
That'll come up here at
the very top by Elliot Condon.

58
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,100
I think I pronounced that right.

59
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,570
Maybe it's Condon.

60
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:47,178
Condon?
I don't know.

61
00:03:47,178 --> 00:03:49,181
Go ahead and install that plugin.

62
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:56,250
And make sure to activate it once
it's unpacked and installed.

63
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,450
And then you will have access
to custom fields right here.

64
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:07,360
So, if you click on that, it gives you
a section here called field groups.

65
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,408
And then, basically, here's where
you start using your custom fields.

66
00:04:12,408 --> 00:04:17,402
So, we're gonna get into the real world
application when it comes to this site

67
00:04:17,402 --> 00:04:19,076
in the next few lectures.

68
00:04:19,076 --> 00:04:22,580
So I won't go through with how to work
with this now because we're gonna be doing

69
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,530
some really cool stuff
in the next lecture.

70
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,036
So see you there.
