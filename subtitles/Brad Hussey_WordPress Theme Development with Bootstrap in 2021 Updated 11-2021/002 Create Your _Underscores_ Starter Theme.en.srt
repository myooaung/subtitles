Hey everyone, welcome back to Boost
Your Income with BootStrap WordPress.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,170
This program is called Creating
your "Underscores" Starter Theme.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:15,385

4
00:00:15,385 --> 00:00:17,845
All right,
now that we've downloaded WordPress.

5
00:00:17,845 --> 00:00:21,805
Very simple lecture,
probably my favorite simple lecture.

6
00:00:21,805 --> 00:00:23,575
We're going to start getting
into the heavier stuff.

7
00:00:23,575 --> 00:00:26,525
Although this lecture is a little
bit light weight as well,

8
00:00:26,525 --> 00:00:29,255
it does get pretty intense but
that is great.

9
00:00:29,255 --> 00:00:31,935
No pain no gain when it
comes to this stuff.

10
00:00:31,935 --> 00:00:36,130
Okay, so basically what we're
gonna do is we're gonna use

11
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:40,370
a starter theme called Underscores,
and the URL is underscores.me.

12
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:43,500
And basically what they do

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,620
is give you just a starter template for
a WordPress theme.

14
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:51,770
There's nothing in it,
like it doesn't have a theme prebuilt.

15
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,930
It's not like when you go
to themeforest.com and

16
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,760
you buy a WordPress theme
that a developer built.

17
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,890
It's just a skeleton bare bones theme
structure so you can build on top of it.

18
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:07,460
It gives you all the default WordPress PHP
templates that you need to code.

19
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,090
It gives you a basic style sheet
that you can add your own styles to.

20
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,860
It's just a bare bones
plain starter them so

21
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,290
that you can build your own theme on top.

22
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,240
The reason why you want this is because
it's gonna save you so much time.

23
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,990
Literally hours and hours and hours and
hours and so much of a headache.

24
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,190
I don't know why you
wouldn't start with this.

25
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:33,800
Most of the developers that I know who
build custom WordPress themes start with,

26
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,020
in fact, Underscores,
because it saves so much time.

27
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,790
And the bigger the project,
the more hours you're gonna save.

28
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:43,800
So don't reinvent the wheel because
it's already here for you and

29
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,690
you don't need to be a hero.

30
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,870
Basically starter theme called
Underscorers, meant for

31
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:52,620
hacking, dont' use me as a parent theme,
instead try turning me into the next most

32
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,330
awesome WordPress theme out there,
which is what we're about to do.

33
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:01,590
Ultra minimal CSS and
well commented HTML5 templates,

34
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,950
404 template, sample headers and

35
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:10,820
a bunch of other fun stuff that we can
use when recording our WordPress themes.

36
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,880
So, head to underscores.me and

37
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,070
what we're gonna do is just
create our Underscores theme.

38
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:22,890
So the theme name,
let's call it Bootstrap to WordPress.

39
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,290
Theme slug bootstrap2wordpress.

40
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:30,040
It could be whatever, but I wanted
to call it bootstrap2wordpress and

41
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,320
if you could keep it the same as me,
it might be easy for you.

42
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,880
So that in the future when we're
doing these lectures maybe

43
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,590
you might see that my code's
a little bit different than yours.

44
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,270
Because you might have called
your theme something different or

45
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,260
have a different slug.

46
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,800
So, keep it the same for now and

47
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,010
in your future WordPress themes
you could do whatever you want.

48
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,580
Author Brad Hussey,
you could put your name.

49
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:55,570
Author URI that is your website and

50
00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:02,290
a custom WordPress theme using Bootstrap.

51
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,700
Don't sassify because we're not gonna
be using sass, we're just using CSS.

52
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,540
Generate that, and

53
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,790
you will get a download with your
Bootstrap to WordPress starter theme.

54
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,470
Here it is, so
you have all the basic pages and

55
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,200
templates that we're gonna be using,
404, archive,

56
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,960
comments, basic content pages,
footer, functions very important.

57
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,530
We have an includes folder with
a few things if we wanted to

58
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,060
do some stuff like that.

59
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,620
JS folder, some layouts,
basically we're gonna use

60
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:37,310
this skeleton template to create our
own theme, so basically that's it.

61
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:41,481
And basically in the next lecture,
we are going to install WordPress,

62
00:03:41,481 --> 00:03:46,069
get it started on our local server and
we're gonna install our starter theme so

63
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:49,630
that we can actually get started and
get into the good stuff.

64
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,330
See you there.

65
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,759
