1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:07,300
Guys I gotta tell you about
this contact form plugin.

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:15,590
[MUSIC]

3
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:19,663
So now we need to add the contact form
plugin which is Contact Form 7 if you do

4
00:00:19,663 --> 00:00:22,180
a quick search here in your plugins.

5
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,650
Add a new plugin and
search for Contact Form 7.

6
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:30,060
It will show up here at the very top as
the most downloaded content form plugin.

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,040
I'm pretty sure it's up there with
22.6 million downloads at this point.

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,900
So it's super good, infinitely
flexible and you can keep it simple or

9
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,010
you can go intense.

10
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:47,748
We're gonna keep it simple but we're gonna
do some custom work within Contact Form 7.

11
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:52,842
They have a really good documentation
on the website for Contact Form 7,

12
00:00:52,842 --> 00:00:56,784
and you can always follow that
if you have any questions or

13
00:00:56,784 --> 00:01:00,666
problems really good
documentation on the site there.

14
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:04,680
So we're gonna install that, go ahead and
install and activate that plug in.

15
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,752
And when you're ready jump into the plug
in itself right here under contact.

16
00:01:10,752 --> 00:01:13,200
So you just click on contact,
which will be installed.

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,800
That's Contact Form 7 and you can go
ahead and add a new contact form.

18
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,860
Or you can add,
modify the one that's currently there.

19
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,365
I'm just gonna show you
what's currently there so

20
00:01:22,365 --> 00:01:24,880
you can see an example of
how Contact Form 7 works.

21
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,860
So this is basically how it works.

22
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,030
It has its own little syntax
of how you put in inputs and

23
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,480
labels and classes and so on and so forth.

24
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,420
You could see here if I
wanna put in a text input,

25
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,080
you would put it in square brackets,
and you would say text and

26
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,622
if it was required, right after the type
of input you have an asterisk, and

27
00:01:46,622 --> 00:01:51,940
then your-name is basically
what the input name is.

28
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:58,190
Same here, you've got an email
input to require your email.

29
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:02,940
That is the name attribute of the input.

30
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:08,850
And then down here we have text which
is a text field and your subject.

31
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:14,820
And then we have text area which is
a text area and it's not required.

32
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,370
Your message is the name attribute and

33
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,050
then down here we have a submit
button with a value of Send.

34
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,380
And over here you can generate tags,
and it's really cool what you can do.

35
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:29,380
You can literally do all the inputs,
and it's cool.

36
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:34,141
You've got text fields, emails, you got
numbers, you can do spin box, dates,

37
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:36,560
drop down menus check boxes acceptance.

38
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,916
You can do quiz, you can add captchas,
file uploads and submit buttons.

39
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:43,170
So it's pretty cool and so
down here you could see

40
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,400
in order to send them an email over
the mail server in this mail metabox.

41
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,220
You could see who its going to so
youremail.com and

42
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,420
from who's it from and
then the subject and additional headers.

43
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,470
Then in the message body, and
this is editable, you can

44
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:06,870
update how the message body displays
using the, and you can see in the syntax,

45
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:11,310
to use the score brackets, and
then the mean of the name attribute.

46
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,450
That will give you the value of the input.

47
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:20,330
So your name If you look up here, the text
box had your name as the name attribute,

48
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:24,640
which will give you that value and
then that will display an email.

49
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,320
So it's pretty cool.

50
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,700
And then it's customizable down here.

51
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,360
You could do a lot more.

52
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,060
And you could do additional settings
like JavaScript if you wanna submit to

53
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,545
a separate page and blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, it's really cool.

54
00:03:34,545 --> 00:03:39,090
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna add
a new contact form, and I'm just gonna say

55
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,030
Primary Contact Form, and down here,
I'm gonna remove everything.

56
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:47,668
And what we're gonna do now is we're gonna
jump over into the Code Editor because

57
00:03:47,668 --> 00:03:54,310
we're gonna code right in here and
then copy and paste it.

58
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,740
Because there's actually quite
a bit of HTML that we have to do.

59
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,760
Because we have to copy from
our static contact page and

60
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,480
then make that friendly with
Contact Form 7, using their syntax.

61
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,410
So go ahead and open the static
version of your contact page and

62
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:14,310
then copy the form right here.

63
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:19,746
Copy that, paste it in your empty page

64
00:04:19,746 --> 00:04:24,860
here and let's start making this
friendly for contact room seven.

65
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,900
You don't need the form tag, because
it's gonna dynamically add that itself.

66
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:34,510
So remove the form tag and
then we're gonna leave any structural kind

67
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:39,090
of layout markup, like the rows and the
columns, form groups and so on, so forth.

68
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,690
So right here in the label,
that's fine, we'll leave Name.

69
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,640
But the input,
this is going to be done byContact Form 7.

70
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:51,074
So right after it I'm gonna do
the syntax for Contact Form 7 and

71
00:04:51,074 --> 00:04:53,870
then we'll remove the R
coded HTML version.

72
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,870
Open and close square brackets and this
is a text field I want it to be required

73
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:04,810
the name

74
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,620
attribute I want to be your name and
then the class.

75
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:15,215
If you wanna add a class to Contact Form
7 input, you just say class: and

76
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:19,490
then you could put your class here,
form-control.

77
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:25,371
If you want another class, you just say
class again and than input-lg, great.

78
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,680
And then I want an id.

79
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,930
Same deal, id:contact-name.

80
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:35,090
Obviously, you can only have one id,
so you can't put multiple.

81
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:42,600
And then placeholder looks like so,
placeholder "Your name".

82
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,200
So that is the syntax.

83
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,060
We're gonna do that for email as well.

84
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,300
Well, after we remove
this hard-coded input.

85
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,180
We got our email input here.

86
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,870
This is gonna be opening and
closing square brackets, email.

87
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:03,680
It's required, your-email will be the name
attribute, class is form-control.

88
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,733
We have another class,
and that is input-lg.

89
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:17,540
ID is contact-email
the placeholder space your email.

90
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:22,710
Great and then remove the input the hard
coded one and we have our text area.

91
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:28,755
Actually we're gonna put
a subject as well, why not?

92
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:33,327
So I'm gonna copy this col-sml-12 and

93
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:40,439
I'm gonna paste it right before and
I'm gonna change this HTML and

94
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:46,916
this is gonna say label and
we're gonna have class sr only for

95
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:51,490
screen readers only for contact subject.

96
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,040
And then,
we're going to have to say subject, and

97
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,050
then right here we're gonna
use our Contact Form 7 syntax.

98
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:08,037
Text* your-subject class:form-control

99
00:07:08,037 --> 00:07:13,870
class:input-lg id:contact-subject,

100
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:20,250
so that label has something to associate.

101
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:28,040
Placeholder "Your subject",
you get the idea.

102
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,350
And now we have the text area.

103
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:36,450
Right here we're gonna say in
square brackets [textarea].

104
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:42,666
This is also required,
your-message class:form-control

105
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:47,241
class:input-lg id:contact-words x3,

106
00:07:47,241 --> 00:07:50,769
means it could do rows and columns.

107
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:55,429
And to do rows in a text area the syntax,

108
00:07:55,429 --> 00:08:02,360
you just have to say x3 because
I want the rows to be three.

109
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:09,130
Placeholder "Your message" awesome.

110
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:13,660
And now the submit button, well first get
rid of this text area, submit button,

111
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,964
this is how we do this in Contact Form 7.

112
00:08:15,964 --> 00:08:19,828
Submit class:btn

113
00:08:19,828 --> 00:08:27,584
class:btn-info class:btn-lg.

114
00:08:27,584 --> 00:08:32,860
Another class:pull-right, and

115
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:40,090
then just "Get in touch" and that is the
value that will display for the button.

116
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,630
And then remove the hard coded one.

117
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:45,600
Copy this, paste it in the form here.

118
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,610
There you go and down here,

119
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,890
make sure to update the information
where you want the form to send to.

120
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:56,160
So you could put to your@email.com,
obviously your real one.

121
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,890
And then from your name, and then the
email, you could even do something like,

122
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,090
you can select the email
that it was sent from.

123
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:06,700
So up here, you have your email,
your-name your-mail.

124
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:10,760
Now I'll put the person's email so
you can hit reply and reply right to them.

125
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,060
Your subject, this is all good.

126
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,710
And everything looks good on here, your
name, your email, your message, perfect.

127
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:25,380
And then you go ahead and save that.

128
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:32,130
Head back to your contact page and
then all you need to do,

129
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:37,130
to add that Contact Form 7 in there is use
the short code that they provide here.

130
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:44,120
So just copy, what they give right here
and then go back to the page, paste that.

131
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,530
Contact Form 7, perfect, update.

132
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,540
Now if I go and view that page,
we'll see what happens.

133
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:56,240
There it is, and it's almost perfect,
something going on here and

134
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,650
I'm assuming it's just
a little bit of an html bug.

135
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:02,460
It looks like to me I just got a couple
break, I got a break tag here,

136
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,960
and a couple empty tags.

137
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,670
And it's probably just because
when you go back to here and

138
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:11,500
I think what is happening is I
have these comments here and

139
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,330
I think it's translating them
into break tags or something.

140
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:17,040
So what we're gonna do is go
back to our code editor and

141
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,640
remove all of those comments.

142
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,060
We don't actually need them and
copy this again, paste it back.

143
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:28,930
Save, let's refresh this page and
we're good to go.

144
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,990
There it is,
now this should technically work but

145
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:35,830
if your unlocal host a lot of the time,
the email server won't actually send, so

146
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:38,880
you'll have to wait until you're
actually live to test this out.

147
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,460
But it does have validation and

148
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:45,110
everything is all set up, good to
go in your Contact Form 7, awesome.

149
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:49,930
That's it for this module, for the contact
page and you pretty much nailed it.

150
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,990
The only other thing is,
I just see up here

151
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:57,850
that the contact tab isn't
highlighted when you're on it.

152
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:03,370
So when you're on these pages,
these styles should actually be in there.

153
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:07,440
So while we're here,
let's just jump into our CSS, real fast.

154
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,830
So here in our CSS we just need
to scroll to the menu section.

155
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,720
Let's just go down to 5.2.

156
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,012
We just need to add a couple
WordPress specific styles here and

157
00:11:17,012 --> 00:11:19,520
right here we're gonna select navbar-nav.

158
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:25,760
Directly under that li with the class of
current_page_item and a tag within it.

159
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,390
And this is automatically added
by WordPress to the markup and

160
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:32,660
if you just inspect
the element on the live site

161
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:37,520
that you're working on you can see
when you're on a current page the list

162
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:42,240
items of the navigation have classes
That are called current page item.

163
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,330
And there are also other
classes that are added as well.

164
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:50,823
So, like this,
navbar-nav directly under that

165
00:11:50,823 --> 00:11:56,839
I also want to select
li.current_page_parent a and

166
00:11:56,839 --> 00:11:59,690
the color with be white.

167
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,400
I save that.

168
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:04,240
That should solve the problem,
there we go.

169
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,012
Any page I go to now,
we should be good to go and looking nice.

170
00:12:10,012 --> 00:12:12,240
All right, so that's it for
this module, the contact page.

171
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,700
And basically you did most of the site.

172
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,182
There's quite a bit left
in terms of clean up, and

173
00:12:17,182 --> 00:12:20,920
making it a little bit more advanced,
and extending your WordPress site.

174
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,791
And that's what the next
section's all about,

175
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:25,220
we're gonna extend the functionality
of our WordPress site.

176
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,300
So I'll see you there.

177
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:31,562
