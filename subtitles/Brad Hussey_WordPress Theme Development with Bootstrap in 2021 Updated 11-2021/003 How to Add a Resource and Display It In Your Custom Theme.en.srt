00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,054
Hey there, welcome back to
Boost Your Income with [NOISE],

2
00:00:03,054 --> 00:00:07,021
in this lecture we're going to be doing
some resources with custom post types UI.

3
00:00:07,021 --> 00:00:15,509
[MUSIC]

4
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:18,508
Hey, hey, all right, so
what we're going to do now is,

5
00:00:18,508 --> 00:00:21,331
first of all we're just
gonna fix this content here.

6
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:24,044
We need to actually make this
dynamic right now, static, but

7
00:00:24,044 --> 00:00:27,188
then we're gonna get right into what
the point of what this lecture is.

8
00:00:27,188 --> 00:00:31,842
And that is to make custom post types,
so we can easily add and

9
00:00:31,842 --> 00:00:35,695
remove and
edit resources to our resources page.

10
00:00:35,695 --> 00:00:39,525
Head back to your code editor and
basically down here,

11
00:00:39,525 --> 00:00:43,780
we're in the main content section,
get rid of everything.

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,020
Basically inside of main content.

13
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,970
So just the two paragraph tags, actually.

14
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:56,410
So paragraph tag, paragraph tag
right before the horizontal rule.

15
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:01,740
So, in here we need to initiate the loop.

16
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:07,276
So a while have_posts and then we're gonna

17
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:13,445
use a colon here cuz we're
using the shorthand.

18
00:01:13,445 --> 00:01:16,760
The_post, then we've gotta
end that while loop.

19
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,230
This is the end of the loop.

20
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,340
And then in here,
we're just gonna go php the_content,

21
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,240
and that should grab the content
from the content editor.

22
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,610
We're gonna go ahead and copy this so that
we can paste it in the content editor.

23
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,960
Update and then we should be
good to go on the front end.

24
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:43,560
There we go,
this is the dynamic test from the editor.

25
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,990
Great, let's move forward and
do this stuff.

26
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,400
So, we need to go back to our Dashboard
and create a new custom post type

27
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:57,920
and that's gonna be,
Resource for the post type name,

28
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,260
Resources for the label, and
then Resource for the singular label.

29
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,650
You can leave the description alone.

30
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,540
Advanced Options,
I think these are all good.

31
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,610
We're going to leave
everything as is except for

32
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:16,550
the menu icon which is going to be
WordPress content themes Bootstrap to

33
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:22,120
WordPress assets image icon-resources.png.

34
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:27,369
And in here we want to be able
to have access to the title,

35
00:02:27,369 --> 00:02:34,890
the editor, no excerpts,
another rest here, keep feature image,

36
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,770
actually don't use feature image,
author, page attributes, okay.

37
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,920
So basically we wanna keep title and
editor.

38
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,010
And then go ahead and
create that custom post type.

39
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,840
That should show up here in your sidebar.

40
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,740
There it is.

41
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:52,820
So what we wanna do is go
to the custom fields, and

42
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:56,300
we wanna create some advanced
custom fields for our resources.

43
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,110
Add a new one.

44
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,080
This is gonna be Resources.

45
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,770
And then add a new field.

46
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,465
Because we already have access to
the title we don't need a title.

47
00:03:05,465 --> 00:03:13,160
We need a URL and
an image for our resources.

48
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,010
Cuz we're going to use the image,
we need a URL for the link.

49
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,120
We need in some content.

50
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,260
And in fact, let's do something cool.

51
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,940
We're going to use a conditional

52
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,409
field that will say, hey,
do you want to add a button to this?

53
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,600
To this resource post, and

54
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,820
if you check yes it will give
you an option to add a button.

55
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,900
And then you need to add the text inside
the button just as like a little practice.

56
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:49,603
So let's go back here and
we need have a resource image.

57
00:03:49,603 --> 00:03:52,590
The field type will be image,

58
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:59,220
Upload an image for resource.

59
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:06,090
Required, let's say yes
to make it look good.

60
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,260
We're going to have the image object.

61
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,600
Preview would be medium
sized on the editor.

62
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,130
Leave it in the normal library, and
we'll close that field for good.

63
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:18,112
The next thing we want is to

64
00:04:18,112 --> 00:04:23,120
have the URL for the resource.

65
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:31,820
Resource URL and that will be just text.

66
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:38,958
Say, Enter a valid URL for

67
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:42,646
your resource.

68
00:04:42,646 --> 00:04:45,890
Acquired, yes.

69
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,750
Default value, no, let's do a place
holder just to show an example.

70
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:55,091
So http://www.google.com.

71
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:57,830
So that's what that would look like.

72
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:02,020
No formatting here at all and
we will close that field.

73
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,590
Now this is where we're gonna
see if you wanna add a button.

74
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:09,070
So let's say, add field and
this is going to be.

75
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,650
It's gonna say, Add Button.

76
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:22,140
And then down here,
you just need to choose True/False.

77
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:27,780
Field Instructions, Would you like
to add a button to this resource?

78
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:34,300
And then the default will be, checked yes.

79
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,790
Great, okay so, close that field.

80
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,200
So now, let me show you hows this works.

81
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,590
Button text.

82
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,260
This will be the button text.

83
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,320
All we need is some text.

84
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,674
Enter the text you'd like to
appear within the button.

85
00:05:55,674 --> 00:05:57,985
Required no.

86
00:05:57,985 --> 00:06:02,380
And then no formatting.

87
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,260
And then conditional logic, yes.

88
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:10,420
And this will show if ad
button is equal to checked.

89
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,620
So now, that should be good.

90
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:18,230
Now show this field group of
the post type is equal to resource.

91
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:18,810
Great.

92
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:24,370
And then we want this to be
standard WordPress metabox, and

93
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:25,970
we wanna hide any of this on the screen.

94
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:32,450
Well let's hide everything
except Content Editor,

95
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:39,670
Feature Image, and I think that's all.

96
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:44,610
So go ahead and publish that and
then now when you go to Resources,

97
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:52,140
Add a Resource, you should now
have some extra info down here.

98
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,720
So Resources.

99
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,150
You got image, URL, would you like
to add a button to this resource and

100
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:03,890
your button text, if I check
this it will remove button text.

101
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:08,450
Because it's not required if I
don't enter anything, that's okay.

102
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:12,150
Meaning if this is unchecked that
field is still there just hidden.

103
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,030
But if you don't enter
anything that is totally fine.

104
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:15,600
Here we go.

105
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:20,220
So now let's just add some resources.

106
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,230
And then we'll hook
them into our template.

107
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,920
So I'm going to say Justhost.

108
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,640
Basically what I'm going to do here so
you don't have to watch me do it all.

109
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,700
I'll do one for you and
you can do the rest.

110
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,420
And then we'll fast forward.

111
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,140
So I'm going to grab the title.

112
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,510
So the resource title.

113
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,970
I'm going to get the resource
text right here.

114
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,450
We're gonna paste that in the body.

115
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,010
And then, I'm gonna grab the link.

116
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:46,300
Which is copy link address.

117
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,150
URL, brighthouseu.ca/justhost.

118
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,640
Add button, yes.

119
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:00,910
The button text will say,
Get started with Justhost and the image.

120
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:04,090
I'm gonna add an image that
should be in our Assets folder.

121
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,690
We should have the Justhost
logo right there.

122
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,302
I'm just gonna make this
a little bit nicer.

123
00:08:11,302 --> 00:08:15,220
Justhost logo, there we go, and

124
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:19,470
more accessible, and now if I publish
that I will have that resource, but

125
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,780
it won't be on my template yet,
because we haven't hooked it in.

126
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,080
So go ahead and do that for the other two,
or however many you wanna add,

127
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,460
if you're kinda working on something else
as we go along here, go ahead and do that.

128
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,150
And then when you come back,
or when we come back,

129
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:35,252
we're going to be hooking this into
our template, so let's fast forward.

130
00:08:35,252 --> 00:08:36,960
All right and here we go.

131
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,980
I've got all my resources.

132
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,310
I've got Dropbox, Coda, and Justhost.

133
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:42,080
Now what we want to do is
head to our code editor, and

134
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,510
we're going to hook
those into our template.

135
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:50,500
So right here at the end
of our while loop,

136
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,370
we're going to do another PHP script here.

137
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:59,450
And that's going to establish
a new variable for loop, and

138
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:04,575
it will be a new WP_Query, so
we're gonna be resetting this, or

139
00:09:04,575 --> 00:09:10,970
re-establishing the value
of what this function is.

140
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:15,880
So, we're gonna be grabbing the custom
post type resource, so the way you do that

141
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,746
is like we've done in the past,
but let's just write it out again.

142
00:09:18,746 --> 00:09:22,266
We've got post_type, and

143
00:09:22,266 --> 00:09:27,692
that would be resource, comma, orderby,

144
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:33,264
and that would be post_id, comma, order,

145
00:09:33,264 --> 00:09:39,140
and that is going to be ascending, great.

146
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,190
That looks good.

147
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:46,665
Now under our resource row,
we're going to initiate the loop.

148
00:09:46,665 --> 00:09:53,970
So, while loop have_posts and

149
00:09:53,970 --> 00:10:01,020
then colon, loop the_post.

150
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:06,210
Now we have to do this because
we're grabbing a custom post type.

151
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,570
And we have to initiate the loop.

152
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,974
Now we need to end that while loop.

153
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,171
Great.

154
00:10:18,171 --> 00:10:19,250
Okay.

155
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,920
So now in here we need to
basically add our resource.

156
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,460
One of these resources, the mark-up,
and then we're gonna make it dynamic.

157
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,390
Cool.

158
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:35,880
So in here we have our image, and
we just need to be able to grab that.

159
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,000
So the way that we do that,
pretty straightforward.

160
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,940
We're gonna have to get
those custom fields.

161
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,896
So let's go up to the top and
establish some variables.

162
00:10:44,896 --> 00:10:49,686
Let's say resource_image, and

163
00:10:49,686 --> 00:10:57,798
that's gonna be
get_field('resource_image').

164
00:10:57,798 --> 00:10:59,480
What other ones do we have?

165
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,737
We have resource_url = get_field.

166
00:11:03,737 --> 00:11:08,582
And that's ('resource_url').

167
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,310
And then I believe we also have resource.

168
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:16,490
Button.

169
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,380
Text.
Or was it just button text?

170
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,090
Let's just double check.

171
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:21,840
Button text.

172
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,315
That would just be button_text.

173
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,830
Get_field, button_text.

174
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,360
And we might as well get the add
button to see if it's true or false.

175
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:46,830
So add_button and that will say get_field.

176
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,230
Add_button.

177
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,170
Great so now we have our variables.

178
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,760
So now we should be able
to just pull these in.

179
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:02,360
So this is gonna be php
echo resource_image.

180
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,290
That should do it.

181
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,010
And then after that we wanna grab.

182
00:12:11,628 --> 00:12:16,916
The title so this is just php the_title,

183
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:21,154
and then in here we have that URL.

184
00:12:21,154 --> 00:12:22,983
So that's just going to be php echo.

185
00:12:29,031 --> 00:12:30,811
Resource_url.

186
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:35,580
And then here all these paragraph tags,
that's just gonna be the content.

187
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,510
Easy enough.

188
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:46,080
And now down here, we want to do something
about this button, and on second thought,

189
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:53,720
because we made our backend here,
we said do you wanna add a button?

190
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,630
And then this field would appear,
the editor.

191
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:58,330
Theoretically, this section right here,

192
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:01,520
we don't need to do anything
with it in our template.

193
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,740
I added a variable that should technically
store its value, but we don't need it.

194
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:11,330
The reason why is because
button text is not required.

195
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,870
So it doesn't matter.

196
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,900
What they chose or not.

197
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,050
If they put button text then all we need
to do is check to see if there is a value

198
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:19,870
in button text.

199
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,050
Otherwise don't show anything.

200
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,880
The add button toggle
field is really just for

201
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,260
the editor just to make it
look a little bit nicer.

202
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,485
So all you need to do is just php if.

203
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:34,950
Not empty.

204
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:40,525
And that would be button_text.

205
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:42,970
Show the button.

206
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,250
Right there.

207
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,710
Now let's close up that php tag and
the endif.

208
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:54,400
So in here we just need
to make this dynamic.

209
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,927
This is gonna be the php

210
00:13:58,927 --> 00:14:04,171
echo resource_url, and

211
00:14:04,171 --> 00:14:09,908
then the text would go here.

212
00:14:09,908 --> 00:14:13,910
Php echo button_text.

213
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:14,860
There it is.

214
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,179
Save that and delete the other resources,
the static ones.

215
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,270
Make sure your resource
row is still intact, and

216
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:26,510
everything's still there, now if you save
that and check it out on the front end.

217
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,820
You should have all of your resources.

218
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:34,740
Cool so they're kind of there,
but we're missing the images and

219
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:40,470
the URL and the buttons.

220
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,120
So, what's up with that?

221
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,926
I believe the reason why this isn't
working is because our variables up here

222
00:14:46,926 --> 00:14:52,520
are not being passed into this loop

223
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:57,370
down here when we loop through the posts
when we're in our custom post type.

224
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:00,639
So, the solution to that would be
just to include those variables.

225
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,140
Right in here.

226
00:15:06,178 --> 00:15:07,900
Like so.

227
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,270
The alternative solution if
you wanted to just not do this

228
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:15,470
is just use the functions themselves.

229
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,270
Within the template.

230
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,659
Now if I save that let's see what happens.

231
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,950
So we have our buttons with the links.

232
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,490
And the image is an array.

233
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:32,070
That's because, silly Brad,
this is passing an array.

234
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,720
What we should have done, is this.

235
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,544
Image source and then alt.

236
00:15:39,646 --> 00:15:45,540
And then right here we would do like so.

237
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,890
Resource_image, and then url.

238
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:54,164
And then alt would be the same deal,
but alt.

239
00:15:54,164 --> 00:15:55,901
Let's see.

240
00:15:59,062 --> 00:15:59,780
There we go.

241
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,040
So we've got our image and
the alt text should be in there,

242
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,080
we've got our links and the buttons.

243
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,110
Good to go.

244
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:09,120
That's it for the resources page,
pretty straightforward.

245
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,823
Took a little bit of figuring out and
a few issues here and there, but

246
00:16:11,823 --> 00:16:12,450
that's okay.

247
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:16,340
That's how you do the resources,
that's how you can add dynamic resources.

248
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:20,090
Very useful to know, and
this can apply to a bunch of other pages.

249
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:23,860
Rather than just specifically for
Resources, it could be for team members,

250
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:28,240
it could be for menu items,
it could be for products and

251
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,040
your imagination is your only limitation.

252
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,420
So in the next lecture we're actually
gonna be jumping to a whole new module,

253
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,060
and we're gonna start working on the blog.

254
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:42,600
And the blog is WordPress's forte, so
it's gonna be fun working with this one.

255
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:48,559
See ya there.
