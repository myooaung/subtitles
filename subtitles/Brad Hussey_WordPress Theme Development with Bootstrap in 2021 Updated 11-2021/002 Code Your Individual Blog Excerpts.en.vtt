00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.880
Hey everyone.

2
00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.300
Welcome back to Boost Your Income
with Bootstrap to WordPress.

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.490
This lecture is called Code
the Individual Blog Excerpts.

4
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.533
[SOUND]

5
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:18.066
[MUSIC]

6
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:22.120
All right, now what we're gonna do is
clean up this Excerpt section of our blog.

7
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.170
And so basically, the Excerpt section
is basically the blog overview.

8
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.690
When you hit blog page up here and
you get taken to this page, you

9
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.670
get an overview of all the posts with the
excerpts rather than the full post view.

10
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.390
So, if we have five blog posts,
you'd see five small excerpts here and

11
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.480
it would kinda look like this,
what we have in our static site.

12
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.210
You got the excerpts.

13
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.020
So, that's what we're gonna do.

14
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.610
We're gonna make the Excerpt
section look more like

15
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.030
the design here in the static site.

16
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.430
And right now you can see it's pretty
plain, but you can see similarities.

17
00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.400
And you can make that
much better like this.

18
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.420
Quite easy.

19
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.957
So head to your code editor and
open up the content.php template.

20
00:01:07.957 --> 00:01:16.650
The content.php template is basically
the blog overview, and it looks like this.

21
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.750
In Wordpress, sometimes if you
haven't used Wordpress before and

22
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.370
you haven't developed a Wordpress site,

23
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.240
you can get a little confused with how
the templates work and which one is which?

24
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.200
You have all these different
content templates like,

25
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.270
Content Single, and you have
the Index page and you have page.php.

26
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.160
Things like that you can
get a little confusing.

27
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.820
And so, the way that I found out,

28
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.550
when I first started out, which page,
I want to edit the excerpt section.

29
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.150
How do I know which template that is?

30
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.690
Well, I went through and
I would select everything, and

31
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.860
I would cut everything out of the page,
and then save it.

32
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:49.860
So, the template is empty.

33
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.110
And then when I refresh the page to
see if the page turned out empty,

34
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.318
then I knew, hey,
this is the template I need to work with.

35
00:01:57.318 --> 00:02:00.590
So, content.php, there's nothing here.

36
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.960
So, I know content.php is, in fact,
what I need to be working with.

37
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.470
So, I put that back there and
we're going to go ahead and fix this up.

38
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.540
And luckily what's here,
we're gonna be recycling a lot of it, but

39
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.200
it's gonna be quite simple
to get what we need.

40
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.390
So we're just gonna go through from top to
bottom and trim out what we don't need and

41
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:30.470
replace the parts that we need to
change to make it look like the design.

42
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.660
So up here at the top,
basically right here in the header tag,

43
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.140
we're gonna start out by
changing here in the title.

44
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.790
This is gonna be a level three heading,
not a level one heading.

45
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.170
That's how we have it in our site.

46
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.410
The rest of it in here is fine.

47
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.210
And down here In between the if
post is equal to get post type,

48
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.820
if statement right here,
we're going to remove the entry meta and

49
00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.060
replace that with our own content.

50
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.180
So, remove entry meta all together.

51
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.059
Well actually, we can go to our blog.html

52
00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:13.470
static page and copy the markup for that.

53
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.740
And that is just right here.

54
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.150
Post details.

55
00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.900
So, grab post details,
copy it, and paste it in here.

56
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.730
Make sure that's lined up properly so
you can see it better,

57
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.870
and we're just gonna go through and
make this dynamic.

58
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.750
And it's quite simple.

59
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.250
So right here, we have the user.

60
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.200
We want this to be the actual
author of the post.

61
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:39.775
Do that like this.

62
00:03:39.775 --> 00:03:43.050
So, WordPress, function, the author.

63
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.550
That's great.

64
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.330
Then in here, time.

65
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.180
Well, PHP Wordpress
function called the date.

66
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.080
And that is the published
date of the post itself.

67
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.350
And in here, remove all the a tags.

68
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.110
We need to list out the categories
separated by a comma.

69
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.640
You do that pretty easily just by going
PHP WordPress function is the categor.

70
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.866
And you could see here actually,
Coda gives me all

71
00:04:14.866 --> 00:04:18.770
the parameters, or
the arguments, of this function.

72
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:22.130
So, $separator, $parents, and $post_id.

73
00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.650
They're all optional, however
separator's the one that we want to use.

74
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.553
Separator means how do you wanna separate
the categories if there's more than one?

75
00:04:29.553 --> 00:04:34.300
Do you want a comma, a pipe,
a space, dash, things like that?

76
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.973
So, I'm gonna remove all this here,
and I'm just going to in a string,

77
00:04:39.973 --> 00:04:43.514
put a comma and a space and
close that string.

78
00:04:43.514 --> 00:04:44.662
That is the separator.

79
00:04:44.662 --> 00:04:48.610
That's the first argument of
that parameter of that function.

80
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.350
And so that should do that.

81
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.566
Now tags is pretty much the same thing.

82
00:04:53.566 --> 00:05:00.368
I'm gonna remove the tags here and
go PHP and this will be the tags.

83
00:05:00.368 --> 00:05:04.770
And then, the parameters of this
function is a little bit different.

84
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.290
Before is the text or whatever you
want to appear before the tags.

85
00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.550
Separator is the how you
wanna separate the tags.

86
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.940
So, the default is a comma, but
you can put one in there or

87
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.730
something different if you'd like.

88
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.220
And after is the text you'd
like to appear after.

89
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.840
Before and after are optional,
they don't display anything by default, so

90
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.390
you don't have to worry about those.

91
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.580
But how you need to display it
if you wanna have the comma or

92
00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:34.670
something specific, you need to do a,
open and close strings, comma.

93
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.810
And then here's where you
want to do your separator.

94
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.460
So, open string comma space,
close the string.

95
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.650
And then, go ahead and
do the same thing for the last comma, and

96
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.390
then close those strings.

97
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.608
Now, if you wanted to just
leave it as the tags,

98
00:05:49.608 --> 00:05:54.120
that should do it just fine,
and separate them by comma.

99
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.580
Down here we have the post comments badge.

100
00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:02.190
What we need to do here is put that badge
up there with the number of comments.

101
00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.073
And so, it's pretty straight forward.

102
00:06:04.073 --> 00:06:09.773
For the number,
you just need to say php comments_number.

103
00:06:09.773 --> 00:06:14.022
That is a WordPress function.

104
00:06:14.022 --> 00:06:18.700
And here, let me show you the arguments
here, or the parameters of this function.

105
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.810
You need to have $zero, $one, and $more.

106
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.060
Basically that means, what do you want
to display if there are zero comments?

107
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.600
What do you want to
display if there are one?

108
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.190
And what do you want to display
if there are more than one?

109
00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:34.120
Basically, this means,
if you don't do anything here,

110
00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:41.170
the default Wordpress parameters here
are no comments is what zero would be.

111
00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:47.500
One would be one comment, and
the rest are 30 comments or whatever.

112
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.692
But in our comments bubble or
comments badge, we just want the number.

113
00:06:51.692 --> 00:06:55.900
No text, nothing that says, zero comments,
or no comments, or whatever,

114
00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.920
cuz that's gonna break the layout.

115
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.540
We want it to actually just
be straight up numbers.

116
00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.010
So this will be 0,1.

117
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:08.850
And then in a string, a percent sign,

118
00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:14.850
which will basically just pass in whatever
the number of comments there will be.

119
00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.500
And then make sure to semicolon and
close that PHP script.

120
00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:20.280
Straight forward, super easy.

121
00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:25.770
Now, I wanna give the option for
people who are logged in, AKA you or

122
00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:30.540
your client, the ability to hit edit
right up here in the Post details.

123
00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:31.580
I wanted to make it easy.

124
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:32.540
And you could do that.

125
00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.360
You can add a little front end section.

126
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.745
So I'm just going to add a div to
give a block level element here.

127
00:07:36.745 --> 00:07:42.150
php_edit_post_link.

128
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:47.750
And that will give us
the ability to hit Edit, and it

129
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.970
will take us to the actual
post to edit in the editor.

130
00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:55.780
But if i just say edit_post_link and

131
00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.920
leave it as,
it's going to have its own default text.

132
00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:05.620
I want to add an icon
that is a little pencil.

133
00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:09.310
And I can just put the icon before here,
but it won't be included in the link.

134
00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:13.210
So if I wanted to include it in the link,
then I need to do something like this.

135
00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:18.940
The first parameter of the edit_post_link
is the text you want to display

136
00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:23.040
instead of the default,
which is Edit or Edit Post or whatever.

137
00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.250
But if you want to have your own text,

138
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:26.670
the first parameter is
what you want it to say.

139
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:27.690
So I just want it to say Edit.

140
00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:31.190
And then comma, there's a second
parameter and a third parameter.

141
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:35.790
The second and third are what do you
wanna display before the link and

142
00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:36.990
what do you wanna display after?

143
00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:41.960
You can use this to wrap it in
well like I could have not put

144
00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:47.440
this div here and just put, and that would
probably actually be better actually.

145
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.000
I'm gonna go like this.

146
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.460
Because if you're not logged it,

147
00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:53.250
then I don't just wanna have a div
tag that's empty and sitting there.

148
00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:58.460
So, you'd go like this and
then that, there you go.

149
00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.360
And that would put the edit
post link in a div.

150
00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.870
But I wanna be able to have that icon,
a pencil icon.

151
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:10.570
And so all I would do is just just here,
have the i tag and

152
00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:14.870
then have a class with fa fa-pencil,
that'll give me a pencil.

153
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:19.710
Close that string, save that, and then now
that should give us the edit post link.

154
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:20.520
Great.

155
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:26.230
Now if I scroll down to
the entry content down here,

156
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:30.380
we're just gonna remove all this cuz
we don't need the footer in everything.

157
00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.350
Leave the closing article tag.

158
00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:35.400
But we're gonna put our own content here.

159
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.650
Go back to blog.html,
the static version you had, and

160
00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:43.321
grab post image, and also post-excerpt.

161
00:09:43.321 --> 00:09:47.632
And then we're gonna make this dynamic,
paste it down here, line that up.

162
00:09:47.632 --> 00:09:52.811
And then we're gonna start
with the post-image.

163
00:09:52.811 --> 00:09:57.130
Post-image is pretty straightforward,
we're just gonna grab the WordPress

164
00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:04.630
function, the post thumbnail,
thumbnail and there it is.

165
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:07.110
But some posts don't have thumbnails, so

166
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:10.710
we need to double check to see
if there is even one uploaded.

167
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.010
Pretty straight forward.

168
00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:18.710
Just an if statement here,
that says if, has post thumbnail.

169
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:20.010
Great.

170
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:24.272
And that means if they have
a post thumbnail this is gonna

171
00:10:24.272 --> 00:10:29.270
check for feature image.

172
00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:31.360
And then, that will spit this out.

173
00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:34.380
Make sure to close that PHP bracket,
and then there you go.

174
00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:38.110
If there's a post thumbnail, great,
otherwise this doesn't even exist.

175
00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:39.210
Perfect.

176
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:42.609
So then in post excerpt, all you really
need to do is just use php the_excerpt,

177
00:10:42.609 --> 00:10:44.750
another built-in WordPress function.

178
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:47.690
There are no parameters to this function,
and so

179
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:52.840
the unfortunate thing about this is
if we go to our excerpt here and

180
00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:57.540
hit refresh, you can see all it does
is add square brackets and an ellipses.

181
00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.220
That doesn't do very good for us.

182
00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:04.450
There's bad user experience and
you can't really go in to view the post.

183
00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:06.830
Unless you clicked on this of course,
the title.

184
00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:09.530
You can see right here, the rest of it,

185
00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:12.120
before we get into the excerpt,
that everything looks good.

186
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.070
We have our username here.

187
00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:18.020
And this could be changed by yourself,
the user.

188
00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.910
So when you go to your User Tab in
the dashboard, you could change it to

189
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:24.860
your name, your first name, full name,
nickname, so on and so forth.

190
00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.080
Right now the default is the username.

191
00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:30.070
The date published,
categories separated by comma text,

192
00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:33.000
separated by comma,
the edit link right here.

193
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.090
And that will take you to edit the posts.

194
00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:39.570
And I have a really long
lorem ipsum post here.

195
00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:44.830
The only thing here is that the excerpt is
not really, you can't really link through.

196
00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:48.340
The way to fix that is
in your functions.php,

197
00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:51.580
you need to just scroll down to
the bottom and add a new function here.

198
00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:54.990
Because the excerpt doesn't
have any additional parameters.

199
00:11:54.990 --> 00:12:00.630
And a quick Google search let me find out
how to change the text of the excerpt and

200
00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:01.570
how to link to the post.

201
00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:03.300
And really I'll show you right here.

202
00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.970
Pasted it at the bottom.

203
00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:05.891
So this right here,

204
00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:09.910
function new_excerpt_more,
this is creating a new function.

205
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:11.650
Or actually,
this is actually a built in function and

206
00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:14.420
it's just updating the filters and
the perameters of this function.

207
00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:15.840
So let's check it out here.

208
00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.065
So we've got a global post.

209
00:12:17.065 --> 00:12:19.280
Wanna be able to grab that.

210
00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.320
Return and then in a string type this out.

211
00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:27.350
This is putting an ellipsis at the end or
three periods, three dots.

212
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:28.490
And then a space.

213
00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:30.930
And then we have our A tag.

214
00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:33.020
And then here we have a series of info.

215
00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.340
So we have class,
more tag in case you wanted to style it.

216
00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:37.490
Href.

217
00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:39.650
We have our opening double quote and
then single quotes,

218
00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:43.640
so we could concatenate
the get_permalink($post->ID) so

219
00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:46.720
that's gonna get the permalink
of that specific post.

220
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:50.090
Concatenate, make sure you close that up.

221
00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:54.200
Make sure you're back in here in
the string, the original string.

222
00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.790
Space, continue reading the lowercase and
then r i quo.

223
00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:00.230
Close the A tag, and then, that's it.

224
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:02.042
And then,
all you need to do it add filter.

225
00:13:02.042 --> 00:13:05.940
Excerpt_more is the first parameter,
and then, new_excerpt_more.

226
00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:09.940
So, this is just basically adding
the new_excerpt_more function

227
00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:15.590
to the original excerpt_more
built-in WordPress function.

228
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:17.910
So that when we hit Refresh,

229
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:21.920
we don't even have to do anything
on the original page here.

230
00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.770
The excerpt will now
always display like this.

231
00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:28.190
So that will take us to, here we go.

232
00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:31.650
And obviously, this doesn't look very good
because we haven't styled this up yet and

233
00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:36.510
we haven't programmed it in PHP yet,
in WordPress.

234
00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:39.210
But let's go in and edit this post and
add a feature image, so

235
00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.360
that we can see if it
works in our excerpt.

236
00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:47.370
So feature image,
we're just gonna set this, add my default

237
00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:53.000
feature image in my assets here, and
I'm gonna set that featured image.

238
00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:54.580
Update.

239
00:13:56.770 --> 00:14:01.550
I'm gonna go back to the website and
hit Blog so

240
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:06.740
I can go to the Blog Excerpt page,
and it's there.

241
00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.035
But you can see there's a problem.

242
00:14:08.035 --> 00:14:14.610
The height seems to be gone wonky.

243
00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:19.490
And the way to fix that Is
to head to your CSS for

244
00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:23.850
the theme, and scroll down to your
Blog section here in the CSS.

245
00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:29.317
And down after Post Image,
we need to make sure

246
00:14:29.317 --> 00:14:34.231
that the post image image is height auto.

247
00:14:34.231 --> 00:14:37.615
And I can see here that
I made you do a typo and

248
00:14:37.615 --> 00:14:42.503
this should have actually been post image,
space image, and

249
00:14:42.503 --> 00:14:47.579
then height auto, to make sure to
force those images to be height

250
00:14:47.579 --> 00:14:52.956
auto not a fixed height which
WordPress tags on to those image tags.

251
00:14:52.956 --> 00:14:55.602
Refresh this and
that should solve all of our problems.

252
00:14:55.602 --> 00:14:56.990
There we go and that looks beautiful.

253
00:14:58.050 --> 00:14:59.100
So there we go.

254
00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.310
That is the post excerpt section.

255
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:06.160
Let's just make sure that we're good here
if I add a new post to see if the styles

256
00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.798
are also reflected in that and
that there's good margins in between.

257
00:15:09.798 --> 00:15:13.180
Another test post.

258
00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:14.540
Let's get some lorem ipsum in there.

259
00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:19.750
And let's skip out on the feature image.

260
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:26.870
Found some tags, fake post, coding, cut.

261
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:30.860
And let's say uncategorized.

262
00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.250
And we're gonna go ahead and publish that.

263
00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:33.240
And there we go.

264
00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.070
It's at the top,
we've got good space in between.

265
00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:38.450
It looks like our styles have made it,
our edit links here on a new line.

266
00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:41.900
If you don't want it in a new
line you can remove those divs.

267
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:45.175
So if I'm gonna go back here just
to jump back into my content.php,

268
00:15:45.175 --> 00:15:49.630
let's remove those divs there, like so.

269
00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:54.120
I'm gonna save that, and now our edit
link should be on the same line,

270
00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:58.140
unless it drops down to second line
because the first line is too long.

271
00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:00.900
And actually, I prefer that, so
I'm going to leave it like so.

272
00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:02.679
And that looks good.

273
00:16:02.679 --> 00:16:05.450
And just to make sure you see how this
works, we have our comment badge.

274
00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:10.759
If I click that, What should theoretically

275
00:16:10.759 --> 00:16:18.810
happen is it should take me to
the comment section on the blog post.

276
00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:19.760
And it doesn't seem to do that.

277
00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.490
And that's because in our content.php,

278
00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:26.290
we didn't actually specify where that's
gonna link to, we just put an empty link.

279
00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:29.780
So, good thing we checked that out
before we closed up the lecture.

280
00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:34.690
All you gotta do here is in your href,
is go php.

281
00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:38.030
Super easy, wait for it,
comments_link, there it is.

282
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.130
Say that.

283
00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:43.000
Now if you go back and refresh this
Overview page, If you hover over this you

284
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.760
can see another test post, slash,
hashtag or pound comments, and

285
00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:54.110
that will take you to the anchor,
the ID comments on the post itself.

286
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:56.210
It'll scroll down,
right down to the comments.

287
00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:57.910
So, perfect, there it is.

288
00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:00.710
And in the next lecture we're gonna
be cleaning up and coding this page.

289
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:03.510
This is the full blog post page.

290
00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:04.510
It's pretty simple, straightforward.

291
00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:06.480
We already did most of
the work in the previous one,

292
00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:08.750
just a lot of copying and pasting.

293
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:09.782
And yeah, I'll see you there.

294
00:17:09.782 --> 00:17:12.940
