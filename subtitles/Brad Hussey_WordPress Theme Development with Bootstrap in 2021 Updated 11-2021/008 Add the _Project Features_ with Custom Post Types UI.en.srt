00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,340
Hey everyone.
Brad here.

2
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:06,380
Welcome back to Boost your
income Bootstrap to WordPress.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:12,370
This lecture is called Add the Project
Features Using Custom Post Types and

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,090
Advanced Custom Fields.

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:14,941
That's so many words.

6
00:00:17,715 --> 00:00:27,206
[MUSIC]

7
00:00:27,206 --> 00:00:29,930
All right, so here we are in
the Final Project Features section.

8
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:36,730
And what we're gonna do is basically
just add a title, description.

9
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,080
And we're gonna make custom post types for
Final Project Features.

10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,800
So we can add these three custom post
types rather than just building them

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,520
directly into the Final Project Features
edit section.

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,700
If that makes any sense.

13
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,900
All right.
Head back to the dashboard.

14
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:00,000
We are going to go back to Custom Fields
here and we're going to add a new field

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,050
group and that's going to be
the Project Features Section.

16
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:15,672
I'm going to add a field and that's
going to be the Project Feature Title.

17
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,440
And that's gonna be Text,
yes it is required, and

18
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,080
we're gonna have no formatting,
close that up.

19
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,981
Then we're gonna have
the Project Feature Body,

20
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:32,137
and that's gonna be Text Area.

21
00:01:34,282 --> 00:01:35,970
Close that field, we're all good.

22
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:38,350
And that should be good for

23
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:42,020
that section because now we're
gonna add a new custom post type.

24
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:47,450
So show this field group if
the page is equal to home.

25
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,000
You got it.
And

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,820
this is gonna be standard
WordPress meta box.

27
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,760
And leave the rest as is, publish that up.

28
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,450
Good to go.

29
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,250
Go to your custom post types.

30
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,280
We're gonna create a new,
add a new custom post type.

31
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,740
That's gonna be project_feature.

32
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,350
So project underscore feature.

33
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,470
The label will be Project Features.

34
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:11,265
The singular label will
be Project Feature.

35
00:02:13,587 --> 00:02:20,736
And we'll say these are the features
of the final project.

36
00:02:20,736 --> 00:02:23,560
Advanced Options.

37
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,480
We don't want this to be in the search.

38
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,166
So exclude from search, True.

39
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:34,030
And the menu icon.

40
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,360
We want this to be WordPress content.

41
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,750
Let's use the same icon because it's
basically going to be same sort of deal,

42
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,270
a feature.

43
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:45,950
We got the title.

44
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,460
We don't need the rest of the stuff.

45
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,440
Let's close it all up and
leave the title alone.

46
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,580
Good to go, create custom post type.

47
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,380
Now let's see,
we've got our project features.

48
00:02:59,380 --> 00:02:59,880
Great.

49
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,030
Now why don't we go ahead and
add some project features.

50
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,450
We can actually use the native
built in WordPress stuff.

51
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,330
We don't have to create
custom post types at all.

52
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,690
Because what we'll do here
is use the feature image.

53
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,760
And we'll use the title, and
we'll use just the content editor.

54
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,310
So why don't we just do that.

55
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:24,370
What we do need to do is in the custom
post types, we need to manage

56
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:29,580
the project features, so edit
the project features custom post type.

57
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,410
The advanced options,
all the way at the bottom.

58
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,880
Turn on the editor and
turn on the feature image.

59
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,320
We need access to those now.

60
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,510
Save that.

61
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,170
Now if you go to Project Features and

62
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:44,970
add a new project feature,
we have the title, the description or

63
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,220
the content editor and we do not
have feature image for some reason.

64
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,670
Now, I believe the reason is,
in our functions of php,

65
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:57,260
we need to enable support for
post thumbnails on posts and pages.

66
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,770
So right here on line 41,

67
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:04,290
it's commented out so we need to add
theme support for post thumbnails.

68
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:10,360
Save that and if we go back and
refresh our Project Feature New Posts,

69
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,720
we should have access to our
feature image, which we do.

70
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,520
Excellent, so take note of that.

71
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,840
By default, the support for
post thumbnails is not active, so

72
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,070
you need to turn that on
by uncommenting that line.

73
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,970
Let's add a new project feature, shall we?

74
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,909
So here on the front end, we're just
gonna copy some of this stuff here.

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,370
Sexy and modern design, and
then we have our body text.

76
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,760
I'm gonna paste that in here.

77
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,725
The only downside about this is that we
have a full WYZIWYG editor that can edit

78
00:04:39,725 --> 00:04:43,883
this text and, you know, it might not be
a good idea if you want this to be simple.

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,817
And the other thing, too, is because
we didn't create any custom fields for

80
00:04:52,817 --> 00:04:58,637
this project feature, we weren't able
to hide the slug, which is useless to

81
00:04:58,637 --> 00:05:05,030
us because this technically is just going
to pull up a really ugly archive page.

82
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:08,460
With some basic information
that we submit here.

83
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:14,530
So usually we'd be able to hide
this if you use a custom feed.

84
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:19,020
Now right now we're using the default
title, body, and feature image, and so

85
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,200
unfortunately we can't
actually hide the permalink.

86
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,740
So if you were to do it a different way
then you can actually hide the slug from

87
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,210
the editor screen, but I'm just showing
you the different options here.

88
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,530
So just ignore this permalink.

89
00:05:32,905 --> 00:05:33,920
Okay, now the feature image.

90
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:40,960
We want to be able to grab the Design
feature image from your Images folder.

91
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,890
I already pulled that in here.

92
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:48,420
And I gave it the title Design Icon and
an icon with transparent layers.

93
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,260
Okay.

94
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,060
Publish that.

95
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:55,300
And we're gonna go ahead and
add another project feature.

96
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,620
And that's gonna be quality HTML5 and
CSS3.

97
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,260
And then the body text will be so on and

98
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:11,770
so forth, and then the feature
image is going to be the icon code.

99
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,499
And this is gonna say.

100
00:06:20,059 --> 00:06:21,720
Web design icon.

101
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:28,819
And say an icon with a browser.

102
00:06:33,964 --> 00:06:35,522
Okay, and then I'm gonna publish that, and

103
00:06:35,522 --> 00:06:37,129
then I'm gonna add one
more project feature.

104
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,550
And now it'll be easy-to-use CMS.

105
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,190
Use that text here, and

106
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:55,610
then the feature image,
we're gonna pull that from our icon CMS.

107
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,170
There we go.

108
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,788
This is gonna be gear icon.

109
00:06:59,788 --> 00:07:02,530
With a gear.

110
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:05,660
There we go.

111
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,970
And I'm gonna publish that.

112
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,632
So now I'm gonna go to my home page.

113
00:07:14,536 --> 00:07:15,610
Editor.

114
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,320
And the Project Features section should
be right here, again it's at the top.

115
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,340
I'm gonna drag it down below
the Course Features Section.

116
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:28,190
Project Features,
title will simply be Project.

117
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,370
Final Project Features.

118
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:36,924
And the Project Feature body will be this.

119
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,630
And I'm going to go ahead and update that.

120
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:49,270
So now in our code editor, we just need
to be able to pull in the info from

121
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:54,530
the editor, and
from our custom post-types.

122
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,970
So let's go ahead and do that.

123
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,430
The very top we need to add
a couple of variables first.

124
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:09,378
Right under here, let's say

125
00:08:09,378 --> 00:08:16,013
project_features_title = get_field.

126
00:08:16,013 --> 00:08:23,690
And that will be
the project_features_title.

127
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:24,871
I believe that's what we called it.

128
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,450
Project feature title
is what we called it.

129
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,469
So let's say project_feature_title,
and let's update this.

130
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,705
And one more here.

131
00:08:37,705 --> 00:08:43,040
Project_feature_body, is
what we had that be called.

132
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,540
I meant to write body.

133
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,040
Okay.

134
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,580
Now save that.

135
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,980
Scroll down.

136
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:56,910
We can start editing
the Project Features Section right here.

137
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,130
Final Project Features.

138
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,995
That's actually going to be,
using php echo

139
00:09:02,995 --> 00:09:09,820
project_feature_tile, and

140
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:17,980
then in here we're going to use
php echo project_feature_body.

141
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:23,820
And then down here,
we're gonna do like we did right here.

142
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,870
So just copy this whole loop right
here from the previous section,

143
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,090
the Course Features.

144
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,709
Copy that,
we're just gonna change a few things.

145
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,230
Paste that whole section in there.

146
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,610
And we're just gonna change a few things.

147
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:41,510
So instead of course_feature,
we're grabbing project_feature.

148
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,340
And then the rest of it, right here,

149
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:49,210
in between the loop,
we need to add one of these columns.

150
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:56,710
So replace that, and
remove the rest after the loop there.

151
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,610
And let's just work with this.

152
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,040
So we're going to grab the feature image.

153
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,880
And the way that we grab
the feature image is like so.

154
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:14,460
So within php, we're going to check
to see if there is a post thumbnail.

155
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:20,160
Which is the feature image, and if so,
the_post_thumbnail, and then that's it.

156
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,170
So, there would be your feature image.

157
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,780
And if you didn't upload one,
then nothing would happen.

158
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,020
So, if you don't want that,
then you could go, else, and then in here,

159
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,930
you can just echo an image,
a static image.

160
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:37,810
Otherwise, You could leave it empty and
then for

161
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:42,090
the level three heading we're gonna go
php and this is gonna be the_title.

162
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:47,070
And we're just using
the native WordPress stuff.

163
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,830
We're not using advanced
custom fields at all here.

164
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:56,010
And this is php the_content.

165
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,990
And that is the content
in the content editor.

166
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,080
Save that and let's see if it worked.

167
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,480
And there it is.
So we have our Final Project Features,

168
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,060
the text and
each of the custom post types.

169
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,390
Awesome, great job.

170
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,300
You did it.

171
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:14,970
The next lecture we're actually
going to skip this section.

172
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,900
We're going to leave it static,
just because,

173
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,140
well it would be redundant to do the same
thing over and over and over again.

174
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,860
We're basically doing the same thing now.

175
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,420
I'm just kind of hammering
in how this all works.

176
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,270
We're going to do this again for

177
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,370
the instructor section because
there are a few more details.

178
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:34,560
A little bit different than
the past few sections.

179
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,360
Like the numbers, the social icons and
things like that.

180
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,900
Where as this,
we just have a title and a video.

181
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:47,540
If you want, and I totally recommend
you do this, is you try yourself,

182
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:52,540
that's my challenge to you,
is, create, before you start

183
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:57,790
the next lecture,
create a custom section on the home page.

184
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:06,210
Using advanced custom
fields to add a video.

185
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,540
To embed a YouTube video.

186
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,930
That's my challenge to you.

187
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:13,260
If you can do it,
if you think you can, give it a try.

188
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,840
And if you want to skip that
altogether then that's fine,

189
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,660
just head to the next lecture
which will be the instructor.

190
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,949
And, doing that sort of stuff so
I'll see you there.

191
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:27,189
