Hey, everybody.
Welcome back to Boost Your Income with

2
00:00:02.261 --> 00:00:03.360
Bootstrap to WordPress.

3
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.136
This lecture is called How To Achieve
the Parallax Scrolling Effect

4
00:00:08.136 --> 00:00:09.903
in Five Minutes or Less.

5
00:00:09.903 --> 00:00:10.878
Let's go.

6
00:00:10.878 --> 00:00:19.143
[MUSIC]

7
00:00:19.143 --> 00:00:22.882
I wanna show you that it's actually
possible to achieve the parallax scrolling

8
00:00:22.882 --> 00:00:25.110
effect in five minutes or less.

9
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.350
To demonstrate,
I have our static site here.

10
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.060
This is the one that we've been building.

11
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.540
And currently we can't actually scroll
because there is not enough content

12
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.110
on the page.

13
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.495
So let's just go back
to our code editor and

14
00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:41.397
I'm just going to paste inside our
section, it doesn't really matter where,

15
00:00:41.397 --> 00:00:46.380
just a div with the class of container
with a wild amount of lorem ipsum.

16
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.780
I'm only putting this in temporarily just
so we can actually cross the page so

17
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.310
we can see the effect.

18
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.270
So this is just there, for example,
so we can actually scroll.

19
00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.010
So I'm gonna scroll, and
there is no parallax effect currently.

20
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.430
The reason why the background is staying
still there is because we set the CSS for

21
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.180
the hero to have a background position of
fixed, so it stays still as we scroll.

22
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.100
That's one step of the parallax effect but
it's not the true parallax effect,

23
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.780
because in the true effect
the background scrolls up.

24
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.510
But at a different speed
than the foreground.

25
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.960
So I'm using this simple parallax
scrolling technique on tutsplus.com.

26
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.530
I will share that as a link in the extras
section or in the description.

27
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.460
And then you can follow along in there

28
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.600
afterwards just if you
missed any little details.

29
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.880
It's the tutorial I used
to learn how to do it.

30
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.990
It's very simple and

31
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.870
straightforward and I wanted to show
you how easy it is to implement it.

32
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.090
Okay, so let's go ahead and
start the timer.

33
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.180
I have egg timer here set for
five minutes.

34
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.300
And I'm going to hit go.

35
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.870
And then when we go I'll prove to you that
we can do this in five minutes or less.

36
00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.930
All right.
Here we go, five minutes.

37
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.770
Open up your code editor.

38
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.670
First thing you wanna do is go to your
hero section and give the custom HTML5

39
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.375
data Attribute of data-type,
background, these are required.

40
00:02:11.375 --> 00:02:17.302
And data-speed.

41
00:02:17.302 --> 00:02:20.590
And the speed we're gonna set to five.

42
00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.660
It could be set to any integer, but
we're gonna set it to five, and

43
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.410
you can play around with it
later just to see how it works.

44
00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.490
Save that.

45
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:35.050
And go ahead and open up your main.js and
let's start up jQuery.

46
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.090
So jQuery should already
be initiated in your index.

47
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.860
You have jQuery being pulled in.

48
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.570
First thing you're gonna wanna
do is cache the window object.

49
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.680
I like doing this cuz it just makes
the load time a little bit faster.

50
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.500
A little bit of an advanced technique but
not so much.

51
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.310
We're gonna be using this window object
a little bit later in our script.

52
00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.230
So here is where we're gonna start
the parallax background effect.

53
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.370
So let's select all sections with the data

54
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.440
attribute, the data type
attribute of background.

55
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.000
And then each.

56
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.080
We're going to roll through each of those,
function.

57
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.972
All right.
Here we go.

58
00:03:22.015 --> 00:03:30.230
Then we're gonna cache the variable
bgobj for background object.

59
00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.110
That's custom variable.

60
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.710
And select this.

61
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.020
There we go.
This is assigning the object.

62
00:03:39.621 --> 00:03:43.441
All right,
now we're gonna go through the window,

63
00:03:45.844 --> 00:03:51.990
Scroll function here.

64
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:57.335
And in here,
we're gonna to scroll the background at

65
00:03:57.335 --> 00:04:03.340
var speed, so
the background object's speed.

66
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.443
And the yPos is a negative

67
00:04:08.443 --> 00:04:15.004
value because we're scrolling

68
00:04:15.004 --> 00:04:19.864
it u Okay, so var yPos =

69
00:04:19.864 --> 00:04:26.911
-($window.scrollTop() /

70
00:04:26.911 --> 00:04:33.724
$bgobj.data('speed').

71
00:04:33.724 --> 00:04:36.970
All right.

72
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:42.020
And then, put together our
final background position.

73
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.828
So variable, call that coords for
coordinates.

74
00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:49.636
And then 50% will be the position.

75
00:04:49.636 --> 00:04:54.760
A little space there, gonna concatenate

76
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.860
the y position,
plus we're gonna concatenate pixels, so

77
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.890
we can actually use this in CSS,
and then let's move the background.

78
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.870
So let's take that
background object CSS and

79
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:18.500
in there,
let's take the background Position.

80
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.270
And then that will be coordinates.

81
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.860
That variable that we just stored there.

82
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.530
And then end, window, scroll.

83
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.160
There is CSS that we have to do, but we've
already done it in the previous lecture.

84
00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.970
In our hero, we've made the background
50% 0, repeat, and fixed.

85
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.090
Fixed is important to have there.

86
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:41.500
Because now if you go to the site and
refresh.

87
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.659
Try scrolling now.

88
00:05:44.121 --> 00:05:46.640
See how that background
scrolls at a different speed.

89
00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.620
Then the foreground,
that is the parallax effect.

90
00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:57.110
And now the beauty of this is all
you need to do for future Sections.

91
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.360
Let's just give it the data type,
background, and

92
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.130
data speed whatever number on any section.

93
00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.500
So if you want it on this section,
if you want it on the section below,

94
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.610
you just need to make sure that
the ID has a background image.

95
00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.660
And make sure it's a tall
background image, very tall one.

96
00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.350
And it's repeat and fixed.

97
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:19.200
And that's it, and you can see
here I have 15 seconds to spare.

98
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.240
So there's the simple parallax scrolling
effect in five minutes or less.

99
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.620
I hope that rocked your world.

100
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:29.549
See you in the next lecture, where we will
create the modal window using Bootstrap.

101
00:06:29.549 --> 00:06:32.879
