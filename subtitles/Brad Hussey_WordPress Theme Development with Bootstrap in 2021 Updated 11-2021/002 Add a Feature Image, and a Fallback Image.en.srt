00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:00,991
Hey, new lecture.

2
00:00:00,991 --> 00:00:03,777
Add a feature image and a fallback image.

3
00:00:03,777 --> 00:00:13,090
[MUSIC]

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:16,944
So in this lecture what we wanna do is
first of all hook this in properly,

5
00:00:16,944 --> 00:00:21,635
make it look a little bit nicer, which
is fairly straightforward and simple.

6
00:00:21,635 --> 00:00:24,595
And then, what we want to do
is work on the feature image,

7
00:00:24,595 --> 00:00:26,715
and that's this right here.

8
00:00:26,715 --> 00:00:32,195
So this is a feature image that you
can attach to pages in WordPress, and

9
00:00:32,195 --> 00:00:37,080
the way we wanna go about it is have
the ability to give the user or

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,260
your client or yourself,
the ability to upload a feature image.

11
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,530
And if they don't add a feature image
which is a very likely scenario,

12
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,950
have a fallback image.

13
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,100
So that the page layout
maintains it's beauty.

14
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:50,859
So in your code editor.

15
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:56,340
The first thing we need to do to just
make this look a little bit nicer,

16
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,860
is get the header.

17
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:04,785
That's one thing we forgot to do, and at
the bottom we just need to get the footer.

18
00:01:04,785 --> 00:01:10,380
Here we go, and
then that should make the page

19
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,250
look more like the rest of the website.

20
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,180
There we go.

21
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,010
Now, we gotta just make this dynamic, so

22
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,110
let's do this header up here
in the feature image, rather.

23
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:30,170
Okay, so what we need to do is check
to see, if there's a post thumbnail and

24
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:38,030
if there is,
add an inline style right here in the tag.

25
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:42,660
Use a style attribute to pull in
a background image with the dynamic

26
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,930
background URL.

27
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,930
Otherwise, we just need
to fall back to this, so

28
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:52,220
that looks a little bit like this,
has post thumbnail.

29
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,190
There we go.

30
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:05,530
And if it has the post thumbnail, let's
just do a little bit more PHP here, else.

31
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:11,970
Just doing the basic structure first,
and then we'll start

32
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,810
explaining how this all works at the end
here, I wanna close that if L statement.

33
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,453
So basically right here,
check for feature image.

34
00:02:24,225 --> 00:02:26,090
Image, there we go.

35
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:26,910
Okay.

36
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,490
Whoops, this isn't right.

37
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,300
There we go.
Close that properly.

38
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,420
Okay.

39
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,890
So in here basically,
we just need to copy this.

40
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,760
And instead of having the feature
image default be the class here,

41
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,460
we wanna just get rid of that.

42
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,420
Because that's what gives
a background image to this section,

43
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,050
to this specific tag.

44
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:48,830
So get rid of that.

45
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:53,020
We're actually gonna add
a style attribute here.

46
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,200
And then, we're gonna go background,
then URL and

47
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,110
then in there is where we
want to put the actual URL.

48
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:04,580
And that's gonna be no repeat and then,

49
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:08,930
we're gonna have background size, cover.

50
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:14,430
Okay, and then basically,
all we need to get is this background URL.

51
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:21,750
Okay, so in order to do this,
we can't just use PHP to say pull in

52
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:26,810
the WordPress function to post thumbnail
because that pulls in an entire image tag.

53
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:31,560
We need to get the URL for
the feature image.

54
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,679
So what is the actual path to
the image in the database?

55
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,590
Stored on our server and so
the way that we do that is

56
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,640
we need to create a variable
because that's good practice.

57
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,860
Let's just say thumbnail
URL that makes sense.

58
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,970
And then in here,

59
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:58,240
we're gonna use a couple functions
together to get us that thumbnail URL.

60
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,872
So there is one function, built into
WordPress called WordPress Attachment URL.

61
00:04:02,872 --> 00:04:09,530
And so that returns the URI for
an attachment.

62
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,150
So basically,
that kind of gets us what we need.

63
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:17,810
So outputs something like this
example.net, WordPress content uploads, so

64
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:18,780
on and so forth.

65
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:23,410
But we need to be able to get the ID of
the attachment that we're looking for,

66
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:27,820
and we could very easily just
hardcode that attachment ID in there.

67
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:32,190
We could just go find out the specific
image we like, find out the ID that was

68
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:37,830
stored in the data base and then, just
type this out and say, whatever the ID is.

69
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,430
But that's bad practice
because it's hard coded.

70
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:46,380
But if we remove that attachment, and what
if we want to change the feature image?

71
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,470
Then this isn't gonna work for us.

72
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:53,000
So we need to dynamically find
out the post thumbnail ID.

73
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,210
Based on the feature image that
was uploaded to this page.

74
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:02,016
Thankfully, we can do that with
a pretty straight forward function,

75
00:05:02,016 --> 00:05:04,412
inward press called get post thumbnail ID.

76
00:05:04,412 --> 00:05:09,254
And essentially,
it will return the ID of feature image

77
00:05:09,254 --> 00:05:14,380
attached to the post,
that's exactly what we need.

78
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,620
So we just need to put
that function in here.

79
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:24,970
So get post thumbnail id and
that requires an argument in here.

80
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,200
And we're gonna grab the post,

81
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,090
which is what we're on and
we're gonna grab the ID from it.

82
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,200
So this will get us the ID and

83
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:39,720
it will store the URL with
the ID right in this variable.

84
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:46,593
Then we could just very easily go php,
echo, thumbnail, url.

85
00:05:46,593 --> 00:05:51,430
And that should get us
what we're looking for.

86
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,830
Let's just check.

87
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:56,210
So nothings broken but
why don't we test to see.

88
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,800
So let's replace the feature image,
cuz right now, it's in the fall back,

89
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,409
why don't we just put,
let's try this hipster stuff.

90
00:06:04,776 --> 00:06:08,520
I'm gonna set that feature image and I'm
gonna update that and see what happens.

91
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,460
And there we go.

92
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,920
There is our background image.

93
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:20,290
And if I remove it, and then update again,
then that should fall back to our default.

94
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:20,930
There it is.

95
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:21,500
Perfect.

96
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,115
All right.
So I saw a couple of things in here,

97
00:06:23,115 --> 00:06:25,280
before we move on to the next lecture.

98
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,000
This should actually be a dynamic title.

99
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,050
So all you gotta do there is just PHP,
use the title function.

100
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,140
Built in WordPress function.

101
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,880
And do the same thing down here.

102
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:36,580
Excellent.

103
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,230
That's it for this lecture.

104
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:38,891
We'll see you in the next lecture.

105
00:06:38,891 --> 00:06:41,329
We're gonna move on to
the rest of the content, here.

106
00:06:41,329 --> 00:06:44,498
