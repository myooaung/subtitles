Hey everybody, welcome back to Boost
Your Income with Bootstrap to WordPress.

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.440
This lecture is called
Code D Boost Your Income Section.

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:16.861
Check it out.
[MUSIC]

4
00:00:16.861 --> 00:00:17.790
>> All right, folks.

5
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.293
And in this section we're gonna be coding
the how you can boost your income section

6
00:00:21.293 --> 00:00:21.860
right here.

7
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:22.940
It's very simple, straightforward.

8
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:23.810
There's not a lot to it.

9
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:24.620
Background texture.

10
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.770
Got some graphics text.

11
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.460
It's obviously very copy heavy.

12
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.505
What we're gonna be doing to save you
time on that, you can go ahead and

13
00:00:31.505 --> 00:00:35.145
in your course file's folder, in
Miscellaneous, you should have a copy deck

14
00:00:35.145 --> 00:00:38.855
there with all of the text that I have
on the home page and the resources page.

15
00:00:38.855 --> 00:00:40.315
Both very copy heavy.

16
00:00:40.315 --> 00:00:41.615
You can just copy and paste this stuff.

17
00:00:41.615 --> 00:00:44.045
If you don't wanna use it, that's fine,
you can use Learn Epsom, or

18
00:00:44.045 --> 00:00:46.415
whatever copy you want to do.

19
00:00:46.415 --> 00:00:48.620
All right, go to your code editor.

20
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.210
Scroll to your BOOST YOUR INCOME section,
right here.

21
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.280
Give that section the ID of boost-income.

22
00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.570
Within there, we're gonna give
the div with the class of container.

23
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.340
By now you should understand
what the container does.

24
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.590
If not,
let me give you a little refresher.

25
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.410
The container looks like this.

26
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.950
It is this stuff right here.

27
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.590
It centers the content in
the middle of the web page.

28
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.310
The whole section,
the idea of boost income is this.

29
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.860
And it is as wide as the browser
window no matter how wide it is.

30
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.250
But if we wanted to center our text and
have access to the bootstrap rows and

31
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.160
columns and such,
you need to put it inside a container.

32
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.770
And this is the container,
all right, inside our container.

33
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.250
We're gonna have a div with
a class of section dash header.

34
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.700
And that will be section dash header,
boom, all right.

35
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.890
Inside here, an image.

36
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.280
The source of assets/img for
image/icon-boost.

37
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.200
There's an icon called icon-boost in
your images folder, or your IMG folder.

38
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.150
That Alt will be chart,
because it is a chart.

39
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.080
Under that level two heading,
how you can boost your income.

40
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.590
Right there.

41
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.270
All right.
After a section header let's add

42
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.000
paragraph.

43
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.960
Give that paragraph the class of lead for
some leading text.

44
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.670
And go ahead and
add that copy that I provided.

45
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.760
We don't have to spend time.

46
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.390
This isn't a copyrighting class.

47
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.680
This is a coding class.

48
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.715
So just go ahead and

49
00:02:26.715 --> 00:02:30.418
add your lorem ipsem or the content
that I provided in the copy deck.

50
00:02:30.418 --> 00:02:31.330
Right there.

51
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:37.160
After that paragraph we're gonna go ahead
and add a div with the class of row.

52
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.280
That is a Bootstrap class.

53
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.500
Inside that row, you guessed it,
div with the class of col.

54
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.260
Small.

55
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.130
And this will be six.

56
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.950
We want two sections, side by side,
in the web page here.

57
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.750
So we're gonna use two six columns.

58
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.060
If that makes sense.

59
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.692
6 plus 6 is 12.

60
00:02:55.692 --> 00:02:59.970
That means we will have two columns,
technically, side by side.

61
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.430
Really it's six columns side by side but

62
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.120
we're utilizing six columns wide
to create a two column look.

63
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.970
Hopefully that makes sense.

64
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.160
All right, in our sadder first call SM6,

65
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.600
level three heading
make money on the side.

66
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.980
Good spelling, Brad, here we go.

67
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:22.480
Paragraph.

68
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.770
Inside that paragraph we got some text.

69
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.160
You got it.
Copy and paste.

70
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.850
All right and then our next column here,
level three heading.

71
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.350
Create a full time income.

72
00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.399
And then we're gonna have some
text here inside a paragraph tag.

73
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:41.730
There it is.

74
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:42.520
Save that.

75
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.342
Why don't we give it a look to
make sure it looks awesome?

76
00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:50.870
It doesn't really look that awesome
because things aren't centered.

77
00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.880
That means we have to do some CSS.

78
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.840
Great.
Let's jump into our CSS.

79
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.810
All right, here we are in our CSS.

80
00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.720
Under the layout, this is where
we're going to do some Styles for

81
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.830
the layout of our web page.

82
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.310
We're gonna use many sections.

83
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.269
And we have been using section tags a lot.

84
00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.930
So, we're gonna style
the section tag in general.

85
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.280
Give it padding, 80 pixels on the top and
bottom, none on the sides.

86
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.500
Save that and give it a little look here.

87
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.580
You can see we gave some breathing
room for our section, great!

88
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.470
We also have section header class.

89
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.020
We want to text align that center.

90
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.520
Check it out.

91
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.080
See how we text aligned
our section header.

92
00:04:32.912 --> 00:04:37.590
All right, inside our section,
we typically use some level two headings.

93
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.530
We want some margins there, 20 on top,
0 on the sides, 40 on the bottom.

94
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:49.657
We're also gonna be using some
section H3's, margin 30, 0 and 10.

95
00:04:49.657 --> 00:04:51.923
These styles are just kinda predetermined.

96
00:04:51.923 --> 00:04:55.370
I already did the design work and
I know that these styles work.

97
00:04:56.558 --> 00:05:00.410
And so yeah, just go ahead and
copy those in, save it, check it out.

98
00:05:01.465 --> 00:05:04.611
Okay, here we go, we got our level
two headings, got some margins,

99
00:05:04.611 --> 00:05:06.253
level three heading, looks good.

100
00:05:06.253 --> 00:05:12.352
This is looking like our final site,
perfect looks identical.

101
00:05:12.352 --> 00:05:15.020
All right, that is the how you
could boost your income section.

102
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.720
I'll see you in the next lecture where
we're going to be jumping down and

103
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.100
coding ourselves
the Who Should Take This Course section.

104
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.438
Again, very simple.

105
00:05:23.438 --> 00:05:27.030
We're just gonna be doing some copy and
some CSS.

106
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.809
See you there.
