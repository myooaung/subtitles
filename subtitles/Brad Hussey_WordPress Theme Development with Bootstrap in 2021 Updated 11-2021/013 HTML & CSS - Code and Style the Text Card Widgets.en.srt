1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:06,320
All right, friends, now we're going to try and code these things up and style them so they look just

2
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:07,160
right.

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,670
Head over to that code editor and in widget start each HTML.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:15,410
We're going to make a little spot for that area of our widgets.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:23,270
So right after our title wrapper, what we want to do is find the closing div tag to the row that we

6
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,730
opened here because we want to start a new row.

7
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:34,710
And so we're going to div with the class of row and in there we're actually going to put a div with

8
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:44,090
the class of call Dash SM Dash Dash four and then we're going to call this div class text dash card

9
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,570
space, let's say style Dash one.

10
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:54,940
And we're going to have an empty div with the class of overlay, so let's make sure that that doesn't

11
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:59,840
expand because we don't actually need that opened just an empty div that will style level four heading

12
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,230
and we'll just say, like modern and responsive.

13
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:07,000
After that, a paragraph tagged with just some text you can put whatever you want.

14
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,600
I'm going to put just a little descriptive, you know, thing there.

15
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,880
And then after we're going to have div with the class of overlay dash image.

16
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:21,130
And inside of that, we're going to have an image.

17
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,710
And we're going to go into our assets folder.

18
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,780
In a folder called Images, which I do not believe we've set up yet, so we'll go ahead and do that

19
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,350
in just a moment.

20
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:37,090
Slash well, we need to get the image, so let's check our assets folder.

21
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:42,580
We have no images right now, but in our final folder, which you should have already downloaded and

22
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:47,770
if you didn't, it'll be in the downloads section of this course, or at least the section of the course.

23
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:52,120
I'll make sure that that's very easy to find wherever those assets are stored.

24
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,570
And then in the assets folder, we'll have assets images.

25
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:01,510
Make sure that you grab those so you can make a copy of them in your finder and put them and put them

26
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,530
in your assets folder.

27
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,010
We're going to grab those images.

28
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:08,830
We're just going to drag them into our assets folder, a copy of them images.

29
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,300
There we go.

30
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:14,200
So we need to grab the card dash date Typekit page.

31
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:25,270
It's always a good practice to put an alt descriptor in there illustration and that will be the markup

32
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,110
for one of these text card overlay type things.

33
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,880
So if we save that?

34
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,560
Check it out in our browser.

35
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:39,230
It looks just like this, so there's not much to it, there's just the markup with no actual specific

36
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:43,190
styles, so that will be the first card.

37
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:51,800
OK, now what we're going to do is we're going to copy this and we're going to do so from the call Sam

38
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,270
for add another one.

39
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,940
And we're going to change a few things.

40
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,890
So instead of style, one is going to be style two.

41
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,270
And you can put different, different text if you want.

42
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:08,390
So in the H-4, I'll put like hand-crafted code and in the paragraph tag, let's put something like,

43
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,130
you know, something like this.

44
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,210
And then a different image, it will be card and then editor.

45
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,310
Illustration is fine.

46
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:20,420
We're going to copy this call, Sam four again for another card.

47
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:27,880
And this is going to be style three and then we'll do something like intuitive seems.

48
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:34,000
This doesn't really matter what's in this, it's just really for display purposes because it will change.

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,400
It'll be dynamic once be added into WordPress.

50
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:41,980
The editor sorry, the image is going to be Car Dash page, so those are three images in the images

51
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:42,400
folder.

52
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,630
Now, if we save that, we'll have three two two two.

53
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,500
So they're in there columns, they just don't look like this.

54
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,780
Now, before we move forward in between this closing rotation and this row tag right here, we're just

55
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:01,180
going to put a date with the class of spacer and we're going to style that to give some space in between

56
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:01,930
these rows.

57
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,570
And we might use this in elementary later once it's in WordPress.

58
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:11,020
So if you head over to your styles, then what we're going to do is maybe just after the typography

59
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,880
here, after the age for you, go to everyone.

60
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,690
It doesn't really matter.

61
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,060
It's class of the spacer margin.

62
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,860
We're going to say seventy five pixels.

63
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:23,060
Zero, so top and bottom seventy five pixels, so that'll give some space right there.

64
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:28,820
Head to the bottom of your styles there, and we're going to text card style that general style up.

65
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:34,340
So possession is going to be relative overflow hidden.

66
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,010
Minimum height of the card.

67
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:42,500
Let's make like three hundred and thirty five pixels padding thirty five.

68
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:48,170
Thirty one hundred, that means thirty five on the top, thirty left and right, 100 on the bottom.

69
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:58,100
We want the border radius to be 20 pixels and then we want the box shadow to be zero, 10 pixels, 15

70
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:04,880
pixels negative three and then be a black and the alpha channel zero point one five.

71
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,450
So if we see what that looks like now, it looks more like this.

72
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,090
So we're starting to we're starting to get there.

73
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:20,140
Now we're going to style the text card age four and the text card paragraph tag.

74
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,340
The color is going to be white.

75
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:30,660
And then we're also going to style the text card paragraph tag individually here in isolation, and

76
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,860
the font size will be zero point eight REM.

77
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,730
Text card overlay, these are classes.

78
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:45,890
Now the position is going to be absolute, and we're going to Z Index negative one.

79
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:50,630
So that overlay that empty div that we set up, this is we're going to style that.

80
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,480
So what does that that index be negative one.

81
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,350
So that goes back behind kind of the content, the text.

82
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:02,330
We're going to say top zero left zero.

83
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,440
We want the width and height to be 100 percent of the container.

84
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:11,720
And then this is where we're going to do like a background gradient sort of thing just to show you where

85
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,050
it is.

86
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:19,220
You could see like background black and you'll see just kind of an overlay that spans the whole content

87
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:19,910
and it's black.

88
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,650
You can change whatever color you want.

89
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,690
But we're actually going to do a gradient, a linear gradient.

90
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,260
Let's go 130 degrees.

91
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:34,940
So from where it starts, the color, the first color stop.

92
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:41,800
Is going to be up to nine nine for a zero percent, zero percent, so the color stopped right at the

93
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:49,840
beginning and it's going to go to even be five seven five seven to 100 percent.

94
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,910
And that's the background gradient.

95
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:53,320
Check it out.

96
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,910
Here we go, looking very good.

97
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,440
Now we're going to style these individual cards, so we have text card.

98
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,750
Also, with the class of style Dash one.

99
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:06,390
So you see how there's no spacing between this, these styles, these classes.

100
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:12,580
Rather, it's because we want to select the text card that also has the class style Dash one.

101
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,630
We could just say style Dash one, but we're being more specific.

102
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:22,180
And then the overlay, we're going to establish a style one overlay as basically the same is what we

103
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:22,590
have here.

104
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,920
In fact, it's the exact same because that's going to be the style one overlay.

105
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,990
Now we want to style the style to overlay.

106
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,230
So just copy that entire style, duplicate it and change it to style too.

107
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,410
And then this is where we can change the colors.

108
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,570
Five six, cc f two.

109
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:44,440
And that's going to go to two f eight zero ed, really.

110
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,460
You can just choose your favorite colors or whatever you think looks good or whatever works for the

111
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,230
brand of the site that you're building.

112
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,610
So let's style to check it out.

113
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:52,470
Perfect.

114
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:53,960
Now, copy that.

115
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:59,770
A third one is going to be style three and then again, change the color to something that you like.

116
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:07,390
We're going to make this one six f c f nine seven two two one nine six five three.

117
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:08,640
There we go.

118
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,810
So we've got like an orange blue and a green gradient.

119
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:18,680
Now we're going to do is we're going to say text card overlay image and then select the image within

120
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:18,920
that.

121
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:26,210
We're going to say width 100 percent height, auto and then opacity zero point five.

122
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:33,810
Looking a little bit better, continue on with this style, we're going to select text card and then

123
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:34,800
overlay image.

124
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,690
We're going to do position absolute transform, rotate negative 15 degrees.

125
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:43,700
We want to twist it a little bit.

126
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:52,530
We want the border radius to be 20 pixels overflow to be hidden and the width to be 65 percent.

127
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,130
Let's check it out, Kate.

128
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,360
Now we want to position these to, you know, being a different location.

129
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,540
As you can see, they're kind of hidden off on the side and the enemy.

130
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,140
So we're going to say because this is position absolute, we can move it wherever we want.

131
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,210
Right.

132
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,750
Negative 15 percent and then bottom negative 15 percent and then transition.

133
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:16,830
Are Variable Transition, dir.

134
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:17,820
OK.

135
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,460
Perfect.

136
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,400
Now let's do that animation effect.

137
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,780
We're going to say text dash card on hover.

138
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:35,440
We're going to select the overlay dash image style that and that's going to be transform rotates and

139
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,850
it's like 18 degrees.

140
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,570
So something subtle but still noticeable.

141
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,240
Negative 18 degrees.

142
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:41,780
Perfect.

143
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,920
Now the font size is a little bit small here, a little bit bigger on the final.

144
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,300
Let's make a little bit bigger.

145
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,970
So that would be the paragraph tag that we started in.

146
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,100
Isolation will say point nine room.

147
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,720
That looks better to me.

148
00:09:54,620 --> 00:10:00,280
That would be the widgets, the little text card widgets with different colors.

149
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:06,050
In our next lesson, we're going to style this kind of bigger call card with the background shadow and
