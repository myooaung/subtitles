00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:00,890
Hey everyone!

2
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,110
Welcome back to Boost Your Income
with Bootstrap to WordPress.

3
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:07,060
This lecture is called Code the "Who
Should Take This Course" Section

4
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,890
using Advanced Custom Fields.

5
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,360
I love advanced custom fields.

6
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:18,931
Check it out.
[MUSIC]

7
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:22,460
Now what we're gonna do is add the,
Who Should Take This Course?, section.

8
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,670
Now the last lecture was quite
long at about 25 minutes.

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,720
That's kinda at the top end of how
long I like to keep my lectures.

10
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,320
So this one's actually gonna be quite
short because this is an easy section

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,270
to update.

12
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,610
We're just gonna have
the image like last time.

13
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:37,110
The title.

14
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,870
And then we're just gonna use
a text box to display this content.

15
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,550
So you can add whatever text you want.

16
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,030
So let's just go into the back end here.

17
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,650
Into our Field Groups.

18
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,820
Let's go back to Custom Fields here.

19
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,800
And then add a new Field Group.

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:01,110
And this is gonna be called
the Who Should Take this Course section.

21
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,030
You could shorten that if you'd like, but

22
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,560
I'm going to leave it as is
because it keeps it simple.

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,540
You know what it means.

24
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,010
There's no confusion.

25
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:11,760
Let's add a field here.

26
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,630
And we're going to do something
a little different here.

27
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,770
We're going to have a field label be
totally different from the field name.

28
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,850
So this is just going to be section title.

29
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,650
But I don't want to call
this section title.

30
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:27,090
I want this to be- who_section_title,
and that's going to be Text,

31
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,180
and required, yes, and
then formatting, no formatting.

32
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,740
Close that field.

33
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,450
Let's add another field here, and it's
actually going to be the section image, so

34
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,620
this would be section Image, and

35
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:45,304
we're going to change this
to who_ Feature_image.

36
00:01:45,304 --> 00:01:48,072
And this will be an image.

37
00:01:51,032 --> 00:01:52,790
And we're gonna grab that image object.

38
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:53,660
Required, no.

39
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,440
Previous size, medium.

40
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,540
All good to go.

41
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:02,160
I'm just gonna drag that above the section
titles, since it comes before.

42
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,100
So, it displays like that in the editor.

43
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,880
It doesn't effect how we pull in the info.

44
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,850
But it does effect how the editor
looks to the people editing the page.

45
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,060
Section body.

46
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,090
This is gonna be who section body and

47
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,960
that will be a text area required yes.

48
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,130
Actually, it won't be a text area.

49
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:30,251
We're gonna make this a wizzy wake editor,
meaning they can do a lot of formatting.

50
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:31,840
So tool bar, full or basic.

51
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,360
Let's give them basics.

52
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,780
They don't have full Toolbar access,
but they have basic access.

53
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:42,070
So they can do basic text formatting,
possibly upload an image,

54
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,100
have some links, things like that.

55
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,470
In fact, you can actually decide if you
want them to show media upload buttons.

56
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:51,270
I'm just gonna say no, so they can't
upload images, cuz they don't need to.

57
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,940
Let's just say that.

58
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:53,490
Close the field.

59
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,270
So we have the image title in body.

60
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,240
Good.

61
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,540
Show this field group if
page is equal to home.

62
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,060
Good and the order number.

63
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,560
This is, again if you want this to display
before or after the previous field group

64
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,490
which was the,
how you can boost your income section.

65
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:17,730
I'm going to leave this as zero because
you can actually drag it on the front or

66
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,360
when you're in the editing
screen you can drag that

67
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,140
meta box to where you want it to display.

68
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,960
And it should by default come
after the one we just created.

69
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,230
Position normal, seamless.

70
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,400
I'm going to show you what
no meta box looks like.

71
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,550
I don't prefer it but
I'll show you what it looks like.

72
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:40,540
And it's already going to
be pulling the settings

73
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,900
from this from the other booster
income section that we just created,

74
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,160
the field group because it
has a lower order number.

75
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,220
Technically this one is zero,

76
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,490
but because we did it first it
should be using those settings.

77
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:57,680
But maybe let's confirm that before we for
sure say that's the case.

78
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,260
Publish that and go to your edit page.

79
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,280
On your home, your home edit page.

80
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,640
There we go.

81
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,850
And under there we should
have our section image.

82
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,370
There we go.
So do you see what I mean without

83
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,000
the meta box?

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,940
It doesn't look as nice.

85
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,770
It just kind of It just kinda fades
into the background a little bit,

86
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:18,150
it doesn't stand out.

87
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:22,870
And that way you can't actually
close the section or drag it.

88
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:27,740
So I'm gonna go back here and
make it be a meta box standard.

89
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:29,800
Update.

90
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,190
That should be here on
the home editing screen now.

91
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,160
In the boost income section, and

92
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,090
who should take this
course section right here.

93
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,970
So we have an image, title, and body.

94
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,940
Let's go ahead and do those.

95
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,590
So, let's add an image and
that image will be pad.

96
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:51,140
The title will say,

97
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:57,410
icon our pad icon and

98
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:03,140
then the alt text will be
an icon of a pencil and paper.

99
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,060
Here we go.

100
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:05,666
Select.

101
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:06,320
There's a section image.

102
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,420
There's a section title.

103
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,310
It is who should take this course.

104
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,960
I'm going to copy that and
then I'm going to paste it in there and

105
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,910
in the section section body,
see how we have the basic tool right here?

106
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,070
I'm just gonna copy all of this.

107
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:26,030
Paste it right in here and it should
maintain or retain the formatting,

108
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:32,040
there we go, and
then go ahead and update that.

109
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,230
Of course we haven't done anything in
the template so it won't do anything.

110
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,570
Won't show up on the front end.

111
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,400
So we have to pull that in in here.

112
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,230
So let's go ahead and
add some more variables.

113
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,140
Who_feature_image.

114
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:49,700
That's going to be get field again.

115
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:56,285
And this will be, who_feature_image.

116
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:05,020
This next one will be, who_section-title,

117
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,375
change this to, who_section_title.

118
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:16,525
And this last one will be, who_section_
body, I believe is what we called it.

119
00:06:16,525 --> 00:06:17,179
Yep.

120
00:06:17,179 --> 00:06:23,910
And this'll be who_section_body.

121
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:27,510
Great.
You should know what to do now,

122
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:32,660
scroll down to the who benefits section
down here is what we called it.

123
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:34,930
The image.

124
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,310
Same deal, why don't we just
copy what we did up here.

125
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,720
If the user uploaded an image.

126
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,780
And we're just going to switch that up.

127
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,120
So put it here.

128
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,640
If user uploaded an image.

129
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:50,296
This will be who_ feature_image.

130
00:06:50,296 --> 00:06:56,771
And then the source will
be who_feature_image, and

131
00:06:56,771 --> 00:07:02,440
then we who_feature_image here as well.

132
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,530
URL and alt is still good.

133
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:12,689
This will be, php echo who_section_title.

134
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:20,610
And then all of this stuff, remove all
of this HTML inside of that column tag.

135
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,378
Or the div with the tag of call.

136
00:07:22,378 --> 00:07:29,790
Php echo who_section_body.

137
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:30,770
And that's it.

138
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,700
Let's see if it worked on the front end.

139
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,210
And here it is.

140
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:38,360
It's dynamic pulling in from
the back end and simple.

141
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,270
Pretty straight forward, really easy and
now you can easily change this text or

142
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:45,000
your client can and it's you

143
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,430
can say how easy it is to just set up
a section like that and it looks great.

144
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:53,450
In the edit screen right here who
should take this course section.

145
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,200
It's very easy to edit.

146
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,030
Very easy to modify.

147
00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:01,410
And it's also worth noting that by
dragging these on top of each other,

148
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:05,650
it doesn't affect
the position on the page.

149
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,400
That's something that we'll leave for
a more advanced lecture,

150
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,000
of how you can reposition
those using the dashboard.

151
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,720
Or using the edit screen.

152
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,100
But it's worth noting that if you
drag these in different positions,

153
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,650
it's not actually going to change
the layout on the front end.

154
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,490
Cool.
In the next lecture,

155
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,980
we're going to go down.

156
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,920
And we're going to get started
