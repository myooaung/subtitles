00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,949
Hey, everybody, welcome back to Boost
Your Income of Bootstrap to WordPress.

2
00:00:03,949 --> 00:00:08,449
This lecture, I'm gonna teach you how to

3
00:00:08,449 --> 00:00:12,957
code a circle, using CSS3, not Corel.

4
00:00:12,957 --> 00:00:14,280
That was weird.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:22,139
>> [MUSIC].

6
00:00:22,139 --> 00:00:26,045
Okay guys, now what we're gonna do
is gonna code some CSS3 Circles, and

7
00:00:26,045 --> 00:00:28,200
what's exciting about CSS3 Circles?

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,530
Well traditionally in web design, what
you'd have to do is open up Photoshop,

9
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:36,120
create a circle at all different sizes,
and colors, and textures, and

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,280
whatever it is you were trying to do, and
you'd export it as a background image.

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,030
And you couldn't just export it as an PNG,
because not all of

12
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:47,310
browsers at one point supported PNG,
so you have to have a JPG as well.

13
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,980
You have to have all these
different fall back images.

14
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,560
It was a huge waste of time and
a pain in the butt.

15
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,490
But now you can use CSS3 for
your circles and your shapes.

16
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:58,760
So we're gonna do that.

17
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,060
I'll show you what that is here.

18
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,890
These are actually circles in CSS3,
they're not images.

19
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,480
Their circles using CSS3,

20
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:10,650
and the even better part,
is they take hardly any loading time.

21
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,130
Whereas an image, you'd have to
export all the image assets, and

22
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,020
that has loading time, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, crappy, you know?

23
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,720
CSS3 is awesome, let's do it.

24
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,060
Open up your CSS, and

25
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:27,420
in your global section, we're gonna
go to the bottom here after image.

26
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,950
Now I did realize there's one
thing we haven't done yet.

27
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:33,270
And this is kind of,
I wanted to include this in this lecture.

28
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,050
Because although this lecture
is about CSS3 Circles,

29
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,730
there is one thing that we
missed in a few lectures back.

30
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,470
And that's cool, that's fine.

31
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,360
It's natural that's kind of the process
of web design and development.

32
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,570
You don't always have everything
perfect and in order.

33
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,600
Sometimes you have to jump back and fix
something that you forgot a while back.

34
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,220
And we're gonna do that together.

35
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:56,640
So right here in this section,
we just need to select our modal content.

36
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,280
Do you remember the modal
content in that modal window?

37
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,260
Well there's supposed to be
a texture within that Popup window.

38
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,770
Right now it's just white.

39
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,530
We're gonna change that.

40
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,080
And we're gonna give it
a background texture.

41
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,420
The tile.jpg, top left repeat.

42
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,420
So that's selecting the tile graphic.

43
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,040
And now let's just check it out.

44
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,060
Refresh your page, and
initiate the modal window.

45
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,800
There you go.
Now you should have the tile.

46
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,780
There you go, that's it, okay.

47
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,610
Now let's jump back into our CSS3 circles.

48
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:33,410
Right below the modal content,
conveniently, we're going to select

49
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:39,820
the CSS3, or sorry,
the CSS class badge and social.

50
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,490
So we're combining those together.

51
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,420
Badge and social.

52
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,910
So this element has two classes.

53
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,560
And we're selecting them together
rather than spacing them apart.

54
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,610
Because it's not a descendant selector,
we're combining those.

55
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:58,202
Okay, the background will be CCC,

56
00:02:58,202 --> 00:03:04,850
font size 24px, height 40px, width 40px.

57
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:12,881
So we're making a square here text
align: center; line height: 40px,

58
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:17,810
that's the height of the social icon.

59
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,832
So, that should technically
center that text vertically.

60
00:03:20,832 --> 00:03:27,830
Margin: 0 5px 20px and 0.

61
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:31,680
So that's 0 on top, 5 on the left and
right, 20 on the bottom.

62
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,270
Sorry, 0 on top, 5 on the right,
20 on the bottom, zero on the left.

63
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,270
Padding, none at all.

64
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,400
We're gonna,
this is where the CSS3 circle comes in.

65
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,765
So we're gonna do web kit.

66
00:03:45,765 --> 00:03:49,450
Border radius 50px.

67
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,860
The other thing you could do is just 100%.

68
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:56,840
But because we're height and
width 40px and it's not gonna change ever.

69
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,608
We could just say 50px, just a little bit
larger than the height and width itself.

70
00:04:02,608 --> 00:04:07,144
And then, moz-border-radius, this is for

71
00:04:07,144 --> 00:04:12,262
Mozilla browsers 50px and
then just the good old,

72
00:04:12,262 --> 00:04:16,120
whoops, border, radius, 50px.

73
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,250
Now I wanna show you something.

74
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,940
Something comes up here in Coda2.

75
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,370
The little border radius
dialogue window here.

76
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:30,260
If I click that, I can actually
style my border radius right here.

77
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,540
So right now this is like
50 pixel border radius, but

78
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,200
if I wanted to change it, and
I want it to look like that.

79
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,860
And maybe I want it to look like that.

80
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,450
Or maybe a little bit like that.

81
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,710
And then this is very ugly.

82
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,690
But see what this does?

83
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:48,460
Here you go.

84
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,470
How about something like this?

85
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,350
This neat little teardrop shape,
something like this.

86
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,800
There you go, that's cool.

87
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,830
What if you wanted to do that?

88
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,360
Then there you go.

89
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,700
You just add the other values
here in the CSS class.

90
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,990
But we're just gonna go with 50.

91
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,250
There you go.

92
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,930
And then the color of
the text will be white.

93
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,660
So why don't we just check it out and
see what it looks like.

94
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,090
Refresh that and
scroll down to your instructor section.

95
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,930
Here it is.

96
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:21,630
Hey, so we're getting there.

97
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,690
Now I noticed a small, little detail
that you might not even notice.

98
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:31,446
I said 40 pixel line height,
but, if you can see here,

99
00:05:31,446 --> 00:05:35,356
the graphics

100
00:05:35,356 --> 00:05:40,940
are just a touch too high
in the center vertically.

101
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,360
There's a little bit too much space on
the bottom and not enough on the top,

102
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,010
not technically centered and that's due
to the fact that sometimes icon fonts

103
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:52,450
don't match up the line height properly,
because they just, it is what it is.

104
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,303
So, all we need to do is
just a little mini hack.

105
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:58,395
Instead of line height 40, just add
a couple pixels to that line height, and

106
00:05:58,395 --> 00:06:03,670
now, if I refresh that, There we go.

107
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,680
That's dead center.

108
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,210
So, just a couple pixels
made all the difference.

109
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:11,530
Okay, now we wanna be able to make
these colors change when we hover.

110
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,320
So back to the CSS.

111
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,800
We're gonna select badge.

112
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,120
That also has a class of social.

113
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,760
That also the class of Twitter.

114
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,150
And the pseudo class hover.

115
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,288
So badge social Twitter hover.

116
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:33,340
Background the Twitter
brand color by five ACEE.

117
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,950
I didn't memorize that.

118
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,460
I have a reference and I researched it.

119
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,340
And why don't we just keep going.

120
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:45,200
Badge, social, Facebook and hover.

121
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,731
The background.

122
00:06:45,731 --> 00:06:49,223
So, we'll do the Facebook brand here,

123
00:06:49,223 --> 00:06:54,369
the actual purple blue color
that they use, 3b5998.

124
00:06:54,369 --> 00:06:59,900
And then, .badge.social.gplus, remember?

125
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:04,171
Hover and then we'll use the gplus
background, the actual brand color.

126
00:07:04,171 --> 00:07:09,078
So we're actually complying with
their brand regulations for, sorry,

127
00:07:09,078 --> 00:07:10,509
that should be four.

128
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:16,547
No, I'm a liar, that's d, db4b39.

129
00:07:16,547 --> 00:07:17,196
Save that.

130
00:07:17,196 --> 00:07:18,350
Why don't we give it a little check.

131
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,610
Hover over those, see what happens.

132
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:22,490
Look at that.

133
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:26,610
So I got the G+ salmon color,
Facebook blue purple color and

134
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,700
the Twitter sky blue color.

135
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,280
Amazing, okay.

136
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,870
So we're getting there.

137
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,610
Okay, now there's something
that I noticed here.

138
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:34,770
I don't like how this looks.

139
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:38,430
You can see the instructor,
the h2 here, and

140
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,460
our social icons,
they're not lined up very well.

141
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,360
That doesn't look very good.

142
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,880
They don't match up in the baseline.

143
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,120
By the baseline, I mean the bottom
of this level two heading.

144
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,700
They don't match up.

145
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,930
There's a little bit of spacing here,
and that's because this

146
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:54,900
level two heading has margin on the top,
and we do not want that.

147
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,600
So let's go into our CSS.

148
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:03,210
And scroll down past the layout
section here down to the instructor.

149
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:03,767
There we go.

150
00:08:03,767 --> 00:08:10,832
And just select instructor ID,
H2, margin 00 and 20.

151
00:08:10,832 --> 00:08:12,822
So there's only 20 pixels on the bottom.

152
00:08:12,822 --> 00:08:13,710
And there we go.

153
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:18,030
So now it's lined, it should be
lined pretty much in the center.

154
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,700
So, we've got just 20
pixels on the bottom.

155
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,960
That gives us just a little
bit of space there.

156
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,630
So, now, the H2 is pretty much
center in between, vertically,

157
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,990
in between these social icons.

158
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,870
Now, why don't we move down,
and style these babies up?

159
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:37,450
So, go to your code here.

160
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,660
And we're going to select
those have the class of num.

161
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:46,200
So, we're going to select instructor,
and then class of num.

162
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,940
What we'll do now is,
let's do a few things.

163
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,380
So, font-size, 30px.

164
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,775
Font-weight, bold.

165
00:08:55,775 --> 00:08:57,920
Color: white.

166
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:05,052
And let's say height: 140, and width:140.

167
00:09:05,052 --> 00:09:07,669
Text-align: center.

168
00:09:07,669 --> 00:09:15,493
Background: we're gonna do
that salmon color, dd5638.

169
00:09:15,493 --> 00:09:17,037
And then we're gonna
do that border radius.

170
00:09:17,037 --> 00:09:24,141
So webkit-border-radius and
that will be 100%.

171
00:09:24,141 --> 00:09:25,999
We'll just try it, why not.

172
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:32,000
And then moz-border-radius 100% and

173
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,897
border-radius 100%.

174
00:09:35,897 --> 00:09:37,140
Great.

175
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,590
Let's do some sexytext,
just cuz we want it to look smooth.

176
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,773
Save that, and
let's just see what happened.

177
00:09:46,293 --> 00:09:51,122
All right, so the circles are there,
but the text doesn't look that great,

178
00:09:51,122 --> 00:09:52,320
but that's okay.

179
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,630
I'm gonna save that for the next lecture.

180
00:09:54,630 --> 00:10:00,810
And I'm gonna show you the trick
to make sure that the text within

181
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:07,290
a block level element is always vertically
centered and it's not using line height.

182
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:10,800
It's actually something you
may not have heard of before.

183
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,917
It's cool.
See you there.

184
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:14,471
