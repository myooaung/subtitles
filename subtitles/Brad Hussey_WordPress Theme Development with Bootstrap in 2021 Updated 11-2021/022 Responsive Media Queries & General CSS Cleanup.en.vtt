00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.120
Hey everybody.
Welcome back to boost your income with

2
00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:07.020
Bootstrap to WordPress and this lecture
is the final lecture for this section.

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.280
We're pretty much done
with the homepage and

4
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.020
basically all we need to do now
is just some general CSS cleanup.

5
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.400
We might have missed a few things here and
there,and also since the site is

6
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.280
already responsive because we're using
Bootstrap it's not always perfect.

7
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.880
Sometimes there are a few things,
a few overlapping elements.

8
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.010
Because we've added some custom CSS,
it might conflict with a few things, so

9
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.990
we're just going to do some stress testing
and make sure everything works, add

10
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.300
some custom responsive media queries, and
then we'll move on to the next section.

11
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:44.489
[MUSIC]

12
00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.650
Okay last but not least,
just a little bit left to do here.

13
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:54.270
Go to your code editor, and there's
a few things that we just left out and

14
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.070
would be good to just add right now,
in terms of the CSS, only a few styles.

15
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.720
And we also need to add some media
queries, at the bottom of our CSS.

16
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.660
So let's just start in our global section,

17
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.940
I already know just because
I built this site, and

18
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.790
we're going to come across this issue,
so I would like to handle it right now.

19
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.550
Remember the paragraph
at the class of lead,

20
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.940
the one that we use here at the very top.

21
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.870
Well, we specifically
styled this as a font

22
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.810
weight light, I believe, or normal.

23
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:30.570
Right here as well.

24
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.350
But what would be good if we
just added paragraph lead.

25
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.400
And we just said font
weight: normal right here.

26
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.490
So that any time we use the lead text
throughout our website in the future,

27
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.410
we don't have to keep
styling that specific one.

28
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.180
So this just globally makes sure
that all of the lead text or

29
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.270
the paragraph the class of lead
will always be following normal.

30
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.770
So it matches the style.

31
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.600
And since we're on the paragraphs, let's
just add a paragraph style and say font,

32
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.520
oh sorry, margin 0, 0, 15.

33
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.350
I want by default the paragraphs to have
a margin of 15 pixels on the bottom.

34
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.220
Not a huge deal.

35
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.440
I think Bootstrap has something like 20 or
25 pixels of margin on the bottom of

36
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.430
paragraphs, but I want it to be 15 because
it looks better within our website.

37
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.090
Okay, save that and
there is just a little bit more.

38
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.910
Scroll down to the layout section.

39
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.670
And we're gonna add a cell
at the very beginning.

40
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.350
It's gonna look like this.

41
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.560
Class of row, and then plus, row.

42
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.200
So what does that mean?

43
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.580
Well this is a specific
combination style where you can,

44
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.680
when you add the plus sign basically
it looks for the row or an element with

45
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.550
the class of row that comes immediately
after an element with the class of row.

46
00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.140
So, in this case,
that would be, I'll show you.

47
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.702
Let's just go background red.

48
00:03:02.702 --> 00:03:07.220
We're not gonna keep this, but I just
wanna show you blatantly what this is.

49
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.440
So, right here, our testimonials,
these guys are rows

50
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.970
with the class, these are rows and then
they have rows immediately afterwards.

51
00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.710
So we want to do something here.

52
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.670
And say margin-top: 20px.

53
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.140
So, any row that comes immediately after
a row, we want the margin top to be 20.

54
00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.600
So, it just gives us a little
bit more breathing room,

55
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.360
here, in the testimonial section.

56
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.840
Okay.
That's really it for that.

57
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.340
Now, why don't we scroll down to the very,
very bottom.

58
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.910
Because here's where we're
gonna add our media queries.

59
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:50.920
Now Bootstrap already has default
media queries and responsive styles,

60
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.900
but we're gonna have to add a couple
of our own for a few specific reasons.

61
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.940
So let's start by adding
the media query media, screen and

62
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.820
this will be max width 991.

63
00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.360
So if your screen is
a maximum width of 991, so

64
00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.870
everything from 991 and
under will get these styles.

65
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.930
So we're gonna select instructor and
container.

66
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.760
So the container within the instructor.

67
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.690
Now why am I doing this?

68
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.413
Because let's just show you.

69
00:04:24.413 --> 00:04:27.310
If I make this smaller than 991,
you'll see there's an issue.

70
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:33.701
Do you see how the text
starts overlapping my body?

71
00:04:33.701 --> 00:04:35.740
And you can't actually see the text.

72
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:42.060
So we're just going to add a background
of rgba, and you can use white or

73
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.860
use a PNG background image if you want
to be more cross browser compatible.

74
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.132
But I like just pushing the envelope
just a little bit here.

75
00:04:51.132 --> 00:04:52.409
And I'm just going to use RGBA.

76
00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:58.286
So that's red, green, blue and
alpha, 255, 255, 255, and 0.8.

77
00:04:58.286 --> 00:05:06.070
Basically, this says the RGB will be 255,
which is basically white.

78
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.075
And the A, alpha will be 80%.

79
00:05:09.075 --> 00:05:11.897
So that means that white will be 80%.

80
00:05:11.897 --> 00:05:15.080
So you could see through it,
just a little bit.

81
00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.880
And padding 20 pixels, so check it out.

82
00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.100
Do you see how now you can
read the text because it added

83
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.800
a semi-transparent white background.

84
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.020
So now you can read even
with me in the background.

85
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.303
Once you get smaller than 991 pixels.

86
00:05:33.303 --> 00:05:34.801
Great.

87
00:05:34.801 --> 00:05:36.403
So that's it for 991.

88
00:05:36.403 --> 00:05:37.700
Let's move onto another one.

89
00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.704
Media screen and max width,
this will be 768, so

90
00:05:41.704 --> 00:05:46.621
it's pretty much like an iPad in portrait,
however there's so

91
00:05:46.621 --> 00:05:51.899
many new iPads coming out now,
I don't even know if we're gonna have

92
00:05:51.899 --> 00:05:57.938
to start changing our media queries,
all of us web designers and developers.

93
00:05:57.938 --> 00:06:05.508
Okay, we're gonna select the logo,
and give it the width of 50%, and why?

94
00:06:05.508 --> 00:06:06.161
Let me show you.

95
00:06:06.161 --> 00:06:08.400
This is our logo right here,
and I want the width to be 50%.

96
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.234
So basically, instead of max width 100%
and having it be the full width, I want it

97
00:06:13.234 --> 00:06:18.860
to be 50% of the width of the screen, so
it just kind of looks a little bit better.

98
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:19.360
Great.

99
00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:26.636
Next, we have the opt-in paragraph tag,
opt-in p, and I'm gonna say margin zero,

100
00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:32.520
zero, ten, because it needs a little bit
of margin in under it, you can see here.

101
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.650
So now, we have some margin
between here and the button.

102
00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:38.260
Looks a bit better.

103
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.990
And also,
the featurette where the video is,

104
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:49.270
the embedded YouTube video,
wanna select that iframe.

105
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.630
And I want the height to be 240 pixels.

106
00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:56.500
Because currently the height is

107
00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.360
the height of the fixed height
that we put in the iframe.

108
00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.560
But if I make it 240,
it will be a little bit more,

109
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.161
I want an appropriate height
especially once it's smaller.

110
00:07:06.161 --> 00:07:07.484
There you go.

111
00:07:07.484 --> 00:07:08.831
Great.

112
00:07:08.831 --> 00:07:15.157
And then we're gonna move on here and

113
00:07:15.157 --> 00:07:21.076
add another one, media screen and

114
00:07:21.076 --> 00:07:24.351
max width 568.

115
00:07:24.351 --> 00:07:32.620
This is an iPhone 5 and up,
in portrait orientation.

116
00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.140
We will be styling instructor numb.

117
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:36.980
So those numbers.

118
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.452
Remember how I said they
were overlapping a bit?

119
00:07:38.452 --> 00:07:44.370
I wanna change that height to 100 pixels,
and the width to 100 pixels.

120
00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:46.105
And now the font size will be smaller.

121
00:07:46.105 --> 00:07:49.410
If I save that,
we'll see a little bit better.

122
00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:52.240
Here we go.

123
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:57.673
And I also want the instructor

124
00:07:57.673 --> 00:08:03.430
num span to have a smaller
font size of 16 pixels.

125
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:04.300
Save that.

126
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.970
And now it should look better.

127
00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:06.780
That's more appropriate.

128
00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.380
And basically our home page looks great.

129
00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:09.460
It's perfectly responsive.

130
00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:10.790
Everything looks good.

131
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:11.990
You can feel free to play around.

132
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:14.730
If you don't like something,
this is yours to play around with.

133
00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:19.320
You can even see here,
cool drop down menu, looks good.

134
00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.420
All right.
That's awesome.

135
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:23.860
So, good job guys for
mastering this section.

136
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:27.020
We've built a beautiful,
beautiful home page.

137
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:32.480
And we're utilizing a lot of Bootstrap's
core features, and it looks great.

138
00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.450
We're using parallax effect,
we have testimonials, we have big buttons,

139
00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.130
we have nice styles and yada, yada, yada.

140
00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:38.940
It looks great.

141
00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:40.044
You did a good job.

142
00:08:40.044 --> 00:08:43.206
The next section,
we're gonna be coding our blog, and that

143
00:08:43.206 --> 00:08:48.440
one should be fairly quick cuz it's pretty
straightforward, as you could see here.

144
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.150
Here's our blog, we're going to
be selling this we have some nice

145
00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:54.970
parallax background title section,
our blog overview.

146
00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:58.680
We have a side bar with some widgets that
we're gonna turn into WordPress widgets

147
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.870
eventually, and then after that we
will move onto resources contact and

148
00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:05.400
then we'll be jumping into WordPress and
that's where the good stuff starts.

149
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.610
So hang in there, go get yourself a drink.

150
00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:09.490
Coffee, tea, beer, water.

151
00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:10.650
Whatever you want.

152
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.410
And I will see you in the next section.

153
00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:15.819
