00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.070
Style and Customize the Comment section.

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:02.900
That's all you need to know.

3
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.510
Let's do it.
Boom.

4
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:11.922
[MUSIC]

5
00:00:11.922 --> 00:00:15.590
All right, and here we are at the bottom
of our blog post with the comment section.

6
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.450
Now, the comments section
is entirely optional.

7
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.980
Meaning, in the dashboard,

8
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.100
you can turn off discussions in WordPress
if you don't want any comments at all.

9
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.480
If your site's not appropriate for
comments, or

10
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.140
if you don't care to have comments,
or if it's not gonna add any value,

11
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.120
then you don't even have to have them on.

12
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.340
But we're gonna be styling the comments
here, because a lot of blogs have

13
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.230
comments, and you wanna be able
to make sure this looks good.

14
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.820
As you can see, it clearly is messed up.

15
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:40.970
It looks bad.

16
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.400
I don't know what's going on up here.

17
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.360
The headers look bad.

18
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.046
There's just a whole
bunch wrong with this.

19
00:00:45.046 --> 00:00:47.910
But thankfully, it's actually quite
easy to fix this because we already did

20
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.090
the styles earlier and
when we did the static site.

21
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.510
We just need a couple
WordPress specific styles.

22
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.730
Now that we can see it in action
in a real WordPress site.

23
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.760
And we just need to do
a couple quick things.

24
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.700
It's actually quite easy.

25
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.577
So go back to your core editor and
open up the comments.php template.

26
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.920
And so this is the template for
displaying comments.

27
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:18.400
So we're just missing a couple tags here,
and I already looked in our post at HTML.

28
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.351
And down here, you can just see
we have the ID of comments and

29
00:01:21.351 --> 00:01:24.920
then we have a div with
the class of comments-wrap.

30
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.300
We're missing that, so all you need
to do is just add it under here.

31
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.920
And we're just gonna remove this php tag.

32
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.530
It's empty and

33
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.220
it just lets you know that you can
start editing, including right here.

34
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.780
So I'm just gonna add a div
with a class of comments-wrap.

35
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.160
And that is going to need to be
closed down here at the very bottom,

36
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.490
after the comment form, okay.

37
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:53.410
And the only other thing left on this
specific template is to scroll to the top.

38
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:59.240
The comments title is actually a level
three heading in our styles, in our CSS.

39
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.600
And then, in our comments title,
we have a PHP function and a whole

40
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.620
bunch of stuff in here which will display
the comments number, the comments title,

41
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:15.050
and a phrase that says, one thought on and
whatever the title of the post is.

42
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.540
Instead of thought,
I want that to say comment.

43
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.539
Give that a save, and now, let's go back
here and refresh and see what happens.

44
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.970
Okay, so we have centered some things and
looks like we're in the wrap.

45
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.150
But now we have some funky headers here,
or footers,

46
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.220
or whatever they call these in WordPress.

47
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.510
We just need to go back
to our style.css and

48
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.060
scroll down to the comments.

49
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.840
CSS comment right here,
you can see your comments.

50
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.795
And the only thing we need to do is at the
very bottom, after Leave Comment, we're

51
00:02:51.795 --> 00:02:56.900
just gonna add a few specific

52
00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.460
WordPress comment styles,
straightforward enough.

53
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.420
We're going to select the comments ID and
then the footer,

54
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.320
because that funny blue part,
when you inspect this,

55
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.020
is actually in a footer tag,
as you can see right here.

56
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.570
You could also select
the class of comment-meta,

57
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.450
but we're going to select comments footer.

58
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.900
Background, none.

59
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.560
And color, inherit.

60
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.500
It's just gonna inherit the color
from the previous style.

61
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.860
So, we have in the comment section.

62
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.900
And then, we're gonna select comments
footer and the a tags within there.

63
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:32.850
Color, inherit.

64
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.410
We already have styles set up for
the a tags in the comments.

65
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.250
So it's gonna grab that.

66
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.470
Gonna grab comments again, and
then the .comment-metadata.

67
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:51.880
And that's gonna be margin 10px on
the top, 0 on the right, 0 on the left.

68
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.900
Sorry, 0 on the right and
left, and 0 on the bottom.

69
00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.530
Save that, and that should fix all of
our problems with the comment section.

70
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.200
There we go.
So now we, it looks good.

71
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.700
This is a pretty decent
looking comment section.

72
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.130
And feel free to go in here and

73
00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.730
test some comments out if you want
to customize the styles more.

74
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.050
If you have a cool idea for comment
section, go ahead and try that out.

75
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.240
You're totally free to experiment.

76
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.350
This was just a simple example.

77
00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.510
And that's it for this lecture.

78
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.550
We've got our blog entirely done here.

79
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.540
As you can see, it looks great.

80
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.590
Now the only other thing, there's
actually a couple more templates left

81
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.350
when it comes to the blog, and
how it works in WordPress.

82
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.070
You have the overview page,
you have the blog,

83
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.490
the single blog page, and
you have the categories and

84
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:45.410
tags pages as well as a search template,
meaning when you search for something.

85
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.100
So, let's click on a category here and
see what happens.

86
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.160
So you could see this also doesn't
look very good, so that's a problem.

87
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.210
if you click on a tag, same sort of deal.

88
00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.880
And if I were to search for something,
again, this looks really bad.

89
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.490
So we need to fix these.

90
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.760
And that's what we're going to
do in the next two lectures.

91
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.540
See you there.

92
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.210
