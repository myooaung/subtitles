00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.120
Welcome back, my friend.

2
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.430
Here we are back in our index file, we set the project up in our last session there.

3
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.650
We're going to do is we're going to start coding up some HTML.

4
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.210
So basically, we're going to create kind of the structure, the HTML, and we're gonna add a whole

5
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.880
bunch of classes that are based on bootstrap.

6
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.140
And for any of you who are new to bootstrap or rather, let me try that again.

7
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.150
For any of you who have used bootstrap before, you're probably going to recognize that there's a lot

8
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.610
of different classes that bootstrap uses now, more utility based, and it's kind of interesting.

9
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:30.930
So we'll we'll we'll jump in.

10
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.070
Let's start off by making the body tag of the class of blog.

11
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.420
Why?

12
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.470
Because we're going to make the index for now in our static HTML file, the blog page, the blog index.

13
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.110
We're going to have a div and we're going to give that the idea of.

14
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:55.550
Not the idea, the idea of top navigation, so we're going to build the mark up for the top navigation.

15
00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.310
We need a div with the class of container that has a bootstrap class container gives you a container

16
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.400
that wraps everything within its parameters.

17
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.520
So whether it's 960 or 11, whatever, 12, whatever, you know, 768 kind of all the different screen

18
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.660
sizes inside the container, we're going to give another div.

19
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.660
We're going to give a div class of row.

20
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.380
It's a bootstrap convention.

21
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.240
We're going to have a row here and we're going to justify content end now.

22
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.050
If you want to know what any of these classes mean, here's the best way of doing it.

23
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.680
So I'm not going to make this course all about digging into the documentation of every single class,

24
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.750
because how lame would that be?

25
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.480
All you got to do if you're like, Hey, what's this class do?

26
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.550
This is what any good developer and web designer should do is just look it up.

27
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.830
So here in the bootstrap documentation, you can just like, type it in, justify content and click

28
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.990
it.

29
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.200
Here you go to justify content utilities.

30
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.150
It's basically based on Flexbox.

31
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.710
So what it's doing is it's literally doing justify content end.

32
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:04.220
And what that does is you can see here in the second example, one to justify content, and it's taking

33
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.220
the items and popping them over to the left, using Flexbox, using flex styles.

34
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:15.350
And so that's all we're doing is instead of writing out all of the Flex, see, Flexbox ceased to make

35
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.040
this happen.

36
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.220
We just have to add a utility class called Justify Content End.

37
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:20.300
So here we go.

38
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.190
We want inner navigation to be on the far right side because that's pretty standard.

39
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.790
Convention nowadays justify content end, so that adds a bunch of styles to make it do that properly.

40
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.610
And of course, it's all responsive and everything like that.

41
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.560
So we've got that built in.

42
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.290
We're going to have another div here.

43
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.200
It's going to have the class call Dash MD four Medium Dash six.

44
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.000
So that means at the medium screen size, that's when it breaks to stack it.

45
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.350
But up into the medium screen size for medium, large, extra large and so on.

46
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.580
It's going to be it's going to be a medium six, which means half because we're going off of the 12

47
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.800
column grid here standard convention.

48
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.500
So six is half a 12.

49
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.530
So this is kind of, you know, two column or the second column, I think you know what I'm saying.

50
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.010
So now let's we're going to have a nav here.

51
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.930
I'm going to give that the class name.

52
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.920
He's called editors in the auto fill in stuff for you, sometimes it's helpful, and other times it's

53
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.720
just a big pain in the rear end.

54
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:31.390
OK, now class main dash menu is a bootstrap class and we're going to have a ul unordered list.

55
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.400
This is going to have a series of classes.

56
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.120
OK, so we're going to have top dash menu, OK?

57
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.340
And that is again BoostCharge class.

58
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:46.710
Now, obviously, you're very welcome to just go to the end result in the beat UAW final.

59
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.990
Click on the index file and just like copy everything.

60
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.920
But I kind of just want to write it out for you so you can see where we're adding and maybe what it

61
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.370
does.

62
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.550
That's just what we're going to do.

63
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.300
Flex Dash Flex, that is Display Flex.

64
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.070
So these are utility classes.

65
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:09.370
So simply like D Flex as a bootstrap class bootstrap utility class, and it's a pretty common convention

66
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.520
nowadays with like tailwind, XSS and a whole bunch of other, you know, CSC frameworks.

67
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.160
They use things called utility classes, and it's simply instead of, you know, going the whole the

68
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.950
I guess people might call it the old fashioned way, which is still pretty common.

69
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:34.000
And I think good being semantic about your team also should be semantic and CSC should be about, you

70
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.520
know, the AP appearance.

71
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.450
But we're kind of merging the two again nowadays and using utility classes.

72
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.650
So semantic would be like top menu.

73
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.560
This is like it's the top menu.

74
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:52.570
De Flex has no, you know, semantic value, but rather it's just the Flex is display flex.

75
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:53.400
We want that.

76
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:59.410
Presumably that literally writes the CSCS display flex and maybe a couple of other things.

77
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.720
So we can just add this utility class to anything we want to be display flex rather than going into

78
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.600
our CSC and selecting NAV main menu.

79
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.910
You know, another element blog.

80
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.270
You know this item, this item and then display flex.

81
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.560
It's just add this class.

82
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.440
It's just what we do nowadays, folks.

83
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:25.030
Flex dash rows are essentially we're kind of writing inline CC kind of kind of kind of not.

84
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:37.060
It's like a hybrid between the two Flex Row Navigation Top Dash menu, and then we justify content end

85
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:39.220
and.

86
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.130
So far, we have no content in here at all, we just have a bunch of markup with classes.

87
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.840
We're going to have a list item.

88
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.460
This one is going to have the class of menu item.

89
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:51.540
This is can bootstrap.

90
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.090
A tag.

91
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.570
This is going to be indexed HTML, whatever.

92
00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.360
Of course, all this is going to change once into boot to WordPress.

93
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.920
This is the home link.

94
00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:10.160
Another item we're going to have be the blog link came at the menu item.

95
00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.710
Now what we're going to do here is we want this item to actually have some.

96
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:23.340
Like a dropdown, so if I were to show you the the final example, we want these links, but we want

97
00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.160
like a submenu like that.

98
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:27.720
And another submenu in there.

99
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.870
Pretty cool right now in the final one here.

100
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.850
We don't actually have that.

101
00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:40.080
But if you had if you added a submenu in the theme, then presumably it would do this, which looks

102
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.590
pretty cool.

103
00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:42.210
All right.

104
00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:42.900
Let's do that.

105
00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.400
So we are home, we got blog.

106
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.630
Let's see here, let's.

107
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.510
Continuous keep adding or top level items first.

108
00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:02.730
Is going to copy this one paced change this to widgets that age HTML because we're going to have a little

109
00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:06.420
widgets age HTML page where we can cut up our widgets that we're going to use for elementary.

110
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.780
Widgets.

111
00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:11.560
Contact.

112
00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:14.640
Join.

113
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:20.760
Change up these links contacted H.M. and then joined an HMO.

114
00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.990
Now this is actually going to go to an external link or whatever you want, but again, we're just hard

115
00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:25.630
coding this stuff.

116
00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:31.500
Everything here is going to change in terms of the links, the content, once it's into one system,

117
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.220
WordPress, because we want to be able to have these be dynamic right now, it's just static.

118
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.950
All right.

119
00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.240
So we're going to top level items.

120
00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:39.180
Let's see if they show up.

121
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:43.220
And they are looking very nice.

122
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:46.130
Oh, so far, so good.

123
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.200
That'll get fixed, don't worry.

124
00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:51.400
All right, now, what we're going to do.

125
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.250
Is.

126
00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.860
Well, let's make sure that everything is good here, so we've got our top nav.

127
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.160
Container row, I mean, six.

128
00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:10.940
Main menu, OK, one thing I want to show you here is when we go to our final version here in our final,

129
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.660
the one we're working on, our student version, you can see our we've kind of got some semblance of

130
00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:19.220
a layout up here, but we've got the list items, have the bullets and naturally they do because they're

131
00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.810
lists, but we want to remove those bullets.

132
00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:28.250
Now, as any of us who have coded, see us as before, you could just, you know, select the main menu

133
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:35.540
or the nav or anything like that and then just say List Unstyled, the list style unstyled.

134
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:41.300
But this is what's interesting about utility based CSIS is that we can kind of just.

135
00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:48.170
Do that with a class that's already baked in to say bootstrap budget five is what we're using right

136
00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:49.970
now, five point one or something.

137
00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:56.360
If you go to the typography section of the documents, content typography, head over to lists and then

138
00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.350
lists on styled.

139
00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:03.980
We want to remove the default list style and the margin on the list items for the immediate children,

140
00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:07.880
and we want it to just, you know, be unstyled.

141
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:13.040
Well, you can just do that by going list unstyled on the top on the unordered list.

142
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:15.320
So this is how we do that.

143
00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.780
We just go to our Adam, our code editor.

144
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:22.910
And then on the URL in all the series of top menu deflects likes, row navigation.

145
00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:28.610
What we would do here is we would just add the class list unstyled.

146
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:30.410
Save that and let's see what it does.

147
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:32.810
So now it's unstyled.

148
00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:39.920
Well, we could also do is add list in line of on each of the items if you wish, and you can and that

149
00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.450
will make it in line.

150
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:45.980
It already is in line, but we can add some padding or margin that way.

151
00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.240
Right now, what do we have?

152
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:48.650
We have menu item.

153
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:53.330
So what we'll probably end up doing, we could just use XSS to actually.

154
00:09:54.380 --> 00:10:02.630
Add that in our star system or you could type list in line.

155
00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.890
And then I believe we also need to add list in line item to each of the items.

156
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:09.860
So we have menu item and then list in line item.

157
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:15.630
Now it's not as appealing, like our HTML starts to get pretty heavy on the CSCS utilities.

158
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:18.350
But again, that's kind of a standard nowadays.

159
00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:19.920
Let's just see what that does.

160
00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:22.070
So it gives us a little bit of space.

161
00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:26.000
Now the reality is is I want a custom style, the width in between that.

162
00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.680
Now I can use utility styles for spacing, padding and margin.

163
00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:31.340
You can use utility styles for that.

164
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:39.110
If you're just to go to layout and then, you know, like utilities, let's see second margin like you

165
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:43.670
can literally add me three, you know, or.

166
00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:47.160
What else do we have spacing utilities here?

167
00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:56.320
And for margin p for padding, top bottom, TBE s for producing left, right and right to left stuff.

168
00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:06.610
So it'd be something like s margin top zero margin top s one gives a spacer p x for padding on the x

169
00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:10.850
axis, to which is the second one, so it gives extra space.

170
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:12.160
You can see how this kind of works.

171
00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.270
We could do that, but we'll probably just do it in c ss.

172
00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:22.780
So we're going to take out the list in line item bonanza in here and we'll we'll do that.

173
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.960
We'll do that in our in our CIUSSS afterwards.

174
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.660
So we have our items here.

175
00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:30.730
Let's create the submenu.

176
00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:35.410
So under blog, we're going to open up that tag right after the tag.

177
00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:39.700
We're going to add another you'll hear our ordered list.

178
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:47.920
It's going to have the class of submenu sub dash menu and there's going to have a series of list items

179
00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:48.390
in there.

180
00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.480
So it's copy of list item.

181
00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:51.520
Paste it with menu item.

182
00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:58.650
OK, now what you need to do before we go any further here, let me just open this so you can see isolated

183
00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:01.480
rather on this parent ally.

184
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:12.270
We need to add the class after menu item menu dash item Dash has dash children to bootstrap utility

185
00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:15.780
class so that we can tell it that we have a submenu.

186
00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:20.210
And a series of styles will happen in there, and I'm assuming JavaScript as well.

187
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:25.710
Now under submenu, we're going to add a couple more of these.

188
00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:31.570
We're going to change this to put blog.

189
00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:33.890
We'll put.

190
00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:39.730
I think you honestly put whatever you want because we're going to we're not even going to really use

191
00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:43.190
this in the initial theme unless you have some menu items.

192
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:47.800
So just whatever you want, you can go here, it's not going to make or break anything.

193
00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:49.180
Now let's see.

194
00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:51.430
What we're going to do is we're going to add on the last.

195
00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:55.290
Item here, let's add one more.

196
00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:00.000
Well, you know what, let's say single post is the first.

197
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:03.640
We will do widgets.

198
00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:14.960
And then contacts will add one more item here, we'll call this one blog, and this one's also going

199
00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.250
to have a submenu.

200
00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:18.410
So if I isolate this, so you could see it.

201
00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:21.200
So we've got a submenu here in this alley.

202
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:22.880
We've got another submenu here.

203
00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.170
Like, here's a submenu.

204
00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:26.870
We're going to add another submenu in this one.

205
00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:30.230
So this menu item is going to have menu dash item.

206
00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:34.040
Dash has Dash children in there.

207
00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:35.690
We're going to add another URL.

208
00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.160
It's going to have the class of sub dash menu.

209
00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:44.380
And they're going to add three items in there, as well as just copy these ones.

210
00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.290
We can rename them if you wish to.

211
00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:49.120
You know, what's a blog?

212
00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:58.410
If a queue and contact, OK, so there's that right there, all that mark up to create a submenu with

213
00:13:58.410 --> 00:13:59.910
another submenu in another somehow.

214
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:01.500
Let's see if it did anything.

215
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.210
So you can see it in the markup.

216
00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:10.020
We've got a menu item with a submenu and then a menu item in here with another set menu, and we'll

217
00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:13.410
use JavaScript to tighten that up.

218
00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:18.090
Right now, we're just going to create in the markup with some basic styling with the utility classes.

219
00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:25.620
One another piece of markup that we need to add here is on our last join item join menu item.

220
00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.730
This is kind of an interesting one because we want it to be like a we want it to just look a little

221
00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:30.030
different.

222
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:30.680
It could be a button.

223
00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:33.090
It could be style, could be different color.

224
00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:37.110
We're just going to give it a class of special dash menu.

225
00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:40.800
You know, we would do that now.

226
00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:46.050
Another cool thing you could do in bootstrap with utility classes in just is just color it right in

227
00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:46.810
the utility class.

228
00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:47.970
So let's go back to the docks.

229
00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:53.460
So here under the colors of utilities, you could just use this style.

230
00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:54.030
So we got a text.

231
00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:56.580
Primary secondary success danger is pretty standard.

232
00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:59.280
We can also do dark body muted.

233
00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:01.050
And then this is where it gets kind of interesting.

234
00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:02.040
You be really specific.

235
00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:06.750
If we're using SAS, we could do all this, but let's see if we have the option.

236
00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:12.810
We can do text and you can use like numbers, I think.

237
00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:14.490
Yeah, so text black fifty.

238
00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:16.960
Or just text.

239
00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:21.490
Black, I believe Pujari, so we have a few here.

240
00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:26.560
So what if we just tried text dash warning and see if that changed?

241
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:29.740
Text dash warning, say that.

242
00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:30.880
See if a change the color.

243
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:33.190
It did not.

244
00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:38.780
I mean, let's inspect it and see why the color should be there, but I think it's because of the link.

245
00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:46.210
So what we're going to do is what you do is you'd have the a head of the class of text dash warning.

246
00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:46.990
You could do that.

247
00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:48.370
And we go.

248
00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:55.210
But because we have the CSI Class special menu, we'll use that later on to style it to have a special

249
00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:57.760
color or special outline or something that's up to you.

250
00:15:58.810 --> 00:15:59.230
There we go.

251
00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.810
So there is our menu.

252
00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:03.400
Let's maybe wrap.

253
00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:08.350
Maybe this lesson up with the adding the mobile menu as well, because we're going to toggle to the

254
00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:09.070
mobile menu.

255
00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:15.290
Or we want to have the option of a mobile menu for our bootstrap or sorry, WordPress.

256
00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.570
So outside.

257
00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:20.560
Of our novelists, see here.

258
00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:26.770
So just after Nav., I'm going to put a little space there, I'm going to add a button and that button.

259
00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.370
Let's give it the type of button.

260
00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:31.480
We don't need a name because we're not using it to submit a form.

261
00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:35.200
We're going to add some classes nav bar dash open.

262
00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:39.460
And then in here, we're going to add an eye.

263
00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:49.210
But the class of mobile dash now Dash toddler flat icon.

264
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:54.560
Flight icon Dash menu, clean it up, save it.

265
00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:55.850
See if it shows up at all.

266
00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.510
So right there, that'll be our menu item.

267
00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:02.190
And again, this is all looks very messy right now.

268
00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:05.630
It'll get cleaned up once we start styling it a little bit more.

269
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.150
But that's we're going to use that element.

270
00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:09.260
So that's in there.

271
00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:13.100
And then after that, let's add our mobile menu.

272
00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:18.600
Which we'll be using, I presume, in our WordPress theme to toggle.

273
00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:27.030
So let's say, mobile menu, and then we're going to add the div with the class of mobile dash menu

274
00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:35.190
inside there, div with a class of menu dash backdrop that's going to be empty div for, like our black

275
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:35.780
background.

276
00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:42.210
Then we're going to have a div class of closed Dash BTN for close button inside of that.

277
00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:53.460
We want to have an AI tag with the class of flat icon and then flat icon dash close.

278
00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:58.020
That's the flat icon that we have, and then we're gonna have another nav.

279
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:08.580
The class of navigation and clearfix, we're just going to have that empty right now.

280
00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:15.960
We're not going to hard code this because essentially once this is in, once we move this over to WordPress,

281
00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:20.770
then we will use this markup for our theme to generate a mobile menu.

282
00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:24.030
But right now, we just want the markup in there, and that should be good.

283
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:25.230
All right.

284
00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:26.390
So that's our menu.

285
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.410
Of course, it doesn't look very good right now.

286
00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:29.430
It's just kind of messy.

287
00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:31.250
But this isn't what we're looking at.

288
00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:32.010
We're looking at this.

289
00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:39.750
So we've called it up kind of this framework for our top navigation, our menu submenus with the little

290
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:41.970
hamburger icon and the mobile menu.

291
00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:49.950
Up next, we're going to keep going and we're going to start coding up the title banner subscriber kind

292
00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:54.260
of start making it look a little more like this right here.

293
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:57.270
So we're going to get the markup going and then we're going to get the styles going.

294
00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:58.050
All right.

295
00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:58.830
That was good.

296
00:18:58.860 --> 00:18:59.700
Take a little break.

297
00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:01.230
You know, get some water.

298
00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:02.250
Make a sandwich.
