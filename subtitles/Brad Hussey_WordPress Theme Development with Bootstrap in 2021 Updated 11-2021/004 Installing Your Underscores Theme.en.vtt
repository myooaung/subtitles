Hey, everybody.

2
00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:02.930
Welcome back to Boost Your Income
with Bootstrap to WordPress.

3
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:09.260
This lecture is called Installing Your
"Underscores" WordPress Theme.

4
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:17.720
[MUSIC]

5
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.460
All right guys.

6
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.540
I got another easy lecture for you here.

7
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.410
Basically we're going to
install our underscores theme.

8
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:29.631
Remember we created and downloaded our
Bootstrap to WordPress underscores theme

9
00:00:29.631 --> 00:00:35.050
using the underscores skeleton theme
creator a couple lectures back?

10
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.671
Well here is the Bootstrap to WordPress
zip file that I was provided,

11
00:00:39.671 --> 00:00:41.910
I downloaded, here it is.

12
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.270
Basically go ahead and unzip that.

13
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.720
Get rid of that zip file, here it is.

14
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.220
Here's the folder and inside that folder.

15
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.520
Basically you're going to have the theme
files for Bootstrap to Word Press.

16
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.535
So you can see here, a bunch of files,

17
00:00:52.535 --> 00:00:57.390
a bunch of basic kind of skeleton
files that we are provided.

18
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.210
Here are basically the starter files
you'll need to create a WordPress theme.

19
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.760
And that's what's so great about
Underscorers is they give you all those

20
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.922
files so you don't have to worry if you
forgot the comments sub PHP file or

21
00:01:10.922 --> 00:01:14.690
functions.PHP, index.PHP,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

22
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.360
It's all kind of here for you start with.

23
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.690
That's why underscores are so
great, because it gets you up and

24
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.090
running with WordPress even faster.

25
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.150
We're all about going faster and
more efficient here.

26
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.970
Because if you had to do this all by hand,
it'd take you forever.

27
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.520
You'd waste a whole bunch of time.

28
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.620
You'd loose all your hair, and
you wouldn't make very much money.

29
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.390
So, WordPress saves you time,
while Bootstrap saves you time.

30
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.190
WordPress saves you time,
underscore saves you even more time.

31
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.720
Awesome.

32
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.010
All we need to do now is very simple.

33
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.210
There's a couple things
we could do actually.

34
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.070
You can install your theme two
different ways with WordPress.

35
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.020
You can do it in the dashboard.

36
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.830
So if I login here, I can go to appearance

37
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.860
right here in the side bar,
and I can add a new theme.

38
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.440
And then you go ahead and
hit upload theme,

39
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.500
and then you can take that zip file and
add it right here, and then install.

40
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.430
That's one way of doing it.

41
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.690
The other way is putting the theme
directly in your source code, or

42
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:22.270
your source directory, so here's
the bootstrap to WordPress WordPress site.

43
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.240
If I were to go to Content, Themes.

44
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.930
Right here are the themes that
are built into WordPress by default.

45
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.550
2012, 13, 14.
it's just their default WordPress themes,

46
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.760
but I want this one in there as well.

47
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.760
Take that, drag it in there.

48
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.620
Boom.
Now the theme is available for

49
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.040
us to activate.

50
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.060
Go back to your dashboard,
refresh your themes.

51
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.720
And you will bootstrap to
WordPress is there for

52
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.620
you to activate, so,
why don't we go ahead and activate that?

53
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.400
Here we go.
So now the theme is activated.

54
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.180
If we check it out, obviously
the theme is not gonna look very good.

55
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.420
It's just a plain skeleton theme,
but this is what we need to start.

56
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.180
And that's it.

57
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.310
That's it for this lecture.

58
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.360
I'll see you in the next lecture where
we're going to be going even further and

59
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.840
hooking in some more important
information into our header and

60
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.880
footer and
getting everything up and running.

61
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:17.671
See you in the next lecture.

62
00:03:17.671 --> 00:03:21.211
