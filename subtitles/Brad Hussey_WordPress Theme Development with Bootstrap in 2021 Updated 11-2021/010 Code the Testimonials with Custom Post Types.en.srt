00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,870
Hey everyone.
Welcome back to Boost Your Income

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,060
with Bootstrap to WordPress.

3
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,493
In this lecture we're gonna be coding
the testimonial section with custom post

4
00:00:07,493 --> 00:00:08,096
types UI.

5
00:00:08,096 --> 00:00:16,796
[MUSIC]

6
00:00:16,796 --> 00:00:18,410
Hey guys,
I've got an easy one for you now.

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,070
We're gonna do the testimonial
section here on the homepage and

8
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,250
basically that is it for the homepage.

9
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,430
So what we're gonna do is just do what
we've been doing the past few lectures.

10
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,980
We're gonna do some custom post types.

11
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,050
It's gonna be really easy and
this one should be quite simple.

12
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,310
Head back to your dashboard and
just prior to recording this lecture,

13
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:42,370
I updated my WordPress version
to version three, sorry, 4.1.

14
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,320
Previously it was 4.01, I believe.

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,970
And at this point you're
probably already updated to 4.1

16
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,430
because by the time I've
launched this course,

17
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,160
I'll make sure that everything is
up to date to the latest version.

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,120
So you might even be on a later version.

19
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,670
So I just wanted to let you
know there were no problems.

20
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,430
No functions were deprecated.

21
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:01,900
Everything's all good.

22
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,990
Usually, when you wanna update
your WordPress version,

23
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,170
you wanna make sure that it's
not gonna break anything.

24
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,730
Have a back up,

25
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:10,560
just in case you need to revert back
to that while you make some changes.

26
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,960
Massage out the bugs and the kinks.

27
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,390
And that's basically it.

28
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,605
So everything's good.

29
00:01:16,605 --> 00:01:20,840
4.1 works perfect for me,
should be working perfect for you.

30
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:26,240
Go ahead and add a new custom post type,
custom post type name will be Testimonial,

31
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,520
the label will be Testimonials,
the singular label will be Testimonial.

32
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,200
The description you don't have to put one,
but

33
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,650
if you want to you could just describe
what this post type is all about.

34
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:41,790
Advanced options, go ahead and
exclude this from search.

35
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,190
Meaning exclude from search, true.

36
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:49,630
You don't have to, I just thought
it's probably not a valuable search,

37
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:53,400
when you are searching for something
on the site, if I have a search bar.

38
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,440
I don't really want
the testimonials to come up.

39
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,780
It's maybe not a valuable search result.

40
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,040
Okay down at the bottom
we need our menu icon.

41
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,590
Luckily we already have one in
our assets/images folder and

42
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,600
that will be WordPress content themes
Bootstraps WordPress assets images

43
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,340
icon testimonials.png Looks like that.

44
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,830
The supports feature, we only wanna
support title editor and feature image.

45
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:23,220
So go ahead and disable everything
else other than those three.

46
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,360
Tittle editor, feature image, keep those.

47
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,720
Go ahead and create that custom post type.

48
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,670
All right.

49
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,250
And when you're done you
should see the testimonials

50
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,750
tab right here with the icon and
all of that good stuff.

51
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,730
Go ahead and hit add testimonial.

52
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:40,300
And what we're gonna do now,
is use the title field for

53
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:45,700
this part right here, so the person's
name and their, who they here.

54
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,340
In this case graduate
of all Brad's courses.

55
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:53,190
Could be so and so client or
CEO of such and such a company.

56
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,060
Use that as the title,
use this as the body, and

57
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:02,154
the image is available
in the assets/images

58
00:03:02,154 --> 00:03:07,880
folder in your website,
both the static and the WordPress version.

59
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,160
So what I'm gonna do now is just
show you how this person looks, and

60
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,478
then I'm gonna fast forward because you
can do this, you don't have to follow me,

61
00:03:14,478 --> 00:03:16,100
kinda time waster.

62
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,570
I like getting to the good stuff.

63
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:23,320
Copy this, paste that into the title,
copy the body,

64
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,960
just the body, and paste that in the body,

65
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,500
section here in set feature image
go ahead and upload a file.

66
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,870
Select files and
it should be in your asset/images folder.

67
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:39,630
You can choose, in this case Brennan,
set that featured image,

68
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,900
and there is Brennan if I hit publish
that will show up on the front page.

69
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,150
Basically what I wanna do now
is publish that and go ahead and

70
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,490
add a new testimonial and
do that for every single one.

71
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:55,340
And then when you're done we'll be good to
go start adding this to our template, so

72
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,450
go ahead and do that, pause the video.

73
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,660
I'm gonna fast forward now and
just do this.

74
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,567
All right, I've went and added all of my
testimonials, we got Ernest, AJ, Ben, and

75
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:06,374
Brennan, but

76
00:04:06,374 --> 00:04:10,429
these won't show up on the front end
until we make our template, do so.

77
00:04:10,429 --> 00:04:15,433
So head back to your your page-home.PHP.

78
00:04:15,433 --> 00:04:20,709
Head down to testimonials and right under
your H2 we want to put that loop variable

79
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:26,297
with the WordPress query function and then
start the WordPress loop, the while loop.

80
00:04:26,297 --> 00:04:28,630
So all you gotta do is just
scroll up a little bit.

81
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,210
We already used this a couple times.

82
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,990
Right here, so
in our project features we have the loop.

83
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,560
So grab the function and
the while loop and

84
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,760
we're gonna have to remember to close
that while loop so don't forget.

85
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,560
Right here, paste that.

86
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,190
And all you gotta do now is first of all
don't forget to close the while loop,

87
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,450
that'll cause some major
issues if you don't.

88
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,330
So, there we go.

89
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,050
Great.

90
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,080
But now we need to change the post type.

91
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,920
The value.
So we got the key and the value pair here.

92
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,051
We need to change this from project
feature to testimonial, because we're

93
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:04,936
grabbing the custom post type and
we gave that field name testimonial.

94
00:05:04,936 --> 00:05:07,150
So that's how we're gonna grab that.

95
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,670
We're going to keep the order by and
the same.

96
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,670
You can change it if you want,
play around.

97
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,920
Go to the WordPress codex and
search WordPress query function.

98
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,880
You can see all the options
that you play around with.

99
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,160
With all the functions that we're gonna
be using throughout the whole site

100
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,780
forever and ever amen.

101
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,940
So here we go.

102
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,420
In the wile loop just grab one
of your testimonials here and

103
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,570
paste it in there and
let's just make it dynamic.

104
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:30,230
Super easy.

105
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:34,350
So the first thing we wanna
do is grab the feature image.

106
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:41,445
And the way that you can do that is
by starting up a PHP script here,

107
00:05:41,445 --> 00:05:48,548
and then we just want to say if
statement has_post_thumbnail.

108
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:52,426
Great.

109
00:05:52,426 --> 00:05:55,150
Because that's in the loop it's
checking the ID for this post so

110
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,688
we don't need to add any extra
arguments in this function.

111
00:05:57,688 --> 00:06:00,450
Great.
If has_post_thumbnail so

112
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:06,811
if there is a post thumbnail,
so check for feature image.

113
00:06:06,811 --> 00:06:12,169
Then the_post_thumbnail, simple.

114
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,336
There we go.

115
00:06:16,336 --> 00:06:20,043
And what you can do in here,
what if the user uploads an image that's

116
00:06:20,043 --> 00:06:24,222
like 1,000 by 1,000 pixels or
2,000 by 1,048 pixels.

117
00:06:24,222 --> 00:06:27,020
Then you're gonna have
a massive image on your site.

118
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,120
You're gonna break something,
it's gonna look bad, and

119
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,180
you're gonna make your users download
massive images unnecessarily.

120
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,600
So luckily in the post thumbnail,

121
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,340
there are a couple of arguments
you can put in this function.

122
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,550
One of which allows you to crop the image,
itself.

123
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,625
And, that would be like so.

124
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,500
Using array( 200, 200 ).

125
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:48,250
And the syntax for that is height and
width or width and height, I believe.

126
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,960
But anyway, if you go to the WordPress
codecs, the post thumbnail,

127
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,960
it will tell you literally everything
you can do within this function.

128
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,850
It's amazing.

129
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,430
Always use the WordPress codecs.

130
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,730
I always use it.

131
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:00,180
I have it always open when I'm
working on WordPress sites.

132
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,350
So go ahead and do that.

133
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,520
And then right here we've
got the block quote.

134
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,680
This is gonna be straight up.

135
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,450
It's gonna be php the_content because
we put the text in the content box.

136
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:13,090
So it's super easy to grab, no extra work.

137
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:16,070
And then the site tag,
we're gonna leave the em dash and

138
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,638
then we're gonna just grab the title.

139
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:22,140
So php the_title because
we put the title of who is

140
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,620
giving the testimonial
in the actual title bar.

141
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,730
So then that will give us what we need.

142
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:29,510
Save that.

143
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,912
Delete the rest of
the testimonials that are static.

144
00:07:35,058 --> 00:07:36,560
And save that.

145
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,110
Give it a check on the front end and
make sure everything's working.

146
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,790
And here we go,
all of these testimonials are static.

147
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,270
Great, that's awesome.

148
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,130
That's really it.
It was actually quite easy.

149
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,250
So in the next lecture,

150
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:54,130
basically what we're gonna do is we're
gonna clean up our Home template here.

151
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:58,330
Because it's quite big, it's got
a lot of PHP in it and a lot of HTML.

152
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:03,560
But we can actually clean it up by doing
a simple little trick that allows us to

153
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:10,100
separate the content out of each
of these sections into separate

154
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:15,695
include type templates and
WordPress makes it really easy.

155
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,015
And it helps clean up your template.

156
00:08:17,015 --> 00:08:20,165
Plus the bonus to that is you can recycle

157
00:08:20,165 --> 00:08:23,245
certain sections should you want to
use them again on different pages.

158
00:08:23,245 --> 00:08:24,765
Like for example the testimonials.

159
00:08:24,765 --> 00:08:26,535
If you wanted to grab that content,

160
00:08:26,535 --> 00:08:30,005
it'd be easy to grab that out without
having to do a lot of coding.

161
00:08:30,005 --> 00:08:31,905
Same deal with all this other stuff.

162
00:08:31,905 --> 00:08:34,215
You want to recycle any sections,
you'd be good to go.

163
00:08:34,215 --> 00:08:35,977
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

164
00:08:35,977 --> 00:08:36,720
Rock on.

165
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,019
