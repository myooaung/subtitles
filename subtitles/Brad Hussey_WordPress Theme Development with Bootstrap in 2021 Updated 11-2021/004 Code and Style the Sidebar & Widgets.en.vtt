00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.210
Hey everybody, welcome back to Boost Your
Income with Bootstrap WordPress, and

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.920
in this lecture we are going to be coding
and styling the sidebar and widgets.

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:15.926
[MUSIC]

4
00:00:15.926 --> 00:00:19.584
All right,
now what we're going to do is code and

5
00:00:19.584 --> 00:00:25.440
style our sidebar right here in the blog,
and the widgets within it.

6
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.470
So let's jump into our code editor.

7
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.740
In your blog.html,
right under the main tag, because

8
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.440
we want this to be within our row and
our container, let's add a comment here.

9
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.790
And I'm going to call this sidebar so
I can clearly see where it is.

10
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.440
And this is going to be an aside tag,
like so.

11
00:00:49.202 --> 00:00:50.030
Got HTML5 tag.

12
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.270
Give that the class of col-sm-4.

13
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.580
And in here let's add,
let's do something cool here.

14
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.480
Let me show you another emit short cut.

15
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.970
So I want four widgets in this sidebar.

16
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.380
So I'm just gonna have four
divs with a class a widget.

17
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.860
So I'm just going to say this but
then times four.

18
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.820
I should spread that out and there we go.

19
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.490
And there is the mark up.

20
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.600
I'm gonna spread these
out just a little bit.

21
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.870
There we go.

22
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.400
And in here, the first one I'm
gonna have a level 4 heading and

23
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.090
say, Join our Mailing List.

24
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.550
After that, a paragraph tag.

25
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.220
Which will be keep up to
date with the latest news,

26
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.550
and we'll, in a strong tag here.

27
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.040
Whoops, send you something
special as a thank you.

28
00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.370
All right?
And then after that,

29
00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.330
I want to add a button.

30
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.510
A button tag.

31
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:09.648
And let's give it the class of btn
btn-success and btn-lg and also btn-block.

32
00:02:09.648 --> 00:02:10.790
Lots of styles.

33
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.980
Let's give it the data toggle attribute.

34
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.780
And that will be modal,
because this button is going to toggle

35
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.365
the modal window that we
already have in our markup.

36
00:02:21.365 --> 00:02:26.230
data-target, and the id was myModal.

37
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.950
And then in here, text will be,
Click here to subscribe.

38
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.150
Let's say that and then have a look.

39
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.550
There we go.
Right there in the side bar.

40
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.580
It's not styled yet, but
that's okay, but it looks good.

41
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.415
Let's see if it toggles our modal window.

42
00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:47.136
Perfect.

43
00:02:47.136 --> 00:02:51.570
All right, next widget.

44
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.130
I'm just going to put
a little comment here.

45
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:55.210
There we go.

46
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.160
Might as well do it for all of them.

47
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.170
It's kind of a habit of mine.

48
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.720
Perfect, okay?

49
00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.920
Now I want a form and

50
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.758
that form will have the role of form,
class of search dash form.

51
00:03:13.758 --> 00:03:17.150
These are attributes and classes.

52
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.790
And then we're gonna have an input

53
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.660
type of text that place holder will be,
search the blog.

54
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.030
Now what I want to do is I
want to give this input an ID.

55
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.220
I want to say sidebar search.

56
00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.030
I want to do that because
I want a label here.

57
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.315
This is peerly for usability purposes for

58
00:03:46.315 --> 00:03:51.070
sidebar-search and

59
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.820
the class will be SR-only for
screen reader only.

60
00:03:58.642 --> 00:04:05.480
And now that won't show up in the sidebar,
the label, cuz I don't want it to.

61
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.670
But I want it to be there for
screen readers, so that's good.

62
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.300
Okay, next widget of a four heading,
and that will be about

63
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.450
bootstrap to WordPress and we're just
gonna have some lorem ipsum in here.

64
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:21.600
That should be good.

65
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.440
Let's do this much right there.

66
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.170
Good.

67
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.720
And next widget.

68
00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.510
Level 4 heading.

69
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:29.970
Recent Posts.

70
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.908
And then we'll have
an unordered list with.

71
00:04:35.908 --> 00:04:42.510
Five li items.

72
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.020
And there we'll have children,
which will be eight tags.

73
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.395
There we go.
Blog post #1.

74
00:04:48.395 --> 00:04:51.330
This is just dummy text because.

75
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.100
This will actually be dynamic in
WordPress, but it's there just so

76
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.920
we could style it and
see what it looks like.

77
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:07.960
And I think I will need one more widget,
here we go.

78
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.169
And in here we will have a four heading.

79
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.210
And that will say categories.

80
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:17.320
UL.

81
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.810
We'll have six list items

82
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.890
with children that are a-tags.

83
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.070
And this will say category 1.

84
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:32.520
And then just dummy text
all the way through.

85
00:05:35.929 --> 00:05:37.345
Okay.

86
00:05:37.345 --> 00:05:39.630
Save that.

87
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:40.260
Let's have a look.

88
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:42.460
Here we go, here's our sidebar.

89
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.770
It doesn't look very good, but that's
why we will style it in CSS, right now.

90
00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:55.380
Open your custom CSS and scroll down
to the section that we Labeled blog.

91
00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:57.800
Believe we were in it.

92
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.190
There we go.

93
00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.850
Right here, the first style post.

94
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:11.120
Let's also select widget, because we
want the widget to have the same style.

95
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.110
Let's see what that looks like.

96
00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:15.720
There we go, getting there.

97
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.870
Now what I want to do is
scroll down under blog.

98
00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.740
Let's go even before comments here.

99
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:31.030
And I want to add a section
specifically for widgets.

100
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.310
Cuz, we're gonna have a few styles here.

101
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.947
So, we're gonna select widget,
padding: 20px.

102
00:06:37.947 --> 00:06:41.141
Let's also select widget h4.

103
00:06:41.141 --> 00:06:46.185
And we'll say, margin: 0 0 10px,

104
00:06:46.185 --> 00:06:52.302
padding: 0 0 10px,
border-bottom: solid 1px #ddd.

105
00:06:54.253 --> 00:06:59.546
Then widget ul, list style none.

106
00:07:01.333 --> 00:07:03.470
Margin 0.

107
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:04.550
Padding 0.

108
00:07:06.269 --> 00:07:10.951
And then widget Ul,

109
00:07:10.951 --> 00:07:17.560
li Margin 0 0 5 pixels.

110
00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:23.120
And then we're gonna
select widget ul li:hover

111
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.090
when you hover over the list item.

112
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.420
I wanna just do a little thing here.

113
00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:30.460
Let me just show you what it
looks like before I do it so

114
00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.890
you can know as a reference.

115
00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:34.080
So everything's looking pretty good so
far.

116
00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:41.190
When I hover over these, I want them
to just kind of move to the right,

117
00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:41.880
just a little bit.

118
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.490
A little animation, almost.

119
00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.850
So when I hover,
I want the position to be relative, and

120
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:53.250
then margin, or sorry, left one pixel.

121
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.080
And that should do it.

122
00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:58.150
There you go.

123
00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:04.040
And you hover over these
links in the sidebar,

124
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.850
they'll just kind of move left or
move right, just a little bit.

125
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:12.700
And the other thing I noticed
was the form, the search form.

126
00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.470
It didn't look very good.

127
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:19.430
So, we're going to style that.

128
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:22.160
We're going to scroll
ourselves all the way up

129
00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:28.140
to the custom icons bright section.

130
00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:29.010
There we go.

131
00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:32.610
I believe that was actually
at the very bottom.

132
00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:39.621
And after that, before media queries
I wanna add a section here for forms.

133
00:08:42.582 --> 00:08:43.477
There we go.

134
00:08:46.263 --> 00:08:48.940
Let's style some forms here.

135
00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.480
There's a few things that I'd like to do.

136
00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.040
There's a lot of styles that we're
gonna have to do for forms but

137
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.460
let's just do what we need right now.

138
00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:00.400
So right off the bat I know I want
my labels to be display block and

139
00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.440
font weight bold.

140
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.520
You're not going to see any of that yet

141
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.090
cause we don't have any forms that
have that but it's very simple,

142
00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:06.910
you can imagine what that would look like.

143
00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:08.180
Block level element and a bold.

144
00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:13.140
Here's where we want to style
a few different things.

145
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.890
Our input elements.

146
00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:21.360
So I want to style input text, email,
URL, password, and search, all the same.

147
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:28.470
So email, URL, password, and search.

148
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.110
I'm just kind of, we're not even
gonna be using most of these.

149
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:34.760
In fact, the only ones we're using
are text and possibly email.

150
00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.100
It's just for scalability.

151
00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.540
So when we build the site bigger,
as you build the theme bigger and

152
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.360
you add in a search input or

153
00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:46.080
a password input you want to be
able to have them styled the same.

154
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.741
Also want the text area to
grab some of these styles.

155
00:09:49.741 --> 00:09:54.023
Okay, color: 666, scary.

156
00:09:54.023 --> 00:10:01.133
Border: 1px solid #ccc;
border-radius: 3px; You know me,

157
00:10:01.133 --> 00:10:07.138
I can't go without making it
cross browser compatible.

158
00:10:07.138 --> 00:10:12.040
Moz-border-radius: 3px; as well.

159
00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:12.540
Okay.

160
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:19.330
And then we'll display: block; and
then we're going to do

161
00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:24.920
webkit box sizing, and border box.

162
00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:29.370
It's just, it's kind of a little fix.

163
00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:32.670
Box sizing, border box,
basically it's to tell the browser

164
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:35.010
what the sizing properties,
width and height, should include.

165
00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:38.590
So should it include the border, or
should it not include the border?

166
00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:42.230
So basically,
the default value is content box.

167
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:44.060
We want the box sizes to be border box.

168
00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:49.215
So when we say we want the element
to be 100%, we want it to be

169
00:10:49.215 --> 00:10:55.250
100% including the borders, whereas if
you didn't have the borders Included.

170
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:59.360
Or, if it was default value content box,
then it would actually be wider than 100%.

171
00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:04.440
And then we'd have to do some random
99.6 or 4 or whatever percent wide.

172
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.760
So box size and border box,

173
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.860
that means include the borders
within the width and height.

174
00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.380
A little tip for you there.

175
00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.080
Moz border box.

176
00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:24.550
Sorry, moz box sizing, border box and
box sizing, border box.

177
00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:29.733
Just want to cover everything
there width 100% C, and

178
00:11:29.733 --> 00:11:35.980
padding six pixels, top and
bottom 12, left and right.

179
00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:36.480
Here we go.

180
00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:38.690
Say that.

181
00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:41.470
Let's have a little look.

182
00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:44.020
There we go, looking pretty good.

183
00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:45.580
And that should be it for now.

184
00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.530
We have a lot more styling that
we're gonna to do throughout

185
00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:50.590
the rest of the course and
in upcoming lectures.

186
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:53.600
But that's it for now, we have our blog.

187
00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.130
Our sidebar here, that we just did.

188
00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:57.760
Looking pretty good.

189
00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.360
And our main content, looks awesome.

190
00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:05.720
Okay, so hang on tight, because we're
jumping into a new section now.

191
00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.650
We're going to be styling
the actual posts.

192
00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:12.330
Coding and styling the posts,
so it looks like this.

193
00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.750
Pretty much the same,
but we're adding posts.

194
00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:16.590
We have our comments.

195
00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:19.470
We have the form and the comments here.

196
00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:24.110
And it's more text, everything like that
so yeah, I'll see you in the next lecture.

197
00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:27.639
