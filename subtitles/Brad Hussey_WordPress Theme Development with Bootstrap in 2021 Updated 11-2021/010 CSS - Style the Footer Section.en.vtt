00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.650
Hey, friend, welcome back.

2
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.760
Here we are at the bottom of this page, we're going to style this up here.

3
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.860
Make it look a little bit more like this.

4
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.660
Let's go in the code editor.

5
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.270
We're going to go down to the bottom where we finished off with our CSIS, and we're going to call this

6
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.790
new section in a comment.

7
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.040
The footer section creative.

8
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.490
I know.

9
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.970
And we're going to say Footer Dash.

10
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.180
And we got to find out what that class was.

11
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:32.850
So we're down to the bottom of your index on Schimel footer and then we have class footer call to action,

12
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.880
I believe.

13
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.260
Yeah.

14
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.760
So we're going to select this here.

15
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.740
Footer call to action.

16
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.860
So footer call to action.

17
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.910
Like, so we're going to style that up with padding

18
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.310
100 pixels on the top and bottom, zero on the left and right and the background, we're going to do

19
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.940
a gradient.

20
00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:03.930
So it's a linear gradient and the format of writing that out and success is the degree like the angle

21
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.200
in which you want the the linear linear gradient to go.

22
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:15.180
So we're going to say, say, 100 degrees, you do like 100 one hundred six point two, three, whatever,

23
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.430
one +1, because that's fun and memorable degrees comma, then the color it's going to start with.

24
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.720
So the color starting with his f five zero zero five seven.

25
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.550
That might be a variable.

26
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.150
Let's check.

27
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.590
It is the color pink.

28
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.790
Perfect.

29
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.310
So what we're going to do is we can even get more creative.

30
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:48.440
And instead of hard coding and we'll say VAR Dash, Dash, color, dash pink and then we have to say

31
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.820
with no comma, the percent at which it's starting.

32
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.610
So this is starting at zero percent.

33
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.850
You know, you could say five percent, I believe, and it will start at five percent.

34
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.810
So zeros, it's starting at zero and then it's going to wear which color.

35
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.210
We're going to say Bebe six.

36
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:09.930
B.

37
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.130
D.

38
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.560
Nine space.

39
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.040
One hundred percent so that says at one hundred and one degree angle, we want the color pink starting

40
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.150
at zero percent to go to this color at 100 percent.

41
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.530
And let's let's see what that looks like.

42
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.570
Make sure to close that up.

43
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:31.610
So here we go.

44
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.980
You can see color pink too.

45
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.620
Kind of like a purple color over here.

46
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.950
Now let's just play with it just for fun.

47
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.300
I mean, this is what it should look like as the right background gradient, but just to show you how

48
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.590
this linear gradient works.

49
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.590
What if we change this to like 90 degrees?

50
00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.980
Or what about 50 degrees, something more drastic than the current setup?

51
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.150
Well, that's hard to see there.

52
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.110
Let's try three, 350 degrees.

53
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.490
There you go, you can see that it's kind of swapped and it's a bit on an angle.

54
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.570
So let's put it back to 101.

55
00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.770
And what if we said this was like 50 percent, what would that do?

56
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.320
You could see that it goes from zero to 50 percent the pink color.

57
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.720
So it starts the gradient starts at 50 percent to the next color.

58
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.740
So this whole section up to 50 percent is pink and then it starts to change.

59
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.630
So you can actually kind of play with that.

60
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.920
We're going to say zero, but what if you wanted to add an additional color stop?

61
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:34.490
It's called.

62
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.510
Well, you can say the color.

63
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:45.560
What if we chose VAR Dash, Dash, Color Green and we said 50 percent color stop put a comma there.

64
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:46.640
Now let's see that.

65
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.510
See if that worked.

66
00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:54.860
So now we got our pink from zero, and then it starts to transition between zero and 50 percent to green.

67
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.830
So you can see this whole section is kind of like a full green.

68
00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.750
And then from 50 to 100, it transitions into that purple.

69
00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:03.890
So it looks like that.

70
00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:10.760
And then if we changed the the gradient to like 200 degrees, you would see it's starting from up here

71
00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:11.960
and moving down.

72
00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:19.250
Or if we started it from zero degrees, it's a top to bottom gradient.

73
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.950
So you see how that works.

74
00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:28.730
Maybe if we wanted to do like a Canadian flag style, you know, let's go like 90 degrees straight across

75
00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.780
like that.

76
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.680
We say color red and then we just want to say white.

77
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.710
And then another color red.

78
00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.060
One hundred percent safe and boom, we got like our Canadian flag.

79
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.080
Very cool.

80
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.590
In a gradient style, let's put it back to where it was.

81
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:53.680
We're going to keep it.

82
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.870
We're going to keep it kind of where we originally intended, so we're going to take that second color

83
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:05.710
swap out one hundred and one degrees, take the color green out to be six by nine, 100 percent should

84
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:06.340
look like that.

85
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.170
Very nice, but feel free when this is your site that you're designing for free to change.

86
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.860
The color of your favorite color is like sea green.

87
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.430
I don't even know if that's the color see green.

88
00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.810
It is too like, I don't know, fuchsia.

89
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.190
OK, that's not a color.

90
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.090
Maybe I spelt it wrong.

91
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.970
There it is, fuchsia there, maybe that's your style.

92
00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.610
But we're going to go with.

93
00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.540
Color pink and baby baby six, BD nine.

94
00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:08.560
Very nice.

95
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:16.040
And let's change the color of the text to make it a little more contrasted footer call to action and

96
00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.100
Sub Dash title is the text in there.

97
00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:25.330
It's going to be color, and we're going to make it have to see 9:04.

98
00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:26.530
See what color is that?

99
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:28.390
That's that yellow actually.

100
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.220
Don't like that yellow.

101
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:33.640
We're going to we're going to standardize this yellow, this button.

102
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:35.890
We're going to standardize this.

103
00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:43.080
We're going to find our button styles and do we have a yellow style established its right here primary.

104
00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.210
So we're going to we're going to establish that as a color.

105
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:56.990
So instead of F to C nine, four C, we're going to change any instance of that to the VAR yellow that

106
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.640
I've already established and the variables.

107
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.930
So in my find and replace, search and replace, find, replace, whatever, we're going to change it

108
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:07.970
to VAR colour, dash yellow and replace all.

109
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.410
So that change the button primary and probably down to the bottom here.

110
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.240
The subtitle Color Yellow.

111
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.650
There we go.

112
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.330
That looks better now.

113
00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:18.680
These are both the same color.

114
00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.450
Very nice.

115
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:34.270
Now we're going to select Footer Dash, call to action, H2 color is going to be, let's say, after

116
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.120
after you have to.

117
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.100
Margin bottom.

118
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.880
16 pixels, or let's just do one REM.

119
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:44.930
Cool.

120
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:45.940
So it's off white.

121
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:50.410
I don't even think I care just white enough.

122
00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.240
Then footer.

123
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:57.680
Call to action, P.

124
00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:58.800
That's not P.

125
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:00.430
There we go.

126
00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.160
Caller, let's go with white again.

127
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.360
Font size one RAM.

128
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:10.490
No, let's do 1.2 RAM.

129
00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.390
Font weight, 500 line height.

130
00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:22.020
Cool trick, if you're using Atom instead of typing out line height, you know, or font weight, just

131
00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:28.350
do like the first letter of each word, and it tends to work so large and then tab line height, font

132
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:30.840
size, EF-S tab.

133
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:36.630
You know, now if you're doing something font style, half won't work that's secondary here or flex

134
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.070
shrink, you know, font stretch.

135
00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:41.550
So you need to navigate through those with your arrow keys.

136
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:44.440
But you know, font size first tends to work.

137
00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:45.900
Line height L.H..

138
00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:51.540
We're going to say one point five and see if that looks good.

139
00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.430
Yeah, it does.

140
00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:55.980
Maybe we're going to make that kind of an off.

141
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.420
Let's go with.

142
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:02.610
E o e o e o or e zero zero zero.

143
00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:08.380
It was an off white, they're kind of another trick you can do here instead of if you want it to be.

144
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.990
I didn't actually like this gray.

145
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:17.310
I actually sometimes like in my column cards like this the footer, instead of making it a gray, actually

146
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:19.760
make it white with some opacity.

147
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.770
So the trick there is simply just doing an arg gba.

148
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:30.180
Because then you can use the red green blue channel and alpha channel, and white is 255, 255 255.

149
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:36.120
And then the Alpha Channel like 0.5 that makes it like.

150
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.600
Half capacity.

151
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:42.970
Let's see what it looks like, and it kind of.

152
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:44.240
I mean, this is a little too light.

153
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.170
I mean, we will make it point seven.

154
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:47.220
That's better.

155
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:51.960
And what's neat about this is that I don't know if you were able to see it, if I really zoom in, but

156
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:56.640
because it's slightly opaque or has some of casity, it's see-through.

157
00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:02.340
It kind of follows the background gradient from that pink to purple.

158
00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:08.550
If I were to be more aggressive with this opacity, you can see that it's like a behind.

159
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.730
This is more pink and then it goes a little bit more purple over here.

160
00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:18.000
And that's just kind of style I'm going for when I make that opacity in that paragraph of the call to

161
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:18.810
action card.

162
00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:25.740
It just looks cool, and it's a pretty common convention these days, you know, with more modern websites

163
00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.640
probably inspired by Apple, to be honest.

164
00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:30.000
But yeah, there we go.

165
00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.360
And now, if there's much left, we've got the button.

166
00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:34.650
We're going to deal with the button.

167
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:43.170
So we've got Footer Dash call to action and beaten one the margin top to be like two RAM.

168
00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:43.950
Let's see what that does.

169
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.210
More space perfect?

170
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:54.090
Then let's let that copyright in the bottom of the index of the footer, rather copyright.

171
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:59.730
And we're going to make that padding 50 pixels zero.

172
00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:05.430
So top bottom 50 pixels, zero left, right and then copyright paragraph tag.

173
00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:07.390
Color.

174
00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.590
Let's do our job again and go black.

175
00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.520
Zero zero zero zero and then zero point five.

176
00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.980
And then margin bottom zero, let's see.

177
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.680
There you go.

178
00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:22.540
I actually want to make that bold.

179
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:24.040
Let's go.

180
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.660
Font weight.

181
00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:29.840
Bold or maybe 500, it's better.

182
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:32.330
And instead of point five, let's do like point two.

183
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:34.000
Very cool.

184
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:40.840
And in the index, H.M., if you want it actually to to do the proper copyright symbol, it's just the

185
00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.170
ampersand copy semicolon space.

186
00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:52.840
And then when you're in WordPress, you know you can use PHP to put a dynamic, you know, date.

187
00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:54.290
A year.

188
00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:57.790
Their copyright always looks up to date.

189
00:11:58.510 --> 00:11:59.260
So there we go.

190
00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:00.730
That looks good, that looks good.

191
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:08.050
Our index theme for our blog, our blog, this is looking really good.

192
00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:11.080
Good work, see in the next one.
