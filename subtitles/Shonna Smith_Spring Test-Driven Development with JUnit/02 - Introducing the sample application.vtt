00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.070
- [Instructor] Throughout this course,

2
00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.000
there will be various exercises and mentions

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.080
of a fictitious company by the name of Hansel & Petal,

4
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.060
and their website.

5
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.030
As we work through some test-driven development concepts

6
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.070
and practice activities, we will reference

7
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.060
Hansel & Petal often.

8
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:21.040
For brevity, I may sometimes refer to them simply as H&P.

9
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.040
We're going to take a look at a software development

10
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.050
project that is aiming to make some updates

11
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.030
to the existing H&P Spring based

12
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.000
e-commerce web application.

13
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.090
For our practice, we will be working through

14
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.070
exercises which involve adding a new contacts management

15
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.000
feature to H&P's application.

16
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.080
This new application feature will allow customers

17
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.040
to upload contacts from their address book

18
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.010
and easily have flowers sent to their contacts.

19
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.000
Because this system is already in production,

20
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.040
the stakes are high, and whenever the stakes are high,

21
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.000
we should definitely be practicing TDD.

22
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.060
Let's quickly review some design aspects

23
00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.030
of the H&P application.

24
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.040
On the front end, we have our typical user interface

25
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.010
assets, which would include HTML files, CSS and JavaScript.

26
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.060
On the back end is where we're going to focus

27
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.000
our test driven development practice.

28
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And that's where you'll see Spring controllers,

29
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.050
Spring services and Spring data access components.

30
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.080
We'll also be working with a relational data store,

31
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.010
specifically, a MySQL database.

32
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.080
Front end and database layer unit tests are out of scope

33
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.020
for this lesson, but are definitely useful

34
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.000
subjects to study at a later time.
