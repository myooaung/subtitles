00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.050
- [Narrator] Now it's time for us

2
00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.080
to come up with a test plan for our controller components.

3
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.070
Just as we've done with our service components,

4
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.090
we should have a plan on how we're

5
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.050
going to test our controller components.

6
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.040
Let's revisit our architecture overview,

7
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.040
just to show where we are in our testing.

8
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:23.000
We will be testing spring MVC controllers

9
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.050
and let's go over some specifics of that plan.

10
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.090
Just as we had to come up with

11
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.050
some very specific ideas and objectives

12
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.060
for our integration testing, we need to do the same

13
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.080
for controller testing.

14
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.090
We need to ask ourselves the same questions we asked before,

15
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.040
however, there's one additional question you need

16
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.000
to be asking when you're testing your controllers.

17
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.070
You want to know if you're testing

18
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.000
MVC style controllers, REST style controllers,

19
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
or possibly both, and it really depends on your application.

20
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Just to get a bit of background,

21
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.050
the only difference between MVC controllers

22
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.000
and REST controllers is

23
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.080
the output that they send back

24
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.090
to whatever code caused them.

25
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.050
For instance, in MVC controllers,

26
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.090
they're usually returning a ViewModel object

27
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.090
to some type of a webpage or html page

28
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.000
that knows what to do with that model.

29
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.040
Whereas REST controllers tend

30
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.040
to return a JSON or XML response.

31
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.000
For our purposes,

32
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.040
we are going to get test driven development practice

33
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.090
focusing on MVC style controllers only.

34
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.050
And just as before, we're going to stick to

35
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.000
our familiar scenario of testing our add contact behavior

36
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.010
for a new contacts management feature.

37
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.000
So let's get started.
