00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.020
- [Instructor] If you have access to the exercise files,

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.090
you can download them and follow along with me.

3
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.080
Let me show you what they look like.

4
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.050
You will have a folder called Exercise Files.

5
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.050
Inside that folder, you will have subdirectories

6
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.060
for each chapter that has exercises.

7
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.040
Within each chapter, you'll have subdirectories

8
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.050
for each video that has exercises.

9
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.070
And, within that directory,

10
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.060
you'll see a folder for the Begin and End states

11
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.010
of the exercises.

12
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.020
Let me walk you through opening up a project

13
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.000
in Spring Tool Suite.

14
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.010
You will need to type the name

15
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.010
of a new workspace that you want to create.

16
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.040
Click Launch and the IDE will open

17
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.030
with a fresh workspace

18
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.000
for you to begin importing all of the projects.

19
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
To import projects, go to the File menu, select Import.

20
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.010
Expand General, then choose

21
00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.070
Existing Projects into the Workspace.

22
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.040
Then you browse to your file system

23
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.030
where you've downloaded your exercise files

24
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:13.050
and choose the project you want to import.

25
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.030
Once it's done importing,

26
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.000
you'll be ready to start working.
