00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.080
- [Shonna] I'd like to thank you for taking this course.

2
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.070
We just covered a lot of topics

3
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.030
that will hopefully get you started

4
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.040
on your test-driven development journey

5
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.030
using the Spring Framework.

6
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.040
We just covered a few reasons

7
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.000
for why test-driven development is as important

8
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
as so many people believe it is.

9
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.010
We covered how to use the JUnit testing framework

10
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.090
to do unit and integration testing

11
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.090
on three major component stereotypes.

12
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.040
That includes controllers, services,

13
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.020
and data repository components.

14
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.020
We also showed how and when you will need

15
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.050
to complement the JUnit framework

16
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.070
with other testing frameworks

17
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.080
that best fit a particular test objective,

18
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.080
such as using Mockito for mocking components in a unit test,

19
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.080
or the MockMVC framework for unit testing controllers.

20
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.050
And we showed how to use DBUnit

21
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.000
for creating more thorough data access layer tests.

22
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.080
If you're interesting in continuing your learning

23
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.040
on this subject, I would highly recommend the book

24
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.030
Test-Driven Development by Example by Kent Beck.

25
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.050
You can also follow me on Twitter @coderighter

26
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.030
where I will occasionally share things

27
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.060
that interest developers

28
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.000
and my fellow agile-minded software professionals.
