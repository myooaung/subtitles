00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.070
- [Shonna] Test-driven development is a very popular

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.020
practice in the software development community

3
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.050
because of the gains in software quality

4
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.030
and shorter software release cycles.

5
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.010
If you're ready to get started learning more

6
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.000
about practicing test-driven development

7
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.040
in the Spring Framework, then this course is for you.

8
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.060
I'm Shonna Smith.

9
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.030
I've been an enterprise software developer

10
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.010
specializing in the Java and Spring ecosystems

11
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.000
for over a decade now.

12
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.030
In this course, I'm going to explain the importance

13
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.020
of practicing test-driven development

14
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.050
using the JUnit test framework

15
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.040
and give you some hands-on practical advice

16
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.000
for applying this skill in a Spring Boot application.

17
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.080
By the end of this course, you will have written test

18
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.010
for some of the major component stereotypes

19
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.080
in a Spring Boot application,

20
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.040
including Spring controllers, services,

21
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.080
and data repository components.

22
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.000
So let's get started.
