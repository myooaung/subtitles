In this lecture, we are going to optimize WordPress by using Ingenix Directive's and WP super cache.

00:27.390 --> 00:31.200
We are going to edit the engine X.com in a file.

00:31.230 --> 00:39.630
We are also going to create two new configuration files optimizations dot seo in F, which will store

00:39.660 --> 00:47.940
our Engine X directive's and WP super cache, which will store the directive's to enable WGP super cache

00:47.940 --> 00:50.570
to work correctly with Ingenix.

00:50.580 --> 00:54.080
Before we continue, I need to speak about images.

00:54.090 --> 00:59.220
Please optimize your images before you upload them to your sites.

00:59.220 --> 01:07.300
You will receive a much lower page speed score if you use HTML and Cyesis to scale your images.

01:07.320 --> 01:13.980
We're going to start the optimization process by using Engine X directive's to instruct a visitor's

01:13.980 --> 01:19.510
browser to cache sites assets for a certain period of time.

01:19.530 --> 01:26.730
We are then going to ensure that proxy servers can store both the compressed and uncompressed versions

01:26.880 --> 01:27.840
of our site.

01:27.870 --> 01:32.700
We also need to ensure that we set a minimum file size to compress.

01:32.880 --> 01:37.920
Compressing a file that's already small can lead to a file being larger.

01:37.950 --> 01:43.770
I'd like you to change to the BTC Engine X directly from the Engine X directory.

01:43.770 --> 01:49.150
We can change to the global subdirectory inside the global directory.

01:49.290 --> 01:57.570
We want to create a file called optimisations dot com and if you do not know optimizations dot seo and

01:57.570 --> 02:05.130
if inside the optimisations dot seo NFL you can paste the directives which I have included in a PDF

02:05.130 --> 02:07.290
file attached to this lecture.

02:07.320 --> 02:09.510
There are two location directives.

02:09.520 --> 02:16.500
The first one specifies that any file ending in the following extensions will be cached for the maximum

02:16.500 --> 02:19.340
allowed period by the visitors browser.

02:19.470 --> 02:27.330
The second location directive specifies that any file ending in J is or success will be cached for thirty

02:27.480 --> 02:28.260
days.

02:28.440 --> 02:36.120
You can exit NENO saving your changes, you can go back one level and we want to change to the sites

02:36.270 --> 02:37.920
available directory.

02:38.100 --> 02:41.820
You can open your sites configuration file using Nannar.

02:41.850 --> 02:50.250
You can scroll down to underneath include global headers and add include global slash optimization stot

02:50.550 --> 02:53.190
SEO and F semicolon.

02:53.400 --> 02:56.070
You can exit saving your changes.

02:56.220 --> 02:59.220
We can test the Ingenix configuration.

02:59.310 --> 03:01.770
The syntax of our files is okay.

03:01.890 --> 03:05.550
You can reload Engine X to enable the change.

03:05.550 --> 03:10.470
We can go back one level to the engine X directory.

03:10.500 --> 03:18.210
We need to open the main engine X configuration file engine X dot SEO and if you can scroll down to

03:18.210 --> 03:23.670
the GS directives underneath GS on, you can press, enter and add.

03:23.670 --> 03:31.170
Guiseppe underscore and underscore lence and the minimum will be 256 bytes.

03:31.170 --> 03:33.570
That will be the minimum file size.

03:33.570 --> 03:37.200
A file smaller than that will not be compressed by GS.

03:37.560 --> 03:45.030
You can press enter tab again, underscore vary and that is on semicolon.

03:45.030 --> 03:51.780
So we've specified the minimum file size that will be compressed and by turning GS obviously on, we

03:51.780 --> 03:58.410
specify that proxy servers can store both the compressed and uncompressed versions of our site.

03:58.500 --> 04:02.070
You can exit saving your changes in G.T..

04:02.100 --> 04:05.550
We need to test our configuration, which is fine.

04:05.820 --> 04:09.810
In G.R., we need to reload Ingenix.
