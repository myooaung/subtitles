Please check the resources section of this lecture.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.700
There is a PDF download available.

00:23.540 --> 00:28.650
In this lecture, we are going to continue looking at securing WordPress.

00:28.970 --> 00:37.850
We are going to look at the main WordPress configuration file, WP config DOT, as well as updating

00:37.850 --> 00:38.540
WordPress.

00:38.690 --> 00:43.410
The main WordPress configuration file is WP config DOT.

00:44.420 --> 00:50.140
It's located in your site's public underscore HTML directory.

00:50.180 --> 00:55.090
There is no need to move WP config to the parent directory.

00:55.250 --> 01:02.380
We have secured the WP config file using an engine X location directive.

01:02.570 --> 01:11.950
Any visitor attempting to access WP config will be denied access to that particular file along listing

01:11.960 --> 01:15.770
of your sites public HTML directory or display.

01:15.800 --> 01:25.270
The ownership and permissions of the WP config for the ownership should be your user and the web server

01:25.430 --> 01:28.370
w w w hyphen data.

01:28.850 --> 01:36.590
The permissions should be six four for your user can read and write the web server and the other users

01:36.590 --> 01:40.790
can only read the file from a security point of view.

01:40.940 --> 01:48.320
Permissions of 644 are fine for the WP config file, but these permissions will become a problem when

01:48.320 --> 01:52.770
configuring certain caching and security plugins.

01:52.910 --> 02:01.100
The reason being that certain plugins need to write to the WP config file and with permissions of 644

02:01.130 --> 02:09.110
they will be unable to do this when configuring plug ins that need to write to the WP config file.

02:09.230 --> 02:18.200
Change the permissions to six six for permissions of 66 for will allow the web server to write to the

02:18.200 --> 02:19.730
WP config file.

02:19.850 --> 02:27.050
Once you have finished configuring the plugins, change the permissions back to six for for with the

02:27.050 --> 02:33.830
permissions that we have set for the WordPress files and directories, an automatic update will not

02:33.830 --> 02:34.730
be possible.

02:34.850 --> 02:41.340
Trying to update WordPress from the dashboard will also fail due to our strict permissions.

02:41.570 --> 02:49.010
We do, however, want to be notified of WordPress updates when we log in to the WordPress dashboard.

02:49.010 --> 02:54.800
So what we do is we add the following two lines to the WP config file.

02:54.920 --> 03:02.270
What the defined WP auto update core will attempt to do is automatically update WordPress.

03:02.270 --> 03:07.000
It will be unable to do this because of our strict permissions.

03:07.010 --> 03:11.240
We want to open up config using nano.

03:16.960 --> 03:23.890
You can scroll to the end of the file and we can add automatic core updates as our comment and then

03:23.890 --> 03:27.690
Valon define WP Auto Update call.

03:27.850 --> 03:32.800
Once you've added those two lines, you can exit saving your changes.

03:32.830 --> 03:37.700
As I've already mentioned, updating WordPress using the dashboard will fail.

03:37.720 --> 03:44.110
The easiest way of updating WordPress is to use the WordPress command line interface.

03:44.110 --> 03:49.180
Looking at the WordPress dashboard, you can see that there is an update available.

03:49.330 --> 03:53.780
You'll also notice that an automated WordPress update has failed.

03:53.890 --> 03:58.690
That is due to our strict permissions on our WordPress site.

03:58.690 --> 04:02.240
So to update WordPress, we turn to the command line.

04:02.290 --> 04:04.030
I want you to log into your server.

04:04.030 --> 04:10.420
And once you've logged into your server, change to your site's public HTML directory.

04:10.810 --> 04:12.700
The command is straightforward.

04:12.850 --> 04:15.460
WP Corps Update.

04:24.490 --> 04:33.610
Success WordPress updated successfully after updating WordPress, I recommend you restart FPM to clear

04:33.640 --> 04:43.870
the up cache and then refresh the dashboard to reflect the changes sudo system ctrl restart and the

04:43.870 --> 04:52.330
service we want to restart is if pm if I change back to my brother and I refresh the dashboard.

04:52.360 --> 04:56.280
We are now running WordPress four point ninety six.

04:56.440 --> 05:03.550
Once you've updated any themes and plugins, you can switch back to the command line, your home directory

05:03.700 --> 05:11.740
and inside the home directory, run the WordPress permissions and ownership script to ensure that all

05:11.740 --> 05:19.560
the files and directories inside public HTML have the correct permissions and ownership.

05:19.570 --> 05:27.070
So that is the procedure you must follow whenever you log into your dashboard and you are notified of

05:27.070 --> 05:29.530
a WordPress update.

05:29.740 --> 05:36.940
The commands we used in this lecture to edit WP config changed your site's public HDMI directory and

05:36.940 --> 05:43.750
open the file using NENO to update WordPress or to use any WP seal I command.

05:43.750 --> 05:46.960
You must ensure you are in your sights.

05:46.960 --> 05:52.800
Public HTML Directory to update WordPress WP Core Update.

05:52.990 --> 06:04.840
Finally, after updating WordPress restart FPM Sudo system ctrl restart seven point zero IFN if PM.

06:04.840 --> 06:11.500
In this lecture we looked at updating WordPress as well as WP config dot p.
