WEBVTT

00:20.480 --> 00:28.260
In a recent W three total cash update, the choice of using a wizard has been added to the W three options.

00:29.690 --> 00:36.440
I don't recommend you use the Wizard, Select, Skip and then general settings to configure the options

00:36.440 --> 00:41.150
manually as per this lecture, as per so many requests.

00:41.300 --> 00:45.260
W three total cache configuration for your VBS.

00:51.030 --> 00:59.010
You can install the plugin using the WordPress Dashboard or WPEC Allai, but do not activate the plugin,

00:59.190 --> 01:05.400
please run the WordPress ownership and permissions script before you install the plugin and after you

01:05.400 --> 01:12.180
install the plugin to ensure that ownership and permissions of the various WordPress files are correct.

01:16.490 --> 01:23.550
W3 TCR uses a file called Engine X.com, enough to store various engine X directives.

01:23.750 --> 01:33.590
Do not confuse this with engine X.com in F the main engine X configuration file 386 engine X.com NFR

01:33.590 --> 01:37.910
is located in the public underscore HTML directory.

01:37.940 --> 01:45.170
The main engine X configuration file is located in the slash ATC slash engine X directory.

01:45.260 --> 01:50.870
We need to manually create the file, then we need to secure the file and ensure that the permissions

01:50.870 --> 01:52.790
and ownership is correct.

01:57.920 --> 02:05.420
We will be creating an include file that contains cash exclusions, you can add any additional exclusions

02:05.420 --> 02:06.260
to the list.

02:08.220 --> 02:15.900
The default travails directive we are using is going to be replaced by the W3 Trial Files Directive,

02:16.200 --> 02:20.640
the directive processes requests as follows trial files.

02:20.670 --> 02:22.550
That is the actual directive.

02:22.710 --> 02:28.620
Firstly, checking server cached static page at the following location.

02:28.800 --> 02:33.300
If that request cannot be fulfilled, then check and serve the requested.

02:33.300 --> 02:39.690
You are right, if that request cannot be fulfilled and server directory at the you are right.

02:39.840 --> 02:47.160
Finally, if the three preceding requests cannot be fulfilled, fall back to serving index dot.

02:48.300 --> 02:53.520
After logging into your server in your home directory, you have a script file that sets the ownership

02:53.520 --> 02:56.380
and permissions for your various WordPress files.

02:56.400 --> 02:58.770
I'd like you to open that file using NENO.

03:02.620 --> 03:08.080
The site that you are busy working with, please ensure you have an entry that sets the permissions

03:08.080 --> 03:17.270
of WPI from config to six six for Sudo Siegmund 664 path to the WP config file.

03:17.560 --> 03:21.280
I'm going to change to my site's public HTML directory.

03:31.320 --> 03:42.000
WP Plugin Search BTC, there is the listing name W3 Total Cash, the Slug W3 1/2 Total Hafid Cash WP

03:42.030 --> 03:44.640
Plug Install followed by the slack.

03:51.010 --> 03:58.060
Plug in installed successfully, do not activate the plug in at this stage, we need to create a file

03:58.060 --> 04:05.920
engine extorts enough in the public HTML directory of your touch engine Eckstut SEO if.

04:08.820 --> 04:15.270
Because your user created the file, it will be both the owner and the group owner use the own command

04:15.270 --> 04:20.010
and change it to your user as the owner and the Web server as the group owner.

04:22.640 --> 04:27.790
Ownership is now correct permissions, your user can write to the file.

04:27.830 --> 04:30.210
The Web server can also write to the file.

04:30.260 --> 04:31.180
That is correct.

04:31.340 --> 04:35.450
You can change to the Etsy Ingenix global directory.

04:37.250 --> 04:43.850
You can open the file WP security director Dot Seo enough using Nano right at the top.

04:43.880 --> 04:52.720
We can add a location directive, an exact match location equals slash engine dot com in F Denyer or

04:53.210 --> 05:01.570
can close NENO saving your changes and two-stage test the configuration configuration test is successful.

05:01.730 --> 05:03.350
Go back to your home directory.

05:03.470 --> 05:10.060
You can open your WordPress ownership and permissions script using Nenna underneath the C Mod six six

05:10.080 --> 05:20.180
four four WP config IP and another command sudo mod 664 with a path to engine Eckstut Seo in F.

05:20.180 --> 05:25.640
Once you've added that command, you can close the WordPress ownership and permissions script saving

05:25.640 --> 05:26.570
your changes.

05:27.740 --> 05:34.340
You can change to the Etsy Ingenix directory, you'll notice a new directory in the listing includes

05:34.530 --> 05:36.340
this is an update of the course.

05:36.350 --> 05:43.430
I don't want you to store the include files and various other configuration files in the global directory,

05:43.460 --> 05:50.210
create a new directory called Includes and Use the includes directory for these course updates.

05:50.450 --> 05:56.390
If you completed the CloudFlare and the right limited course updates, you will of course have the includes

05:56.400 --> 05:57.800
directory already.

05:57.860 --> 06:06.620
Sudo neno the file we want to create is w3 btc underscore directive's dot seo and if the contents of

06:06.630 --> 06:14.150
WCT you will find in the PDF attached to this lecture, you can regard this file as the cache exclusions

06:14.150 --> 06:19.720
file, for example, post requests and you are Owles with a query string should always go to IP.

06:19.880 --> 06:26.360
Don't cache your eyes containing the following segments, don't cash for logged in users or recent commenters.

06:26.360 --> 06:32.710
And then you have the trifocals directive that's prior files directive or replace the existing trial

06:32.750 --> 06:35.950
files directive in your site's configuration file.

06:35.960 --> 06:37.370
We will get to that shortly.

06:37.460 --> 06:42.440
You can close NENO saving your changes to the W3 CTC directive's file.

06:43.510 --> 06:51.550
You want to change to the ITC Ingenix sites available directory, you want to then open your sites configuration

06:51.550 --> 06:52.930
file using Nano.

06:57.680 --> 07:01.430
Scroll down to the existing files directive.

07:05.740 --> 07:08.410
I'm going to comment the director about.

07:12.280 --> 07:22.690
We need to add to include files, the W3 directives file, as well as the engine extorts SEO NFR include

07:22.690 --> 07:31.480
full path to W3 directives include full path to engine X.com and if you can close your site's configuration

07:31.480 --> 07:33.820
file, saving your changes.

07:34.630 --> 07:42.190
I'm going to type clear sudo Ingenix hyphen t configuration test is successful, you can now reload

07:42.310 --> 07:43.210
Ingenix.

07:53.690 --> 07:55.650
I've changed to my site's directory.

07:55.700 --> 08:03.230
I've listed the plug ins, I'm now going to activate W3 Total Cash using WPEC Aligarh.

08:07.270 --> 08:16.140
It's always good practice to periodically restart the FPM service to clear the up cash sudo system or

08:16.160 --> 08:19.280
restart seven point two hyphen.

08:19.730 --> 08:27.980
If PM before you configure W3 total cash, please run the WordPress ownership and permissions script.

08:28.200 --> 08:35.560
You can open your browser and log into your dashboard left hand side performance dashboard.

08:35.600 --> 08:40.580
It's giving us a path is writable with finished permissions back to.

08:40.610 --> 08:45.370
You can ignore that it is not taking ownership into account.

08:45.560 --> 08:51.620
I had this message engine exosphere and if rules have been updated, please restart engine X.

08:51.620 --> 08:52.630
We will do that.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.010
Had this message.

08:54.020 --> 09:05.210
Thanks for using exit general settings page cash enable the method disk enhanced Minify enable after

09:05.210 --> 09:06.440
enabling Minify.

09:06.620 --> 09:08.690
Please read the warnings.

09:08.810 --> 09:10.640
It is giving you some tips.

09:10.640 --> 09:15.660
I'll change the mode from auto to manual mini farkash method disc.

09:15.690 --> 09:18.710
I will leave all the options as they are.

09:18.860 --> 09:21.770
OP code cache caching op code.

09:21.770 --> 09:25.370
Send up cache which is correct database cache.

09:25.370 --> 09:29.870
We can leave as is object cache in another course update.

09:29.870 --> 09:32.210
I will be installing Redus for now.

09:32.330 --> 09:35.960
Leave it as is fragment cache method disk.

09:36.140 --> 09:44.120
You can click on save all settings on the left hand side and the page cache cache preload automatically

09:44.120 --> 09:45.950
from the page cache.

09:45.950 --> 09:51.280
You can also select reload the post cache upon publish events.

09:51.560 --> 09:57.860
This will create static HTML pages of your site and serve those to visitors.

09:57.860 --> 10:00.170
Makes your site extremely fast.

10:02.820 --> 10:09.390
Save settings, Ingenix rules have been updated, please restart Engine X, we will do that from terminal.

10:09.480 --> 10:11.030
We can hide this message.

10:11.070 --> 10:16.440
The setting changes made either invalidate the cash data or modify the behavior of the site.

10:16.450 --> 10:19.290
Empty the page cache dashboard home.

10:19.470 --> 10:22.080
It's switched back to terminal earlier.

10:22.230 --> 10:23.540
Our engine starts.

10:23.820 --> 10:26.060
NFR was empty.

10:26.100 --> 10:29.430
Look at the size of the file now for 086.

10:33.640 --> 10:41.620
They are some of the Engine X directors that W3 ATC has added to the engine Eckstut CEO, NFR test the

10:41.620 --> 10:44.350
configuration test successful.

10:47.170 --> 10:55.210
You can read out Ingenix and you have successfully installed and configured W3 total cash on your site,

10:55.480 --> 11:00.580
you can use both Redus and W3 RTC together on your server.

11:00.610 --> 11:03.640
This configuration provides excellent performance.

11:04.130 --> 11:12.670
W3 will control Redus, so all you need to do is install Redus and then select Redus under object cash.

11:12.880 --> 11:15.520
Do not install any other Redus plugins.

11:15.670 --> 11:20.940
If you are using CloudFlare, you can activate outfly under Extension's W3.

11:20.950 --> 11:25.090
TK makes it easy to integrate outfly on your site.

11:25.810 --> 11:29.230
BTC is not a simple caching plug in to work with.

11:29.350 --> 11:35.380
The level of complexity and configuration choices make it a difficult plug in to start out with.

11:35.500 --> 11:43.660
Initially, I recommend you use WP super cache on your production server test wct see on a space server

11:43.660 --> 11:46.840
until you are confident configuring the plugin.

11:46.900 --> 11:53.110
As with any type of caching, it's important that you test your site thoroughly after enabling caching,

11:53.110 --> 12:00.070
review all critical processes on your website to ensure that the cache objects are not being reused

12:00.100 --> 12:00.940
incorrectly.

12:01.090 --> 12:09.110
Any time you change any setting for W3 GC, you need to test the configuration and then reload Engine

12:09.160 --> 12:09.520
X.

12:09.700 --> 12:14.230
In this lecture, we configure the W3 total cache for WordPress.
