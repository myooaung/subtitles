Each top is a utility that can be used to monitor server resources in real time.

00:06.610 --> 00:11.800
It is extremely useful to monitor your memory and CPU usage.

00:11.830 --> 00:13.750
Each stop should be installed.

00:13.900 --> 00:21.380
If it's not sudo get installed, each top to run, each stop, you simply top each stop at the prompt,

00:21.580 --> 00:22.120
each stop.

00:31.810 --> 00:38.470
Now, once your site starts receiving traffic, the memory usage and the CPU usage make interesting

00:38.470 --> 00:38.870
