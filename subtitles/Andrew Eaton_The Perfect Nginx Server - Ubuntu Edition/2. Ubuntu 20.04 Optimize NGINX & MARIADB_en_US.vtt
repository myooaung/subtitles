WEBVTT

00:19.110 --> 00:22.860
Optimizing Engine X is an involved process.

00:22.890 --> 00:30.420
Initially, we need to optimize the directives in the main events and HTP contexts, the next section

00:30.420 --> 00:34.680
of the course deals with optimizing Engine X exclusively.

00:34.710 --> 00:40.220
So in this section, we are only going to optimize Maria DB and HP.

00:45.380 --> 00:52.400
The main performance bottleneck of a WordPress site are the database queries, the database uses valuable

00:52.400 --> 00:58.940
server resources and will eventually crash your server if you don't have enough RAM.

00:58.970 --> 01:04.240
What we do is to reduce the resource requirements of the database.

01:04.250 --> 01:11.210
We need to cache duplicate database queries and tune the database on a monthly basis.

01:11.450 --> 01:18.680
Initially, we are going to implement both a performance and an elsewise schema, which will aid the

01:18.680 --> 01:24.380
recommendations made by an optimization script called My Iska Altuna.

01:24.410 --> 01:31.250
I'll be discussing schemas shortly after we create and populate a WordPress database.

01:31.280 --> 01:39.350
We are going to make use of my esca Altuna to give us some recommendations on how to improve the database

01:39.350 --> 01:40.090
performance.

01:40.280 --> 01:44.800
At this stage, do not attempt to run and tune Maria DB.

01:44.840 --> 01:51.530
You need to populate the database with information before you can start tuning a database.

01:51.560 --> 01:53.570
I must mention swap.

01:53.990 --> 01:58.700
Firstly, I don't recommend creating a swap file on a solid state drive.

01:58.700 --> 02:02.420
Rather, insure your server has enough physical memory.

02:02.540 --> 02:09.930
If you have no option but to create a swap file, you need to look at reducing the sloppiness value.

02:09.990 --> 02:17.420
What happens is my Esquibel does its own internal caching and for this reason, the internal buffer

02:17.420 --> 02:24.590
pool must be fast if some of this buffer pool is mapped from ram to disk.

02:24.590 --> 02:26.760
My school book Crash.

02:26.780 --> 02:33.620
It's for this reason that it's important to ensure that your database has enough memory to work with.

02:33.800 --> 02:42.350
The main Marea DB configuration file is a file called five zero hyphen server dot c in the schema is

02:42.350 --> 02:47.420
a synonym for a database in Marea DB or MySQL.

02:47.420 --> 02:52.280
The terms, database and schema can be used interchangeably.

02:52.400 --> 02:59.310
When you create a database, you can change the command from create a database to create schema.

02:59.360 --> 03:06.940
The first step we are going to take in optimizing Maria DB will be to install the performance and s

03:06.990 --> 03:08.570
elsewise is schemas.

03:08.750 --> 03:12.680
The performance schema monitors server events.

03:12.710 --> 03:20.240
An event is anything the server does that takes time and has been instrumented so the timing information

03:20.240 --> 03:21.740
can be collected.

03:21.860 --> 03:29.690
The performance schema is a tool to help a database administrator do performance tuning by taking real

03:29.690 --> 03:32.960
measurements instead of wild guesses.

03:33.080 --> 03:38.150
Server monitoring occurs continuously and with very little overhead.

03:38.150 --> 03:43.850
Activating the performance schema has minimal effect on the server resources.

03:44.030 --> 03:51.500
The SLA is schema is a set of objects that help to interpret the data collected by the performance schema.

03:51.500 --> 03:56.870
S What is schema objects can be used for tuning and diagnosis.

03:56.930 --> 04:02.870
The S4 is schema provides an alternative way of accessing the performance schema.

04:02.900 --> 04:09.500
The performance schema must be enabled for the ASWAY schema to work by implementing the performance

04:09.500 --> 04:17.720
and Ezri schemas to allow for more accurate configuration recommendations made by my Eskdale Tuna.

04:17.720 --> 04:26.120
My Iska Altuna is a Perl script that analyzes your MySQL performance and based on the statistics it

04:26.120 --> 04:33.620
gathers, gives recommendations of which variables you should adjust in order to increase performance.

04:33.680 --> 04:41.090
Using the recommendations, you can tune your database configuration to tweak out the last bit of performance

04:41.090 --> 04:43.670
and make it work more efficiently.

04:43.820 --> 04:51.980
Let's change to the Slash ETEK Directory CD Slash ETSI Enlisting will display a directory called My

04:51.990 --> 04:52.480
Escape.

04:52.490 --> 04:59.950
Oh, it's changed to the My Escarole directory Khedive Espace my Eskil a listing displays a directory

04:59.950 --> 05:02.770
Amaria db dot com dot d.

05:02.810 --> 05:10.540
You can change to the Maruja db seo nf Dotti directory listing displays the main configuration file

05:10.540 --> 05:11.990
that we are going to be editing.

05:11.990 --> 05:15.230
Five zero hyphen server dot CnF.

05:15.230 --> 05:17.930
Make a backup copy of the file.

05:21.420 --> 05:29.490
Sue C.p, the file name leave Espace the file name dot vacay a listing will display the original configuration

05:29.490 --> 05:31.570
file as well as the backup copy.

05:31.620 --> 05:38.850
We can now open the five zero hyphen server file using then a student and a five zero hyphen server,

05:38.850 --> 05:39.910
Dot CnF.

05:40.110 --> 05:44.370
We have a section marked My Isco D and we have basic settings.

05:44.370 --> 05:50.700
You can scroll down until you find BINDE address and position your cursor underneath binde address.

05:50.850 --> 05:57.860
In the PDF attached to this lecture you will find the directives to enable the performance schema.

05:57.870 --> 06:01.200
We have a comment performance schema underneath.

06:01.230 --> 06:05.690
You have the various directives to enable the performance schema.

06:05.700 --> 06:12.030
Once you've added those directors to the five zero hyphen server dot CFR, you can close NENO saving

06:12.030 --> 06:16.440
your changes to the five zero hyphen server dot c in file.

06:16.680 --> 06:23.880
If you make a change to the configuration file, you need to restart that particular service to enable

06:23.880 --> 06:25.590
the change in the configuration.

06:28.680 --> 06:35.990
SUDA system, all we want to restart now, specify the name of the service that you want to restart,

06:36.000 --> 06:40.920
and it is Maria Debe CD Change to your home directory.

06:41.070 --> 06:43.800
Now we need to install the SBA schema.

06:43.800 --> 06:50.580
To do that, we need to download a file from GitHub, the URL you will find in the PDF.

06:51.120 --> 06:55.020
It allows you to retrieve content from other servers.

06:55.350 --> 06:57.430
You get followed by the you are all.

06:57.450 --> 07:00.440
The file we want to download is a file called Mosta.

07:00.630 --> 07:03.800
That's a listing in my home directory.

07:03.810 --> 07:05.400
The file that I downloaded.

07:05.400 --> 07:06.560
Master Dotzler.

07:06.780 --> 07:12.900
We need to unzip the file, unzip the space followed by the filename master.

07:13.050 --> 07:21.540
That's a command unzip not found but it can be installed with ept install unzip sudo ept install.

07:21.540 --> 07:24.120
We want to install the package called Anzu.

07:28.900 --> 07:32.890
I'm going to talk play unzipped, followed by the filename.

07:35.960 --> 07:43.910
A listing reveals the file we downloaded, as well as a directory called Maria DB s y es m. change to

07:43.910 --> 07:47.400
the directory Maria DB s y es m..

07:47.420 --> 07:54.340
A listing displays an e l file, a README file, as well as a directory called Views.

07:54.560 --> 08:03.650
Now we need to install the Maria DB Espace installed at escarole file sudo my escudo hyphen you root

08:03.680 --> 08:07.260
that commanders used to log in to Maria DB.

08:07.370 --> 08:17.510
Now you type A this then period forward slash followed by the file name Maria db underscore s y es underscore

08:17.510 --> 08:18.200
installed.

08:18.200 --> 08:19.730
What is QoL.

08:22.690 --> 08:31.270
You have just installed the ASWAY Schema CD, go back to your home directory, Aughrim is used to remove

08:31.270 --> 08:35.560
or delete Halfon or if recursive and force.

08:35.560 --> 08:42.330
We want to delete the Marea DB Suezmax, the directory, as well as the zip file Master Motsepe.

08:42.850 --> 08:46.830
Now we need to download MySQL Tuner in my home directory.

08:46.840 --> 08:52.000
I'm going to create a new directory mkdir for the directory I want to create.

08:52.010 --> 08:55.180
I'm going to call my escarole chuda.

08:55.210 --> 09:01.610
Please take note of the uppercase and lowercase characters that I'm using that's changed to the MySQL

09:01.610 --> 09:03.650
Altuna directory MySQL.

09:03.650 --> 09:10.540
Altuna is available in the official repositories, but I prefer to download the most up to date version

09:10.540 --> 09:13.220
from the my escort, you know, website.

09:13.360 --> 09:17.740
Again, we will use w get to download my Eskil tuner.

09:17.740 --> 09:22.210
You will find the URL in the PDF attached to this lecture.

09:23.320 --> 09:30.880
To run my escutcheon on our server, you have to give that particular Perl script executable permissions

09:31.060 --> 09:38.710
C Mod plus six followed by the filename, look at the permissions, read, write, execute, read,

09:38.710 --> 09:41.260
write, execute, read, execute.

09:41.290 --> 09:46.570
That particular script can now be run on our server to run MySQL, Chuda.

09:46.600 --> 09:48.930
You need to use sudo.

09:48.940 --> 09:54.910
When we log into Marea DB we use Pseudo to run the MySQL Altuna script.

09:54.910 --> 09:59.560
You need to use sudo suda leave space period forward.

09:59.560 --> 10:02.800
Slash my esca altuna dot pl.

10:05.330 --> 10:12.750
After running the script recommendations, we have general recommendations as well as variables to adjust.

10:12.800 --> 10:20.060
I want you to scroll up until you find the section performance metrics to show you how important RAM

10:20.060 --> 10:21.230
is on your server.

10:21.350 --> 10:26.710
Maximum reached memory usage, 56 percent of installed RAM.

10:26.720 --> 10:34.490
My server has one gig of RAM maximum possible memory usage, three point three gigabyte 345 per cent

10:34.490 --> 10:35.990
of installed RAM.

10:35.990 --> 10:41.120
Overall, possible memory usage with other process exceeded memory.

10:41.210 --> 10:48.750
The amount of memory that Maria DB will use far exceeds the physical memory that the server has.

10:48.800 --> 10:56.810
So what we need to do is reduce the number of connections currently set to one hundred and fifty one.

10:56.810 --> 11:04.940
We need to restrict the database to a maximum of 75 to 80 percent of the installed RAM.

11:04.940 --> 11:10.970
At the moment, the maximum possible memory usage is three hundred and forty five percent of installed

11:10.970 --> 11:11.290
RAM.

11:11.300 --> 11:16.590
We want to restrict it to 75 to 80 per cent of the available ram.

11:16.610 --> 11:18.320
I'm going to open a calculator.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.480
My server has a gig of RAM.

11:20.480 --> 11:21.700
Take it at a thousand.

11:21.860 --> 11:28.880
We want to restrict Maria DB to around 75 per cent of the available room times point seventy five.

11:29.030 --> 11:34.580
That leaves us with 750 total buffer's 432 megabytes.

11:34.580 --> 11:38.530
That needs to be subtracted from the 750.

11:38.570 --> 11:41.030
That leaves us with three hundred and eighteen.

11:41.060 --> 11:46.430
The total buffers are four hundred and thirty two megabytes global plus eighteen point nine megabytes

11:46.430 --> 11:47.240
per thrid.

11:47.240 --> 11:51.410
So we need to divide the three one eight by eighteen point nine.

11:51.560 --> 11:59.240
That gives us sixteen point eight to I don't like to round up with Maria DB rather round down sixteen.

11:59.390 --> 12:03.710
I'm going to make it fifty some my maximum connections on the server.

12:03.710 --> 12:05.930
I'm going to change to fifteen.

12:06.050 --> 12:11.300
I'm currently in my home directory in a directory called my Iska Altuna.

12:11.300 --> 12:19.910
I need to open the main Marea DB configuration file five zero hyphen server sudo neno lever space.

12:19.910 --> 12:23.780
I'm now going to use the absolute path to that file.

12:23.780 --> 12:27.680
Slash etsi slash my Eskil.

12:27.680 --> 12:36.350
Inside the MySQL directory we had another directory called Maruja DB Dot Seo in the D inside the Maruja

12:36.350 --> 12:45.140
DBC directory we have five zero hyphen server dot cnf in the section my escrowed.

12:45.170 --> 12:54.620
We have basic settings underneath skip external locking max underscore connections equals fifteen.

12:54.740 --> 12:58.580
You can close five zero hyphen server saving your changes.

12:58.760 --> 13:06.410
Now we need to restart the Marea DB service to enable the change we've made to the five zero hyphen

13:06.410 --> 13:08.180
server file suit system.

13:08.220 --> 13:15.050
Ctrl restart Marea db sudo period forward slash mysql tuner dot pl.

13:17.580 --> 13:25.170
This scroll back to performance metrics, overall, possible memory usage with other process is compatible

13:25.170 --> 13:34.050
with memory available total buffer's 432 global plus eighteen point nine per thread, 15 maximum threats

13:34.080 --> 13:38.750
in the same manner that I calculated the maximum connections to 15.

13:38.790 --> 13:45.780
You can calculate for your server, say your server has two gigs of RAM 75 per cent of two gigs, minus

13:45.990 --> 13:47.600
four hundred and thirty two.

13:47.610 --> 13:56.430
The balance divide by eighteen point nine and rounded off but round it down then run MySQL tuner and

13:56.430 --> 14:02.610
ensure overall possible memory usage is compatible with the memory available.

14:05.110 --> 14:11.160
That is the only city that we are going to look at with my ISKA or tuna at this stage of the course,

14:11.170 --> 14:13.350
you need to create a WordPress site.

14:13.480 --> 14:16.330
You need to create the database for that site.

14:16.360 --> 14:19.720
That database needs to be populated by WordPress.

14:19.750 --> 14:26.030
Only then can you start looking at the general recommendations as well as the variables to adjust.

14:26.050 --> 14:28.500
Do not attempt to change them now.
