WEBVTT

00:05.110 --> 00:15.760
Permissions can also be expressed in decimal notation, read is full, right, is to and execute is

00:16.000 --> 00:16.570
one.

00:16.760 --> 00:21.140
If you have no permissions, it is zero.

00:21.340 --> 00:23.020
Let's look at an example.

00:23.350 --> 00:34.210
If you have permissions of six six for the first value, six refers to the owner, the second six refers

00:34.210 --> 00:36.790
to the group, the four.

00:37.000 --> 00:46.200
The last character refers to the other user to get permissions of 66 for you and the permissions together.

00:46.300 --> 00:53.220
Reed is for right to execute one to get six.

00:53.230 --> 00:54.970
It's four plus two.

00:55.060 --> 00:56.740
So it's read plus.

00:56.740 --> 00:57.330
Right.

00:57.340 --> 01:01.900
So when we look at the permission, it will be our W python.

01:01.930 --> 01:04.120
That is for the owner, for the group.

01:04.150 --> 01:05.910
The permissions are six.

01:05.920 --> 01:14.650
How do we get six readers for writers to set the permissions will be are W hyphen for all other users.

01:14.680 --> 01:17.440
The permission value is for that is read.

01:17.470 --> 01:21.430
It will be displayed as R hyphen hyphen.

01:21.440 --> 01:25.480
Let's go back to the listing of our Ingenix directory record.

01:25.480 --> 01:29.080
Ingenix dot com and F first three characters.

01:29.080 --> 01:33.190
Read, write, read is four, right is two.

01:33.190 --> 01:35.230
So that's six for the group.

01:35.260 --> 01:38.350
It's read, that's four for all other users.

01:38.350 --> 01:40.530
It is read which is four.

01:40.540 --> 01:41.860
So the engine extorts.

01:41.860 --> 01:46.630
SEO NFL has permissions of six for four.

01:46.690 --> 01:54.550
When we look at the directory sites available, the owner read, write, execute four plus two plus

01:54.550 --> 01:54.880
one.

01:54.880 --> 02:02.830
So it is seven for the group owner it is read which is four and execute which is one.

02:03.100 --> 02:04.840
So it is five.

02:04.960 --> 02:10.000
All other users read and execute four plus one.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.670
So the sites available directory has permissions of seven five five.

02:15.700 --> 02:16.170
It's no good.

02:16.180 --> 02:21.280
Another example, permissions of seven seven five to get seven.

02:21.490 --> 02:23.800
It's four plus two plus one.

02:23.980 --> 02:30.280
Read write, execute the next seven four plus two plus one, the five four plus one.

02:30.400 --> 02:35.680
So the owner seven, the group seven, all other users five.

02:35.680 --> 02:40.090
That is how you would express permissions of seven seven five.

02:40.240 --> 02:43.390
The owner can read, write and execute.

02:43.390 --> 02:46.120
The group can read, write and execute.

02:46.120 --> 02:50.290
All other users can only read and execute.

02:50.320 --> 02:56.840
You may at some stage come across permissions of four hundred permissions of 400.

02:56.860 --> 03:01.540
Give the owner of the file the ability to read the file.

03:01.540 --> 03:07.150
The group and other users have no permissions on that file.

03:07.150 --> 03:15.520
Permissions of six four are also file permissions that you will come across as you start working on

03:15.520 --> 03:16.240
your server.

03:16.270 --> 03:22.960
That gives the owner the ability to read and write the group to read.

03:22.990 --> 03:30.010
All other users can only read that file permissions of seven five five.

03:30.010 --> 03:34.480
You will also come across frequently when working on your server.

03:34.480 --> 03:37.360
These permissions relate to directories.

03:37.360 --> 03:40.630
The owner can read, write and execute.

03:40.870 --> 03:44.230
The group can read and execute.

03:44.230 --> 03:48.400
All other users can read and execute.

03:48.400 --> 03:54.790
I must mention permissions of seven seven seven permissions of triple seven.

03:54.790 --> 04:04.540
Give all users the owner, the group and all other users the ability to read, write and execute.

04:04.840 --> 04:10.600
Never use seven seven seven as a permission value.

04:10.600 --> 04:17.350
If you want to introduce vulnerabilities into your server, start giving files and directories.

04:17.650 --> 04:25.510
Permissions of seven seven seven do not use permissions of seven seven seven.

04:25.510 --> 04:32.830
If any plugin or theme requires seven seven seven permissions, please get in touch with a developer

04:33.010 --> 04:38.650
and ask them to learn how to code correctly or an easier solution.

04:38.650 --> 04:41.170
Find another plugin or theme.

04:41.170 --> 04:46.600
You will see this often when setting up various content management systems.

04:46.600 --> 04:52.210
Sometimes it's even in the documentation to change permissions to seven seven seven.

04:52.240 --> 04:56.740
It's easy to be lazy and recommend triple seven permissions.

04:56.740 --> 04:58.540
Do not do this.

04:58.540 --> 05:04.690
Rather, look at the ownership and permissions and try and figure out what.

05:04.830 --> 05:12.210
Needs permission to do what when a developer recommends triple seven permissions, you can resolve it

05:12.210 --> 05:19.800
by giving the Web server right permissions, sometimes triple seven permissions can also indicate that

05:19.800 --> 05:22.410
there is a problem with your configuration.

05:22.410 --> 05:24.140
Fix the configuration.

05:24.150 --> 05:28.720
Don't try and find an easy way out and use 777.

05:28.740 --> 05:35.180
Always remember, there are no shortcuts and easy fixes in server security.

05:35.190 --> 05:38.770
You have to do it correctly from the word go.

05:38.880 --> 05:42.600
I just want to recap what each permission means.

05:42.600 --> 05:49.620
When we look at files and directories, they are different when it comes to the read permission with

05:49.620 --> 05:50.370
files.

05:50.400 --> 05:56.480
It allows the user to view the contents of the file with directress.

05:56.490 --> 06:04.530
It allows a user to view the contents of a directory when it comes to write permissions with files.

06:04.560 --> 06:10.380
It allows a user to modify, edit and delete files.

06:10.380 --> 06:19.230
When it comes to directress, it allows a user to write into the directory that is, create files and

06:19.230 --> 06:25.060
directories inside that directory with execute when it comes to files.

06:25.200 --> 06:31.930
It allows the user to execute the file if it is a program or script when it comes to directories.

06:31.980 --> 06:37.020
It allows the user to enter that particular directory.

06:37.140 --> 06:43.640
Earlier we looked at what permissions are required for your WordPress directories.

06:43.680 --> 06:49.050
We will look at this again when we set up WordPress, the root owned by your user.

06:49.080 --> 06:50.640
Ignore ownership for now.

06:50.670 --> 06:58.460
Let's just concentrate on permissions writable by your user only and readable by the Web server.

06:58.500 --> 07:05.790
All users need to execute permissions on the directory to enter it, so that gives one for each user.

07:05.820 --> 07:14.790
Each user also needs to be able to read the directory that gives us permissions of so each user currently

07:14.790 --> 07:18.650
is four plus one five five five.

07:18.690 --> 07:24.100
Only our user who is the owner must have right permissions.

07:24.210 --> 07:25.250
So that's two.

07:25.290 --> 07:28.340
So we have seven five five.

07:28.560 --> 07:32.850
The same for WP Admin seven five five.

07:33.000 --> 07:38.220
The same for WP includes seven five five.

07:38.220 --> 07:40.320
WP content is slightly different.

07:40.320 --> 07:45.330
It needs to be writable by our user and the web server.

07:45.330 --> 07:51.300
Seven five five is correct, but we need to add right permissions to the web server.

07:51.300 --> 07:54.540
The web server is the group owner.

07:54.570 --> 07:57.930
We now have seven seven five.

07:58.110 --> 08:04.860
There are a few commands I'd like you to make note of when working with ownership and permissions to

08:04.860 --> 08:08.010
change the permissions of a file or directory.

08:08.010 --> 08:10.740
We use the command change mode.

08:10.740 --> 08:19.560
S.H. Mod the command user mod that allows us to take a user and add it to a group.

08:19.740 --> 08:24.870
We can also change the ownership of files and directories.

08:24.990 --> 08:36.060
That command is S.H. own change ownership to switch or change users use the command switch use s you

08:36.360 --> 08:40.290
do not use permissions of seven seven seven.

08:40.380 --> 08:44.730
Understanding permissions is an important part of server administration.

08:44.760 --> 08:49.530
If you're still a little lost about permissions and ownership, don't worry about it.

08:49.530 --> 08:55.620
Now, Kinealy, throughout the rest of the course there are many stages where we will work with permissions

08:55.620 --> 08:56.280
and ownership.

08:56.280 --> 08:57.900
You will master it.
