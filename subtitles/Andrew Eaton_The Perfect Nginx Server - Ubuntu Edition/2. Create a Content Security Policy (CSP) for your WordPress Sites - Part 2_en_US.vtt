00:03.310 --> 00:10.060
You can open your browser as well as the developer tools, ensure that you have console open, look

00:10.060 --> 00:12.260
at the errors refused to frame.

00:12.280 --> 00:18.460
It's giving me a tutorial because it violates the following content security policy directive frame,

00:18.460 --> 00:19.990
source, self.

00:20.020 --> 00:27.310
Yeah, we have our first external source that needs to be added to our CSP player Vimeo dot com.

00:27.340 --> 00:35.290
I'm going to copy the link adris copy the address, switch to your text editor frame source self Niva

00:35.290 --> 00:39.970
space after the apostrophe of self and add the URL.

00:40.180 --> 00:46.660
When you add the you are all you can remove the slash at the end and in this case I'm not going to leave

00:46.660 --> 00:49.870
it as https player dot vimeo dot com.

00:50.230 --> 00:55.270
I'm going to remove player and add and Asterix back to the browser.

00:55.270 --> 01:02.050
Refused to load the image giving me a new URL because it violates the following CSP directive image

01:02.050 --> 01:02.560
source.

01:02.560 --> 01:04.300
We have self and data.

01:04.300 --> 01:09.160
We need to add this URL to our image source copy link address.

01:09.310 --> 01:14.380
You can switch back to your text editor image source self data.

01:14.410 --> 01:16.540
There's a kolon after data Devah.

01:16.580 --> 01:18.880
Space and paste the URL.

01:23.770 --> 01:27.850
All you want is the domain secure gravity dot com.

01:27.880 --> 01:32.650
Same with Vimeo, remove, secure an ad and streak's.

01:35.970 --> 01:38.860
Switch back to your browser, refused to load the image.

01:38.880 --> 01:43.140
It's the same you URL, we can ignore that, refuse to load the script.

01:43.290 --> 01:49.620
The next wave dev dot discussed dot com violates the following CACP directive, the script source.

01:49.620 --> 01:51.060
We can copy the link.

01:52.490 --> 02:00.200
Switch back to your text editor, script source, self unsafe in an unsafe eval to the right of the

02:00.200 --> 02:02.210
apostrophe and the euro.

02:04.620 --> 02:06.670
Remove the specific file.

02:06.690 --> 02:11.880
We are also going to remove the next web dev ad and air.

02:12.600 --> 02:16.620
So these are the areas that appear on the front page of our site.

02:16.620 --> 02:22.460
Select the entire CSP in your text editor and copy back to terminal.

02:22.500 --> 02:28.860
You can change to either the global or the includes or the include files directory and then using that

02:28.860 --> 02:33.530
to open the CSP underscore domain dot com NFR.

02:33.570 --> 02:40.650
You can go to the line that contains the default CSP control K, remove the entire line and paste the

02:40.650 --> 02:42.560
updated CSP.

02:42.690 --> 02:50.760
You can close neno saving your changes to the configuration sudo Ingenix hyphen t Tastee successful.

02:50.760 --> 02:55.380
You can reload Ingenix back to our browser and refresh.

02:59.560 --> 03:04.860
We have no errors generated in console, let's click on one of our post titles.

03:04.960 --> 03:09.990
Now we have additional resources that we need to add, refused to pre fetch content.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.850
One, two, three, four.

03:11.860 --> 03:13.190
Back to the text editor.

03:13.210 --> 03:20.980
We don't have a pre fetch source, so we need to make use of the default source refused to pre fetch

03:20.980 --> 03:24.430
content from giving me one, two, three, four.

03:24.430 --> 03:28.930
You URLs violates the following CSP directive default.

03:28.930 --> 03:35.520
S note that pre fetched source was not set, so default source is used as a fallback.

03:35.530 --> 03:43.660
If I look at the URL https discuss CDN, discuss cdn, discuss CDN C.C.C..

03:43.690 --> 03:48.670
So I only need to copy one copy link address, switch back to my text editor.

03:48.760 --> 03:52.450
Default self to the right of the apostrophe.

03:52.480 --> 03:58.570
I can paste to you url we only add the you are rel we don't add a specific file.

04:02.180 --> 04:07.970
HTTPS, C dot, discus, CD and dot com, you can remove the C and add an extra.

04:10.020 --> 04:12.310
So that's the first three taken care of.

04:12.360 --> 04:16.890
We also have https, discus dot com on its own.

04:18.860 --> 04:23.300
Copy that you are well to the right of the existing, you are only the space.

04:25.950 --> 04:32.520
You can then remove the reference to that specific far refused to frame, it's giving me a U.

04:32.520 --> 04:40.310
RL because it violates the following CSP directive frame, source, self and the URL Vimeo.

04:40.320 --> 04:48.060
We can select the link frame source to the right of the Vimeo URL Yuva Space and paste.

04:50.210 --> 04:55.920
The dotcom select the entire CSP and copy vector terminal.

04:56.180 --> 05:04.700
We need to open CSP underscored domain dot com net go to the line that contains the CSP header control

05:04.700 --> 05:08.900
k remove and paste the updated SEECP.

05:08.900 --> 05:13.850
You can close NENO saving your changes to the configuration test.

05:13.940 --> 05:15.680
Successful reload.

05:15.680 --> 05:17.300
Ingenix refresh.

05:17.330 --> 05:18.830
Now we have a few more errors.

05:19.010 --> 05:26.810
Refused to load the script discussed CD dot copy the link violated the following CSP Directive script

05:26.810 --> 05:27.580
source.

05:27.590 --> 05:29.480
Switch back to your text editor.

05:36.700 --> 05:44.380
He keeps strict statistics, dot com, and it's added in the script source refused to allow the stylesheet

05:44.380 --> 05:45.010
a copy.

05:45.040 --> 05:53.770
The euro violates the following SEECP directive style source to the right of style source, self unsafe

05:53.770 --> 05:57.480
in line to the right of the apostrophe and euro.

06:01.170 --> 06:05.400
Same procedure, subdomain, remove the subdomain and add an extra.

06:07.650 --> 06:14.110
You can select the entire updated copy and copy block by client, block by client, block by client.

06:14.130 --> 06:15.720
That is my ad blocker.

06:23.980 --> 06:28.720
With the ad blocker disabled, those errors are removed switchback to terminal.

06:33.890 --> 06:38.210
Same procedure, again, you need to open your domains CSP file.

06:38.240 --> 06:44.660
Remove the existing CSP, add the updated CSP, close the file, save your changes.

06:46.630 --> 06:53.650
Test the configuration if the test is successful, reloader Ingenix, back to your browser and refresh.

06:56.230 --> 07:02.380
Refused to connect to giving me a URL because it violates the following SEECP directive, a connect

07:02.380 --> 07:09.430
source, self copy, link, address, switch back to your text editor connect source self.

07:14.090 --> 07:21.800
I'm going to leave that you are out as it is links, dot services, dot discuss, dot com, same procedure

07:21.800 --> 07:30.830
again, select the updated CSP pasted into your CSP file on the server, reload Ingenix and then continue

07:30.830 --> 07:31.820
testing your site.

07:39.600 --> 07:42.000
Reload the browser, no errors.

07:42.120 --> 07:43.560
Back to our home page.

07:52.850 --> 07:59.060
Refused to load the image, giving me a euro because it violates the following SEECP directive, image,

07:59.060 --> 08:06.590

08:06.590 --> 08:11.120
to load the image or giving me an additional URL https.

08:11.120 --> 08:15.980
The euro we would need to add would be esoterics dot discussed cdn dot com.

08:15.980 --> 08:21.820
You need to continue in this manner until you have added every single URL.

08:21.830 --> 08:26.110
You need to go through, every single post, every single page.

08:26.150 --> 08:30.230
There could be a resource that's not loading on one particular page.

08:30.230 --> 08:33.590
You need to work your way through your entire site.

08:33.740 --> 08:36.680
You also need to check the back end of your site.

08:36.830 --> 08:42.770
I've opened the dashboard, refused to load the image it's giving me a new URL, violates the following

08:42.770 --> 08:50.450
SEECP directive image source here that you are URL you would add to the image source would be https

08:50.480 --> 08:53.170
as Strix dot dot org.

08:53.180 --> 09:00.350
I cannot emphasize how important it is that you review your content security policy frequently.

09:00.500 --> 09:04.190
It is not something that you can simply set and forget.

09:04.340 --> 09:11.360
You need to review the CSP after changing themes, adding a new plugin, whether it's a WordPress,

09:11.360 --> 09:18.950
a theme or a plugin update, you need to review the CSP using console the process of monitoring your

09:18.950 --> 09:19.400
content.

09:19.400 --> 09:22.670
Security policy is an ongoing process.

09:22.880 --> 09:27.710
In this lecture, we configure the content security policy for our WordPress site.
