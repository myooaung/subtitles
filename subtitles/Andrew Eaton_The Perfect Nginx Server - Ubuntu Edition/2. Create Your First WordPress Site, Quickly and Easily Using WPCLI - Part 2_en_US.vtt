00:04.300 --> 00:10.900
I want to refer you back to your text, Ed, ensure you have the file with a random characters open

00:10.900 --> 00:15.880
as well as the file where we added our database information to.

00:15.940 --> 00:23.340
Those are the two files I would like you to have open to hitting CLIA commands, admin user admin password.

00:23.350 --> 00:28.600
Then add the three steps that you need to install a WordPress site.

00:28.600 --> 00:34.620
WP Core Download, WP Core Config WP Core Install.

00:34.630 --> 00:42.820
When you look at the commands, WP Core download its go to terminal and type that command before you

00:42.820 --> 00:45.700
type any WP CLIA command.

00:45.820 --> 00:52.640
If I type WD Print Working directory, we are currently in slash home slash Andrew.

00:52.660 --> 00:56.350
You don't create a WordPress site in your home directory.

00:56.350 --> 01:03.400
We've already created the directory structure for our sites and the path to those directories.

01:03.580 --> 01:08.460
Slash far slash w w w the ownership.

01:08.470 --> 01:09.460
Andrew Andrew.

01:09.640 --> 01:10.570
That is fine.

01:10.660 --> 01:12.460
That will give us right.

01:12.670 --> 01:16.810
Read and executable permissions in those directories.

01:16.990 --> 01:21.790
The site we want to set up is WPEC ally dot com.

01:21.790 --> 01:26.470
It's changed to that directory inside WPK allowed dot com.

01:26.470 --> 01:31.180
We have another directory public underscore html.

01:31.180 --> 01:34.660
We don't want to install WordPress in WPEC ally dot com.

01:34.660 --> 01:39.520
We want to install it inside public underscore HTML.

01:39.850 --> 01:42.790
The directory, as expected is empty.

01:42.790 --> 01:44.890
WP Core Download.

01:47.260 --> 01:54.070
Success, WordPress has been downloaded, so that's the first step WP core download.

01:54.160 --> 02:04.060
The second step is WP core config double hyphen database name equals database user database POS database

02:04.060 --> 02:04.970
prefix.

02:04.990 --> 02:09.460
We have that information in the same file, our database name.

02:09.460 --> 02:16.600
We can copy and paste it right next to the equal sign our database user.

02:17.080 --> 02:23.080
Same thing again, copied and pasted right next to the equal sign the database password.

02:23.110 --> 02:25.980
You can also paste to the right of the equals sign.

02:26.140 --> 02:29.230
We need to provide a database prefix.

02:29.230 --> 02:31.930
Do not use WP.

02:31.930 --> 02:36.850
Underscore our use for h x underscore.

02:37.300 --> 02:41.950
Select the entire line and copy all we do.

02:41.950 --> 02:52.840
Inside the terminal window is paste that line and press enter success generated WP hyphen config dot

02:53.920 --> 02:59.040
file its top lists and they are all your WordPress files.

02:59.290 --> 03:00.040
The next step.

03:00.040 --> 03:04.810
We need to provide the admin user as well as the admin password.

03:04.930 --> 03:09.100
Go to your file that contains your randomly generated characters.

03:09.100 --> 03:17.140
Select one click next to one of the other and paste that will make a decent administrative user name.

03:17.380 --> 03:22.390
Select another one and paste our admin user will be that.

03:23.020 --> 03:29.770
Let's go back to the file admin user and paste our administrative password for the WordPress.

03:29.770 --> 03:38.830
Dashboard will be that you can copy the admin user and paste it to the right of the equals sign and

03:38.830 --> 03:43.000
you can do the same for the password to the right of admin email.

03:48.290 --> 03:53.330
I'll provide my email address to the right of the equals sign that you are El.

03:58.580 --> 04:07.790
I'll provide the you are all I'm selecting w w w dot domain name for the title Inside Two Apostrophes.

04:07.950 --> 04:14.690
Most of the WordPress command line interface in thirty minutes, click right at the end to the right

04:14.690 --> 04:23.210
of your email address and select from the WP to the end of your email address and copy.

04:23.240 --> 04:28.600
Now we can return to terminal and you can paste that line.

04:28.940 --> 04:31.540
Please take note of the u rl.

04:31.550 --> 04:34.100
It's w w w dot.

04:34.280 --> 04:34.670
Right.

04:34.760 --> 04:37.550
You can press enter to install WordPress.

04:37.700 --> 04:44.600
WordPress successfully installed note above that sendmail not found.

04:44.720 --> 04:48.440
WordPress need sendmail for form submission.

04:48.560 --> 04:53.510
Although we won't be using sendmail it is recommended to install it.

04:53.630 --> 04:57.290
Firstly, let's update the package list with sudo headgate.

04:57.290 --> 05:03.020
Update w ampersand sudo apte get installed a package sendmail.

05:06.300 --> 05:08.190
The package has been updated.

05:08.370 --> 05:11.610
Do you want to continue installing the package sendmail?

05:11.640 --> 05:12.570
Yes, we do.

05:12.630 --> 05:19.230
I also want you to take note of the following packages were automatically installed and are no longer

05:19.230 --> 05:20.220
required.

05:20.280 --> 05:23.550
We want to continue with the installation of Sen. Mel.

05:42.400 --> 05:49.260
Installing Sendmail may take some time, please be a little patient, it's open our browser.

05:49.420 --> 05:56.740
I'm going to type in my domain name without the W, W, W and R WordPress site has been installed.

05:58.660 --> 06:06.880
I'd like to point out that I typed the domain name without the w w w when we installed WordPress, we

06:06.880 --> 06:12.660
specified the u r l will be w w w dot the domain name.

06:12.700 --> 06:19.840
So WordPress will redirect to w w w dot domain name.

06:19.850 --> 06:25.210
It's go to the address bar and type in slash wp hyphen edman.

06:25.510 --> 06:30.940
You can switch back to your text editor for your admin username and password.

06:33.510 --> 06:37.410
We can copy and paste the username and password.

06:41.900 --> 06:45.720
First step after installing WordPress settings permalink.

06:46.220 --> 06:53.110
I'm going to change you to post name, you can save the changes, go to your posts, add new my title.

06:53.150 --> 06:54.360

It's publish.

06:59.890 --> 07:02.840
And view the post, I'm going to open it in a new tab.

07:02.860 --> 07:03.940
This is a test.

07:04.100 --> 07:08.740
If I check the address bar pretty PÃ¡lmi links are enabled and working.

07:08.920 --> 07:12.760
Let's go to all posts and we can delete the two posts.

07:17.320 --> 07:26.020
Pages or pages, and you can delete the sample page, we can leave our WordPress site at the stage,

07:26.050 --> 07:31.090
a long listing reveals the permissions as well as the ownership.

07:31.120 --> 07:33.550
This is an important part of WordPress.

07:33.560 --> 07:41.290
Security is ensuring that your WordPress files and directories have the correct ownership and permissions

07:41.470 --> 07:42.380
in this lecture.

07:42.400 --> 07:48.310
We installed our first WordPress site using the WordPress command line interface.
