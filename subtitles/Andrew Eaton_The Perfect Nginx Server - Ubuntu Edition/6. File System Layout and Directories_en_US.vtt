00:08.260 --> 00:18.250
In front of you, you have a less high for hour display of the root directory in Lennix, the root directory

00:18.520 --> 00:25.430
is specified by a forward slash with a listing of the root directory.

00:25.540 --> 00:33.280
They are only four directories that are of interest to US Etsy Home UPT.

00:33.280 --> 00:39.880
And for Etsy is the directory where you find all of your configuration files.

00:39.910 --> 00:45.700
The home directory is for user created files and directories.

00:45.730 --> 00:48.850
For example, we will be creating a backup script.

00:48.940 --> 00:52.660
That backup script will be stored in our home directory.

00:52.780 --> 00:59.470
The UPT directory is for the installation of add on software packages.

00:59.500 --> 01:05.650
The VA directory contains TARTA used by various applications.

01:05.650 --> 01:13.990
For example, our websites are stored inside the VA directory or log files are stored inside the VA

01:14.110 --> 01:14.860
directory.

01:15.010 --> 01:17.380
Here is the same information.

01:17.530 --> 01:24.880
Only this time it's a graphical representation of a directory listing of the root directory.

01:25.030 --> 01:30.130
The root directory is specified by a forward slash.

01:30.160 --> 01:34.600
The home directory is identified with a tool.

01:35.050 --> 01:41.620
Before we look at navigating the file system, using the change directory command, we need to look

01:41.620 --> 01:45.720
at two terms which are very important.

01:45.850 --> 01:53.950
Those two terms are the absolute path name and the local path and the difference between the two.

01:54.040 --> 02:04.000
With the absolute PathÃ©, the location is specified relative to the root directory with the local path

02:04.000 --> 02:04.420
name.

02:04.570 --> 02:10.230
The location is specified relative to the current directory.

02:10.300 --> 02:15.310
There are two examples on the screen to the right of the dollar sign.

02:15.340 --> 02:17.970
You have the word no, no, no, no.

02:17.980 --> 02:18.820
He's an editor.

02:18.820 --> 02:25.450
We will be using we are using NENO to edit a file called Engin X Dot.

02:25.450 --> 02:35.920
See in if the location of engine X dot com if it's in slash ATC slash Ingenix.

02:36.160 --> 02:41.470
If you look at the terminal prompt, we are in our home directory.

02:41.590 --> 02:46.480
So to open the engine extorts SEO in a file from our home directory.

02:46.480 --> 02:49.930
We need to type the absolute POS name.

02:49.960 --> 02:54.760
That is the path relative to the root directory.

02:54.880 --> 03:04.180
If we look at the example underneath that we have no Ingenix slash engine Eckstut seo in F.

03:04.330 --> 03:12.580
If you look to the left of the dollar sign, our current location in the file system is slash etsi to

03:12.580 --> 03:21.820
open engine Eckstut Seo and if using Nano we could specify the absolute path name or we could use the

03:21.820 --> 03:23.520
local path name.

03:23.530 --> 03:32.410
So in this case it would be Nannup Ingenix slash Ingenix dot see a caniff at this stage.

03:32.620 --> 03:35.230
If it doesn't make much sense, bear with me.

03:35.410 --> 03:41.410
As soon as we start working on the server, I will be guiding you step by step.

03:41.590 --> 03:45.310
Initially in the beginning I will use the absolute path.

03:45.310 --> 03:45.640
No.

03:45.670 --> 03:51.630
Then I will also show you how we could have done it using the local path name.

03:51.700 --> 04:01.330
So for now, please make a note of absolute relative to the route local relative to the current directory.

04:01.450 --> 04:06.460
The command to change directories is called C D.

04:06.610 --> 04:13.480
Initially, when you start with the course, you may struggle to find the relevant directory.

04:13.630 --> 04:15.580
It's not something to worry about.

04:15.670 --> 04:22.510
You will become familiar with the location of the various files and directories that we are going to

04:22.510 --> 04:23.440
be working with.

04:23.650 --> 04:32.890
There are four variations of the code command changing to the home directory, changing to a specific

04:32.890 --> 04:42.220
directory using the absolute POS or the local path, changing to the parent directory and changing to

04:42.430 --> 04:44.710
the previous directory.

04:44.800 --> 04:54.490
If you type CD all on its own and press enter, you will return to your home directory CD, followed

04:54.490 --> 05:02.680
by either the absolute or local path name will change to that directory.

05:02.860 --> 05:07.680
CD followed by two periods will change to the page.

05:07.720 --> 05:14.990
Current directory CD hyphen will change to the previous directory.
