00:05.090 --> 00:10.820
In step 12, we need to optimize WordPress as per the WordPress optimization lecture.

00:10.850 --> 00:16.970
We've already modified the main engine X configuration file engine X dot seo enough so you don't need

00:16.970 --> 00:18.360
to redo that step.

00:18.380 --> 00:22.840
We've already created the include file to leverage browser caching.

00:22.910 --> 00:27.230
We've already created the WP super cache include file.

00:27.240 --> 00:31.450
I'd like you to change to your Etsy Ingenix that's available directory.

00:31.580 --> 00:35.660
Then you need to open your second Saaz configuration file using Nenna.

00:36.200 --> 00:42.560
You can scroll down to the second server context to the location context that contains the TRA Files

00:42.560 --> 00:43.370
Directive.

00:43.400 --> 00:48.740
You can remove those three lines in place of the location context.

00:48.920 --> 00:54.680
We are going to add the global optimizations file as well as the WP super cache file.

00:54.710 --> 00:59.930
So we need to include optimizations as well as WP super cache.

00:59.930 --> 01:05.810
You can Xanana saving your changes, its test, the configuration, everything is fine.

01:05.810 --> 01:06.710
Let's reload.

01:06.710 --> 01:15.830
Ingenix you need to change to your var ww w site directory, not the public html, just the site directory.

01:15.860 --> 01:22.820
We are going to use mod and change the permissions of public underscore html two seven seven five.

01:23.030 --> 01:28.700
You can then change to the public HDMI old directory where they need to change the permissions of WP

01:28.700 --> 01:37.670
config two six six four six six four will allow the web server to write to the WP config for my WordPress

01:37.670 --> 01:38.330
dashboard.

01:38.510 --> 01:42.800
I would like to add a new plugin WP Super Cache Install.

01:47.410 --> 01:56.050
Installed plug ins would be super cash we can activate let's go to settings caching on update status,

01:56.060 --> 01:58.390
let's test the cache success.

01:58.600 --> 02:01.690
I would like you to click on the advanced tab.

02:01.840 --> 02:05.740
Enable caching is selected your cache delivery method.

02:05.890 --> 02:08.520
I would like you to select expert.

02:08.530 --> 02:15.910
We have added the WP Super Cache Engine X configuration files so the expert option can be enabled.

02:16.060 --> 02:21.310
I would also like you to select don't cache pages for one uses.

02:23.870 --> 02:26.510
You can then click update status.

02:27.850 --> 02:35.110
And now I'd like you to click on Preload, Preload will create static files of every published post

02:35.110 --> 02:37.030
and page on your site.

02:37.030 --> 02:41.800
Creating static pages will speed up your site tremendously.

02:41.920 --> 02:44.430
Refresh preload cache files every.

02:44.440 --> 02:51.520
I normally like to set it at 1200 minutes and then select preload mode garbage collection disabled.

02:51.520 --> 02:56.950
Send me status emails, no emails and you can click save settings.

02:57.100 --> 02:59.380
You can then click preload cache.

02:59.380 --> 03:00.940
Now back to terminal.

03:01.060 --> 03:08.710
I'm changing the permissions of WP config back to six for for in the event you get changing permissions

03:08.710 --> 03:10.240
operation not permitted.

03:10.240 --> 03:16.060
Simply use sudo change to your home directory and run the WP permissions script.

03:16.060 --> 03:22.870
Every time you install a plugin or theme, change to your home directory and run that particular script

03:22.870 --> 03:28.270
to correct the permissions on all the WordPress files and directories.

03:28.270 --> 03:35.530
You will notice the script changed public underscore H.T. email back to seven five five.

03:45.460 --> 03:52.390
You've just installed your second WordPress site on your engine server, installing site number three

03:52.390 --> 03:54.960
four five is exactly the same.

03:55.180 --> 03:57.670
Follow the 12 steps.
