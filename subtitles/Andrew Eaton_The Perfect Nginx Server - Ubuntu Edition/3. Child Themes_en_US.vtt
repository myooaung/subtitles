No theme is perfect if you intend to make changes to your theme, you must never edit the original files.

00:09.180 --> 00:16.140
The reason for not editing the original theme files is that any changes you make will be lost when your

00:16.140 --> 00:18.100
theme is updated.

00:18.120 --> 00:22.530
It's for this reason that we make use of a child theme.

00:22.530 --> 00:29.400
A child theme is a theme that inherits the functionality and looks of the parent theme.

00:29.580 --> 00:37.200
The whole idea of a child theme is that you can modify the parent theme without modifying it directly

00:37.380 --> 00:38.070
to parent.

00:38.070 --> 00:40.100
Theme remains unedited.

00:40.110 --> 00:43.230
Everything is modified using the child.

00:43.420 --> 00:50.010
The IV use different colors to specify different variables when creating a child theme.

00:50.010 --> 00:56.400
Using WP Seelie, we will make use of the WP Scaffold Command.

00:56.400 --> 01:00.000
We then specify child hyphen theme.

01:00.210 --> 01:03.150
The first variable we need to look at is the folder.

01:03.150 --> 01:07.650
That is the folder that will contain the child theme files.

01:07.830 --> 01:08.850
The parent theme.

01:08.940 --> 01:14.280
That is the theme you want to create a child theme from the theme name.

01:14.490 --> 01:17.970
That's the name you want to give to your child theme.

01:18.120 --> 01:23.520
The author you can use your name, the also uniform resource identifier.

01:23.550 --> 01:28.200
That's the you are of the author and the theme you are I.

01:28.230 --> 01:30.720
I normally use my site address.

01:30.870 --> 01:35.580
The commands are all typed in a single line.

01:35.730 --> 01:40.860
The entire command is typed without pressing enter at any stage.

01:40.860 --> 01:42.960
It's a single line.

01:43.110 --> 01:44.910
So I'm going to create a child.

01:44.910 --> 01:49.170
See the command is WP scaffolded child theme.

01:49.320 --> 01:52.980
The folder I want to create to store the child theme files.

01:52.980 --> 01:58.000
I'm going to call my 2017 child the parent theme.

01:58.020 --> 01:59.700
Twenty seventeen.

01:59.820 --> 02:04.410
The Child Theme Name My 2017 child theme.

02:04.410 --> 02:09.270
Please note the apostrophe apostrophe my space.

02:09.270 --> 02:15.920
The minute you have a space inside, one of the options enclose it in apostrophes.

02:15.960 --> 02:16.710
The author.

02:17.040 --> 02:18.180

02:18.300 --> 02:25.410

02:25.440 --> 02:27.090
The author you are I.

02:27.180 --> 02:29.520
That is the author's site address.

02:29.550 --> 02:30.820
The theme you are I.

02:30.830 --> 02:33.180
I normally use the site address.

02:33.450 --> 02:35.070
I'm currently in my sites.

02:35.250 --> 02:37.410

02:37.410 --> 02:45.120

03:37.780 --> 03:40.620
You will notice it does not have an image.

03:40.630 --> 03:42.310

03:45.320 --> 03:48.640
