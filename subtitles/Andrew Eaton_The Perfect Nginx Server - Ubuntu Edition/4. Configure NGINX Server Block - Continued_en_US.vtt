The third step is to create the non-secure server blocks, to serve the site on our server as before,

00:13.160 --> 00:18.680
we will use the Engine X default file as a template for the new site.

00:18.710 --> 00:24.290
We need to make a copy of the default file, naming it our domain name.

00:24.320 --> 00:26.750
We need to change to your Etsy.

00:26.780 --> 00:30.900
Ingenix sites available directory sudo c.p.

00:30.980 --> 00:38.150
We want to copy, we want to copy the file default and name the new file domain name with any to open

00:38.150 --> 00:40.070
the newly created file using.

00:40.070 --> 00:48.980
And you are only allowed one default server so you need to remove default server from the lists and

00:48.980 --> 00:50.060
directives.

00:54.330 --> 01:05.760
The route or sites route is slash, bar, slash w w w the domain name slash public underscore html the

01:05.760 --> 01:07.050
index directive.

01:07.050 --> 01:14.230
We are configuring a WordPress site so the only entry we need is index dot p.

01:14.490 --> 01:21.270
The server name is your domain name and w w w dot your domain name.

01:21.480 --> 01:24.780
The two location directives under the server name.

01:24.810 --> 01:30.370
You can leave as is for now we can exit saving URL changes to the file.

01:31.170 --> 01:33.470
Now we need to enable our site.

01:33.780 --> 01:43.560
We do that by creating a symbolic link from the sites available to sites enabled sudo Elin Finniss the

01:43.560 --> 01:52.320
path to the file ETEK Ingenix sites available the folder, then the path to the sites enabled Etsy.

01:52.320 --> 01:56.160
Ingenix sites enabled Meka Web dev dot com.

01:56.310 --> 02:01.300
I'm going to go back one level and change to the site's enabled directory.

02:01.350 --> 02:06.660
There is the link mac web dev NJT test URL configuration.

02:06.780 --> 02:11.220
Everything is OK to enable in G or.
