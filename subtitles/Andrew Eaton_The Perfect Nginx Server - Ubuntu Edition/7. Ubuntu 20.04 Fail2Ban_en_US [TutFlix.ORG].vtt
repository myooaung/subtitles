00:20.060 --> 00:27.770
Failed to ban is an intrusion prevention software framework that protects servers from brute force attacks,

00:27.890 --> 00:34.820
failed to ban operates by monitoring log files for selected entries and then running scripts.

00:34.820 --> 00:41.300
Based on those entries with your server, you will find numerous attempts to log into your server from

00:41.300 --> 00:48.230
all over the world, although we have set up key authentication and these attempts are in actual fact,

00:48.230 --> 00:49.140
a waste of time.

00:49.190 --> 00:54.230
These attempts are annoying and they can also affect the server resources.

00:54.260 --> 01:00.890
Having thousands of SSL login attempts will eventually affect the performance of your server.

01:00.920 --> 01:08.390
I'll fail to ban works is to block the IP addresses that belong to hosts that are trying to breach the

01:08.390 --> 01:09.590
system security.

01:09.610 --> 01:17.570
It can ban any IP address that makes too many login attempts or performs any other unwanted action within

01:17.570 --> 01:24.370
a timeframe that has been defined by the rules that fail to ban follows are referred to as shale's.

01:24.590 --> 01:31.070
We need to install, fail to ban prior to installing a package, ensure that the package list is up

01:31.070 --> 01:34.520
to date by running the command sudo act update.

01:37.200 --> 01:43.380
All packages are up to date, I've run the SUDA update command, I'm now going to install the package

01:43.380 --> 01:48.930
Fadal to bed in 10 minutes time if I installed another package, I really don't need to update the package

01:48.930 --> 01:49.470
list again.

01:49.680 --> 01:53.720
If an hour or two is passed, then I would run the update command again.

01:53.820 --> 01:55.410
We need to use sudo.

01:55.410 --> 02:01.110
Installing packages on the server is the job of the router user, so we need to invoke route privileges

02:01.110 --> 02:03.600
to do the advanced package manager.

02:03.600 --> 02:04.620
What do we want to do?

02:04.620 --> 02:09.300
Install the name of the package that we want to install is Fail to Bad.

02:11.710 --> 02:17.320
The following additional packages will be installed, the following new packages will be installed after

02:17.320 --> 02:22.210
this operation, almost two and a half megabytes of additional disk space will be used.

02:22.240 --> 02:23.500
Do you want to continue?

02:23.650 --> 02:24.300
Yes.

02:24.310 --> 02:25.940
I'm not going to press enter.

02:25.990 --> 02:27.490
I'm going to type no.

02:27.520 --> 02:29.110
That last prompt.

02:29.260 --> 02:34.990
If you don't want to receive that prompt and you want the package to be installed without having to

02:34.990 --> 02:36.610
confirm, add a hyphen.

02:36.610 --> 02:37.090
Why?

02:37.120 --> 02:38.470
To the end of the command.

02:44.120 --> 02:50.270
And the package will be installed without any further confirmation on your part, configuration files

02:50.270 --> 02:53.570
are stored in the slush etek directory.

02:53.570 --> 02:57.540
KDDI slash ETSI a listing of the FTC directory.

02:57.560 --> 02:58.760
Top left hand corner.

02:58.760 --> 03:00.920
There is a directory file to ban.

03:01.070 --> 03:08.330
It's now a local party name so you can type CD space fail to ban a listing displays the fail to ban

03:08.330 --> 03:09.640
configuration files.

03:09.830 --> 03:17.420
The main fail to band configuration file is a jail dot com and if standard practice is to create a backup

03:17.420 --> 03:22.220
copy of jailed dot com f but was fail to ban, things are slightly different.

03:22.430 --> 03:29.030
Instead of creating a backup copy of the jailed Orzio in a file, we are going to create a new file

03:29.030 --> 03:31.460
called Jail DOT Local.

03:31.460 --> 03:37.490
Any configuration sitting in jail dot local overrides jail dot com in.

03:37.490 --> 03:44.180
If we follow this method to prevent any changes that we have made to the failed to band configuration

03:44.180 --> 03:50.460
from being lost in the event of an upgrade to failed to ban, say you make a change in jail.

03:50.540 --> 03:57.380
Orzio in two weeks time failed to banquettes updated any changes that you make to jail dot com f will

03:57.380 --> 03:58.010
be lost.

03:58.010 --> 04:01.490
But we are going to use child or local and upgrade.

04:01.490 --> 04:05.320
To fail to ban will not affect the configuration in jail.

04:05.330 --> 04:07.160
That local a wide listing.

04:07.160 --> 04:10.660
All the files are owned by the route user and the route group.

04:10.660 --> 04:16.970
When creating a backup copy of a particular file, the normal procedure would be Sepi Devah space,

04:16.970 --> 04:22.830
followed by the filename Niva space followed by the backup file name the Espace.

04:23.030 --> 04:28.640
Add a dot back as all the files and directories are owned by the route user.

04:28.640 --> 04:34.670
From this point forward, when you create backup copies of your configuration files, you need to use

04:34.670 --> 04:35.450
sudo.

04:35.720 --> 04:43.040
So it would be sudo sepi followed by the filename jail dot com Neth the the space, the backup file

04:43.040 --> 04:46.820
that we would normally type the same file name but add a dot vacay.

04:46.820 --> 04:53.090
Fail to ban is different instead of jail dot com dot back you type in jail.

04:53.090 --> 04:57.830
Dot local listing displays the jail dot local file.

04:57.840 --> 05:06.080
Now what happens is we modify the jailed often local file not jail dot com and f sudo neno jail dot

05:06.080 --> 05:06.710
local.

05:07.960 --> 05:11.710
All these lines in the beginning with a hash are all comments.

05:12.990 --> 05:18.810
I want you to find a U.S. default, not the common default as you see there, scroll down.

05:18.810 --> 05:21.320
Until you find default, there is default.

05:21.360 --> 05:22.770
That is not a comment.

05:22.800 --> 05:28.770
You can scroll down a little way until we find bantam font and the MEXT retry.

05:31.050 --> 05:37.880
There we have the three directors ban, Tom Foreman, Tom and Max redraw, firstly the ban.

05:37.890 --> 05:43.170
Tom, this is how long we want to ban a particular host who can remove the ten.

05:43.170 --> 05:45.820
And the ten is for ten minutes.

05:45.840 --> 05:48.060
I'm going to type the time in seconds.

05:48.060 --> 05:50.880
Six for 800 seconds.

05:50.880 --> 05:52.620
That is seven days.

05:52.650 --> 05:53.610
The fine time.

05:53.610 --> 06:01.770
I want to sit for three hours, ten, eight hundred seconds max redraw from five change to two.

06:01.920 --> 06:05.100
So the ban, Tom, is how long you want to ban a host.

06:05.250 --> 06:08.250
Now the fun Tom and the MEXT retry.

06:08.250 --> 06:09.600
Those two are related.

06:09.690 --> 06:17.580
If you exceed the max retry in the specified fine time, your host will be banned for the ban.

06:17.580 --> 06:20.460
Tom, looking at these three directives, we have a ban, Tom.

06:20.460 --> 06:21.290
Seven days.

06:21.300 --> 06:24.120
We have a fine time, three hours, and we have a max drive.

06:24.120 --> 06:31.440
To to summarize it, if you exceed to login attempts in three hours, your IP address will be banned

06:31.440 --> 06:32.420
for seven days.

06:32.460 --> 06:36.750
Control W control W is a search function of NENO.

06:36.780 --> 06:38.600
I want you to search for a string.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.160
This is HD.

06:40.200 --> 06:43.410
Now we want to enable the S.H. Joe.

06:43.530 --> 06:48.720
Firstly the mode you can uncommented, you can change normal to aggressive.

06:56.970 --> 07:01.230
Port DSH, log pass and back end can remain as is.

07:01.260 --> 07:04.560
You need to add enabled equals true.

07:05.220 --> 07:11.640
At this stage we have finished with our configuration of the jail local file control X..

07:11.640 --> 07:14.190
You want to close then save modified buffer.

07:14.190 --> 07:14.730
Yes.

07:14.730 --> 07:17.190
File name to write Jahlil DOT Local.

07:17.400 --> 07:23.730
When you make a change to a configuration file, you need to restart the service that is associated

07:23.760 --> 07:28.380
with that configuration file sudo system CTL.

07:28.380 --> 07:29.340
What do we want to do?

07:29.350 --> 07:31.550
We want to restart Niva space.

07:31.560 --> 07:35.730
The name of the service that we want to restart is fail to ban.

07:36.510 --> 07:44.040
It happens that fail to ban Banjul IP and you cannot access your server if this happens to you.

07:44.040 --> 07:46.410
You have two choices to rectify it.

07:46.590 --> 07:53.190
The easiest method is to get a new IP from your ISP, contact your ISP in this regard.

07:53.190 --> 08:00.330
But most of the time, if you reboot or power your router on and off, you should be allocated a new

08:00.330 --> 08:04.120
IP and therefore you can access to your server.

08:04.260 --> 08:09.020
The second method is the manual method of unbanning or IP versity.

08:09.030 --> 08:11.520
You need to determine your local IP.

08:11.520 --> 08:13.740
You need to Google what is my IP?

08:13.800 --> 08:15.150
Make a note of your IP.

08:15.180 --> 08:22.560
Then you need to get consular access to your server and manually type the command to unban your IP.

08:22.590 --> 08:27.500
Your hosts should provide a web based console access to your server.

08:27.540 --> 08:33.660
This console provides access to your server that is almost like sitting in front of your server.

08:33.690 --> 08:38.490
This is also called KVM Keyboard Video Mouse Access.

08:38.490 --> 08:45.360
You need to check your hosts support regarding console access and then log into your server as the route

08:45.360 --> 08:47.420
user I want to type exit.

08:47.430 --> 08:49.250
I've logged out of my server.

08:49.290 --> 08:52.810
This is EQ, ABC at my servers IP address.

08:52.980 --> 08:54.670
Permission denied Prisma up.

08:54.690 --> 08:56.130
Eric, try again.

09:00.990 --> 09:02.560
As you can see, nothing.

09:02.580 --> 09:03.570
Let's try again.

09:03.630 --> 09:08.520
Let's change the ABC to the if that is failed to begin working.

09:08.520 --> 09:10.160
My IP has been banned.

09:10.170 --> 09:12.190
Google, what is my IP?

09:12.330 --> 09:14.060
Make a note of your IP.

09:14.790 --> 09:18.120
I'm going to copy my IP and pasted into my text.

09:18.120 --> 09:20.730
Editor of Logged into the Vulture Control Panel.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.050
I'll click on my servers.

09:22.050 --> 09:25.650
Hostname top right hand corner view console.

09:27.760 --> 09:31.180
The username is Root Your Root Users Password.

09:31.210 --> 09:33.830
You need to remember we changed the password.

09:33.850 --> 09:37.830
It's not the password that is in the vulture control panel any longer.

09:40.800 --> 09:48.960
Now I need to manually unban my IP, fail to ban Hafen client, leave a space set, leave a space,

09:48.990 --> 09:52.340
the jail is SS, HD, Niva space.

09:52.380 --> 09:53.390
What do I want to do?

09:53.400 --> 09:57.640
I want to unban an IP unbend IP Niva space.

09:57.810 --> 10:04.580
Now I need to type my IP forty one dot 13 dot for dot one four zero.

10:04.680 --> 10:06.210
Back to my local terminal.

10:06.390 --> 10:08.190
Is this H Ubuntu.

10:11.200 --> 10:18.280
And our passphrase and I've logged in to my server, I can close console and my browser, so that is

10:18.280 --> 10:24.400
the steps you need to follow if your IP is back, the easiest method, power your router on and off

10:24.400 --> 10:26.050
or reboot your router.

10:26.050 --> 10:31.210
If you're unable to do that, you need to follow these manual steps, get your IP address, Google.

10:31.210 --> 10:37.240
What is my IP log into your server using console type the command to unban your IP address.

10:37.270 --> 10:42.220
The fail to bend log file makes interesting reading to view the contents of log files.

10:42.220 --> 10:51.250
You use the cat or less commands as the log files are owned by the root user use sudo with either the

10:51.250 --> 11:00.130
cat or less command your log files are located in the slash VA directory CD slash for a listing displays

11:00.130 --> 11:01.800
another directory called Log.

11:01.810 --> 11:04.460
Now you can type CD space log.

11:04.460 --> 11:12.730
A listing of the slash VA slash log directory displays a file folder bendat log if I type Keat followed

11:12.730 --> 11:16.480
by the filename felt abandoned log permission denied.

11:16.480 --> 11:19.090
I'm going to list the contents of the log directory.

11:19.240 --> 11:20.680
Let's look at the file.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.220
Failed to Ben on the extreme left.

11:23.260 --> 11:25.900
The owner has agreed to write permissions.

11:25.930 --> 11:28.780
That means the route user can read and write the group.

11:28.780 --> 11:32.110
The group is Adam has read permissions.

11:32.110 --> 11:33.190
So who are we?

11:33.220 --> 11:34.480
We are the other user.

11:34.480 --> 11:36.370
What permissions does the other user have?

11:36.370 --> 11:37.360
No permissions.

11:37.510 --> 11:39.700
That is why permission denied.

11:39.700 --> 11:46.810
But if I invoke privileges, Sudo Kett, followed by the fail to bend log filename, I can view the

11:46.810 --> 11:49.270
contents of the failed to bend log file.

11:49.300 --> 11:54.250
The cat command will display the entire file contents on the screen.

11:54.280 --> 11:57.550
As you could see, the contents of the file flashed past us.

11:57.700 --> 12:01.210
That's fine if the file contains very little information.

12:01.210 --> 12:07.390
Now, the this command is much more useful as each page will be paused for you to look at.

12:07.420 --> 12:14.800
You can use the following keys with a list, command home and page up, page down as well as your cursor

12:14.800 --> 12:16.300
keys to quit the list.

12:16.300 --> 12:20.890
Command Priscu so I can type Pseudolus leave Espace.

12:20.890 --> 12:23.120
The name of the log file is fail to bed.

12:23.260 --> 12:24.040
Don't look.

12:24.040 --> 12:29.470
I can use my cursor keys and scroll down or up one line at a time.

12:29.470 --> 12:35.800
I can use page up, page down as well as home to take me to the beginning of the file or end to take

12:35.800 --> 12:37.330
me to the end of the file.

12:37.330 --> 12:41.170
As I said, the fail to bend log file makes interesting reading.

12:41.170 --> 12:51.640
Creating new jail SS HD fine time, three hours bantam seven days max try to jail SS HD started notice

12:51.640 --> 12:59.500
my IP found there's my IP found is my IP ban, there's my IP and then there is my IP.

12:59.530 --> 13:02.500
As I've just set up the server was failed to bend.

13:02.500 --> 13:04.000
Log file is empty.

13:04.000 --> 13:11.110
You will find bots from all over the world continuously attempting to access to your server.

13:11.110 --> 13:14.860
Failed to bend will help prevent all this brute force attacks.

13:15.010 --> 13:22.570
Failed to Bend is one of the essential utilities that any systems administrator must install on any

13:22.570 --> 13:30.190
publicly facing server to quit the last command tip queue and you will return to your prompt CD Change

13:30.190 --> 13:32.560
to my home directory, followed by Clear.
