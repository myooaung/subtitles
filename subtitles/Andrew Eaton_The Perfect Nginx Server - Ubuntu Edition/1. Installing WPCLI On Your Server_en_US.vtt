00:00.150 --> 00:02.950
Please check the resources section of this lecture.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.700
There is a PDF download available.

00:23.800 --> 00:30.670
In this lecture, we are going to install the WordPress command line interface, WordPress command line

00:30.670 --> 00:38.230
interface is the official command line tool for interacting with and managing your WordPress sites from

00:38.230 --> 00:45.310
editing configuration files and database management to posting theming, uploading media, approving

00:45.310 --> 00:46.150
comments.

00:46.150 --> 00:55.510
WPEC Allai allows a WordPress site owner to control all the aspects of WordPress from the command line.

00:55.630 --> 01:01.240
Installing and configuring WPEC ALLAI is a straightforward procedure.

01:01.240 --> 01:04.720
The commands we will be using for the section are as follows.

01:04.840 --> 01:08.620
Firstly, you need to download WPEC Allai.

01:08.620 --> 01:11.140
We will use the kernel command for that.

01:11.230 --> 01:15.610
Then we need to give WP Seelie executable permissions.

01:15.820 --> 01:24.330
All that means is by giving WPEC Allai executable permissions, we will allow it to run on our server.

01:24.340 --> 01:28.960
We use the S.H. Mod Command to change permissions.

01:29.110 --> 01:33.250
We then need to move WPEC allai into our POS.

01:33.670 --> 01:39.400
Every time you type a command, you don't want to have to specify the path to the command.

01:39.400 --> 01:48.250
By moving WPEC allai into our path, we can execute the WP command in any directory.

01:48.400 --> 01:56.410
Finally, to display the version information WP leave a space double hyphen followed by info.

01:56.590 --> 02:00.550
There are no configuration files to be edited in this lecture.

02:00.730 --> 02:02.800
You should be in your home directory.

02:03.310 --> 02:06.700
If not, please type CD followed by Enter.

02:06.820 --> 02:16.140
Firstly, we need to download WPEC Allai Curl hyphen o followed by the you are allowed to WPEC align

02:16.140 --> 02:17.290
not far.

02:17.320 --> 02:21.490
The link is in the PDF companion to this lecture.

02:23.440 --> 02:31.030
It's a little over six megabytes listing off the files in our home directory, we'll reveal the file

02:31.060 --> 02:32.890
that we have just downloaded.

02:33.040 --> 02:37.600
Now we need to give WPC Allai executable permissions.

02:37.810 --> 02:46.960
I'd like you to type alias hyphen L look at the permissions of pinkly file, read, write, read, write,

02:46.960 --> 02:50.110
read six six four.

02:50.290 --> 02:56.020
We are now going to give that file executable permissions.

02:56.230 --> 03:03.760
S.H. Mod is used to change permissions Gmod plus X followed by the filename.

03:03.820 --> 03:08.260
A long listing will reveal the change in permissions.

03:08.290 --> 03:15.130
That file has changed from six six four to seven seven five.

03:15.550 --> 03:20.830
Now we need to move WPC Allai into our POS sudo.

03:21.430 --> 03:31.780
The command is M.V. To move M.V. can be used to move a file or directory as well as rename a file or

03:31.780 --> 03:32.540
directory.

03:32.590 --> 03:41.560
The path is slash us or slash local slash and slash w p to test.

03:41.560 --> 03:47.470
If WPEC allai is installed correctly as well as obtain version numbers.

03:47.710 --> 03:51.670
WP Iva Space Double hyphen info.

03:51.850 --> 03:56.020
WPEC Allai has now been installed on our server.

03:56.170 --> 04:02.560
If you need to upgrade WPEC allai, all I recommend is to upgrade.

04:02.710 --> 04:05.350
Follow the steps that we have just done.

04:05.380 --> 04:12.040
Use the Kerl command, download WPEC Allai, change the permissions, make the file that you've downloaded

04:12.040 --> 04:12.940
executable.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.430
Move it inside your path and it's done.

04:15.430 --> 04:21.400
Now we need to use WP CLIA to create our first WordPress site.

04:21.640 --> 04:26.710
In this lecture we installed the WordPress command line interface.
