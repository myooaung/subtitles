00:20.840 --> 00:27.390
In this section, we are going to look at Linux users as well as passwords.

00:27.530 --> 00:36.740
They are two types of users in the mix that concern us, the root user and then all other users.

00:36.890 --> 00:38.910
Let's look at the root user.

00:38.930 --> 00:46.940
Firstly, the root user is the all powerful administrative or super user on the limbic system.

00:46.970 --> 00:54.940
The root user has tremendous power, so utmost care must always be taken if you are working as the root

00:54.950 --> 00:55.460
user.

00:55.490 --> 01:03.080
It is extremely foolhardy to work on a server as the root user, as one carelessly typed command can

01:03.080 --> 01:06.260
erase important configuration files.

01:06.260 --> 01:15.440
Amongst the responsibilities of the user includes installing various packages, making changes to configuration

01:15.440 --> 01:17.870
files, updating the server.

01:17.880 --> 01:26.420
A non route user can be a user like us, or it could be a system process.

01:26.420 --> 01:35.660
For example, Engine X runs as a user on your server and that user is a non route user.

01:35.690 --> 01:40.940
All other users are non route users.

01:41.060 --> 01:49.130
When you can't figure a server, we are going to be installing various software packages that we need

01:49.130 --> 01:51.310
to display our sites.

01:51.320 --> 01:55.880
You don't do this working as the route user.

01:55.880 --> 02:00.530
What we do is we take a non route user.

02:00.530 --> 02:09.050
In this case, it will be us, the user, that we will create for ourselves and we give that user route

02:09.050 --> 02:11.450
privileges by privileges.

02:11.720 --> 02:17.270
I'm referring to having the rights to perform a task on your server.

02:17.270 --> 02:25.610
When you log into your server, you are logged in as a normal non route user with the privileges of

02:25.610 --> 02:28.130
a non route user.

02:28.130 --> 02:33.590
A non route user cannot install packages or update the server.

02:33.620 --> 02:38.600
You can only accomplish tasks that you have the privileges for.

02:38.720 --> 02:50.690
You take a non router user and you give that user route privileges to allow a non route user route privileges.

02:50.870 --> 02:56.330
That user must be added to the route group of users.

02:56.480 --> 03:04.700
I'll be covering the concept of groups shortly by adding a non route user to the route group.

03:04.970 --> 03:14.270
That non route user can invoke the power of the route user at any time to accomplish that.

03:14.270 --> 03:24.650
The non route user who has been given route privileges types sudo super user to prior to tapping the

03:24.650 --> 03:25.460
command.

03:25.460 --> 03:32.420
I must mention the following when talking about passwords as a security precaution, you will not see

03:32.420 --> 03:38.090
any characters appear on the screen as you type a password.

03:38.210 --> 03:46.940
At this stage, I would like you to please make note of two commands that we will be using.

03:47.090 --> 03:50.030
The first command is V.I..

03:50.390 --> 03:59.750
Sudi V Suja allows us to add a non route user to the route group.

04:00.020 --> 04:09.200
The user we have then added to the REDgroup can invoke route privileges at any time using the command

04:09.590 --> 04:10.400
sudo.

04:10.550 --> 04:20.420
Please make note of these two commands suda you will use continuously throughout the course vasudha

04:20.810 --> 04:26.000
you will use once when we initially login to our server.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.670
For now, just make a note of the commands.

04:28.670 --> 04:34.250
I will cover their usage as we progress through the course.

04:34.520 --> 04:42.380
In this lecture I briefly covered the difference between a route user and a non user.
