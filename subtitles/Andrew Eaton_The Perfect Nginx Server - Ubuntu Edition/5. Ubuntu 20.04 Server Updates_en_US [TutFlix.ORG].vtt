00:20.070 --> 00:25.200
Vulnerabilities are found continuously, packages are being updated continuously.

00:25.250 --> 00:28.940
It is most important that you keep the packages up to date.

00:29.030 --> 00:34.370
You need to log into your server, run three commands, and then you can log out of your server.

00:34.400 --> 00:37.630
I don't like any form of automatic updates.

00:37.640 --> 00:40.600
If something goes wrong, I want to be there.

00:40.610 --> 00:44.750
I want to see what has gone wrong and if needs be, fix the problem.

00:44.750 --> 00:49.580
He takes a few minutes of your time to log in and ensure your server is kept updated.

00:49.760 --> 00:51.770
There are three commands that you need to run.

00:51.920 --> 00:54.920
The first command downloads a new package list.

00:55.040 --> 01:00.020
The second command updates the packages based on the package list that you downloaded.

01:00.020 --> 01:04.400
The last command will remove any unneeded packages from the server.

01:04.410 --> 01:06.500
I'm going to type the clear command.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.380
Updating a server is an administrative task.

01:09.380 --> 01:13.370
You need to use Sudo after Sudo, Apte, ect.

01:13.620 --> 01:15.740
That is our advanced package manager.

01:15.770 --> 01:22.670
The first command is Suda update SUDA update will download the latest package list to your server.

01:22.700 --> 01:25.610
You will need to provide the password for your user.

01:29.890 --> 01:35.470
This is the first time I'm running the update and upgrade command, 36 packages can be upgraded.

01:35.590 --> 01:39.990
The next command will perform the actual upgrade sudo act.

01:40.300 --> 01:41.250
What do we want to do?

01:41.260 --> 01:42.760
We want to upgrade.

01:42.760 --> 01:45.640
So Sudo EPT update downloads the new package.

01:45.640 --> 01:50.200
This upgrade will perform the actual upgrade of those packages.

01:52.150 --> 01:54.310
The following new packages will be installed.

01:54.430 --> 01:59.320
There is a list of packages, the following packages will be upgraded, followed by the list of packages

01:59.500 --> 02:02.360
needed to get 181 megabytes of archives.

02:02.380 --> 02:07.870
After this operation, an additional three hundred and sixty megabytes of disk space will be used.

02:08.020 --> 02:11.590
This is the first time we are running the update upgrade command.

02:11.620 --> 02:15.710
There will be a lot of packages to download if you do it on a daily basis.

02:15.730 --> 02:17.420
This should not be many.

02:17.470 --> 02:18.700
Do you want to continue?

02:18.830 --> 02:19.540
Yes.

03:07.300 --> 03:14.740
And the upgrade command has completed now we need to remove any unneeded packages, the command is Sudo

03:14.890 --> 03:21.640
ept and we want to orta remove the following packages will be removed after this operation.

03:21.670 --> 03:25.160
Three hundred and fifty nine megabytes of disk space will be freed.

03:25.270 --> 03:26.530
Do you want to continue?

03:26.830 --> 03:27.340
Yes.

03:37.770 --> 03:39.510
I'm going to type clear.

03:39.810 --> 03:46.380
Those are the three commands that you use to update your server, the first command sudo update that

03:46.380 --> 03:50.980
command will update the list of available packages and their versions.

03:51.180 --> 03:55.120
He does not install or upgrade any packages.

03:55.320 --> 04:01.770
I want to point out that the update command is not only used when updating packages, you use the update

04:01.770 --> 04:09.660
command prior to installing new packages on your server to ensure you download the latest package versions.

04:09.870 --> 04:16.570
The SUDA upgrade command installs the newer versions of the packages you have installed on your server.

04:16.590 --> 04:24.030
It's most important that you run the update command before the upgrade command so the package manager

04:24.030 --> 04:28.920
knows about available updates for the packages you have installed on your server.

04:28.950 --> 04:35.730
Finally, we have to do at auto remove, which is used to remove unneeded packages that are sometimes

04:35.730 --> 04:36.600
left behind.

04:36.600 --> 04:43.020
After you remove or purge packages from the server, further package manager usage will be covered in

04:43.020 --> 04:47.910
the next section when we start installing various packages on our server.
