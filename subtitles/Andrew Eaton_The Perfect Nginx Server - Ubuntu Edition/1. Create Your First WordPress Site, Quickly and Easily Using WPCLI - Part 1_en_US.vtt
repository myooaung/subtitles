Please check the resources section of this lecture.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.700
There is a PDF download available.

00:23.120 --> 00:29.740
In this lecture, we are going to create a WordPress site using WP CLIA.

00:29.990 --> 00:37.730
There are three steps to create a WordPress site using the WordPress command line interface.

00:37.940 --> 00:45.060
The first step is to download the latest version of WordPress from WordPress dot org.

00:45.110 --> 00:49.520
The command is WP Core Download.

00:49.670 --> 00:54.530
The second step is to create the WP config file.

00:54.530 --> 00:58.250
WP Core Config database name database.

00:58.250 --> 01:02.760
User database password database prefix.

01:02.960 --> 01:13.100
What's most important, do not use WP underscore as the database prefix as with our database name,

01:13.400 --> 01:14.930
username and password.

01:14.930 --> 01:19.190
Use random characters when typing the commands.

01:19.190 --> 01:25.160
Make note of double hyphen db name equals database name.

01:25.220 --> 01:34.100
There is no space after the two hyphens and to the left or right of the equals sign double hyphen db

01:34.100 --> 01:35.720
name equals you.

01:35.720 --> 01:41.630
Then add the name of the database that you created using Maraire DB.

01:41.840 --> 01:46.420
The same with the database user and the database password.

01:46.520 --> 01:51.830
Do not use WP underscore as the database prefix.

01:52.100 --> 01:57.290
The third and final step is to actually install WordPress.

01:57.470 --> 02:02.300
You have five variables that you need to provide information for.

02:02.360 --> 02:08.060
The admin email is the site owners email address admin user.

02:08.240 --> 02:15.290
That is the WordPress administrative username as well as the administrative password.

02:15.440 --> 02:22.010
The title, if it's more than one word, enclose the title in two apostrophes.

02:22.250 --> 02:35.240
The are you have two choices http colon slash slash domain or htp colon slash slash w w w dot followed

02:35.240 --> 02:36.730
by the domain name.

02:36.770 --> 02:45.170
When we created our sites server block server name we added in my case with my domain name, WPEC allai

02:45.170 --> 02:51.030
dot com and w w w dot wp Seelie dot com.

02:51.050 --> 02:56.670
When installing your WordPress site, decide how you want your site to be displayed.

02:56.670 --> 03:04.640
Do you want it to redirect, for example, if somebody types in domain dot com, do you want just domain

03:04.640 --> 03:14.000
dot com to be displayed in the browser's address bar or do you want a redirect to w w w dot domain dot

03:14.000 --> 03:14.390
com.

03:14.390 --> 03:17.870
Decide how you want your site to be displayed.

03:17.930 --> 03:25.370
You can combine the steps, WP core download double ampersand, WPK or config after config.

03:25.370 --> 03:33.800
You need to provide the database name the database user then the double ampersand WP core install,

03:33.800 --> 03:38.330
followed by the variables related to the core install.

03:38.480 --> 03:42.290
Installing a secure WordPress site will look like this.

03:45.640 --> 03:53.950
They are the commands WP Core Download all on its own WP core config database, name database, user

03:53.950 --> 04:01.110
database pass all randomly generated the database prefix randomly generated you r-al.

04:01.230 --> 04:08.290
I'll use the w w w the title enclosed in apostrophes admin user.

04:08.440 --> 04:10.150
Look at the admin user.

04:10.180 --> 04:12.580
It's not admin, it's not your name.

04:12.850 --> 04:17.470
It's randomly generated the same with the password.

04:17.500 --> 04:21.550
The admin email is simply queries at the domain name.

04:21.580 --> 04:27.160
As I've mentioned before, you can combine these commands, WPK or download.

04:27.280 --> 04:35.920
There are no variables to type after download lever space double ampersand WP core config double hyphen

04:36.280 --> 04:40.540
db name equals database name the same for the user.

04:40.540 --> 04:51.970
The password and the prefix double ampersand WP call instore double hyphen u rl equals http w w w dot

04:52.180 --> 04:55.810
followed by the rest of the options that you need to supply.

04:57.690 --> 05:01.950
There are no configuration files for us to edit in this lecture.
