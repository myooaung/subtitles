00:19.950 --> 00:27.000
In computing terms, a firewall is a software or hardware based network security system that controls

00:27.000 --> 00:33.330
the incoming and outgoing network traffic by analyzing the data packets and determining whether they

00:33.330 --> 00:35.250
should be allowed through or not.

00:35.430 --> 00:39.780
This is based on an applied rule set in easy terms.

00:39.900 --> 00:46.870
A firewall is simply a filter that checks packets or requests coming into or out of your server.

00:46.890 --> 00:53.800
We are going to lock the server down and only open the ports that are absolutely necessary.

00:53.850 --> 00:57.030
We are going to open the following ports on our server.

00:57.030 --> 01:06.470
S.H., which is Port 282 HTTP Port 80 https, which is Port 443 and Paing on a Linux server.

01:06.630 --> 01:10.230
The firewall is managed by the utility IP tables.

01:10.260 --> 01:16.830
IP tables allows you to create rules to manage the traffic coming from or coming to your server.

01:16.860 --> 01:23.610
Unfortunately, creating IP table rules is an error prone task that can become complex.

01:23.820 --> 01:27.450
Due to this, we are going to make use of an IP tables.

01:27.450 --> 01:31.710
A rapper called Uncomplicated Firewall, or UFW.

01:31.710 --> 01:36.890
UFW makes adding firewall rules to your server a simple task.

01:36.900 --> 01:39.230
Please ensure you are logged into your server.

01:39.240 --> 01:43.710
All commands related to UFW by administrative commands.

01:43.710 --> 01:50.460
You need to use SUDA prior to typing the command to confirm if UFW is installed.

01:50.460 --> 01:57.000
You need to type sudo UFW status verbose status inactive.

01:57.210 --> 02:04.950
If you receive the message command not found, you would need to install UFW to install UFW sudo ept.

02:04.950 --> 02:06.690
We are using our package manager.

02:06.690 --> 02:09.120
What do we want to do with the package manager?

02:09.120 --> 02:14.250
We want to install the name of the package we want to install is UFW.

02:14.640 --> 02:17.280
UFW is already the newest version.

02:17.280 --> 02:23.670
I've not come across any Ubuntu twenty point zero for server release that does not contain the package

02:23.670 --> 02:24.480
UFW.

02:24.570 --> 02:28.470
Now we need to set up what are called the default policies.

02:28.650 --> 02:36.070
The default policies are to deny all incoming connections and allow all outgoing connections.

02:36.300 --> 02:41.910
This means anyone trying to reach our server will not be able to connect to our server.

02:41.910 --> 02:47.910
And at the same time, any package that we have installed on our server would be able to connect to

02:47.910 --> 02:49.230
the outside world.

02:49.330 --> 02:51.870
So now we must set up this default policy.

02:51.900 --> 02:59.310
The default policy denies all incoming requests to our server and allows all outgoing requests from

02:59.310 --> 03:01.590
our server sudo UFW.

03:01.590 --> 03:05.700
We are setting up the default policy default we want to deny.

03:05.700 --> 03:07.080
And what do we want to deny?

03:07.110 --> 03:12.690
All incoming connections sudo UFW default deny incoming.

03:13.110 --> 03:18.930
Now we need to sit the outgoing policy sudo UFW default.

03:18.930 --> 03:20.400
Allow outgoing.

03:22.520 --> 03:29.540
Those are our default rules, allow all outgoing connections, deny all incoming connections, but there's

03:29.540 --> 03:36.440
a problem with that policy servers need to respond to incoming requests from outside users.

03:36.470 --> 03:43.430
We want to be able to access to our server on Port 20 to our server, must respond and allow us to connect

03:43.430 --> 03:44.170
to our server.

03:44.210 --> 03:49.500
Currently, we would not be able to do that because we are denying all incoming connections.

03:49.700 --> 03:56.930
So what we need to do is we need to set up rules that will allow both incoming and outgoing connections

03:56.930 --> 03:57.840
on our server.

03:57.860 --> 04:07.610
We are going to limit this to HTTP and all other ports and services will not respond to requests.

04:07.790 --> 04:10.970
Sudo uff w we want to allow.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.080
What do we want to allow?

04:12.080 --> 04:13.700
Firstly, a search.

04:14.450 --> 04:18.620
We can pressure up Iraqi to repeat the command, remove S.H..

04:18.620 --> 04:23.510
We want to allow htp, you can pressure up Iraqi.

04:23.510 --> 04:33.920
We also want to allow each Tepes so you need to type sudo ufw allow its S.H. Sudo UFW, allow HGP and

04:33.920 --> 04:42.590
Suda UFW allow each Tepes Ping is enabled by default with UFW so we don't need to allow paing.

04:42.590 --> 04:50.280
So now your server will respond to requests for services on those three ports for twenty two point eighty

04:50.330 --> 04:51.560
import for three.

04:51.560 --> 04:55.790
All other ports are closed and will not respond to requests.

04:55.970 --> 04:59.570
Now we need to enable these rules that we have added.

04:59.570 --> 05:08.030
We also need to ensure that UFW will start on a server reboot and apply these rules that we have set.

05:08.180 --> 05:18.260
In other words, we want our rules to persist after a server reboot sudo UFW and we want to enable command

05:18.260 --> 05:21.310
may disrupt existing S.H. connections.

05:21.320 --> 05:22.850
Proceed with operation.

05:22.850 --> 05:27.230
Yes, firewall is active and enabled on system startup.

05:31.350 --> 05:39.960
When we started setting up our firewall, we typed sudo UFW status, verbose status, active default,

05:39.960 --> 05:46.860
deny incoming, allow outgoing board to any to allow in port at allow in port forfour three.

05:47.100 --> 05:48.020
Allow in.

05:48.030 --> 05:49.330
Those are our rules.

05:49.560 --> 05:57.210
Now we need to confirm that these rules will persist after a server reboot to reboot your server sudo

05:57.210 --> 06:02.400
reboot connection to close by remote host connection to closed.

06:02.550 --> 06:08.270
Give your server a few minutes to reboot and you can log into your server using your alias in my case,

06:08.270 --> 06:12.740
SSL, which opened to enter passphrase to unlock my private key.

06:12.900 --> 06:20.580
I'm going to type clear pressure up Iraqi until you find the command to do UFW status, verbose status,

06:20.580 --> 06:21.630
active ports.

06:21.630 --> 06:24.360
Twenty two and 443 allow in.

06:24.360 --> 06:29.910
So our firewall rules have persisted after a reboot for the purposes of this course.

06:30.090 --> 06:32.940
That's the firewall configuration taken care of.
