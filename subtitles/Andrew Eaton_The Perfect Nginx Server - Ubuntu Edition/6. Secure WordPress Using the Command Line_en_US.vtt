Step number six involves securing your WordPress site, using the command line, the quickest and easiest

00:11.370 --> 00:17.970
way of accomplishing this is to add your new site to the WordPress ownership and permissions script

00:18.000 --> 00:22.800
we created earlier CD You Need to change to your home directory.

00:23.040 --> 00:26.810
A listing will display the WP permissions script.

00:26.820 --> 00:29.140
You can open that file using Nano.

00:29.190 --> 00:36.810
The first five lines referred to the first site we created on the server, in my case WPEC ally dot

00:36.810 --> 00:37.230
com.

00:37.230 --> 00:45.360
All you need to do is repeat the same five lines underneath, changing the domain name where necessary.

00:45.390 --> 00:47.150
So sudo own.

00:47.160 --> 00:53.010
I change WPC Allai to equip death for the following four find commands.

00:53.160 --> 00:56.760
I've changed WPC Allai to web dev.

00:56.760 --> 01:02.270
Once you've done that you can exit neno saving your changes to the permissions script.

01:02.280 --> 01:08.780
I want a wide listing of the VA w w w mac web dev public html directory.

01:08.850 --> 01:10.020
No, just the permissions.

01:10.020 --> 01:13.790
If I look at indexed it is six six four.

01:13.830 --> 01:15.930
Read, write, read, write, read.

01:15.960 --> 01:22.680
I'm still in my home directory to run our permissions script period forward slash followed by the name

01:22.680 --> 01:23.340
of the script.

01:25.720 --> 01:34.530
If I lost the contents of public e-mail after running the stripped naked index, it is six four for

01:34.570 --> 01:36.740
Reed, right, Reed Reed.

01:36.790 --> 01:43.470
You need to change to your var w w w site public underscore html directory.

01:43.630 --> 01:48.670
You need to open the WP hyphen config file using Nenna.

01:48.670 --> 01:50.710
You can scroll to the end of the file.

01:50.720 --> 01:59.590
We need to add the allow direct updating without FPP as well as we need to disable the editing of themes

01:59.590 --> 02:02.550
and plugins using the built in editor.

02:02.560 --> 02:09.100
You can Xanana saving your changes to the WP hyphen conflict peafowl.
