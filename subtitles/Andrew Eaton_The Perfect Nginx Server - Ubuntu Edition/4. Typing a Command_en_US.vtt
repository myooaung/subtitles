00:18.140 --> 00:26.150
In this section, I'm going to show you how you type a command and we will look at flags or options

00:26.480 --> 00:28.190
for a particular command.

00:28.220 --> 00:35.510
We will also look at files and directories with relation to case sensitivity.

00:35.540 --> 00:40.220
Most importantly, we will look at navigating the file system.

00:42.350 --> 00:44.510
Using terminal is easy.

00:44.540 --> 00:48.130
All you do is type the command and press enter.

00:48.320 --> 00:55.490
If a particular command has an option or flag you would like to use, you leave a space, add the flag

00:55.640 --> 01:02.570
and then press enter the flag or option is normally preceded by a IFN.

01:02.570 --> 01:07.730
A flag is used to change the way a command is executed.

01:09.680 --> 01:20.480
A few pointers about files and directories, any file or directory that starts with a period is a hidden

01:20.480 --> 01:23.420
file or directory in Lennix.

01:23.420 --> 01:26.040
Extensions are not needed.

01:26.090 --> 01:29.540
They are used, but they are not needed.

01:29.570 --> 01:36.330
Please be aware of case sensitivity regarding directory names and file names.

01:36.350 --> 01:38.960
If you look at the examples we have used.

01:38.990 --> 01:45.820
Hello, Dotty on a Linnik system, those five names are different files.

01:45.860 --> 01:51.790
If you are using windows, those five names refer to the same file.

01:51.800 --> 01:58.050
When you type a command, all commands are typed in lower case.

01:58.100 --> 02:01.670
The exception is when adding flags.

02:01.670 --> 02:06.050
Some options need to be typed in upper case.

02:07.520 --> 02:10.280
I now want to introduce you to the L.

02:10.280 --> 02:12.020
S command, the L.

02:12.020 --> 02:17.050
S command is the most widely used of all the commands.

02:17.300 --> 02:21.580
It is used to list the contents of a directory.

02:21.620 --> 02:31.910
There are two flags that get used frequently, and they are L and A the flag and will display all files,

02:31.910 --> 02:34.490
including hidden files.

02:34.520 --> 02:39.550
E hyphen L flag will give you a long or wide listing.

02:39.590 --> 02:42.560
Flags can also be combined.

02:42.560 --> 02:49.370
You can combine a wide listing with all files by adding hyphen a l.

02:49.370 --> 02:52.760
It doesn't matter the order of the flag.

02:52.760 --> 02:58.550
You could type it as ellis' hyphen l-a or ifn a l.

03:03.790 --> 03:13.090
All you do is type the command in this case is to list and press enter if you want to add an option

03:13.090 --> 03:19.030
or flag to the command, you top the command hyphen, followed by the flag.

03:19.060 --> 03:20.940
In this case hyphen.

03:20.980 --> 03:31.120
Hey, another variation using a different flag this time hyphen El you can combine Flagg's hyphen l

03:31.300 --> 03:41.620
a less hyphen a hyphen l they do not need to be typed separately combined they I used a first if I use

03:41.620 --> 03:49.000
tell and then a exactly the same result do not type commands in uppercase.

03:49.030 --> 03:52.420
All commands are to be typed in lowercase.

03:52.540 --> 04:01.540
Some flags are required to be typed in uppercase, a different command this time clear top to command

04:01.810 --> 04:05.650
if you need to add a flag hyphen followed by the flag.

04:05.800 --> 04:11.530
I've been using the Ellis Command, which is our last command.

04:11.560 --> 04:18.210
We will look at what information the Ellis' command is displaying to you shortly.

04:18.580 --> 04:22.540
All commands come with a built in help system.

04:27.720 --> 04:35.520
To access a commands boulting help you top man, followed by the command, the manual for that particular

04:35.520 --> 04:42.840
command will give you a description of the command as well as a listing of the flags that can be used

04:43.230 --> 04:47.760
with that particular command to quit Priscu.

04:48.360 --> 04:52.220
Some commands do not have a manual effort.

04:52.230 --> 04:54.950
Top man followed by Nenna.

04:55.110 --> 05:01.410
I have opened the manual for the editor NENO to quit KUB.
