WEBVTT

00:14.840 --> 00:19.290
In this section, we are going to set up CloudFlare in order to set up CloudFlare.

00:19.310 --> 00:22.430
You need to sign up for a CloudFlare account.

00:22.580 --> 00:24.810
I'm not going to go through the procedure.

00:24.830 --> 00:29.060
It's something you can do once you've created your CloudFlare account.

00:29.090 --> 00:35.720
You need to change your name servers with your domain registrar to those which CloudFlare have given

00:35.720 --> 00:36.050
you.

00:36.050 --> 00:43.240
An optional step is to add the CloudFlare plug in to your WordPress site as of July 2019.

00:43.250 --> 00:45.650
This plugin hasn't been updated for a while.

00:45.680 --> 00:48.680
Proceed with caution regarding the CloudFlare plugin.

00:48.980 --> 00:55.910
Implementing CloudFlare on a site after completing the course requires no further configuration on the

00:55.910 --> 00:56.480
server.

00:56.690 --> 01:01.560
What we need to do is fix the issue of CloudFlare IP addresses.

01:01.580 --> 01:07.760
We want your visitors IP address to appear in the log files and not CloudFlare IPS.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
CloudFlare is acting as a reverse proxy.

01:11.180 --> 01:16.040
That means you will only see the CloudFlare IP addresses in your log files.

01:16.280 --> 01:17.310
This is a problem.

01:17.480 --> 01:25.220
If any of your Web applications needs the originating IP of the visitor, it will not have the visitors

01:25.220 --> 01:26.050
IP address.

01:26.060 --> 01:29.680
It will have the CloudFlare IP address instead.

01:29.960 --> 01:32.030
This can create many issues.

01:32.240 --> 01:36.470
For example, fail to ban will not be able to ban the visitors IP.

01:36.470 --> 01:39.110
It will ban the CloudFlare IP.

01:39.140 --> 01:46.790
CloudFlare includes the visitors IP address in the ex forwarded for header and the CEF connecting IP

01:46.790 --> 01:47.240
header.

01:47.270 --> 01:52.340
You can use these headers to restore the originating IP address of your visitor.

01:52.490 --> 02:01.250
The ancient X module HTP real IP is included by default with almost all versions of Ingenix.

02:01.430 --> 02:05.900
It's confirmed that that particular module has been installed on our server.

02:06.060 --> 02:12.740
If I type the command engine X, hyphen V two greater than ampersand one, I then use grep to search

02:12.740 --> 02:19.760
for the module HTP real IP module with HTP real IP module.

02:19.760 --> 02:27.080
So the version of Engine X that we have installed on our server was compiled with the HTP real IP module

02:27.230 --> 02:29.110
for the new course updates.

02:29.120 --> 02:37.010
I'm going to create a new include directory in the Engine X directory called Includes With CloudFlare.

02:37.040 --> 02:39.270
We need to create an include file.

02:39.290 --> 02:43.280
I'm going to call the include file CloudFlare Dot Seo in F.

02:43.280 --> 02:48.590
You can include this file in the HTTP or server contexts.

02:48.770 --> 02:52.850
If it's in the HTTP context, it will be applied to all your sites.

02:53.060 --> 02:58.400
In the server context, it will be applied to a specific site in the cloud.

02:58.410 --> 03:03.980
Vedat Seo NFR will contain the list of CloudFlare IP addresses.

03:04.130 --> 03:10.320
We will then use the engine exit real IP to get the client's address.

03:10.340 --> 03:16.670
Now what we need to do is in your home directory we need to create an additional directory.

03:16.700 --> 03:19.220
That directory we are going to call CloudFlare.

03:19.340 --> 03:22.280
In that directory, we are going to create a bash script.

03:22.280 --> 03:25.040
I'm simply going to call it CFT Dot S.H..

03:25.220 --> 03:32.720
That script will be responsible for populating the CloudFlare Dot Seo in a file with the CloudFlare

03:32.750 --> 03:34.040
IP addresses.

03:34.070 --> 03:40.790
We are going to create a current job that will run the CFO Dot S.H. script three times a week that will

03:40.790 --> 03:47.470
ensure that our server has the correct list of CloudFlare ipis at all time.

03:47.570 --> 03:57.440
Here is the contents of CFT S.H. Use Kerl and grab the IP the full and IPV six IP addresses from the

03:57.440 --> 03:58.520
CARDPLAYER site.

03:58.670 --> 04:00.650
Then insert the directive.

04:00.650 --> 04:07.610
Set real IP from followed by the IP address for each of the IPS from the list.

04:07.730 --> 04:14.300
When a client visits your site, the client's IP address will be used due to the real IP header getting

04:14.300 --> 04:18.440
the IP from the CEF connecting IP header.

04:18.440 --> 04:24.620
The CFTC script needs to be made executable and to prevent accidental deletion.

04:24.620 --> 04:26.900
Add an immutable but to the file.

04:26.900 --> 04:32.970
Using the change attribute to command, you will need to reload Engine X after updating the cloud the

04:32.990 --> 04:33.950
IP addresses.

04:34.100 --> 04:36.590
So an additional script needs to be created.

04:36.650 --> 04:40.130
I'll call it engine x underscore reload dot S.H..

04:40.310 --> 04:47.090
The contents will simply be sys ctrl reload engine X, give the script executable permissions and to

04:47.090 --> 04:55.160
prevent accidental deletion add and immutable but to the file using chapter and change to the XY Engine

04:55.160 --> 04:56.120
X directory.

04:56.210 --> 04:59.060
I already have the includes directory.

04:59.060 --> 05:05.270
I created the includes directory when I completed the lecture on rate limiting so you can change to

05:05.270 --> 05:06.650
the includes directory.

05:06.680 --> 05:14.160
We need to create a file CloudFlare Dot Seo and if sudo touch CloudFlare dot seo in f the.

05:14.310 --> 05:22.140
All is owned by the user route, the group route, it's permissions 64 for the owner route can write

05:22.140 --> 05:28.500
to the file so we don't need to change the ownership or permissions of the file can change to your home

05:28.500 --> 05:30.790
directory, your home directory.

05:30.840 --> 05:33.920
We need to make a directory called CloudFlare.

05:33.990 --> 05:37.250
You can name change to the CloudFlare directory.

05:37.410 --> 05:44.640
We want to create a script neno s.f., dot, S.H. attached to this lecture you will find a PDF, the

05:44.640 --> 05:49.350
script CFT DSH you will find the contents in that PDF.

05:49.650 --> 05:54.810
You can close NENO saving your change just to see if not a search.

05:54.960 --> 06:04.410
We need to give CFT search executable permissions mod plus X followed by the filename we need to set

06:04.410 --> 06:05.250
and immutable.

06:05.250 --> 06:15.600
But on that file to prevent accidental deletion sudo change attribute a ttr plus I CFT search we need

06:15.600 --> 06:17.790
to create a second script file.

06:17.820 --> 06:26.850
Ingenix underscore reload dot is etch the contents of which is simply system ctrl reload Ingenix you

06:26.850 --> 06:29.820
can close neno saving your changes.

06:29.820 --> 06:38.250
Give Ingenix reload executable permissions siegmund plus x set and immutable but on Ingenix reload sudo

06:38.250 --> 06:45.120
sujata plus filename for use the katka bound to view the contents of a file the path to the file CloudFlare

06:45.120 --> 06:52.830
dot seo in if the file is black sudo period forward slash followed by the filename its use the cat command

06:52.830 --> 06:54.660
and view the contents of CloudFlare.

06:55.320 --> 07:01.540
They are the CloudFlare IP addresses set real IP from the IP address right at the bottom.

07:01.560 --> 07:02.730
Real IP header.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.190
See if connecting IP.

07:06.240 --> 07:10.950
Let's run our second script sudo period forward slash, Ingenix, reload.

07:13.020 --> 07:22.050
Now we need to sit across a job to run the CFTC script three times a week and half an hour later, reload

07:22.260 --> 07:23.100
Ingenix.

07:28.350 --> 07:38.720
Sudo crosstab hyphen e, this is a root crosstab, you must use sudo I'll select one NENO as my editor

07:39.180 --> 07:40.290
we need to create a root.

07:40.290 --> 07:46.680
Cronon Sudo crosstab hyphen E at midnight on the first, third and fourth days.

07:46.770 --> 07:53.280
I want to run the script, see if Dot S.H. 30 minutes later I want to run the script.

07:53.280 --> 08:01.440
Ingenix underscore reload dot S.H. There are two Crunch's minutes zero hours zero midnight Dave the

08:01.440 --> 08:05.900
week one three five past to the best interpretor path to the script.

08:05.910 --> 08:14.190
I'd like to run home Andrew Card CFT DSH and we're going to redirect any mail from scran to slash dev

08:14.190 --> 08:14.640
slash.

08:14.640 --> 08:21.480
Now the second krod is going to run minutes thirty hours zero thirty minutes after the first GrÃ¶nholm

08:21.480 --> 08:31.380
Andrew CloudFlare Ingenix underscore reader dot isec you can exit neno saving your changes sudo crosstab

08:31.530 --> 08:34.440
Halfon L will list the two kraja.

08:34.920 --> 08:37.740
I've changed to my NPC Engine X directory.

08:37.770 --> 08:45.360
I then want to open the file engine x dot com and if using neno in the H TTP context I'm going to scroll

08:45.360 --> 08:47.760
down to under the GS settings.

08:48.090 --> 08:55.380
If I want to apply the CloudFlare real IP to all the sites on the server, I include the Cloud 3.0 in

08:55.380 --> 09:03.420
file in that HTP context of engine Eckstut SEO and if I have a few sites on the server and I'm only

09:03.420 --> 09:09.740
going to use CloudFlare on one of the sites, so I'll comment to include direct in engine X.com in F

09:09.750 --> 09:13.890
and add that directive in the site's Engine X server Bluck.

09:25.390 --> 09:31.990
In the Etsy engine sites available directory, you can open your sites, engine X configuration file

09:31.990 --> 09:32.830
using Nano.

09:36.430 --> 09:43.450
In the server context, you can add include path to cloud dot com in if that particular directive will

09:43.450 --> 09:47.680
then be applied only to this particular site.

09:47.830 --> 09:53.080
I want to point out that you have a lot of configuration choices when it comes to CloudFlare.

09:53.590 --> 09:56.890
Read the documentation that Kallaugher offers.

09:56.890 --> 09:59.070
Their documentation is very good.

09:59.350 --> 10:02.440
Don't blindly start enabling options.

10:02.620 --> 10:07.420
You could end up breaking your site, enable one option, test your site.

10:07.570 --> 10:11.350
Everything work perfectly, enable the next option, test your site.

10:11.530 --> 10:12.280
Does it work?

10:12.460 --> 10:15.340
In this lecture, we implemented CloudFlare.
