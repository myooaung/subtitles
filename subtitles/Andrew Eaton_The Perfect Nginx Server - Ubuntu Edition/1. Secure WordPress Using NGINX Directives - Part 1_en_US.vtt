Please check the resources section of this lecture.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.700
There is a PDF download available.

00:18.260 --> 00:24.590
In this lecture, we are going to secure WordPress using various Ingenix directives.

00:24.620 --> 00:30.710
We are going to be working with we are going to be working with three configuration files in this lecture

00:30.830 --> 00:36.830
engine, Eckstut SEO in F, then we are going to be working with your domains.

00:37.010 --> 00:38.660
Virtual host file.

00:38.690 --> 00:42.550
In my case, it's WPEC ally dot com.

00:42.560 --> 00:47.300
We are also going to be editing the dot Besch or C file.

00:47.300 --> 00:51.860
The dot Benghazi file is located in your home directory.

00:52.010 --> 00:59.090
The commands in this lecture, apart from, you know, to open various configuration files, Sudo Ingenix

00:59.090 --> 01:08.780
hyphen T to test the configuration and sys ctrl reload Ingenix to reload the engine X configuration.

01:08.990 --> 01:16.850
Before we get to securing WordPress using engine X, I want to discuss a Besch alias with you so far

01:16.850 --> 01:25.130
throughout the course to test the engine X configuration you've been typing sudo Ingenix hyphen t you

01:25.130 --> 01:27.880
can make use of Abeche alias.

01:28.040 --> 01:38.690
So instead of typing Suja engine X hyphen T you could type in G.T. typing LGT would run sudo Ingenix

01:38.690 --> 01:39.650
hyphen T.

01:39.650 --> 01:41.860
It's simply a shortcut.

01:41.930 --> 01:51.200
Another example to reload engine X sudo sys ctrl reload Ingenix instead of having to type that out each

01:51.200 --> 01:51.710
time.

01:51.710 --> 02:02.930
If you created a Abeche alias in are to run Suda system ctrl reload Ingenix you could type in G or the

02:02.930 --> 02:06.530
Besh or C file is found in your home directory.

02:06.530 --> 02:16.280
We will open it using Nannar to create an alias you type alias leave a space followed by the shortcut

02:16.280 --> 02:22.270
you would like to use an equal sign apostrophe type the command apostrophe.

02:22.280 --> 02:25.010
We will create three shortcuts.

02:25.010 --> 02:32.690
One to test the engine X configuration, the next one to reload engine X and the third one to restart

02:32.840 --> 02:33.800
the P.

02:34.130 --> 02:36.440
If rpm in your home directory.

02:36.440 --> 02:42.230
Alice I found a there is the Besh or C file a long listing.

02:42.230 --> 02:45.500
The ownership is your user, your user.

02:45.500 --> 02:51.200
You don't need to use sudo neno period Besch or C.

02:51.350 --> 02:54.530
You can scroll down until you get to the section.

02:54.530 --> 02:57.200
Some more ellis' aliases.

02:57.200 --> 03:00.830
We are going to add our aliases in the section.

03:01.250 --> 03:08.600
So you type alias o alias is going to be in T equals apostrophe.

03:08.630 --> 03:10.700
What command do we want to run with.

03:10.700 --> 03:17.180
The alias NJT Suja Engine X hyphen T you can add the next two lines.

03:17.210 --> 03:27.510
Alias Engy are apostrophe Suda system ctrl reload Ingenix apostrophe will add one additional alias if

03:27.530 --> 03:34.790
pm or we will use that to restart P if pm you can exit.

03:34.790 --> 03:43.730
No, no saving your changes to enable the changes that you've made to the Benghazi file you type source

03:43.910 --> 03:50.270
told indicating your home directory followed by the file name which is Besch our C.

03:50.300 --> 03:59.870
So any stage if I want to reload the Ingenix configuration, all I need type is in g t followed by my

04:00.110 --> 04:07.850
password that will speed up testing the Ingenix configuration as well as restarting Engine X tremendously.
