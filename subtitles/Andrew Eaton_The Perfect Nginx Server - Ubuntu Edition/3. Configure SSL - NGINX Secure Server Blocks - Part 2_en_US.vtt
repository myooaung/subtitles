00:12.750 --> 00:20.100
Please ensure you are in the Etsy Ingenix directory inside Etsy Ingenix.

00:20.130 --> 00:27.250
We are going to create a new directory, the directory we can call SSL.

00:27.450 --> 00:31.530
You can then change to the SSL directory.

00:37.240 --> 00:43.150
Firstly, we need to set up the Diffie Hellman configuration settings.

00:59.460 --> 01:09.360
Sudo Open is d.H Parum, we are going to use two zero for eight bots and we would like a file to be

01:09.360 --> 01:13.900
created called d.H Parum DOT PCM.

01:14.220 --> 01:15.830
This may take a while.

01:15.960 --> 01:19.830
Just let it run until it finishes.

01:25.170 --> 01:36.090
A listing of the Etsy Ingenix SSL directory will display the file D.H Perram DOT p.m. inside the SSL

01:36.090 --> 01:36.780
directory.

01:37.140 --> 01:40.430
We need to create two files.

01:40.620 --> 01:48.600
The first file we need to create will contain the SSL directives for a particular site.

01:48.810 --> 01:52.740
Sudo Touch, followed by the file name SSL.

01:52.860 --> 02:04.160
Underscore the site name Dout Seo and if that file will contain the directors for the site WP Seelie

02:04.170 --> 02:09.330
dot com, we then going to create another file called Izell.

02:09.720 --> 02:20.970
All sites dot seo in f this file will contain the global SSL directives that can be used for any site

02:21.060 --> 02:23.250
that you configure on your server.

02:23.400 --> 02:31.350
It's open the SSL underscore WPEC allai dot com dot seo nfr using nano.

02:34.430 --> 02:43.640
Inside our sites SSL file, you need to provide three directives, the SSL certificate, the SSL certificate

02:43.640 --> 02:48.640
key, as well as the SSL trusted certificate.

02:48.860 --> 02:57.270
The post was displayed to us when we created these files using third party slash ATC.

02:57.680 --> 03:04.300
Let's encrypt live, followed by the domain name slash the file name.

03:04.490 --> 03:10.970
So after adding these three directives, you can close and know saving your changes.

03:14.230 --> 03:19.650
Now we need to open the global SSL file using NENO in.

03:34.620 --> 03:43.710
The resources section I've given you the directives to add to this particular file, the one directive

03:44.160 --> 03:55.500
SSL Diffie Heldman parameters, followed by the path to the D.H Perram DOT PCM file, you can exit saving

03:55.770 --> 03:56.930
your changes.

03:56.940 --> 04:02.070
I'd like you to open those sites dashboard using your browser.

04:02.280 --> 04:06.900
For now, I would like you to go to settings general to entries.

04:07.050 --> 04:13.800
I would like you to be aware of the WordPress address and the WordPress site address.

04:13.980 --> 04:25.860
When we created our site, I specified the URL as htp w w w dot followed by my domain name.

04:26.130 --> 04:35.470
So the WordPress address and the site address htp w w w dot followed by the domain name.

04:36.690 --> 04:42.900
Now we need to configure Ingenix to display our sites securely.

04:42.990 --> 04:45.270
You can go back one level.

04:45.570 --> 04:50.480
You can then change to the sites available directory.

04:50.880 --> 04:56.310
We want to open our sites configuration file sudo no no.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.770
Followed by the name of your site.

04:58.980 --> 05:04.860
No, I intend to display WPEC Allai over a secure connection.

05:05.040 --> 05:13.620
Only what we need to do is add a new server block server, open up curly bracket, close our curly bracket.

05:13.860 --> 05:22.910
Listen put at the server name WPEC allai dot com w w w dot w pclob dot com.

05:23.280 --> 05:26.670
Then we have the return directive.

05:27.150 --> 05:37.110
What this directive does is it will redirect whatever is specified in the server name directive.

05:37.470 --> 05:46.590
So if somebody's visiting your site types in WPEC yellow dot com, the return directive will redirect

05:46.800 --> 06:00.120
that request from WPEC allai dot com to htp is w w w dot wp seelie dot com the same if somebody types

06:00.120 --> 06:13.320
in w w w dot wpec illi dot com they will be redirected a three or one redirect to h t s w w w dot com.

06:13.560 --> 06:24.210
The dollar request underscore urai is important if somebody requests wpec i dot com slash about you

06:24.210 --> 06:31.920
don't want to redirect them to https w w w dot wpc dot com.

06:32.130 --> 06:42.770
You want to redirect them to https domain name slash about that is what the request you are.

06:42.790 --> 06:43.950
I does.

06:44.310 --> 06:47.550
So that is our nonsecure server block.

06:47.910 --> 06:53.610
Now underneath the new server block we have our old server block.

06:53.850 --> 07:01.950
Now what we do is we modify the old server block to display our site using SSL.

07:02.430 --> 07:05.430
Your first step is to change the port.

07:05.550 --> 07:14.670
It's no longer port eighty, it is port four for three SSL and at the same time to turn on HTP to all

07:14.670 --> 07:21.060
you do is you add H TDP to after SSL the same for the next line.

07:21.270 --> 07:26.790
Replace the eighty with 443 ssl h ttp two.

07:26.790 --> 07:31.170
The rest of the entries remain exactly the same.

07:31.350 --> 07:38.400
Except I would like you to go to where we have server name and underneath server name we are going to

07:38.400 --> 07:40.530
include to files.

07:40.740 --> 07:50.400
The first file will be SSL site name Dot Seo and if we also need to include the global SSL file.

07:50.610 --> 08:01.350
So we have included our site specific SSL configuration file as well as the global SSL directive's SSL

08:01.680 --> 08:04.200
all sites dot seo in.

08:04.250 --> 08:11.490
If you can exit NENO saving your changes, let's test the Ingenix configuration.

08:11.640 --> 08:18.020
The configuration file Syntex is okay, it's restart engine X in G.R..

08:18.240 --> 08:24.330
It's open a new tab in our browser type in our domain name and there is our site.

08:24.510 --> 08:26.580
You will notice the padlock.

08:26.810 --> 08:28.740
Our site is secure.

08:29.160 --> 08:34.020
Our site has now been configured to be displayed as SSL.

08:34.350 --> 08:40.230
Only, let's go to SSL labs, dot com and test our server.

08:55.460 --> 09:04.690
Your site will have an A plus rating, any visitor to your site, if they type in W w w dot WPC allai

09:04.700 --> 09:05.330
dot com.

09:05.370 --> 09:07.800
There will be redirected to H.

09:07.880 --> 09:19.790
Tepes if they typed in WPEC elai dot com without the w w w, they will be redirected to h tepes w w

09:19.790 --> 09:21.300
w dot.

09:21.350 --> 09:29.390
If I open my configuration file wpec allai dot com the return 3001 that is the redirect.

09:29.400 --> 09:39.350
It's a permanent redirect if anybody types in WPEC yellow dot com or w w w dot WPEC yellow dot com they

09:39.350 --> 09:47.600
will be redirected to h t s w w w dot followed by the domain name.

09:47.610 --> 09:52.130
In this lecture we configured the engine x SSL directive's.
