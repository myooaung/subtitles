00:17.760 --> 00:25.050
In this lecture, we are going to move a WordPress site from shared hosting to a VPs moving a site from

00:25.050 --> 00:34.370
a VPs to another VPs is quick, easy and Error-free shared hosting can present you with numerous problems.

00:34.560 --> 00:38.640
Some of the problems occur as hosts modify their control panel.

00:38.640 --> 00:46.770
So much and certain options, which should be there, are no longer available in the steps that we used

00:46.770 --> 00:49.440
to set up an engine X powered site.

00:49.560 --> 00:52.740
Steps one to four are the same.

00:52.740 --> 01:01.590
No matter if you are creating a new site or moving an existing site, step six to 12 are also exactly

01:01.740 --> 01:02.360
the same.

01:02.370 --> 01:06.090
It's step five that is different with a new site.

01:06.090 --> 01:14.310
We would install it using WPC Allai when moving our site from shared hosting to our VPs.

01:14.310 --> 01:17.370
We will not make use of WPEC a lot.

01:17.370 --> 01:20.910
We are going to make use of a plugin called Duplicator.

01:21.030 --> 01:28.020
I'm using duplicator to prevent any problems due to various hosting configurations.

01:28.020 --> 01:32.100
It's free and downloadable from the WordPress repository.

01:32.100 --> 01:36.990
So please go ahead, download and install duplicator.

01:36.990 --> 01:41.310
We will look at creating a backup using duplicator shortly.

01:41.460 --> 01:46.320
The steps you are going to follow using duplicator are as follows.

01:46.350 --> 01:51.810
You are going to create a backup of your existing site using duplicator.

01:51.810 --> 01:56.580
You then need to download the backup files from your shared server.

01:56.610 --> 02:01.490
You then need to upload the backup files to your VPs.

02:01.710 --> 02:09.660
Finally, you need to open the file installer dot IP using your browser to complete the move before

02:09.660 --> 02:17.130
you back up your existing site using duplicator deactivate caching and security plugins.

02:17.280 --> 02:24.030
Once you've downloaded your backup files from your shared server, delete the backup files, uploading

02:24.030 --> 02:27.850
the backup files to your VPs, you will use files.

02:27.850 --> 02:34.740
Then there is a lecture on how you set up files and to upload and download files to and from your server.

02:34.740 --> 02:40.590
Once you've uploaded the files, open installer using your browser.

02:40.590 --> 02:47.880
And don't forget to delete the backup files on your IS when you are done, I'm going to be moving the

02:47.880 --> 02:52.080
site WP Seelie to a different server.

02:52.080 --> 02:59.190
But not only am I moving the site from one server to another, the domain name will also change.

02:59.220 --> 03:07.590
The domain name of the new site will be when web dev, all the contents, all the images of WPC ally

03:07.710 --> 03:10.350
are going to be moved to when whipped.

03:10.380 --> 03:16.650
If you need to log in to your existing site, install and activate a plugin duplicator.

03:16.770 --> 03:21.360
Once you've done that, create new you need to provide a name.

03:21.390 --> 03:24.330
I'm going to call it shared next.

03:24.450 --> 03:30.000
Once the site has been scanned, you are presented with an overview of your site.

03:30.090 --> 03:31.770
You can click on Bould.

03:44.300 --> 03:51.930
At this stage, you can use falsetto and download the installer as well as the zip file, or you can

03:51.930 --> 03:55.830
use your WordPress dashboard and download the files.

04:01.160 --> 04:05.130
So I've downloaded both the installer and the archive.

04:05.240 --> 04:09.580
Now you need to upload those two files to your server.

04:09.710 --> 04:14.280
If you are using a Mac, you can use FCP if you are using windows.

04:14.300 --> 04:18.830
I recommend you use files and upload one file using it.

04:18.840 --> 04:24.920
Keep the other file using files in the name of the file installer.

04:25.760 --> 04:34.910
You'll use a name at the name you gave your server in your config file Kolon pass to your home directory.

04:39.490 --> 04:44.620
The file installer has been copied to our server using file.

04:45.250 --> 04:47.380
I'm going to log in to my server.

04:50.670 --> 04:59.310
In my home directory installer Dot P, the file we uploaded using a all you need to do is drag the second

04:59.310 --> 05:02.610
file to your remote site tab.

05:12.810 --> 05:17.960
We have now uploaded the second file using files and you can close files.

05:18.000 --> 05:24.450
Look, at this stage, please ensure that you have the database credentials that you created for the

05:24.470 --> 05:26.590
site readily available.

05:26.610 --> 05:29.230
We need that information in my text.

05:29.940 --> 05:33.840
My database name, user and password.

05:34.020 --> 05:37.560
You can switch to terminal and please log in to your server.

05:37.710 --> 05:44.640
A listing of your home directory will display installer as well as the Orka file M.V..

05:44.670 --> 05:46.770
We want to move the first file.

05:46.770 --> 05:48.470
We're going to move his installer.

05:48.480 --> 05:52.270
The second file we will move is the archive file.

05:52.290 --> 05:59.150
We are we moving it via W. w. w. domain name public underscore html.

05:59.190 --> 06:04.310
A listing of the public underscore HTML directory will display both files.

06:04.320 --> 06:09.540
I'm going to remove the index not file, which I had in that directory.

06:09.570 --> 06:15.960
I'd like you to go back one level at listing displays the permissions of public HTML.

06:15.990 --> 06:20.550
The ownership is correct, but the permissions seven five five.

06:20.580 --> 06:25.560
The Web server cannot write inside that directory.

06:25.590 --> 06:26.970
Let's go to our browser.

06:26.970 --> 06:31.670
The URL slash installer dot p fail.

06:31.710 --> 06:34.830
If you look where it is failing permissions.

06:34.830 --> 06:36.360
Let's go back to terminal.

06:36.450 --> 06:41.100
You need to give the web server right permissions in the public.

06:41.310 --> 06:47.670
HTML Directory Mod seven seven five public html.

06:47.880 --> 06:52.170
Read, write, execute, read, write, execute, read, execute.

06:52.440 --> 06:57.180
We can go back to our browser, refreshing the page pos pos.

06:57.180 --> 07:00.330
We can accept the terms and conditions and click next.

07:01.630 --> 07:04.420
Now you need to provide the database information

07:07.330 --> 07:13.360
I've provided my database name, my database user, and the password the host is localhost.

07:13.360 --> 07:14.530
The port is correct.

07:14.530 --> 07:16.360
It's test the database.

07:19.850 --> 07:25.100
Success, we can click next, confirm the settings that are correct, yes.

07:30.110 --> 07:37.580
New settings, the euro is correct when, but if the path is correct, the title of the site, I'm going

07:37.580 --> 07:38.480
to change.

07:38.630 --> 07:43.870
Under normal circumstances, you would not change the title options.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.700
I'm going to create a new admin account again.

07:46.700 --> 07:50.360
You would normally not create a new admin account.

07:50.360 --> 07:53.720
You would keep your existing admin account.

07:53.870 --> 07:56.990
The site you URL is correct when whipped.

07:56.990 --> 08:07.190
If the old you URL is WPEC, Allai Duplicator is going to scan the database tables and replace the old

08:07.190 --> 08:10.350
you URL with the new You URL.

08:10.610 --> 08:15.740
The old POS is also correct and we can click next.

08:18.270 --> 08:21.630
Let's look at show report general notices.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.510
Nothing that concerns us, it's Log-in.

08:29.210 --> 08:36.050
The site has been successfully migrated its remove installation files, now it's visit the site, I'm

08:36.050 --> 08:39.230
going to open the site in an incognito window.

08:39.410 --> 08:42.970
Our website is currently undergoing scheduled maintenance.

08:42.980 --> 08:45.650
Its disable a maintenance mode, plug in.

08:52.250 --> 08:55.580
I'm going to flush up cash, it's visit to our site.

09:04.030 --> 09:08.620
And we have successfully moved our site from one server to another.

09:08.650 --> 09:15.940
Now you need to continue with step six to 12, start by securing your site, using the command line

09:15.940 --> 09:19.930
to the final step where you optimize WordPress.

09:19.930 --> 09:26.500
In this lecture, we successfully moved a WordPress site from shared hosting to our VPs.
