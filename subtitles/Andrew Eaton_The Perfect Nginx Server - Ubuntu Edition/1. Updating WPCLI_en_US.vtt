Please check the resources section of this lecture.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.700

00:26.010 --> 00:32.740
In this lecture, we are going to look at how you use WPC Allai to administer your site.

00:32.970 --> 00:37.500
They are no configuration files to be edited in this lecture.

00:37.680 --> 00:44.130
It's important to ensure that you are always using the latest version of WPC Allai.

00:44.160 --> 00:49.210
Updating WPC Allai is straightforward in your home directory.

00:49.230 --> 00:52.680
Create a best script to perform the update.

00:52.890 --> 00:59.370
The contents of the script are exactly the same as when you installed WPC Allai.

00:59.370 --> 01:03.930
I've talked to ensure I am in my user's home directory.

01:04.050 --> 01:08.730
NENO Update WPEC Allai Dot S.H..

01:08.940 --> 01:09.600
The script.

01:09.870 --> 01:16.830
The first line is our Shabangu line, the first command code that ensures you are in your home directory.

01:16.830 --> 01:26.460
The call command is used to download WPEC Allai Mod Command will give WPEC Allai executable permissions

01:26.460 --> 01:31.650
and then we need to move the WPEC alive file into our POS.

01:31.650 --> 01:35.610
You can exit NENO saving your changes to the script file.

01:35.760 --> 01:42.840
You need to give your script executable permissions S.H. Mod plus X followed by the file name.

01:42.870 --> 01:51.540
You can use the command WP double hyphen info to check the currently installed version of WPEC CLIA.

01:51.630 --> 01:55.860
Our weekly version is one point five one.

01:55.890 --> 01:57.810
Let's run our update script.

02:04.970 --> 02:11.600
If I check my version currently installed, it's still at one point five one, I recommend you run the

02:11.600 --> 02:17.420
script at least once a month and immediately after an update to WordPress.
