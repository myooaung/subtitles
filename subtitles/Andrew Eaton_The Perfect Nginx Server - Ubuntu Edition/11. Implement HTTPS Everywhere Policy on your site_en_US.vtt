00:15.070 --> 00:22.320
In this lecture, we are going to ensure that all our site's content is served over Tepes.

00:22.390 --> 00:29.830
We need to ensure that any images and videos that we upload to the WordPress Media Library have a HTP.

00:29.870 --> 00:33.200
Yes, you are all attached to that particular asset.

00:33.250 --> 00:39.760
This will prevent mixed content errors as well as prevent any issues at a later stage when you set up

00:39.760 --> 00:41.780
a content security policy.

00:41.950 --> 00:47.710
Firstly, when you install your site, did you install it as a domain dot com or did you install your

00:47.710 --> 00:50.870
site as w w w dot domain?

00:50.890 --> 00:56.930
It's most important we are going to search and then replace the euro in the database.

00:56.950 --> 01:06.340
We are going to search for HTP and replace it with HTP is the command WP Search Hive and replace HTP

01:06.340 --> 01:07.690
followed by your domain.

01:07.700 --> 01:15.610
You leave a space https followed by your domain, you searching for http domain and replacing it with

01:15.610 --> 01:20.720
https domain before executing the search replace on the database.

01:20.740 --> 01:27.640
It's best to do a dry run, a dry run as a simulated search and replace in my sights media library.

01:27.700 --> 01:29.470
I have one asset, an image.

01:29.500 --> 01:35.200
If I click on the image, the copy link htp, I'm going to upload an additional file.

01:40.870 --> 01:44.730
If I click on the file, the copy link is HTP.

01:44.810 --> 01:51.890
Now, what the WPC Allah commands will do change the URL on those two files to https.

01:51.910 --> 01:59.180
And from this point on, any uploads will not be uploaded as HTP, but rather HTP.

01:59.220 --> 02:05.290
Tepes, you can open terminal and you can change to your site's public underscore HTML directory.

02:07.970 --> 02:11.790
The command is WPE Search, IFN replace.

02:11.810 --> 02:13.280
Now what do we want to search for?

02:19.460 --> 02:26.910
My install you earlier was the naked domain name, I did not specify the domain name as w w w dot.

02:26.930 --> 02:30.080
And what do we want to replace the search term with?

02:34.790 --> 02:38.910
We want to replace it with https, followed by the domain name.

02:38.930 --> 02:42.240
Then you add double hyphen, dry and run.

02:42.260 --> 02:44.810
We want to simulate the search replace.

02:49.450 --> 02:56.500
24 replacement's to be made compressor up, Iraqi to repeat to command, and you can remove, rerun

02:56.650 --> 02:57.790
and press enter.

03:00.380 --> 03:03.490
Success made 24 replacements.

03:03.530 --> 03:08.450
I'm going to reload my sites dashboard, you will need to log in again.

03:13.580 --> 03:17.030
If I click on my image copy link https.

03:18.310 --> 03:22.630
Second image https upload an image.

03:29.850 --> 03:39.300
Click on the image copy link, each to any media that you upload will have a Eurail of HTP is in this

03:39.300 --> 03:39.720
section.

03:39.720 --> 03:43.800
We implemented a HTP is everywhere policy.
