00:00.480 --> 00:05.480
We need to restore the site content, restore the database first.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
We've done that Uncompress, the tofile in your home directory.

00:10.530 --> 00:11.640
We will do that.

00:11.880 --> 00:18.600
You then need to modify WP config with the new database credentials.

00:18.840 --> 00:30.300
You then need to move the contents to var w w w site name public html to uncompress, the taufa to EXIF

00:30.630 --> 00:32.270
followed by the filename.

00:32.400 --> 00:36.450
Then you need to change to the public html directory.

00:36.450 --> 00:40.490
You are compressing this file in your home directory.

00:40.500 --> 00:47.220
It's not c.D slash for it's Kadivar and then follow the path.

00:47.550 --> 00:55.260
We will use NENO to edit WP config to change the database credentials and to move the contents.

00:55.260 --> 01:05.670
We will use M.V. The Move command tor EXIF followed by the filename listing displays a new directory

01:05.670 --> 01:08.910
called VAR Change to the VA directory.

01:09.060 --> 01:13.710
It's not slash for it is just for a listing.

01:13.710 --> 01:22.500
Displays another directory w w w change to that directory listing displays another directory change

01:22.500 --> 01:32.370
to your site name listing displays another directory public HTML change to that directory listing displays

01:32.550 --> 01:34.590
our WordPress files.

01:36.620 --> 01:42.110
Now we need to open WP config and change the database credentials.

01:57.750 --> 02:03.930
Database name, we can copy and paste into WP config, the database user.

02:11.130 --> 02:16.950
And finally, the database password, you can exit NENO saving your changes.

02:16.980 --> 02:26.640
Now we need to move these files and directories from our home directory to slash volle w w w the name

02:26.640 --> 02:28.940
of the site public html.

02:28.950 --> 02:37.640
We have now moved the contents from our home directory to slash for w w w the site name public underscore

02:37.680 --> 02:38.610
html.

02:38.640 --> 02:43.980
If you look at the ownership and the permissions on certain files, it is incorrect.

02:44.010 --> 02:53.430
This is why it is most important at this stage to continue with number six, secure WordPress using

02:53.430 --> 03:00.060
the command line and step seven, secure WordPress using Ingenix Directive's.

03:00.090 --> 03:04.900
Our site has been restored from back up with zero errors in this lecture.

03:04.920 --> 03:10.740
We looked at restoring a site, using the database and site backup files.
