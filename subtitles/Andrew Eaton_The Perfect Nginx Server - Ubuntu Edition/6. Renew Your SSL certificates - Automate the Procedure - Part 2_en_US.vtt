00:17.810 --> 00:24.870
In this lecture, we are going to configure automatic let's encrypt SSL certificate renewal.

00:25.070 --> 00:33.530
It's an important point to remember that all let's encrypt commands are executed with route privileges.

00:33.540 --> 00:36.140
I've already covered some of these commands.

00:36.150 --> 00:38.450
But let me briefly recap.

00:38.450 --> 00:48.770
Do you view all the installed certificates, sudo cert bot certificates to renew all certificates?

00:48.770 --> 00:59.300
And it's important to remember all certificates sudo cert renew double hyphen force and renewal to test

00:59.300 --> 01:06.080
renewal of certificates sudo cert but renew double hyphen dry eye and run.

01:06.260 --> 01:12.770
When you install a certificate or renew a certificate, you must reload.

01:12.950 --> 01:22.610
Ingenix Sudo surfboat certificates will display all certificates as well as the expiry date sudo cert

01:22.610 --> 01:26.770
but renew double hyphen, dry ifx and run.

01:26.780 --> 01:30.140
I'm not going to use the force renewal at this stage.

01:30.150 --> 01:32.480
I'm just testing the renewal.

01:35.180 --> 01:38.630
Congratulations, all renewals succeeded.

01:38.780 --> 01:45.800
There are two additional commands at the stage to switch from the non-routine user, which we are currently

01:45.800 --> 01:50.880
using to the root user, the command is issued hyphen.

01:50.900 --> 01:55.300
You will need to type the password of your user.

01:55.430 --> 02:03.110
Once you've completed working as a user, you simply type exit and you will switch back to your non-routine

02:03.110 --> 02:03.650
user.

02:03.770 --> 02:08.580
We are going to create a route cron jobs and route best scripts.

02:08.600 --> 02:13.480
It makes it much easier to perform these tasks as the route user.

02:13.520 --> 02:21.530
I again want to emphasize that when we run the command to renew our certificates, all the certificates

02:21.530 --> 02:25.070
installed on the server will be renewed.

02:25.220 --> 02:33.740
We are going to create two best scripts as the user, one to renew the certificates and one to reload

02:33.740 --> 02:34.760
Engine X.

02:34.760 --> 02:40.670
The first best script will renew our certificates surfboat renew force renewal.

02:40.820 --> 02:44.210
The second best script reloads Engine X..

02:44.240 --> 02:47.990
We are also going to create two current jobs.

02:48.140 --> 02:52.070
The first cron job will renew our certificates.

02:52.250 --> 02:55.640
The second cron job will reload engine Genex.

02:55.820 --> 03:03.530
We will run the second current job an hour after the first crunch up to the first current job.

03:03.650 --> 03:10.340
We will run at three thirty a.m. on the 14th day of every month.

03:10.520 --> 03:11.750
The second cron job.

03:11.750 --> 03:17.620
We will run at four thirty a.m. on the 14th day of every month.

03:17.630 --> 03:26.480
The path to our shell slash burn slash its edge the command slash route, slash the script name.

03:26.660 --> 03:32.120
We want to redirect the output of this current job to slash dev slash.

03:32.120 --> 03:36.500
Now issue hyphen will allow us to switch to the route user.

03:40.830 --> 03:48.270
If you look at the prompt, it is now a hash sign, not a dollar sign that indicates we are now working

03:48.270 --> 03:50.120
as the root user.

03:50.160 --> 03:54.840
I talked to Command P WD, which is print working directory.

03:54.900 --> 03:58.740
We are currently in the slash root directory.

03:58.770 --> 04:07.500
We are now going to use NENO and create a file called Ali'i Underscore Renew Dot S.H. the contents of

04:07.500 --> 04:12.870
L e renew dot S.H. Firstly our Shabangu line, then the command.

04:12.870 --> 04:18.380
We would like to execute search but we knew double Halfan force renewal.

04:18.390 --> 04:21.350
You can exit saving your changes.

04:22.500 --> 04:29.160
The second script we would like to create neno engy underscore reload dot S.H..

04:29.340 --> 04:32.940
The contents are Shabangu line underneath the command.

04:32.940 --> 04:37.590
We would like to execute system ctl reload Ingenix.

04:37.590 --> 04:46.320
We are executing these commands as the route user we do not need to use can exit saving your changes.

04:46.350 --> 04:54.450
We need to give both of these files executable permissions mod plus X followed by the name of the file.

04:54.600 --> 05:00.600
If we look at the permissions, read, write, execute, read, execute, read, execute, I'm going

05:00.600 --> 05:04.560
to run the l e renew script period.

05:04.560 --> 05:08.310
Forward slash Alerian you dot S.H..

05:16.090 --> 05:19.070
Our certificate has been renewed successfully.

05:19.240 --> 05:27.820
I'm going to run the second script period forward, slash engy, reload, dot S.H. so our scripts execute

05:27.820 --> 05:29.470
without any errors.

05:29.770 --> 05:31.950
I'm going to type the clear command.

05:32.080 --> 05:34.210
Now we need to create the current job.

05:34.450 --> 05:38.750
Crosstab hyphen l will list the jobs for the user.

05:38.890 --> 05:43.980
We don't have any to create a current job for our producer Crosstab Ifni.

05:44.170 --> 05:46.990
It's asking us to select an editor.

05:47.200 --> 05:49.550
We will select number to NENO.

05:49.660 --> 05:52.820
You can scroll down to underneath all the comments.

05:53.050 --> 06:01.690
So our first cron job will renew our certificate's minutes, 30 hours every day of the month, 14 months.

06:01.720 --> 06:03.820
We don't specify a day of the week.

06:03.820 --> 06:04.930
We don't specify.

06:04.990 --> 06:13.630
So on the 14th day of every month at three thirty am the command slash root slash L.E. Underscore Dot

06:13.660 --> 06:14.920
S.H. will run.

06:15.040 --> 06:23.470
The output will be redirected to slash dev slash now, which simply means we will not receive notification

06:23.500 --> 06:27.400
that this particular job has run our second Chron minutes.

06:27.400 --> 06:30.500
Thirty hours for the day of the month 14.

06:30.520 --> 06:34.240
We don't specify a month and we don't specify the day of the week.

06:34.240 --> 06:41.940
So for thirty a.m. on the 14th day of every month, the script engy underscore reload will run.

06:41.950 --> 06:45.160
That's all there is to configuring a current job.

06:45.190 --> 06:50.380
You can Xanana saving your changes crosstab ifn l.

06:50.410 --> 06:58.090
There are two current jobs for the route user on the 14th day of every month at three thirty am, we

06:58.090 --> 07:04.930
will force the renewal of all of the certificates installed on the server and our later Ingenix will

07:04.930 --> 07:11.110
reload to enable the new certificates to switch back to the non-routine user.

07:11.110 --> 07:12.490
You top exit.

07:12.640 --> 07:15.880
You can immediately see the change in the prompt.

07:15.880 --> 07:21.070
I recommend you set an alarm for the day after the current job has run.

07:21.070 --> 07:27.280
Check if the certificates were renewed successfully by using sudo cert but certificates.

07:27.460 --> 07:34.330
In this lecture we configured cron jobs to renew our SSL certificates and then to reload Ingenix to

07:34.330 --> 07:35.920
enable the renewal.
