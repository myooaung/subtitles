00:12.630 --> 00:20.100
Now we need to add the buffer's tom out and the foul Handal cash directive's, we are not going to let

00:20.340 --> 00:24.800
the engine X.com NFR with hundreds of directive's.

00:24.810 --> 00:29.110
We are going to make use of the include DirecTV.

00:29.160 --> 00:37.680
What I recommend you do is inside your Ingenix directory is create a new directory where you could store

00:37.680 --> 00:45.060
all of your configuration files sudo mkdir or we want to create a directory.

00:45.210 --> 00:48.300
I'm going to call it global listing.

00:48.660 --> 00:51.450
There is the directory we have just created.

00:51.610 --> 00:53.490
Let's change to that directory.

00:53.490 --> 00:57.210
We can type a local path name to that directory.

00:57.300 --> 00:58.950
The directory is empty.

00:59.080 --> 01:03.480
I'm going to use the touch command and create three files.

01:03.510 --> 01:07.080
Buffer's Dot seo in if I can press that up.

01:07.080 --> 01:15.920
Iraqi remove Buffer's timeouts, prisma up Iraqi again, remove timeouts and then file andal cache.

01:16.170 --> 01:22.710
A long listing will show us the three files that we have just created using the touch command.

01:22.710 --> 01:25.710
The size of the files, they are all zero.

01:26.010 --> 01:32.520
So you do no know and we can open Buffer's with all configuration files that you create.

01:32.640 --> 01:34.080
Comment the file.

01:34.080 --> 01:40.560
Well, we can now add our buffer directive's to the buffers dot com NFR.

01:40.590 --> 01:48.510
You will find these directives as well as the values for each one in the companion to this lecture,

01:48.630 --> 01:57.030
you can close NENO saving the changes to buffers dot c0 and if the next file we can open file handle

01:57.030 --> 02:06.060
cache dot c and if the settings for file handle cache engine X will cache one thousand five hundred

02:06.060 --> 02:08.760
files for thirty seconds.

02:08.910 --> 02:18.030
But that excludes any files that haven't been accessed for thirty seconds and only files that have been

02:18.030 --> 02:21.690
accessed five times in that time frame.

02:21.720 --> 02:22.500
You can close.

02:22.500 --> 02:25.000
No, no saving the changes.

02:25.050 --> 02:28.290
It's open the lost file in no time outs.

02:28.290 --> 02:31.020
We have added our timeout directives.

02:31.020 --> 02:34.080
You can exit NENO saving the changes.

02:34.200 --> 02:40.260
So we've created our three files, buffers, file, handle cache and timeouts.

02:40.440 --> 02:44.670
Go back one level and open the main engine X configuration.

02:44.670 --> 02:45.160
File it.

02:45.180 --> 02:47.040
Scroll down to the bottom of the file.

02:47.040 --> 02:48.540
I've added a comment.

02:48.750 --> 02:51.540
Buffer's Tomaz file handle cache.

02:51.690 --> 02:58.350
These directives we are going to add must be added in the HTP context.

02:58.470 --> 03:06.060
Now, are we going to make use of the include directive to use the include directive you type include

03:06.310 --> 03:09.420
the Newtok, the path to the file.

03:09.450 --> 03:19.860
So it's include the space global slash buffers, dot com in f semicolon directives end in semicolons.

03:19.860 --> 03:29.590
Now we need to include timeouts, global slash timeouts, botsio in f semicolon hash include global

03:29.640 --> 03:32.370
slash file and all cache.

03:32.370 --> 03:37.710
Semicolon the file handle cash for those directives to work properly.

03:37.710 --> 03:41.460
You need a stable asset environment.

03:41.490 --> 03:46.770
Comment those directives finish setting up your site, add all your content.

03:46.770 --> 03:51.870
Once that's done, come back to this file and uncommented that particular line.

03:51.870 --> 03:58.260
It's pointless having a file handle cash enabled when you are still busy building your WordPress site

03:58.260 --> 04:02.670
control x, you want to exit neno save the changes before we proceed.

04:02.670 --> 04:07.440
Sudo Ingenix ifn t test the configuration syntaxes.

04:07.440 --> 04:09.480
OK test is successful.

04:09.480 --> 04:14.430
To enable the changes we have made, we now need to reload Ingenix.

04:14.850 --> 04:18.030
That's the main engine X config file taken care of.
