WEBVTT

00:00.150 --> 00:03.000
Please check the resources section of this lecture.

00:03.030 --> 00:05.730
There is a PDF download available.

00:18.170 --> 00:24.710
In this lecture, we are going to install the let's encrypt client server, but once you've installed

00:24.710 --> 00:31.760
search bot and created a SSL certificate for your site, you will have the following files, the private

00:31.760 --> 00:35.870
key certificate and the SSL trusted certificate.

00:35.930 --> 00:39.620
The path is the same for all three files.

00:39.800 --> 00:44.770
Etsi Let's encrypt live followed by your site name.

00:44.810 --> 00:48.060
You will not be editing any of those files.

00:48.080 --> 00:57.290
It's important to remember the path to each one of those files with a server you only download from

00:57.290 --> 01:02.200
the official Ubuntu Repository CERT but is an exception.

01:02.210 --> 01:07.970
So we will be adding an additional repository to our server to install cert.

01:07.970 --> 01:11.750
But you would install it as you would any other package.

01:11.770 --> 01:14.540
Atget install cert, but.

01:19.780 --> 01:27.190
We will be using Searsport to install our SSL certificates for 18 zero for you need to add the cert

01:27.190 --> 01:32.380
but repository to your server for 20 zero for do not add the repository.

01:32.380 --> 01:38.660
You install support from the official Ubuntu repository with twenty point zero four.

01:38.680 --> 01:41.940
Update your package list and then run the command sudo app.

01:41.980 --> 01:45.770
Install surfboat with Ubuntu eighteen point zero four.

01:45.820 --> 01:53.530
You need to add the repository, update the package list and then install surfboat to install a certificate.

01:53.680 --> 02:03.820
Sudo cert bot cert only double hyphen webroot hyphen w followed by the path to your site.

02:04.030 --> 02:10.990
In my case it would be var w. w w my site name public html.

02:11.020 --> 02:20.290
Then you add hyphen D followed by the domain name hyphen D followed by w w w dot domain name do not

02:20.290 --> 02:23.850
and unofficial repositories to your server.

02:23.860 --> 02:27.760
It's also called a personal package archive.

02:27.940 --> 02:36.430
The repository that contains the cert book packages is safe to add to your server cert but will verify

02:36.460 --> 02:43.870
ownership of the domain that you are requesting a certificate for by verifying that it can write to

02:43.870 --> 02:46.770
certain directories on your server.

02:46.780 --> 02:50.920
We need to create a directory called Data Well known.

02:51.100 --> 02:55.240
The ownership will be how user and the web server.

02:55.240 --> 03:05.980
The permissions will be seven seven five to create a certificate sudo cert bot cert only double hyphen

03:06.010 --> 03:15.520
webroot hyphen w followed by the path to your site then hyphen D followed by the domain names that you

03:15.520 --> 03:23.770
would like to create certificates for our first step, we add the support repository to our server at

03:23.770 --> 03:26.610
the stage press enter to continue.

03:26.680 --> 03:35.950
Now we need to update the package list not only from the Ubuntu repository but also from the surfboat

03:36.370 --> 03:37.210
repository.

03:41.920 --> 03:47.740
Sudo Atget update now we can install the search bot package.

03:50.410 --> 03:57.430
You Atget install Certa, but there are quite a few packages that are going to be installed.

03:58.140 --> 03:59.340
We want to continue.

04:03.830 --> 04:11.420
Pressure up Iraqi till you get to see you get update backspace, the update while we are busy installing

04:11.420 --> 04:12.210
packages.

04:12.260 --> 04:17.060
Let's check if they are any packages that need to be upgraded immediately.

04:17.060 --> 04:18.470
We can see the message.

04:18.470 --> 04:21.210
The following packages have been kept back.

04:21.230 --> 04:22.680
Do you want to continue?

04:22.790 --> 04:27.440
No pressure up Iraqi and just before upgrade type.

04:27.680 --> 04:29.510
Just upgrade.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.010
We want to continue.

04:35.770 --> 04:41.770
Let's run the dust upgrade command again now we have a message, the following packages were automatically

04:41.770 --> 04:44.530
installed and are no longer required.

04:46.340 --> 04:53.120
Sudo do it or to remove the following packages will be removed.

04:55.720 --> 05:01.930
After running the dust upgrade command, I recommend you reboot your server.

05:02.110 --> 05:05.310
Let's do that and continue after the reboot.

05:05.350 --> 05:07.310
I've logged in to my server.

05:07.330 --> 05:11.490
We need to change to the root directory of our site.

05:11.500 --> 05:18.300
Slash va w w w your site name public underscore html.

05:18.760 --> 05:24.850
We need to make a directory and the directory name is period or dot.

05:25.060 --> 05:34.330
Well hyphen node and lists listing will not display the directory because it is a hidden directory.

05:34.360 --> 05:38.920
Using the hyphen, a flag will display dot well known.

05:39.130 --> 05:47.990
The ownership is my user, my user, my users, the owner and my user is the group owner.

05:48.010 --> 05:56.890
We need to change the ownership of that well known sudo S.H. and the ownership will be your user and

05:57.160 --> 05:58.360
the web server.

06:02.430 --> 06:08.070
Our ownership is now correct, our ownership is correct, and the permissions are correct.

06:08.280 --> 06:13.520
I'm going to type CD to return to my home directory.

06:13.560 --> 06:23.580
Now we want to generate our SSL certificate for our site Sudo CERT, but cert only leave a space double

06:23.580 --> 06:28.370
hyphen followed by Webroot single hyphen w.

06:28.560 --> 06:34.230
Now you specify the path to the web route of your site.

06:40.120 --> 06:52.630
After topping the Webroot I d it is WPEC ally dot com leave a space hyphen d w w w dot followed by the

06:52.630 --> 07:00.040
domain name into email address used for urgent renewal and security notices.

07:10.690 --> 07:16.930
We agree to the terms and conditions, no, we won't share our e-mail address.

07:24.870 --> 07:31.770
Congratulations, your certificate and chain have been saved at followed by the pass, your certificate

07:31.770 --> 07:34.090
will expire in 90 days time.

07:34.290 --> 07:39.090
You have just installed your SSL certificate for your site.

07:39.270 --> 07:42.750
That's how easy it is to use Sorkh.

07:42.750 --> 07:49.110
But if I type sudo bot certificates, it will list the certificates.

07:49.380 --> 07:56.850
Found the following certificates certificate name WPEC ally dot com domains that the certificate is

07:56.850 --> 08:02.970
valid for my naked domain and w w w dot the expiry date.

08:03.180 --> 08:09.390
It's also giving us the path to the certificate and the private key.

08:09.600 --> 08:18.200
Those are two important paths that we will be using when we configure Engine X to use these certificates.

08:18.390 --> 08:27.120
A few additional support commands, sudo search bot certificates will display all the certificates installed

08:27.360 --> 08:33.000
on your server to renew a certificate sudo cert but renew.

08:33.030 --> 08:35.610
I like to use the force renewal.

08:35.610 --> 08:39.840
So once a month I can renew my certificates.

08:39.960 --> 08:44.240
In this lecture we installed and configured cert, but.
