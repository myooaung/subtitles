00:00.150 --> 00:02.950
Please check the resources section of this lecture.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.700
There is a PDF download available.

00:23.200 --> 00:28.340
In this lecture, we are going to look at various tasks that you must perform.

00:28.390 --> 00:34.210
I cannot emphasize enough keep the packages on your server up to date.

00:34.330 --> 00:38.710
The security of your server is of extreme importance.

00:38.740 --> 00:44.080
We've discussed these commands before, but I'm briefly going to recap to update the package list.

00:44.290 --> 00:51.010
So you do get an update to then upgrade the packages based on the package list.

00:51.310 --> 00:56.720
So you do get upgrade if certain packages are being held back.

00:56.770 --> 01:02.830
These are higher level packages that sudo upgrade upgrade cannot upgrade you.

01:02.830 --> 01:06.700
They need to use sudo Atget just upgrade.

01:06.850 --> 01:12.720
Normally after a dust upgrade, you would need to reboot your server.

01:12.730 --> 01:15.780
All you top is sudo reboot.

01:15.820 --> 01:22.060
Finally, when running the upgrade upgrade command, if there is a message that states that they are

01:22.060 --> 01:30.150
unneeded packages to remove unneeded packages, you use sudo Atget auto remove.

01:30.190 --> 01:33.850
There is a good example of a server that has not been taken care of.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.070
15 packages can be updated.

01:36.070 --> 01:42.730
The server also requires a restart of that restart is from a previous upgrade.

01:42.760 --> 01:50.380
So what we do initially is reboot the server, give the server a while to reboot and we can log in again.

01:50.440 --> 01:53.050
The first step, update the package list.

01:53.050 --> 01:55.090
Sudo Atget update.

02:00.270 --> 02:08.030
The next step is to upgrade the packages based on the package list, you get upgrade.

02:08.070 --> 02:11.640
Yeah, we have a few notifications that we need to take note of.

02:11.790 --> 02:16.060
The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required.

02:16.140 --> 02:21.540
We need to use Sudo Atget or to remove to remove those packages.

02:21.570 --> 02:23.990
The following packages have been kept back.

02:24.030 --> 02:28.320
That's telling us that the open VM tools is a higher level update.

02:28.320 --> 02:29.550
We need to run.

02:29.820 --> 02:31.200
Just upgrade.

02:31.230 --> 02:33.630
The following packages will be upgraded.

02:33.780 --> 02:35.430
Yes, we want to continue.

02:42.850 --> 02:49.420
The situation facing us now happens fairly frequently, you are performing an upgrade and what is happening

02:49.420 --> 02:54.350
is on your server, you have a file that has already been modified.

02:54.430 --> 02:58.330
Now you are upgrading the upgrade command is prompting you.

02:58.360 --> 02:59.900
What do you want to do?

02:59.920 --> 03:07.600
Do you want to keep the existing file that is on your server or do you want to replace it with a new

03:07.630 --> 03:08.300
version?

03:08.350 --> 03:13.570
We have not edited that file or made any changes to that particular file.

03:13.630 --> 03:17.710
So in this instance, we can install the package maintainers version.

03:17.740 --> 03:23.890
If, for example, it was an Engine X configuration file, which we have already modified, we would

03:23.890 --> 03:27.480
then keep the local version currently installed.

03:27.520 --> 03:34.180
When this happens and you are unsure, the safest option to choose is to keep the local version currently

03:34.180 --> 03:34.870
installed.

03:38.660 --> 03:46.670
Our exit upgrade command has run, we now need to run, just upgrade to perform a higher level upgrade.

03:52.440 --> 03:58.980
We finally need to run sudo do or to remove to remove unneeded packages.

04:03.720 --> 04:06.600
That's our server updates taking care of.

04:12.200 --> 04:18.480
It's important to check for theme and plugin updates on a daily basis.

04:18.500 --> 04:25.280
A lot of the vulnerabilities associated with WordPress are not from the WordPress core itself.

04:25.280 --> 04:32.360
They are from the themes and plugins that are being used with WordPress when you log into your dashboard

04:32.360 --> 04:33.200
updates.

04:33.230 --> 04:35.690
They are two updates for plugins.

04:35.690 --> 04:37.790
Select all update plugins.

04:41.650 --> 04:43.430
Our plugins have been updated.

04:43.460 --> 04:48.010
If we go back to updates, our themes are also all up to date.

04:48.040 --> 04:52.870
We also have the latest version of WordPress on a daily basis.

04:52.870 --> 04:56.020
Log into your dashboard and select updates.

04:56.350 --> 04:58.930
Now we need to look at site updates.

04:59.140 --> 05:03.440
WordPress core updates refers to updating WordPress itself.

05:03.670 --> 05:09.340
I have already mentioned that we are very strict with the permissions we are using, so any attempt

05:09.340 --> 05:13.000
to upgrade WordPress using the dashboard will fail.

05:13.030 --> 05:17.740
You need to update WordPress using the WordPress command line interface.

05:17.900 --> 05:24.190
When you log into the dashboard and you are notified about a failed update, the procedure is easy.

05:24.220 --> 05:26.530
Open terminal and perform the update.

05:26.740 --> 05:29.680
You need to change to your site's root directory.

05:29.680 --> 05:36.740
The directory of your site will be the public underscore HTML directory to update WordPress is straightforward.

05:36.790 --> 05:38.530
Check the existing version.

05:38.530 --> 05:40.330
WP Code Version.

05:40.330 --> 05:43.510
The Update Command WP Corps Update.

05:43.510 --> 05:44.950
Update the database.

05:44.950 --> 05:48.010
WP Corps Update Hyphen DB.

05:48.040 --> 05:56.680
Then I recommend you restart the FPM Service System Ctrl Restart seven point to IFN if rpm that will

05:56.680 --> 05:58.210
clear the cache.

05:58.210 --> 06:02.170
Finally check the updated version WP core version.

06:02.260 --> 06:09.350
Refresh the dashboard and you have updated WordPress change to your site's public underscore HDMI Directory

06:09.350 --> 06:16.660
WP Call Version five point to point to WP Call Update Success.

06:16.660 --> 06:18.370
WordPress is up to date.

06:18.380 --> 06:25.750
Obviously if there was an update available, WP Seelie will update your version of WordPress to update

06:25.750 --> 06:26.590
the database.

06:26.740 --> 06:33.190
WP Core Update Halfan DB WordPress database already at the latest database version.

06:33.220 --> 06:40.540
Restart FPM Service Sudo System Ctrl Restart seven point two Halfan if rpm.

06:40.750 --> 06:45.640
Finally you can type WPE core version to confirm the upgrade has taken place.

06:50.840 --> 06:57.830
Another task which you need to perform on a monthly basis, possibly even every two months, is to optimize

06:57.830 --> 06:58.640
your memory.

06:58.640 --> 07:04.370
EDB databases do not do this on a daily basis or weekly basis.

07:04.400 --> 07:09.420
We are going to download a script called my Iska Altuna.

07:09.440 --> 07:17.210
Now, my Eskil Altuna will make recommendations to you based on the activity of your database.

07:17.220 --> 07:25.010
For that reason, you need to generate traffic to get accurate and meaningful recommendations.

07:25.070 --> 07:32.210
This is why I've already mentioned to you run the script every 30, 60 or 90 days.

07:32.210 --> 07:33.900
You need traffic.

07:33.920 --> 07:37.730
Otherwise the recommendations will not be accurate.

07:38.000 --> 07:45.950
To implement the MySQL recommendations, we will be editing a configuration file called five zero hyphen

07:45.950 --> 07:57.200
server dot C and if it's location slash UTC my esquibel Maria DB dot seo in F dot D, we are going to

07:57.200 --> 08:05.720
use w get to download the MySQL Altuna script to make running the script easier on our server.

08:05.750 --> 08:13.100
We will give it executable permissions and finally to run the script period forward slash followed by

08:13.280 --> 08:14.660
the script name.

08:14.780 --> 08:17.210
It's Gogia Terminal CD.

08:17.330 --> 08:20.750
Please ensure you are in your home directory.

08:20.930 --> 08:28.070
From the companion attached to this lecture you have the you are able to download the MySQL dot pl script

08:28.070 --> 08:28.810
so it's double.

08:28.840 --> 08:33.230
You get Levett space followed by the download you URL.

08:33.260 --> 08:35.570
The listing will display the script.

08:35.570 --> 08:43.940
We now need to change the permissions mod plus six, followed by the name of the script listing or display.

08:43.940 --> 08:48.530
Read, write x, read, write x, read, write executable.

08:48.650 --> 08:52.520
We are using Marea DB as our database.

08:52.530 --> 08:56.450
Marea DB runs with elevated privileges.

08:56.450 --> 09:03.200
When we run the MySQL Chewiness script, we also need to run it with elevated privileges.

09:03.200 --> 09:06.500
So it's sudo devah space period forward.

09:06.500 --> 09:10.070
Slash my eskil tuner dot p l.

09:14.860 --> 09:22.570
Once my Eskil Tuner's run, you will be presented with a list of recommendations, general recommendations,

09:22.570 --> 09:28.550
as well as variables to adjust the first time you run MySQL Tuna.

09:28.570 --> 09:37.520
You will find that once you've adjusted the variables, a lot of the general recommendations will disappear.

09:37.660 --> 09:38.740
The two are linked.

09:38.860 --> 09:41.350
So what I like to do is select.

09:42.820 --> 09:50.020
Both the general recommendations as well as the variables to adjust and what I do is I paste them into

09:50.020 --> 09:51.070
my text editor.

10:05.770 --> 10:11.650
Once I've pasted the general recommendations, as well as the variables to adjust, I create a section

10:11.650 --> 10:12.640
underneath that.

10:12.670 --> 10:15.420
I just call it Fiverr server entries.

10:15.430 --> 10:21.160
When we look at the variables to adjust, it is query cache size must equal zero.

10:21.160 --> 10:25.890
The temp table size must be greater than 16 megabytes.

10:25.900 --> 10:34.120
The performance schema must be on the, you know, DB log file size should be sixteen megabyte if possible.

10:34.150 --> 10:39.220
Now I need to edit those entries to reflect the recommendations.

10:50.670 --> 10:55.420
So I've edited each of those lines to reflect the recommendations.

10:55.440 --> 10:58.380
There's one more on the general recommendations.

10:58.410 --> 11:03.630
Update your configuration with Schipp name, resolve equals one.

11:03.690 --> 11:07.590
So let's add that to our five server entries.

11:13.050 --> 11:17.800
Now we can select all those lines and copy, let's go back to terminal.

11:17.940 --> 11:26.310
I'm going to type clear we need to change to the relevant directory etsi my Eskil Maria DB dot com and

11:26.310 --> 11:33.780
if dot d we are going to be editing the five zero hyphen server file sudo c.p.

11:33.810 --> 11:42.000
We need to make a copy of the configuration file before you edit the file so you do the name of the

11:42.000 --> 11:45.920
file, followed by the name of the file you would like to create.

11:45.930 --> 11:51.930
Now we can edit the file Sudano five zero hyphen server dot CnF.

11:52.170 --> 11:55.740
You can scroll down to underneath fine tuning.

12:02.090 --> 12:10.620
You can add a hash, my Eskil Tuna, and paste the recommendations that we received from my Eskil Tuna.

12:10.640 --> 12:14.320
Once you've done that, you can exit the file, saving your changes.

12:14.660 --> 12:18.150
My Eskil is running as a service on our server.

12:18.170 --> 12:26.450
You need to restart my Eskil to enable the changes we have made to the five zero hyphen server dot cnf

12:26.450 --> 12:28.430
file back to the home directory.

12:29.480 --> 12:30.810
Do not do this.

12:30.830 --> 12:33.170
I'm doing it as an example.

12:33.170 --> 12:38.720
Sudo period forward slash followed by my iska altuna dot pll.

12:38.810 --> 12:43.430
You'll notice the variables to adjust, query, cache, size and type.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.050
We already changed those.

12:45.230 --> 12:47.180
It's giving us an additional one.

12:47.180 --> 12:51.590
Query cache limit must be greater than one megabyte.

12:58.680 --> 13:02.650
I've added that particular recommendation to the text file.

13:02.670 --> 13:04.140
It's switched back to terminal.

13:04.170 --> 13:11.430
We need to change to the myriad botsio in F directory and then open the five zero hyphen server file.

13:19.760 --> 13:26.450
Go back to our section, my Eskil Tuna, and to query cash limit entry, you can then exit.

13:26.690 --> 13:28.450
Saving your changes.

13:28.460 --> 13:32.650
You need to restart the MySQL service at this stage.

13:32.810 --> 13:34.940
Forget about my Eskil Tuna.

13:34.970 --> 13:42.200
Wait at least 30 days, preferably 60 to 90 days, then run the script again.

13:42.350 --> 13:47.270
In this lecture, we looked at various tasks that you need to perform on your server.
