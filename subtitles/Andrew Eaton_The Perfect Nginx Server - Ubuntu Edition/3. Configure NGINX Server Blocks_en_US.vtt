00:05.190 --> 00:14.310
Step to the second step is to create your site directress, we will use the mkdir command utilizing

00:14.310 --> 00:22.140
the hyphen P flag, the hyphen P flag will create the intermediate directories as required.

00:22.170 --> 00:27.570
You need to change to your slash bar slash w w w directory.

00:27.570 --> 00:32.820
We need to change to the slash va slash w w w directory.

00:32.970 --> 00:41.790
We using the make directory command emcdda or hyphen p the domain name slash public underscore html

00:41.790 --> 00:43.070
slash dot.

00:43.080 --> 00:46.230
Well I've known permission denied.

00:46.350 --> 00:57.600
The reason being the va slash w w w directory is owned by rich w w w the owner is root root so we need

00:57.600 --> 01:02.910
to use the mkdir command with Suda and there is our directory.

01:02.910 --> 01:06.570
The ownership, as you can see is root root.

01:06.660 --> 01:08.640
We need to change the ownership.

01:08.640 --> 01:12.090
So you do own I Fanaa the owner.

01:12.090 --> 01:20.490
We want as our user in my case and the group owner, the web server followed by the POS public HTML,

01:20.700 --> 01:26.280
our user and the web server, well known our user and the web server.
