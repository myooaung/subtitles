00:05.010 --> 00:12.390
In step nine, we will be dealing with the configuration of the secure Ingenix server blocks, the procedure

00:12.390 --> 00:19.560
is identical to the first site, but you have to files that deal with SSL directives.

00:19.590 --> 00:26.180
You have the global SSL file and then you have the site specific SSL file.

00:26.190 --> 00:29.850
You do not need to recreate the global file.

00:29.860 --> 00:31.800
We've already done that.

00:31.800 --> 00:36.450
You only need to create the site specific file.

00:36.480 --> 00:40.800
A listing of our ATC engine is this old directory.

00:40.840 --> 00:42.510
It's this are all sites.

00:42.600 --> 00:49.080
That is the global SSL file that contains the global directives and the SSL.

00:49.080 --> 00:53.870
WPEC ALLAI is the site specific SSL file.

00:53.880 --> 00:58.650
We now need to create our second site's SSL file.

00:58.830 --> 01:03.450
That is the site specific SSL file sudo CEDP.

01:03.450 --> 01:10.530
We want to copy, we want to copy the existing site specific SSL file and create a new file giving it

01:10.530 --> 01:12.330
up new domain name.

01:12.600 --> 01:15.420
We then need to open the file using Nano.

01:18.250 --> 01:26.560
The site specific SSL files are simply a file that contains the SSL certificate directives, all we

01:26.560 --> 01:32.410
need do is change the existing domain name to the new domain name.

01:36.790 --> 01:44.320
I've not changed all the WPC allies to the new domain name Mac whipped, if you can exit, saving your

01:44.320 --> 01:48.330
changes, no changes need to be made to the global issues.

01:48.370 --> 01:57.370
Alpha, all the directors inside SSL, all sites can be used by any site, can go back one level CD,

01:57.370 --> 02:03.100
double period forward slash and then change to the sites available directory where they need to open

02:03.100 --> 02:07.770
our sites configuration file suit and then followed by the name of the site.

02:07.840 --> 02:11.140
Now we need to start adding our SSL directives.

02:11.140 --> 02:14.920
We need to add a new server block in the server block.

02:14.920 --> 02:24.820
We have a return 3001 if any visitor types Mac Web dev dot com or w w w dot mac web dev dot com.

02:25.000 --> 02:32.370
There is a permanent 301 redirect to HTP is Mac Web dev dot com.

02:32.380 --> 02:39.250
So what we are doing is we are letting engine X redirect from HTP to H.

02:39.520 --> 02:42.520
TTP is the second server block.

02:42.730 --> 02:47.200
We need to remove the ATI and turn on HTP to.

02:51.520 --> 02:59.630
Underneath server name in the four four three server context, we need to add our two SSL include files,

02:59.680 --> 03:07.570
the SSL for the site, its Islamic Web dev, as well as the SSL all sites dot seo in.

03:07.570 --> 03:10.330
If that's all we have to do at this stage.

03:10.840 --> 03:18.040
Exit saving your changes to the file end to test the configuration engi or reload.

03:18.040 --> 03:22.450
Ingenix I'm going to check our HTP response headers.

03:22.480 --> 03:24.610
We receive an A rating.

03:24.610 --> 03:28.480
Let's test our SSL certificate and check the rating.

03:32.890 --> 03:35.920
And a plus on SSL Lapps.
