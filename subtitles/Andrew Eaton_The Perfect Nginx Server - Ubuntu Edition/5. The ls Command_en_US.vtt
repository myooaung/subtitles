00:14.100 --> 00:22.050
Let's look at the information that Alice is displaying to us, the total displays, the amount of disk

00:22.050 --> 00:31.890
space that is used by the files in the list, the first column specifies the identifier and the permissions.

00:31.890 --> 00:36.450
The second column specifies the number of links.

00:36.460 --> 00:39.750
The third column specifies the ownership.

00:40.080 --> 00:44.630
The fourth column specifies the size of the file or directory.

00:44.640 --> 00:51.980
The fifth column specifies the date and time the file or directory was created or lost modified.

00:52.020 --> 00:56.800
The last column indicates the name of the file or directory.

00:56.850 --> 00:59.590
Let's look at each column in more detail.

00:59.730 --> 01:03.410
The first column is divided into 10 characters.

01:03.570 --> 01:10.320
The first character identifies if the entry is a file directory or a symbolic link.

01:10.380 --> 01:14.320
The remaining characters specify the permissions.

01:14.340 --> 01:18.140
We will look into permissions in more detail in the next lecture.

01:18.150 --> 01:24.090
The next column specifies the number of links for the purposes of this course.

01:24.090 --> 01:26.270
We can ignore that column.

01:26.280 --> 01:29.350
The next column specifies the ownership.

01:29.370 --> 01:32.670
This column is further divided into two.

01:32.760 --> 01:38.850
On the left you have the owner and on the right you have the group owner.

01:38.880 --> 01:43.250
As with permissions, we will look into ownership in the next lecture.

01:43.260 --> 01:47.910
The fourth column specifies the size of the file or directory.

01:47.940 --> 01:56.520
I must point out that a directory is just a file with information about the files contained in that

01:56.550 --> 01:57.320
directory.

01:57.600 --> 02:06.150
The Fifth Column specifies the date and time that the file or directory was created or last modified.

02:06.270 --> 02:10.850
The sixth column specifies the name of the directory or file.

02:10.980 --> 02:17.490
The three columns that are of interest to us and are pertinent to this course is the first column,

02:17.490 --> 02:24.630
the identifier and the permissions, the ownership column and the file or directory name column.

02:24.660 --> 02:28.180
Here we have a listing of the Etsy directory.

02:28.260 --> 02:34.270
It's quite easy to identify files, directories and a symbolic link.

02:34.290 --> 02:43.830
A file is identified by a hyphen, a directory is identified by a D and a symbolic link is identified

02:43.830 --> 02:44.940
by an L..

02:44.940 --> 02:51.950
For the purposes of the course, we are only interested in directories and files.

02:52.050 --> 02:54.300
Here is another directory listing.

02:54.300 --> 02:59.740
This time the directory is slash Etsy, slash Ingenix.

02:59.910 --> 03:05.030
Are you able to identify the three columns that interest us?

03:05.100 --> 03:09.130
The first column of identifier and our permissions.

03:09.150 --> 03:15.330
The ownership column and the file or directory name column.

03:15.360 --> 03:21.660
Are you able to identify directories and files to identify the directories?

03:21.660 --> 03:24.740
We look at the first character in the list.

03:24.750 --> 03:28.530
If it starts with a D. It is a directory.

03:28.530 --> 03:32.730
If it starts with a hyphen, it is a file.
