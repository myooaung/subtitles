WEBVTT

00:20.060 --> 00:21.370
Now we need to optimize.

00:22.220 --> 00:23.660
We have already edited.

00:25.100 --> 00:30.320
And as with the other services on the server, if you make a change to the configuration file, you

00:30.320 --> 00:32.040
need to restart that service.

00:32.090 --> 00:34.540
There are few directives we are going to change.

00:34.550 --> 00:39.680
We are going to change the upload max file size to 100 megabytes.

00:39.860 --> 00:46.430
Once you have set up your site, drop that value back to around 16 megabytes.

00:46.670 --> 00:49.760
The same goes with the post max size.

00:49.760 --> 00:52.280
We're going to set it to 100 megabytes.

00:52.400 --> 00:57.140
Once you've set up your site, you've uploaded your theme's, your plugins, your media.

00:57.140 --> 01:02.030
Change the value back to a lower value of around sixteen megabytes.

01:02.210 --> 01:07.880
The max execution time is the maximum execution time allowed for each script.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.450
Certain resource limits may need to be adjusted.

01:11.450 --> 01:18.920
If your site is using commercial themes or plugins, please consult the theme or plug ins documentation

01:18.920 --> 01:20.750
or contact the theme or plug in.

01:20.760 --> 01:25.880
Support the max execution times default value is thirty seconds.

01:25.880 --> 01:28.020
We will leave it at thirty seconds.

01:28.250 --> 01:31.100
The same applies for the max input time.

01:31.100 --> 01:35.060
That is the maximum amount of time each script may spend.

01:35.060 --> 01:36.980
Passing Request Stata.

01:36.980 --> 01:42.740
Some commercial themes and plugins require you to increase the max input value.

01:42.740 --> 01:46.610
We will leave it at the default of sixty seconds.

01:46.790 --> 01:55.460
The Max Input Variables Directive helps to reduce the severity of a denial of service attack using hash

01:55.460 --> 01:56.300
collisions.

01:56.540 --> 02:02.330
It limits the number of input variables your server can use for a single function.

02:02.360 --> 02:05.860
With a WordPress site set the value to three thousand.

02:06.050 --> 02:11.000
A higher value reduces the possibility of issues with theme options.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.690
You will need to uncommented the Max Input Variables directive and change it to three thousand.

02:16.700 --> 02:22.460
The memory limit sets the maximum amount of memory a script to make one assume we're going to increase

02:22.460 --> 02:25.790
the limit to two hundred and fifty six megabytes.

02:28.240 --> 02:32.540
CD slash etsi off to change into the Etsy directory.

02:32.560 --> 02:35.050
We will change to the directory.

02:35.050 --> 02:40.900
Inside the directory there's a directory called Seven Point for change to that directory.

02:40.910 --> 02:46.960
Inside the seven point four directory, there's a directory called FPM Change to that directory once

02:46.960 --> 02:48.580
in the FBI directory.

02:48.730 --> 02:51.850
The file we want to edit is Dot Einai.

02:51.880 --> 02:56.080
We have already created the backup copy of that file when we secured.

02:56.860 --> 02:59.410
Please make a note of the path to DOT.

02:59.410 --> 03:04.390
I know it's much easier if you know the path and you can type the path all in one.

03:04.390 --> 03:13.840
For example, CD slash Etsy slash P seven point four FPM and enter much easier than changing to the

03:13.840 --> 03:15.160
one directory list.

03:15.160 --> 03:17.530
The contents change to the next directory.

03:17.610 --> 03:23.020
The contents make a note of the path to important configuration files.

03:23.230 --> 03:25.120
Sudo nano dot.

03:25.270 --> 03:34.000
I know I control w we need to search for upload, underscore, max, upload, max file size, etc. two

03:34.000 --> 03:39.130
megabytes, remove the two and change it to one hundred controlled w.

03:39.130 --> 03:47.650
We want to search for post underscore Max, change the post max size from eight megabytes to 100 megabytes

03:47.650 --> 03:50.320
the max execution time and the max input time.

03:50.320 --> 04:00.910
We will leave at the default values control w max underscore input max input time control w press enter

04:00.910 --> 04:09.840
max input time little way down max input variables uncommented change the one thousand to three thousand.

04:09.850 --> 04:14.350
You can scroll down to the memory limit from one hundred twenty eight.

04:14.350 --> 04:18.610
Increase it to two five six control w.

04:18.610 --> 04:20.920
I want you to type in up cache.

04:21.970 --> 04:29.620
Up cash is a cash engine built into it dramatically increases the performance of your WordPress sites

04:29.650 --> 04:38.200
with cash disabled, your sites will face major performance issues as it takes time to compile all the

04:38.830 --> 04:41.140
scripts on every request.

04:41.200 --> 04:48.140
The human readable code needs to be converted to machine language, request after request.

04:48.160 --> 04:55.480
This process will be followed and it will lead to huge performance issues with up cash enabled.

04:55.600 --> 05:03.190
The process of converting human readable code to machine language will run and then the result will

05:03.190 --> 05:04.540
be cashed up.

05:04.540 --> 05:12.550
Cash improves the performance by storing pre compiled script bytecode in shared memory, removing the

05:12.550 --> 05:16.750
need for IP to load and pass scripts on each request.

05:16.930 --> 05:23.970
This will give you a dramatic performance boost and reduce your site loading time significantly.

05:24.010 --> 05:30.210
We can configure up cash by modifying the directives in the sport einai file.

05:30.250 --> 05:33.940
There are four directives that we are going to edit cache.

05:34.030 --> 05:38.440
Memory consumption is the maximum memory available to op cache.

05:38.470 --> 05:42.430
We are going to set it to 192 megabytes.

05:42.640 --> 05:48.070
The op cache in turned string's buffer uses a technique called string.

05:48.070 --> 05:53.800
In turning to improve performance, it saves memory and improves performance.

05:53.800 --> 05:57.130
We are going to set it to sixteen megabytes.

05:57.310 --> 06:05.350
The op cache max accelerated files controls how many files at most can be held in memory at once.

06:05.530 --> 06:12.880
It's important that your sites contain list files, then the value you set the max accelerated files

06:12.880 --> 06:13.180
to.

06:13.210 --> 06:16.030
This is a value that can be calculated.

06:16.030 --> 06:23.260
After you install your WordPress sites, you will find the command in the PDF attached to the selector.

06:23.260 --> 06:32.620
And finally, we have OPCs validate timestamps with validate timestamps, disabled OPCs revalidate frequency

06:32.620 --> 06:37.630
is ignored and FB files are never checked for updated code.

06:37.690 --> 06:44.800
This means that changes will not be implemented until you restart the FBN process.

06:45.040 --> 06:52.720
Once you have enabled the cache, there are times when you will need to clear that up to clear the up

06:52.750 --> 06:53.230
cache.

06:53.230 --> 06:57.670
You can clear that up cache by restarting the BB seven point four.

06:57.670 --> 07:03.400
If we process in the event you want to clear that up cache from the WordPress dashboard, you can install

07:03.400 --> 07:07.750
the flash up cache, plug in or use W3 total cache.

07:07.780 --> 07:14.710
The installation and configuration of W3 total cache is covered later in the course of cache enabled

07:14.710 --> 07:17.050
equals one uncommented up cache.

07:17.050 --> 07:22.810
Memory consumption, uncommented change the one two eight two one nine two.

07:23.560 --> 07:32.380
The OPCs in turn strings buffer change eight to sixteen and uncommented the OPCs max accelerated files.

07:32.380 --> 07:36.640
We will change to a prime number seven nine six three.

07:39.550 --> 07:41.860
OPCs validate timestamps.

07:41.890 --> 07:45.250
We will change to zero and uncommented.

07:48.210 --> 07:52.410
You can close the Anei, saving your changes to the farm.

07:52.980 --> 07:57.960
We've made changes to the EINAI, restart the FPM process.

08:02.390 --> 08:11.530
Sudo system ctl restart seven point four hyphen if pm cd slash va slash w w w.

08:11.600 --> 08:17.750
After you've completed the set up of your first WordPress site in the PDF attached to this lecture,

08:17.780 --> 08:24.650
you will find the find command find period type F print grip and count.

08:24.680 --> 08:32.660
We have no files in the slash va slash w w w because I reckon it will return zero after installing your

08:32.660 --> 08:39.020
site, installing your themes, your plug ins, change to the slash va slash w w w directory.

08:39.020 --> 08:41.100
That is the webroot on our server.

08:41.120 --> 08:44.180
Copy and paste the fine command from the PDF.

08:44.180 --> 08:45.980
Check the number that has returned.

08:46.100 --> 08:51.440
That number must be less than the op cache max accelerated files.

08:51.650 --> 08:55.940
You will find the command in the PDF that is attached to this lecture.

08:55.940 --> 08:58.460
I'm going to repeat that as it's important.

08:58.460 --> 09:03.980
After you've set up your WordPress site, you've installed your theme, you've installed all your plugins.

09:04.160 --> 09:08.120
Change to the slash VA slash w w w directory.

09:08.150 --> 09:16.070
Copy the fine command from the PDF that counts the number of PHP files in the slash will slash w w w

09:16.070 --> 09:16.730
directory.

09:16.760 --> 09:20.810
The number that has returned must be less than the op cache.

09:20.810 --> 09:23.030
Max accelerated files.

09:28.020 --> 09:34.530
So at this stage, I've installed a few WordPress sites, now I need to update the op cache Max Accelerated

09:34.530 --> 09:42.090
Files Directive, the op cache, Max Accelerated Files directive must be greater than the number of

09:42.780 --> 09:43.350
files.

09:43.500 --> 09:51.470
So my first step is to count the number of files in the slash for slash W. w. W. directory.

09:51.600 --> 09:56.310
I'm currently in my slash four slash W. w. W. directory.

09:56.400 --> 10:00.210
The font command you will find in the PDF attached to this picture.

10:00.210 --> 10:06.300
The file command will count the number of files in the slash for slash W..

10:06.300 --> 10:07.800
W. W. directory.

10:07.950 --> 10:14.710
The font command returns a value of Nonet five to looking at Anei.

10:14.790 --> 10:20.060
My op cache max accelerated files is set to seven nine six three.

10:20.070 --> 10:30.240
So I need to increase the cache max accelerated files value in dot i the value nonet five to ten thousand

10:30.240 --> 10:31.110
is too close.

10:31.120 --> 10:38.460
I'm going to rounded off and take it at 11000 in the PDF you will find the URL decoder dot if ah.

10:38.520 --> 10:44.220
Now what we want to do is calculate the nearest prime number to eleven thousand.

10:50.120 --> 10:57.800
The nearest prime number is eleven thousand and three, so in my iron, I feel I must change seven nine

10:57.800 --> 11:01.100
six three two double one, double zero three.

11:01.310 --> 11:08.530
The reason we use prime numbers is that prime numbers lend themselves to a natural hashing function.

11:08.630 --> 11:13.130
So I always recommend that you set the value to a prime number.

11:13.160 --> 11:17.030
You can close that iron by saving your changes.

11:17.060 --> 11:24.530
Then you need to restart the process to enable the new max accelerated philes value.

11:29.910 --> 11:37.980
It's most important you must check the number of files and ensure the number of files in slash bar slash

11:37.980 --> 11:44.910
w w w are less than the value set for Akaash Max accelerated files.

11:49.960 --> 11:56.740
In this section, we started the optimization process for Maria DBI and seven point four in the next

11:56.740 --> 12:03.700
section, we will cover detailed Engine X configuration with reference to both hardening and optimization.
