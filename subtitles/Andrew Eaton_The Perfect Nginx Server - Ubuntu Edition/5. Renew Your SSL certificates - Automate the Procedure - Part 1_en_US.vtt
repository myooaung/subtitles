00:16.600 --> 00:22.690
In this lecture, we are going to be using Chron to schedule jobs on our server.

00:23.200 --> 00:27.270
There are no new configuration files in this lecture.

00:27.460 --> 00:34.180
The commands we are going to be using in this lecture, crosstab hyphen L is to list the current users

00:34.360 --> 00:35.320
cron jobs.

00:35.530 --> 00:40.590
Crosstab hyphen E is used to create a new cron job.

00:40.720 --> 00:49.150
If the command you would like to schedule requires route privileges, you must create a route current

00:49.150 --> 00:57.420
job by using Sudo crosstab Ifni Chron allows you to schedule and automate tasks.

00:57.460 --> 01:03.280
You can run certain commands at a date and time that you specify.

01:03.430 --> 01:08.800
An important part of using Chron is to understand how the schedule works.

01:08.980 --> 01:10.960
It's broken up as follows.

01:10.990 --> 01:13.620
You have five esoterics.

01:13.810 --> 01:20.010
That is where you specify the minutes, the hours, day of the month, month, day of the week.

01:20.230 --> 01:28.480
Then you have your pass to your shell slash, burn, slash S.H. Then you specify the command you would

01:28.480 --> 01:29.250
like to run.

01:29.260 --> 01:37.840
And finally, if you would like to redirect the output of the current job, you specify that after your

01:37.840 --> 01:38.530
command.

01:38.710 --> 01:44.380
Now the first five esoterics, the first one is where you specify the minutes.

01:44.590 --> 01:48.220
The allowed values are zero to fifty nine.

01:48.220 --> 01:51.460
The second S6 is where you specify hours.

01:51.610 --> 01:55.000
The allowed values are zero to twenty three.

01:55.120 --> 01:58.510
The third extricates is the day of the month.

01:58.540 --> 02:01.780
The allowed values are one to thirty one.

02:01.780 --> 02:04.600
The fourth Strix is the month.

02:04.600 --> 02:07.660
The allowed values are one to twelve.

02:07.810 --> 02:11.410
The last Asterix is the day of the week.

02:11.440 --> 02:18.940
The allowed values are zero two six zero being Sunday and six being Saturday.

02:19.000 --> 02:27.610
I want to run a particular command at five thirty a.m. every day minutes I would type thirty hours.

02:27.790 --> 02:32.020
I would type five day of the month, month and day of the week.

02:32.020 --> 02:41.260
I leave as an Asterix so every day at five thirty a.m. the command I specify will run another example

02:41.380 --> 02:46.060
zero six six six six zero minutes.

02:46.090 --> 02:47.220
Hours six.

02:47.380 --> 02:51.630
This command will run at zero minutes, six hours.

02:51.640 --> 02:54.730
So this command will run at six a.m..

02:54.730 --> 03:00.640
I haven't specified day of the month, I haven't specified a month, but I've specified a day of the

03:00.640 --> 03:02.140
week as six.

03:02.140 --> 03:10.090
So every Saturday at six am, the command I specify will run minutes, zero hours three.

03:10.090 --> 03:16.390
So this command will run at three am day of the month, the seventh day of the month.

03:16.390 --> 03:18.100
I haven't specified a month.

03:18.100 --> 03:20.380
I haven't specified the day of the week.

03:20.380 --> 03:28.450
So the command I specify will run at 3am on the seventh day of every single month.

03:28.690 --> 03:38.110
If you want to run a certain command every few hours or minutes, Asterix forward slash six under hours

03:38.290 --> 03:43.390
will run whichever command I specify every six hours.

03:43.630 --> 03:50.650
If I look at the time five thirty am slash burn slash is the path to my shell.

03:50.680 --> 03:56.890
The command that will run slash home slash Andrew dbi dot s h.

03:56.890 --> 03:59.440
That is how you specify the command.

03:59.440 --> 04:07.990
You create a Besch script and in the section command you specify the path to that particular script.

04:08.110 --> 04:13.300
The redirect slash dev slash now to greater than ampersand one.

04:13.300 --> 04:21.610
Every time a cron job runs, mail is sent to the user who created that particular job.

04:21.620 --> 04:24.490
Now this can get quite annoying at times.

04:24.490 --> 04:31.030
Redirecting the output of Chron to slash dev slash now will redirect it to nothing.

04:31.060 --> 04:33.910
You will receive no confirmation.

04:33.910 --> 04:39.640
In this lecture we looked at configuring Chron to schedule events on your server.
