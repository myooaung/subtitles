WEBVTT

00:14.970 --> 00:22.410
I again want to remind you there is a PDF attached to this lecture that you must download when we talk

00:22.410 --> 00:31.590
about hardening or securing, what we are doing is we are removing any dangerous default settings that

00:31.590 --> 00:35.070
were applied during the installation process.

00:39.760 --> 00:47.620
The engine next defaults are actually very secure and further hardening of the server is a combination

00:47.620 --> 00:50.200
of securing and optimizing.

00:50.200 --> 00:55.270
In the next section, we will secure and optimize Engine X in detail.

00:55.420 --> 01:00.810
For now, what we want to do is we want to prevent information leakage.

01:00.970 --> 01:07.420
In this case, we want to prevent the Engine X version number from being displayed on various pages,

01:07.450 --> 01:12.390
as well as remove the server name from the HTP headers.

01:12.430 --> 01:18.460
The main engine X configuration file that we are going to spend a lot of time editing is Engine X,

01:18.460 --> 01:19.510
not SEO.

01:19.510 --> 01:27.670
And if any change that you make to any Engine X configuration file to enable that change, you need

01:27.670 --> 01:36.310
to restart or reload the engine service prior to restarting or reloading engine X, you must test the

01:36.310 --> 01:38.020
configuration first.

01:38.140 --> 01:44.920
You don't want to edit an engine X configuration file and then restart the service suddenly to discover

01:44.920 --> 01:50.430
that there is a problem with one of the configuration files and the Engine X service goes down.

01:50.470 --> 01:54.000
If your web server goes down, all your sites go down.

01:54.010 --> 02:01.540
So what you do before you reload or restart Engine X, you test the configuration for errors to test

02:01.540 --> 02:03.190
the engine X configuration.

02:03.310 --> 02:11.260
You type Suja, engine X, hyphen T, the Seydou, engine X, hyphen T Command will identify any errors

02:11.260 --> 02:13.660
in the engine X configuration.

02:13.660 --> 02:21.220
Once you've tested the configuration and the test was successful, then you can reload or restart engine

02:21.220 --> 02:26.800
X with engine X, it's preferable to reload engine X rather than restart.

02:26.800 --> 02:30.550
Reloading does not drop connections in terminal.

02:30.610 --> 02:37.760
I'm going to type the kill command and I followed by my server's IP address server engine X slash,

02:37.870 --> 02:41.530
followed by the version of Engine X that is installed on my server.

02:41.530 --> 02:45.190
Now what we want to do in this section is remove that.

02:45.280 --> 02:48.400
We don't want the server header to be displayed.

02:48.460 --> 02:56.380
If I open my browser and I take my IP address slash followed by ABC dot html, I get the ForFour not

02:56.380 --> 03:02.890
found page, which is correct, but I also get engine X slash followed by the version number back to

03:02.890 --> 03:05.260
terminal CD slash ATC.

03:05.260 --> 03:10.090
The slash ATC directory is where you find all your configuration files.

03:10.240 --> 03:17.680
Listing will display a directory called Ingenix CD Engine X, not CD slash engine X.

03:17.710 --> 03:20.080
Engine X is a local path name.

03:20.080 --> 03:24.550
Engine X is a subdirectory of the slash ATC directory.

03:29.430 --> 03:36.870
A listing of the slash Etsy slash Ingenix directory displays the main engine X configuration file engine

03:36.870 --> 03:43.710
Eckstut Seo F before editing any configuration file, make a backup copy of the file sudo.

03:44.610 --> 03:50.730
We want to copy the name of the file that you want to copy is Engine Eckstut SEO in F leave a space

03:50.730 --> 03:54.230
now type the name of the backup file name.

03:54.240 --> 03:58.050
I'll top it as engine Eckstut seo in f dot be.

03:58.050 --> 04:05.550
Okay, I'm listing of the slash EDC slash engine X directory or display both engine X.com in F and the

04:05.550 --> 04:07.080
back up copy I created.

04:07.200 --> 04:15.570
Now I need to edit engine X.com F sudo nano Nano is the editor I'll be using to edit various configuration

04:15.570 --> 04:16.740
files on my server.

04:16.740 --> 04:20.900
Niva Space followed by the filename engine Eckstut Seo in.

04:20.910 --> 04:23.550
If we will be looking at the file engine next.

04:23.550 --> 04:27.620
Orzio in in a lot of detail in the next section.

04:27.630 --> 04:31.860
So for now this is the main context up to include.

04:31.890 --> 04:33.960
This is the events context.

04:33.990 --> 04:38.760
There is the opening curly bracket and there is the closing curly bracket of the events.

04:38.760 --> 04:42.000
Context is the TTP context.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.300
I'm going to scroll down till we get to the closing curly bracket for the H.

04:47.340 --> 04:48.930
TTP context.

04:50.330 --> 04:54.110
You can scroll up to the section basic settings.

04:58.050 --> 05:05.430
Server tokens you can uncommented by removing the hash server tokens is the version number we saw on

05:05.430 --> 05:09.440
a four a four page, we don't want to see the version number.

05:09.450 --> 05:18.090
So I'm going to uncommented to enable the server tokens of DirecTV, all directors in a semi colon underneath

05:18.110 --> 05:19.260
server tokens.

05:19.290 --> 05:26.400
You can add more, underscore, clear, underscore headers leave a space enclosed by two apostrophes

05:26.400 --> 05:28.800
type server semi code.

05:29.100 --> 05:37.080
We are now making use of the live engine x mod http headers more filter package that we installed.

05:37.140 --> 05:43.970
That package allows us to remove certain headers and I want to remove the server header.

05:44.040 --> 05:47.850
You can close neno control x save modify buffer.

05:47.850 --> 05:50.970
Yes, file name to right engine X.com.

05:51.000 --> 05:57.930
And if you simply need to press enter after editing any engine X configuration file immediately test

05:57.960 --> 06:02.250
the configuration sudo engine x hyphen t syntaxes.

06:02.250 --> 06:09.600
OK, test is successful now to enable the changes that I've made to the engine x dot com NFL, I need

06:09.600 --> 06:11.700
to reload the engine X service.

06:13.270 --> 06:20.800
SUDA System CTL Reload, followed by the service that I would like to reload, which is Ingenix back

06:20.800 --> 06:21.740
to my browser.

06:21.790 --> 06:25.810
I'm going to refresh the Ingenix version number has disappeared.

06:25.810 --> 06:29.950
Kerl 1/2 and I followed by my service IP address.

06:30.100 --> 06:32.710
The server header has been removed.

06:38.000 --> 06:45.290
With Maria Debe, we need to remove any dangerous default settings that were applied during the installation

06:45.290 --> 06:45.930
process.

06:46.130 --> 06:53.770
This is accomplished by running the security script, my esquibel secure installation in terminal.

06:53.780 --> 06:57.470
I'm still in a slash, slash and Genex directory.

06:57.620 --> 07:00.160
I'm going to change to my home directory.

07:00.200 --> 07:08.690
The command is sudo the space my Eskil underscore secure underscore installation into current password

07:08.690 --> 07:09.320
for route.

07:09.320 --> 07:15.310
That is the route Maria DB user, not the router user on your server.

07:15.320 --> 07:22.550
We have not set a password for the route Maria DB user you can press enter set route password.

07:22.730 --> 07:27.710
No Maria DB uses Unix socket authentication.

07:27.710 --> 07:30.830
We log into Marea DB using Suja.

07:30.830 --> 07:33.890
You do not need to set a root password.

07:34.010 --> 07:35.990
Remove anonymous users.

07:35.990 --> 07:36.740
Yes.

07:36.980 --> 07:39.650
Disallow route log in remotely.

07:39.830 --> 07:47.300
Yes, we will only allow connections from localhost, remove test database and access to it.

07:47.300 --> 07:47.990
Yes.

07:48.170 --> 07:50.390
Reload privilege tables now.

07:50.630 --> 07:51.380
Yes.

07:51.530 --> 07:55.490
Cleaning up all done to log in to Maria DBE.

07:55.520 --> 07:58.280
We use sudo Maisky.

07:58.280 --> 07:59.930
Oh I find you.

07:59.930 --> 08:08.180
The user is a route we have now logged into Maria db to exit Maria DB you type the command exit.

08:08.390 --> 08:16.760
If you leave out Sudo and you type my Eskil hyphen you followed by the user route access denied.

08:21.860 --> 08:31.460
The main configuration file is packed, and I hope that Anei is a large file, Nano has an option that

08:31.460 --> 08:34.100
allows you to search for a particular string.

08:34.100 --> 08:41.420
You use control plus W and then you can type A string that you are searching for, as with any other

08:41.420 --> 08:43.610
service that is running on your server.

08:43.670 --> 08:51.770
If you make a change to the configuration file of that service, you need to restart or reload the service

08:51.770 --> 08:55.340
that is associated with that configuration file.

08:55.340 --> 09:07.060
After we edit Anei, you need to restart the process sudo system ctrl restart seven point four Hafford

09:07.070 --> 09:07.970
f rpm.

09:07.980 --> 09:12.460
We are going to make the following changes in the speed in Ifrah.

09:12.470 --> 09:20.180
We are going to set allow you RLF if open to off set CGI fix pass info to zero.

09:20.180 --> 09:28.010
And we need to confirm that exposed IP is set to off by changing allow you are all open to offer.

09:28.070 --> 09:34.530
It prevents a directive allowing files to be included from external sources.

09:34.730 --> 09:40.040
This can create a security risk for all sites that are hosted on your server.

09:40.070 --> 09:47.990
By changing our fixed path info to zero, it prevents me from trying to execute parts of the path.

09:48.170 --> 09:55.040
If the file that was passed in to the process is not found, this can be used by malicious users to

09:55.040 --> 09:57.080
execute arbitrary code.

09:57.140 --> 10:02.630
You don't want to expose that your server is using and what version of.

10:03.380 --> 10:09.770
So we need to confirm that expose is set off CD Sush UTC.

10:09.950 --> 10:12.500
A listing will display a directory FTP.

10:12.590 --> 10:16.750
You can change to the directory CD Leave a space.

10:17.600 --> 10:25.070
A listing displays another directory seven point four CD Space seven point for another listing displays

10:25.070 --> 10:29.180
three directories Seelie, PM and mods available.

10:29.180 --> 10:31.910
We want to change to the FEMA directory.

10:32.030 --> 10:35.780
Listing of the FPM directory displays the configuration file.

10:35.780 --> 10:38.270
We want to edit update EINAI.

10:42.620 --> 10:50.180
As with any other configuration file suit you see online are the MySpace type of the same file name,

10:50.180 --> 10:58.190
but add a dot back to the file name, a listing will display online and the dot back backup file of

10:58.190 --> 10:59.110
BHP dot.

10:59.120 --> 11:06.680
I know you can now use neno sudo neno followed by the file name that you want to edit einai.

11:06.800 --> 11:14.090
As you can see the dot on file is one thousand nine hundred and forty six months control w we want to

11:14.090 --> 11:22.430
search allow underscore your url after pressing enter allow you url if open is currently set to on.

11:24.160 --> 11:32.200
Change it to off in the eye and offer comments or proceeded with a semicolon in other configuration

11:32.200 --> 11:40.070
files, comments are preceded by a hash control w we now want to search for CGI dot fix.

11:40.160 --> 11:41.530
Here is the directive.

11:41.590 --> 11:45.730
CGI dot fix underscore pass info equals one.

11:45.760 --> 11:53.620
Remove the semicolon to enable the directive change the one to zero control w we now want to search

11:53.620 --> 12:03.640
for expose the directive exposed p equals or you can close neno control x save modify buffer y filename

12:03.640 --> 12:05.740
to write dot einai.

12:05.770 --> 12:12.820
To enable the changes in the configuration that we've made, you need to restart the seven point four

12:12.850 --> 12:14.230
FBN process.

12:17.320 --> 12:23.560
SUDA System CTL restart seven point four Hafen if PM.

12:28.530 --> 12:33.570
So now we've hardened Ingenix, Maria, Debe and seven point four.
