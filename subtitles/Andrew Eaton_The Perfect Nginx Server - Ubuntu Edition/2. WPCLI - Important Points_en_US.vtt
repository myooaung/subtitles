00:00.120 --> 00:07.890
We are going to use WPC Allai for the following administrative tasks, creating child teams and administering

00:07.890 --> 00:09.690
themes and plug ins.

00:09.750 --> 00:19.230
There is one important aspect that I must emphasize before using any WPEC that I command ensure that

00:19.230 --> 00:20.880
you are in your sights.

00:20.880 --> 00:23.480
Public HTML directory.

00:23.610 --> 00:29.070
If you are not, you then need to use the past variable.

00:29.070 --> 00:35.890
You need to specify the path to your site's public HTML directory.

00:35.940 --> 00:37.700
Let's look at an example.

00:37.710 --> 00:41.730
The first example I'm currently in my home directory.

00:41.760 --> 00:45.230
I type the command WP themeless error.

00:45.330 --> 00:48.570
This does not seem to be a WordPress install.

00:48.780 --> 00:49.940
The second example.

00:49.980 --> 00:53.060
I am still in the home directory of my user.

00:53.070 --> 00:56.520
I've topped the same command WP themed list.

00:56.520 --> 01:01.760
Only this time I've specified a path to the WordPress files.

01:01.770 --> 01:06.570
VAR w w w my domain name public html.

01:06.570 --> 01:08.910
And there is the list of themes.

01:08.970 --> 01:14.740
The next example I've changed to my site's public HTML directory.

01:14.760 --> 01:21.870
You'll notice the change in the prompt of top to command WP themeless and the list of themes is being

01:21.870 --> 01:22.620
displayed.

01:22.620 --> 01:28.140
The easiest option is to change to your site's public HTML directory.

01:28.140 --> 01:34.200
Once you've changed your site's public HDMI directory, all you do is type the command you would like

01:34.200 --> 01:34.910
to use.

01:34.920 --> 01:37.110
You can also use the part variable.

01:37.110 --> 01:41.110
It just means there will be a lot more typing involved.

01:41.110 --> 01:47.100
So for the rest of this picture, I will be changing to my site's public HTML directory.
