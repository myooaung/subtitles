00:17.630 --> 00:23.810
In this lecture, we are going to look at a few definitions that you must be familiar with.

00:23.930 --> 00:29.110
We need to look at packages, repositories and the package manager.

00:29.300 --> 00:34.670
These three items are all closely related and work together.

00:34.790 --> 00:42.620
A package refers to the individual components that make up a full featured software program.

00:42.650 --> 00:46.750
Let me give you an example on anyone to desktop installation.

00:46.760 --> 00:48.420
The software program files.

00:48.420 --> 00:51.960
Zila is made up of various packages.

00:52.010 --> 00:59.120
These packages work together to build the program files, as you can see files.

00:59.210 --> 01:04.100
It depends on numerous smaller packages called dependencies.

01:04.100 --> 01:11.720
With Lennix, you have what is called a package manager that will find, download and install the required

01:11.720 --> 01:13.760
dependencies for you.

01:13.910 --> 01:23.360
Repositories or servers which contain sets of packages or packages are stored in what's called a repository.

01:23.390 --> 01:28.020
Each in the next distribution takes care of its own repositories.

01:28.100 --> 01:35.080
The package manager will check the repository to see if a package you are requesting is available.

01:35.090 --> 01:42.050
It will check all the required dependencies and present you with a list of what's going to be installed

01:42.050 --> 01:43.230
on your server.

01:43.280 --> 01:46.800
It's fast, efficient and very reliable.

01:46.870 --> 01:53.140
A package manager is used to install software on your server in an organized manner.

01:53.300 --> 01:57.550
A package manager is similar to a mobile app store.

01:57.590 --> 02:04.960
The package manageable download and install the packages from its software repositories.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.330
The package manager will also perform updates for all the installed packages.

02:11.360 --> 02:17.510
The Ubuntu package manager is called Advanced Package Manager, or EPT.

02:17.660 --> 02:21.800
You need take no steps in setting any of this up.

02:22.070 --> 02:28.640
When your Linux server distribution is installed, the package manager is installed by default and as

02:28.640 --> 02:34.730
long as your server has an Internet connection, the package manager will connect to the repositories,

02:34.760 --> 02:42.330
thereby allowing you to install and update packages as well as update the server operating system.

02:42.350 --> 02:48.160
I must point out that you can also add unofficial repositories to your server.

02:48.170 --> 02:55.490
I don't recommend this as you may introduce possible vulnerabilities and security problems.

02:55.490 --> 03:03.860
I recommend you only install the packages you need and only from the official Ubuntu repository keeping

03:03.860 --> 03:11.300
the packages installed on your server updated is one of the most important steps in server security.

03:11.420 --> 03:15.880
The command used to configure packages is called EPT Get.

03:16.160 --> 03:19.790
There are three variations of the target command.

03:19.790 --> 03:24.620
You must know when it comes to keeping your server software updated.

03:24.680 --> 03:33.470
These are update, upgrade and just upgrade your first update and then you upgrade.

03:33.470 --> 03:37.310
Neither of them automatically runs the other bits.

03:37.310 --> 03:39.680
Look at each command in more detail.

03:39.710 --> 03:43.580
Update is used to synchronize the package.

03:43.580 --> 03:50.690
Files from the sources this package lists contains all the information related to what is installed

03:50.690 --> 03:56.450
on your server, such as version numbers, binaries and dependencies.

03:56.600 --> 04:02.930
Upgrade is used to install the newest versions of all packages currently installed on the system.

04:02.930 --> 04:08.600
No installed packages are removed and no new packages are installed.

04:08.630 --> 04:15.080
The upgrade command will compare what versions are installed on your server and compare it to the package

04:15.080 --> 04:15.650
list.

04:15.650 --> 04:20.630
You will then be presented with a list of packages that can be upgraded.

04:20.630 --> 04:26.150
Just upgrade is used to upgrade packages that target cannot upgrade.

04:26.240 --> 04:33.200
These are COL upgrades or other big changes that may require a reboot to take effect.

04:33.320 --> 04:40.130
If you receive a message stating the following packages have been kept back, this is an indication

04:40.160 --> 04:43.910
that you need to run the test upgrade command.

04:43.910 --> 04:52.700
You may need to reboot your server after the dust upgrade, command, install, remove and purge.

04:52.700 --> 04:59.180
You use the advanced package manager apt to install packages on your server.

04:59.330 --> 05:05.960
The package manager will check the repository to see if the package you are requesting is available.

05:05.960 --> 05:13.040
It will also check the dependencies and present you with a list of what's going to be installed on your

05:13.040 --> 05:13.700
server.

05:13.800 --> 05:16.880
EPT is also used to remove.

05:17.160 --> 05:25.890
Packages from your server get installed is used to add or install packages on your server, EPT get

05:25.890 --> 05:36.090
remove is used to remove packages from your server target purge is also used to remove packages from

05:36.090 --> 05:37.020
your server.

05:37.140 --> 05:45.330
The difference between target, remove and get purge removed does not remove modified configuration

05:45.330 --> 05:48.510
files, whereas purge does.

05:49.110 --> 05:56.910
If during the upgrade process you are prompted to overwrite a configuration file that you have modified,

05:57.060 --> 06:01.320
you will be presented with an option to keep the modified version.

06:01.530 --> 06:03.810
Always keep the modified version.

06:03.960 --> 06:08.700
Otherwise you will lose the changes you have made to that file.

06:09.060 --> 06:13.740
This is a list of some of the target commands we will be using.

06:13.890 --> 06:20.540
They are straightforward and throughout the course we will be using all of these commands.

06:20.550 --> 06:22.980
So for now, make a note of them.

06:22.980 --> 06:25.460
We will be using them shortly.

06:25.650 --> 06:34.200
In this lecture, we looked at a few definitions as well as the Boonchu package manager, Apte.
