00:17.990 --> 00:25.430
In this section, we are going to look at the terminal prompt, being able to use a terminal emulator

00:25.430 --> 00:32.780
is a necessity if you intend to administer a Linux server after logging into your server.

00:32.810 --> 00:34.880
There are two different prompts.

00:34.880 --> 00:42.260
You must be aware of the route user prompt and the non route user prompt.

00:42.500 --> 00:45.660
Let's look at the prompt in more detail.

00:45.680 --> 00:54.110
Firstly, you have the user name that is the user name of the current user at the top route.

00:54.140 --> 00:57.800
You are then logged in as the route user.

00:57.830 --> 01:02.450
User name is just a generic name I am using.

01:02.450 --> 01:07.700
When we set up a server, we will add a non user to the server.

01:07.700 --> 01:15.320
Whatever username you decide on will be displayed where user name is now appearing.

01:15.350 --> 01:19.910
The next part of the prompt is the server hostname.

01:19.940 --> 01:22.540
That name can be changed.

01:22.550 --> 01:27.680
We will look at that later in the course where you see the told.

01:27.770 --> 01:33.650
The prompt will display your current location in the file system.

01:33.650 --> 01:40.280
If you have, for example, changed to a different directory, that directory will be displayed.

01:40.280 --> 01:48.230
Whether told is currently being displayed, the told indicates a user's home directory.

01:48.260 --> 01:52.100
If ever the told is displayed in the terminal prompt.

01:52.100 --> 01:57.830
Your current location in the file system is that user's home directory.

01:57.860 --> 02:06.080
The home directory is where a user stores any information that that user has created.

02:06.080 --> 02:14.600
The hash or the hash indicates that you are logged in and working as the root user.

02:14.600 --> 02:24.380
The dollar sign indicates you are logged in as a non root user 99 percent of the time your prompt will

02:24.380 --> 02:27.170
display a dollar sign.

02:27.200 --> 02:29.630
Finally, we have the cursor.

02:29.660 --> 02:33.020
That is where you type the commands.

02:33.050 --> 02:36.840
The appearance of the cursor can be changed.

02:36.860 --> 02:47.180
Here are a few examples of the terminal prompt at the top username Andrew Hostname course VPs is two

02:47.360 --> 02:55.580
told Tollerson told indicates the user Andrew is currently in his home directory.

02:55.580 --> 03:00.860
The dollar sign indicates Andrew is a non route user.

03:00.860 --> 03:05.120
In the second example, the user Andrew has changed.

03:05.120 --> 03:11.090
Directories to the Etsy directory noticed the change in the prompt.

03:11.090 --> 03:12.890
It's no longer told.

03:13.010 --> 03:15.830
It is now slash Etsy.

03:16.010 --> 03:21.560
It's displaying Andrew's current location in the file system.

03:21.680 --> 03:25.570
The last two examples of the route user.

03:25.670 --> 03:29.450
There is a hash rather than a dollar sign.

03:29.630 --> 03:31.190
The user name is Root.

03:31.190 --> 03:35.390
The hostname is the same course VPI is too.

03:35.570 --> 03:45.620
And as the user changes from one location to another in the file system, so the location changes in

03:45.950 --> 03:46.610
the prompt.

03:46.850 --> 03:55.250
In this lecture we looked at the terminal prompt and the information that the prompt is displaying to

03:55.250 --> 03:55.580
you.
