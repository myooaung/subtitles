00:08.050 --> 00:10.580
Now we need to look at permissions.

00:11.020 --> 00:19.840
There are three types of permissions on a limbic system, and these apply to both files and directories

00:19.960 --> 00:23.770
read, write and execute.

00:23.990 --> 00:30.040
They are abbreviated with R, W, X, all lowercase.

00:30.220 --> 00:39.550
A permission value that is displayed with a hyphen is an indication of the user having no permissions

00:39.760 --> 00:41.740
in that context.

00:41.800 --> 00:45.940
Let's look at what permissions allow a user to do.

00:46.060 --> 00:47.680
Read, write and execute.

00:47.680 --> 00:51.640
Permissions differ with files and directories.

00:51.670 --> 00:53.710
Let's look at files first.

00:53.740 --> 01:01.330
Having a read permission on a file allows a user to view the contents of that file.

01:01.450 --> 01:09.790
Having right permissions on a file allows a user to modify and delete files.

01:09.820 --> 01:15.360
Having execute permissions on a file allows a user to execute the file.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.980
If it is a program or script.

01:17.980 --> 01:22.570
When it comes to directorate's, you have the same three permissions.

01:22.570 --> 01:27.250
But because we are now working with a directory, it will differ.

01:27.250 --> 01:35.590
Read permissions on a directory will allow a user to view the contents of a directory.

01:35.710 --> 01:45.250
Having right permissions allows a user to write into that directory right into a directory, allows

01:45.250 --> 01:54.010
you to create new files in that directory as well as create subdirectories execute permissions when

01:54.010 --> 02:00.590
referring to directories will allow a user to enter that particular directory.

02:00.650 --> 02:05.410
Previously we looked at the c.D Change Directory Command.

02:05.560 --> 02:13.630
If a user does not have execute permissions on a directory, you can not change to that directory.

02:13.660 --> 02:17.850
Here we have the listing of our Ingenix directory.

02:17.890 --> 02:22.990
There are two entries I would like to look at Ingenix Dot Seo in F.

02:23.140 --> 02:30.850
If we look at the identifier on the extreme left, it is a hyphen indicating it is a file further down

02:30.970 --> 02:32.380
sites available.

02:32.380 --> 02:39.940
The identifier on the extreme left is a D indicating sites available is a directory.

02:39.940 --> 02:48.900
It's look at Ingenix dot C in F first three characters or W hyphen belong to the owner.

02:49.090 --> 02:52.600
The second three characters are hyphen.

02:52.600 --> 02:55.930
Hyphen belong to the group owner.

02:56.050 --> 03:02.740
The last three characters are often hyphen belong to other users.

03:02.920 --> 03:08.800
Looking at the first three are W hyphen, the owner is root.

03:08.950 --> 03:14.370
So what would the user root be able to do to that file?

03:14.410 --> 03:20.710
What permissions does the user have on the Ingenix not SEO in a file?

03:20.740 --> 03:25.030
It allows the user to view the contents of the file.

03:25.030 --> 03:26.620
That is the read permission.

03:26.770 --> 03:30.850
It allows the user to modify the file.

03:30.880 --> 03:33.550
That is the right permission.

03:33.580 --> 03:40.180
The hyphen indicates the user has no execute permissions on that file.

03:40.180 --> 03:43.900
Let's look at what the group can do to that file.

03:44.050 --> 03:46.870
The owner is the route group.

03:47.020 --> 03:48.670
What can the group do?

03:48.820 --> 03:53.080
They can view the contents of that file and nothing else.

03:53.080 --> 04:01.630
The route group do not have permissions to write or execute, so anyone who's part of the route group

04:01.630 --> 04:10.870
can only view the contents of that for the last three characters belongs to all other users, a user

04:10.870 --> 04:15.160
who is not part of the group and users who did not create the file.

04:15.160 --> 04:22.270
The route user created the file so all other users can only view the contents of that file.

04:22.300 --> 04:27.700
Let's look at sites available, the identifiers telling us it is a directory.

04:27.700 --> 04:29.830
Who is it owned by Root.

04:30.460 --> 04:32.860
So the root user created that directory.

04:32.890 --> 04:34.360
Who is the group owner?

04:34.510 --> 04:35.740
It is root.

04:35.860 --> 04:39.850
What can the root user do in that directory?

04:39.880 --> 04:43.270
Read, write and execute.

04:43.420 --> 04:50.770
So what the root user can do is read the contents of that directory, create files or subdirectories

04:50.950 --> 04:56.080
inside that directory as well as enter that directory.

04:56.110 --> 05:00.730
Executable permissions are important when it comes to directories.

05:00.730 --> 05:07.510
Unless a directory has executable permissions, you cannot enter that directory.

05:07.760 --> 05:14.510
What can the group do with the sites available directly to the group owner is root, so any member of

05:14.510 --> 05:17.300
that group can list the contents?

05:17.480 --> 05:22.150
That is our read permission and they can enter the directory.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.250
It has executable permission.

05:24.260 --> 05:32.180
They cannot create any files or subdirectories inside the sites available directory all other users

05:32.180 --> 05:33.040
on the system.

05:33.050 --> 05:41.030
They have read and execute permissions so they can list the contents of the directory and they can enter

05:41.060 --> 05:41.870
the directory.

05:41.990 --> 05:43.730
They cannot create files.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.740
They cannot create subdirectories.

05:45.770 --> 05:53.570
They cannot delete any files unless you have right permissions inside a directory.

05:53.720 --> 05:56.000
You cannot delete anything.
