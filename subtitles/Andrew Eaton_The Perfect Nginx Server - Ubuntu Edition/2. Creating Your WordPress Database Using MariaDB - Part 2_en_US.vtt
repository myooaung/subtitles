00:03.240 --> 00:13.020
To log into periods, you need to use Sudo Maria DBI run ins with elevated privileges by Esquibel hyphen

00:13.020 --> 00:17.700
you, the hyphen you flag is how you specify as which you use.

00:17.970 --> 00:25.110
You would like to log in as we would like to log in as the my esquibel route user.

00:25.290 --> 00:30.990
I want to point out this is not your server's route user.

00:31.140 --> 00:37.380
This is the my esquibel route user, your sudo password for your user.

00:37.380 --> 00:40.050
And we have logged into Marea DB.

00:41.750 --> 00:50.560
Show databases will list the current databases first step, we need to create a new database.

00:56.100 --> 01:02.640
Create a database, leave a space database name followed by a semicolon.

01:02.790 --> 01:08.910
Now we need to give privileges on the database, grant all privileges on.

01:09.120 --> 01:17.580
I'm going to copy and paste the database name DOT airstrikes to apostrophe the username apostrophe et

01:18.060 --> 01:29.280
apostrophe localhost apostrophe identified by the password apostrophe the password apostrophe cime kolon.

01:29.340 --> 01:37.530
Now you need to flush privileges, flush privileges will refresh the database show database's.

01:37.560 --> 01:40.800
There is the database we created.

01:40.980 --> 01:44.730
If I use the show grants command for our user.

01:46.340 --> 01:53.060
It will display grant usage on the database name identified by the password.

01:53.090 --> 01:55.480
That was the long way of doing it.

01:55.520 --> 02:01.040
I'm going to show you a much easier and quicker method to create databases.

02:01.070 --> 02:03.230
I'd like you to open your text editor.

02:03.230 --> 02:09.490
Please open the file that contains the random characters that we copied from random dot org.

02:09.530 --> 02:16.190
I would then like you to create a new file at the top of the file, type your domain name, then type

02:16.190 --> 02:20.900
the database, name the database user and the database password.

02:20.900 --> 02:29.360
Underneath that type, the database commands create a database, grant privileges, flash privileges.

02:29.370 --> 02:32.930
Do this for every one of your sites.

02:33.140 --> 02:35.510
Let's go back to our random list.

02:36.440 --> 02:37.450
Do not copy.

02:37.700 --> 02:46.580
Rather cut the random string from your list of database name will be Why HP?

02:51.650 --> 02:53.900
Our database user will be be.

02:58.950 --> 03:06.900
Our database password will be Eppy seven, select database name and copy it, create a database, you

03:06.900 --> 03:11.870
can paste it, grant all privileges on the database name districts.

03:12.060 --> 03:20.730
Let's select the database user to Apostrophe Apostrophe, our database user identified by copy the database

03:20.730 --> 03:25.050
password and pasted in between the two apostrophes.

03:25.170 --> 03:31.610
Right from the beginning of the course I say to you, this course is not a copy and paste exercise.

03:31.800 --> 03:33.270
This is one exception.

03:33.450 --> 03:37.410
You've already typed all the commands in your text editor.

03:37.410 --> 03:43.620
We are just looking for a quicker and easier method where you have your database commands.

03:43.620 --> 03:47.730
Create a database followed by the database name and the semicolon.

03:47.760 --> 03:49.930
Leave a space and delete.

03:49.950 --> 03:52.640
Then you have your grant all privileges command.

03:52.710 --> 04:01.020
Go to the next semicolon, leave a space used, delete so you have semicolon space flash privileges,

04:01.200 --> 04:05.090
select the entire line and copy.

04:05.130 --> 04:06.680
You can go back to terminal.

04:06.870 --> 04:09.540
We are still logged in to Maria DB.

04:09.630 --> 04:17.220
Obviously if you are not logged into your database, you need to log into your database before you paste

04:17.250 --> 04:17.850
the line.

04:19.410 --> 04:28.770
Show databases, and there is our second database you can type exit, the second method is a lot easier.

04:28.980 --> 04:35.040
All you need do when you want to create your next site, save this file with a different file name.

04:35.040 --> 04:42.750
Add your new database name, database, user database password, replace them database commands, copy

04:42.750 --> 04:43.580
and paste.

04:43.590 --> 04:47.160
Please save this text file that you created.

04:47.340 --> 04:49.740
We will be coming back to it shortly.

04:49.770 --> 04:51.000
Your random string's.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.110
When you start cutting certain strings from it, save it each time.

04:55.140 --> 04:57.340
That's our database taken care of.

04:57.540 --> 05:02.250
Now we need to install the WordPress command line interface.

05:02.400 --> 05:07.260
In this lecture we created the database for our WordPress site.
