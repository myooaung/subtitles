WEBVTT

00:23.550 --> 00:30.030
Just a reminder that some of the lectures were recorded when you went to sixteen point zero four was

00:30.030 --> 00:32.530
still the latest Altius release.

00:32.730 --> 00:39.060
Not much has changed from 16 04 to 18 04 and now 20 04.

00:39.090 --> 00:41.880
The configuration largely remains the same.

00:41.880 --> 00:49.190
But you need to be aware that your VFP inversion differs from one LTE release to the next.

00:49.200 --> 00:56.850
You can see that quite clearly in the slot 16 zero four seven eight zero four seven point to twenty

00:56.850 --> 00:59.790
zero for the HP, seven point for that.

00:59.790 --> 01:01.170
You need to keep in mind.

01:01.200 --> 01:09.240
Another aspect is over time, certain directors are optimized or changed slightly to either improve

01:09.240 --> 01:10.980
performance or security.

01:11.070 --> 01:14.700
The House director is responsible for WordPress.

01:14.820 --> 01:17.440
Pretty permalink in the default file.

01:17.460 --> 01:19.050
We have trifocals files.

01:19.050 --> 01:22.500
Urai you are slash equals four four.

01:22.530 --> 01:30.140
In the video lectures I change the equals four four to slash index questionmark dollar args.

01:30.300 --> 01:34.950
That has changed and the recommended configuration is now slightly different.

01:34.950 --> 01:41.060
You need to add a dollar is underscore args after index dot speak.

01:41.130 --> 01:46.170
These changes are indicated in the PDF files that are attached to the relevant lecture.

01:46.320 --> 01:52.470
In this lecture we are going to continue configuring Ingenix server blocks, the commands you'll be

01:52.470 --> 01:53.700
using in this section.

01:53.820 --> 02:01.470
You've used all of them before, Kopi Nano, Ingenix half and T as well as reloading Ingenix.

02:01.650 --> 02:07.950
They are two configuration files default and a new configuration file which we shall create.

02:07.950 --> 02:13.710
They are both found in the Etsy Ingenix sites available directory.

02:13.890 --> 02:18.750
They are quite a few new directives which you're going to be exposed to.

02:18.750 --> 02:23.760
Before we get to them, let's move over to terminal in the sites available directory.

02:24.030 --> 02:25.650
I'm going to list the files.

02:25.680 --> 02:30.000
We have default and we have our default date back.

02:30.030 --> 02:34.410
We need to make a copy of the default file sudo seip default.

02:34.530 --> 02:39.210
The name that we giving the file this time is our domain name.

02:39.210 --> 02:44.550
In my case, WPEC allai dot com and listing will display the file.

02:44.550 --> 02:47.130
WPEC yellow dot com.

02:47.130 --> 02:50.870
That's open file we have just created using Nenna.

02:50.910 --> 02:56.850
The contents of WPK ally dot com correspond with the default file.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.860
Let's look at the information that's contained in WPEC allai dot com.

03:01.860 --> 03:08.870
All the information is enclosed in a server block at the top we have the listen director.

03:09.060 --> 03:15.690
The and directive sits the port on which the server will accept requests.

03:15.870 --> 03:23.790
At the moment our server is only accepting requests on Port Eighty, which is the HTP port.

03:24.090 --> 03:27.690
Now we come to the default server.

03:27.870 --> 03:36.090
When you look at the configuration file for our site, there is nothing in the file that refers to our

03:36.180 --> 03:37.350
domain name.

03:37.380 --> 03:41.130
This file is WP Ally dot com.

03:41.160 --> 03:45.520
There is nothing in this file that mentions the domain name.

03:45.690 --> 03:51.630
If I open my browser and I type in my IP address, I get welcome to Ingenix.

03:51.900 --> 03:56.790
If I type in my domain name, I get welcome to Ingenix.

03:56.970 --> 04:07.200
If I type in w w w dot followed by my domain name, I get welcome to Ingenix if I type Inforum dot wpec

04:07.230 --> 04:09.050
allai dot com the same.

04:09.060 --> 04:13.650
Welcome to Ingenix when a request is made to your server.

04:13.650 --> 04:22.650
In the case of WPEC Alikhan, if Engine X cannot fulfill that request, which it can't do, there is

04:22.650 --> 04:31.410
nothing in this file that relates to WPEC allai dot com engine X then displays what is called the default

04:31.590 --> 04:32.430
server.

04:32.460 --> 04:39.630
If you look a little further down, we have the server name direct of the underscore that you see there.

04:39.660 --> 04:42.600
You could call a catch all name.

04:42.960 --> 04:47.220
So what's happening is I'm typing WPEC ally dot com.

04:47.220 --> 04:53.040
So the request comes in to the server for that particular server name.

04:53.040 --> 04:58.770
The server name directive is where you define your virtual servers.

04:58.770 --> 05:03.570
The names, the server names should be WPEC align dot com.

05:03.570 --> 05:05.060
I don't have that name there.

05:05.100 --> 05:06.420
I have an underscore.

05:06.450 --> 05:10.230
So the request comes in for WPEC allai dot com.

05:10.410 --> 05:16.380
Ingenix cannot fulfill the request that's made for that particular server name.

05:16.560 --> 05:22.890
What happens then is Engine X displays the default server, which in this case, if you.

05:23.120 --> 05:31.700
Underneath, listen, you have the root directive that sits the root directory for requests, so my

05:31.700 --> 05:38.930
request for WPC Allai dot com was handled by the default server, the default server.

05:38.960 --> 05:44.870
The route is slash far slash W W W slash HTML.

05:44.990 --> 05:48.590
And underneath you have the index director.

05:48.800 --> 05:53.610
Now, the index directive defines the files that will be used as an index.

05:53.840 --> 05:57.650
These files are checked in the specified order.

05:57.650 --> 05:59.960
So Engine X will run along that list.

05:59.960 --> 06:06.950
It will find the file index dot, engine X, hyphen Debian and display that file.

06:06.980 --> 06:10.450
We also have two location contexts.

06:10.640 --> 06:14.450
The first one does not have a modifier.

06:14.460 --> 06:16.490
There is no modifier.

06:16.670 --> 06:24.650
The TRA files directive we will need to edit to accommodate pretty permalink in WordPress with the current

06:24.650 --> 06:25.430
directive.

06:25.460 --> 06:33.560
Engine X will check for the file at the funeral, then engine X will check for a directory.

06:33.770 --> 06:39.380
If he doesn't find a file or directory A 404 is displayed.

06:39.650 --> 06:42.230
The second location context.

06:42.350 --> 06:52.680
It's a case sensitive regular expression match for any files ending in p p engine X cannot process P.

06:52.760 --> 07:01.340
It relies on p, p, fpm to process the p p in this particular location context.

07:01.520 --> 07:11.690
Engine X is forwarding any files that end in DOT to a back end process p p if BPM and it's using the

07:11.690 --> 07:14.540
fast CGI protocol.

07:14.750 --> 07:19.010
Now we need to edit this file to set up our site.

07:19.190 --> 07:22.970
You can only have one default server.

07:22.970 --> 07:26.780
The default server is located in the file default.

07:27.110 --> 07:30.020
You need to remove default server.

07:32.750 --> 07:43.310
The directive, where is our site located in the filesystem slash va slash w w w slash WPEC allai dot

07:43.310 --> 07:47.450
com slash public underscore html.

07:47.580 --> 07:51.410
So we've specified our sites right now.

07:51.420 --> 07:54.010
We need to define the index file.

07:54.110 --> 07:56.560
We are setting up a WordPress site.

07:56.570 --> 08:08.000
All we need is index dot p p, the server name, WPEC ally dot com and w w w dot wallowed by the domain

08:08.000 --> 08:08.290
name.

08:08.420 --> 08:11.150
We need to edit this location context.

08:11.390 --> 08:19.780
You can remove the equals for ofl and change it to slash index dot p p questionmark dollar.

08:19.820 --> 08:22.490
R.G. is semicolon.

08:22.610 --> 08:25.460
That will enable pretty permalink.

08:25.850 --> 08:34.280
All we are saying is when a request is made, if engine X cannot find a file, it must look for a directory

08:34.280 --> 08:35.270
with that name.

08:35.270 --> 08:40.400
If not, it must fall back to a indexed dot before it's close.

08:40.400 --> 08:44.360
Neno saving the changes you have made to the file.

08:44.360 --> 08:48.130
We need to test the configuration test is successful.

08:48.470 --> 08:50.840
I'm going to go back one level now.

08:50.840 --> 08:58.880
You have a site available where we have been working and you have a directory called Sites Enabled.

08:58.880 --> 09:06.650
When you create a configuration file for a site in the sites available directory, you need to enable

09:06.920 --> 09:08.570
that particular site.

09:08.660 --> 09:18.110
You do that by creating a link from the sites available to the sites enabled directory sudo URL in I

09:18.110 --> 09:18.890
Finniss.

09:18.890 --> 09:26.660
We are creating a symbolic link followed by the full path to the file leave Espace, followed by the

09:26.660 --> 09:29.720
full path to the sites enabled.

09:37.060 --> 09:44.950
Finally, add the name at the end, it's changed to sites enabled, there is a file default followed

09:44.950 --> 09:50.620
by WP ally dot com to enable WPEC ally.

09:50.650 --> 09:57.700
We need to firstly test the configuration, which is successful and straight afterwards, we need to

09:57.820 --> 09:59.950
reload the configuration.

10:04.160 --> 10:10.370
So at this stage, all we need to do is install WordPress, once we've installed WordPress, we can

10:10.370 --> 10:18.410
then secure WordPress using both a command line and Ingenix, and then we will use surfboat to install

10:18.410 --> 10:21.750
our SSL certificates in this lecture.

10:21.770 --> 10:28.520
We covered the initial steps in configuring your server blocks, which will enable you to display your

10:28.520 --> 10:29.630
WordPress sites.
