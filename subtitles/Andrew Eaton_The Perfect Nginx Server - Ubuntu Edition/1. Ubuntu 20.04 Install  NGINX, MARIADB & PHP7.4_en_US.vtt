WEBVTT

00:15.010 --> 00:20.860
Please download the PDF attached to this lecture in this section of the course, we are going to install

00:20.860 --> 00:28.480
Ingenix, Maria, Debe and Engine is the Web server, Maria Debe, the database management system.

00:28.480 --> 00:35.600
And she is the server side scripting language that is responsible for generating dynamic page content.

00:35.620 --> 00:39.520
We are going to use the package manager to install the packages.

00:44.540 --> 00:50.510
There are a few commands we need to look at regarding the advanced package manager apt to install a

00:50.510 --> 00:55.210
package, we use Suda EPT install, followed by the package names.

00:55.400 --> 00:59.240
If you are installing a single package, you type the single package name.

00:59.240 --> 01:04.190
If you are installing multiple packages, you can leave a space after typing the first package name

01:04.190 --> 01:05.830
and then type the second package.

01:05.840 --> 01:07.840
Now you can continue in that fashion.

01:07.940 --> 01:15.380
If you are installing multiple packages to remove packages, you have two choices you can use sudo ept

01:15.380 --> 01:21.650
remove followed by the package names or sudo ept purge followed by the package names.

01:21.710 --> 01:28.250
The difference between remove and purge purge will remove the packages, including the configuration

01:28.250 --> 01:28.790
files.

01:28.820 --> 01:33.530
Remove will remove the packages, not the configuration files.

01:33.710 --> 01:40.760
If you want to search the repository for a particular package, you can use sudo at half in cash search

01:40.760 --> 01:48.290
followed by the package name if you want to display information about a particular package sudo encash

01:48.290 --> 01:50.390
show followed by the package name.

01:55.130 --> 01:59.730
We are going to install Ingenix from the official Ubuntu repository.

01:59.750 --> 02:02.250
We are going to install two packages.

02:02.270 --> 02:09.290
We are going to install the Engine X package, as well as the package called Leyb Engine X mod HTTP

02:09.290 --> 02:10.840
headers more volter.

02:10.850 --> 02:18.010
The second package allows you to add, set or clear any output or input header that you specify.

02:18.020 --> 02:25.250
We are going to use this particular package to help secure Ingenix once we've installed Engine X. We

02:25.250 --> 02:31.910
need to use the system CTO status, followed by the package name, in this case Engine X, to check

02:31.910 --> 02:35.330
the status of the Web server after installation.

02:35.510 --> 02:39.670
Please ensure you have logged into your server before you install any packages.

02:39.680 --> 02:42.620
Please ensure that the package list is up to date.

02:44.770 --> 02:46.420
Sudha ept update.

02:49.630 --> 02:51.580
All packages are up to date.

02:52.870 --> 03:00.110
Now we can install Ingenix Suda ept, we want to install after install leave space, the first package

03:00.110 --> 03:05.160
you want to install is Ingenix leave a space, then you tap the next package.

03:05.170 --> 03:08.230
I recommend you copy and paste the second package.

03:08.240 --> 03:13.090
No, you will find the package name in the PDF attached to the selector sudo app.

03:13.120 --> 03:19.480
Install Engine X and the package leyb ingenix mod http headers more folta.

03:21.220 --> 03:26.620
After pressing into the following, additional packages will be installed, the following new packages

03:26.620 --> 03:27.610
will be installed.

03:27.610 --> 03:32.710
After this operation, almost eight megabytes of additional disk space will be used.

03:32.740 --> 03:34.050
Do you want to continue?

03:34.090 --> 03:36.250
You can Tapasvi and enter.

03:41.940 --> 03:48.100
And that's all there is to installing Engine X and the LEAP Engine X Mod HTP hitter's package.

03:48.120 --> 03:53.730
What I'd like you to do now is open your browser and then type in your service IP address.

03:53.880 --> 03:57.860
The default engine X page should be displayed to you.

03:57.960 --> 04:01.590
I'm going to type in my service IP address after pressing enter.

04:01.620 --> 04:02.970
Welcome to Engine X.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.600
Engine X has been installed and is running back to terminal.

04:08.810 --> 04:17.330
Sudo Systems CTL, we want you to confirm the status of the service Ingenix Sudo System, CTL status

04:17.330 --> 04:21.200
and Genex the Engineer Service is active and running.

04:21.200 --> 04:24.080
No issues are listed due to quit.

04:29.160 --> 04:35.280
We are also going to install Maria Debe from the official Ubuntu repository, the package name that

04:35.280 --> 04:38.640
we want to install is Maria DBI hyphen server.

04:38.790 --> 04:45.020
As with Ingenix, check the status of the Maria DBI service after installing Maria Debe.

04:45.030 --> 04:47.130
I'm going to type the clear command.

04:51.560 --> 04:57.810
A few minutes ago, I installed Ingenix prior to installing Ingenix, updated the package.

04:58.250 --> 05:04.660
In this case, I don't need to update a package list right now, so I don't need to type SUDA update.

05:04.670 --> 05:07.040
I can simply type Sutta install.

05:07.040 --> 05:10.240
And the name of the package, Maria DB hyphen server.

05:10.340 --> 05:14.930
A lot of new packages are going to be installed on the server after this operation.

05:14.990 --> 05:18.940
One hundred and seventy three megabytes of additional disk space will be used.

05:18.980 --> 05:20.200
Do you want to continue.

05:20.210 --> 05:22.010
You can tap away and enter.

05:28.400 --> 05:37.130
Now we can check the status of the Maruja DV service, SUDA System, CTL status, Maria Debe, Maria

05:37.130 --> 05:40.550
DBE is active and running due to quit.

05:45.550 --> 05:52.480
As with Ingenix and Maria Debe, we are going to install seven point four from the official Ubuntu repository,

05:52.510 --> 05:58.800
the following modules are recommended for WordPress, the magic module.

05:58.930 --> 06:06.820
Please make a note, even if WordPress site health indicates that that is a required package, only

06:06.820 --> 06:09.700
install PHP magic if needed.

06:09.850 --> 06:15.680
The magic package has been replaced by the PGD package.

06:15.730 --> 06:22.250
If a particular plugin requires magic, then you are more than welcome to install it.

06:22.360 --> 06:28.860
You need to be aware that the magic module can cause issues with certain plugins.

06:28.870 --> 06:36.190
I'm going to type the clear command to do EPT install the first package we need to install this seven

06:36.190 --> 06:39.520
point four Hafen FPM you then the space.

06:39.550 --> 06:43.840
The second package you need to install is seven point four CD.

06:45.950 --> 06:51.390
After topping the GDP package, they leave a space, it's quite a long list of modules.

06:51.440 --> 06:53.900
There is an easier way of doing it.

06:56.950 --> 06:59.220
I'm going to type SUDEP in.

06:59.680 --> 07:06.040
When we look at all these module names, every module starts with seven point four hyphen.

07:06.070 --> 07:12.880
It's only the module name to the right of the hyphen that differs all packages except the hyphen is

07:12.880 --> 07:14.120
this H2 package.

07:14.320 --> 07:18.170
So you do have to install be seven point four hyphen.

07:18.190 --> 07:21.160
Now you open a curly bracket or Prezi.

07:21.190 --> 07:23.970
The first package is FPM comma.

07:24.130 --> 07:31.680
The second package is GD comma, third package is Jason comma and you type the rest of the module names.

07:31.690 --> 07:37.280
The last package name is Call You then close the curly bracket and the space.

07:37.360 --> 07:42.490
Now you type the last package name which is P hyphen s h to.

The following new packages will be installed after this operation, almost 23 megabytes of additional

07:49.500 --> 07:51.240
disk space will be used.

07:51.270 --> 07:52.500
Do you want to continue?

07:52.570 --> 07:53.100
Yes.

07:59.650 --> 08:09.430
Check the status of the FBN process after installing SUDA system, CTL status seven point four hyphen.

08:09.460 --> 08:14.200
If PM the status is active or running queue to quit.

08:14.380 --> 08:16.020
I'm going to type clear.

08:16.090 --> 08:22.090
So at this stage, we've installed Ingenix, Maria DB and seven point four.
