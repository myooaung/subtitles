00:05.150 --> 00:11.780
To create the best script to perform our database backups, you need the database name, the database

00:11.780 --> 00:16.540
user, the backup file name you would like to use as well as the command.

00:16.550 --> 00:20.510
In this case, it is my Eskil dubbed the database name.

00:20.540 --> 00:25.220
As I've shown you, WP hyphen config contains your database name.

00:25.220 --> 00:28.970
The database user is the backup file name.

00:29.030 --> 00:33.070
Use your site's name to avoid confusion.

00:33.080 --> 00:34.190
Please make note.

00:34.190 --> 00:39.260
The tactics are used around the date, not an apostrophe.

01:03.440 --> 01:11.590
Sudo my Eskil dump, we are working with Maria Debe, we run our database commands as an elevated user,

01:11.690 --> 01:13.910
I find you a database user.

01:13.910 --> 01:20.630
The database user is root the database name, get the name from WP config.

01:20.630 --> 01:28.100
The output of my ESKILD dump will become the input of GS with a level nine compression.

01:28.100 --> 01:37.230
The output of GS will then be stored in slash home user database backups slash filename.

01:37.280 --> 01:40.030
This is what the best script will look like.

01:40.250 --> 01:49.310
First line is your Shabangu line underneath the Shabangu line database name equals database user equals

01:49.310 --> 01:55.120
file name equals side name hyphen to back ticks in between the two back ticks.

01:55.310 --> 02:02.810
The date underneath file name we have oh my Eskil Dump Command in the best script.

02:02.930 --> 02:07.850
We don't need to use sudo because we run the script.

02:07.880 --> 02:11.510
We will run the script as an elevated user.

02:11.510 --> 02:18.350
So any commands in the script that require elevated privileges will already have those privileges.

02:18.560 --> 02:27.220
I'm in my home directory in a directory called Scripts NENO DB Database underscore my site name WPEC

02:27.230 --> 02:28.700
ally Dot S.H..

02:28.910 --> 02:34.130
The script first line is the Shibam line second line database name.

02:34.130 --> 02:43.130
You obtain the database name from WP config database user is route site name WPEC Yellow dot com hyphen.

02:43.130 --> 02:50.790
Back to date Hiva space plus per cent if underscore per cent our per cent minute back tick.

02:50.810 --> 02:58.880
The last line we have our command MySQL dump I find you know you don't specify the database name and

02:58.880 --> 03:01.940
the database user $ db user.

03:01.940 --> 03:08.870
We've already specified the database user above that route dollar database name.

03:08.870 --> 03:14.630
We've already specified the database name Peiping Symbol Jesus greater than sign.

03:14.660 --> 03:17.960
Now we need to specify the POS slash home.

03:17.960 --> 03:21.980
My user is and you use your user.

03:22.280 --> 03:24.920
Is there a particular directory.

03:24.920 --> 03:27.320
We want to save it to DB backups.

03:27.530 --> 03:32.210
Slash a file name dot fescue l dot Jesus.

03:32.500 --> 03:42.680
So our file name will be WPEC allai dot com ifn the date and time dot dot it you can Xanana saving your

03:42.680 --> 03:46.640
changes in script file must be made executable.

03:46.640 --> 03:50.170
S.H. Mod plus X followed by the file name.

03:50.330 --> 03:59.960
If I run the command without elevated privileges by escarole dump got error access denied for user varya

03:59.960 --> 04:00.590
db.

04:00.770 --> 04:07.070
We run as an elevated user sudo then followed by a period.

04:07.070 --> 04:08.520
Slash your script.

04:08.520 --> 04:12.860
Now let's go back one level and change to our database backups.

04:12.890 --> 04:18.620
The backup done at zero zero four one is the access denied the error.

04:18.620 --> 04:21.710
Look underneath that there is our backup.

04:21.710 --> 04:24.800
I'm going to remove the forty one file.

04:24.920 --> 04:27.350
Let's go back to scripts.

04:27.350 --> 04:30.740
So that is our database backup script for our first site.

04:30.740 --> 04:37.430
Now what happens when we add an additional site CPP existing file name followed by the new file name

04:37.430 --> 04:41.060
you then open the new file name using NENO.

04:41.060 --> 04:42.530
Change the database name.

04:47.650 --> 04:48.310
FileName.

04:57.080 --> 04:59.310
Everything else remains the same.

04:59.360 --> 05:05.660
You can exit NENO, so that's our database backups for WPC Allen Dotcom taking care of.
