In step 11, we are going to configure the WP config file, please refer to the WP config lecture.

You need to check the ownership and permissions in the event that you are installing caching or security

00:19.980 --> 00:26.860
plug ins, as well as modified the WP config file to allow for automatic call updates.

00:26.880 --> 00:33.710

00:34.680 --> 00:41.130
You can scroll down to the end of the file and add the WP Auto Update Core constant.

00:41.340 --> 00:44.020
You can then Xanana saving your changes.

00:44.190 --> 00:48.390

00:48.540 --> 00:51.060
Currently it's set at six forfour.

00:51.210 --> 00:58.710
If you install any security or any caching plugins, change the permissions to six, six four and then

00:58.710 --> 01:01.070
change it back to six forfour.

01:01.110 --> 01:06.780
When you are done, when you install certain plugins that need to write to the WP config file, you

01:06.780 --> 01:09.390

01:09.390 --> 01:16.140
Underscore HTML two seven seven five, then change it back again to seven FA five.
