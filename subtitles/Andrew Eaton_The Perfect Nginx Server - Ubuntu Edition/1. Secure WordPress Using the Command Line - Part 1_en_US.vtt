Please check the resources section of this lecture.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.700
There is a PDF download available.

00:23.840 --> 00:28.650
In this lecture, we are going to secure WordPress using the command line.

00:29.090 --> 00:38.120
We're going to start by editing WP config that we are then going to check the ownership of the WordPress

00:38.120 --> 00:41.490
files and directories after the ownership.

00:41.540 --> 00:45.920
We will look at the permissions on WordPress files and directories.

00:46.160 --> 00:49.740
Then we're going to create a simple Besch script.

00:49.760 --> 00:55.640
All the best script is it's a script that will run a series of commands.

00:55.670 --> 01:03.800
I need to point out to you, if I type dollar user, it is the same as typing the user name that I am

01:03.800 --> 01:04.310
working.

01:04.310 --> 01:10.090
As if you look at the example S.H. own, that command is used to change ownership.

01:10.100 --> 01:20.960
If I type my user Andrew or I type dollar user, it is exactly the same w w w hyphen data is the non-routine

01:21.110 --> 01:24.700
web server user WP config.

01:25.510 --> 01:31.670
We are going to allow Garecht updating using the dashboard by direct updating.

01:31.670 --> 01:34.430
You can update your themes and plugins.

01:34.610 --> 01:42.800
We are going to disable the built in editor that will prevent anyone from editing files using the WordPress

01:42.950 --> 01:43.610
editor.

01:43.640 --> 01:47.690
Then we need to look at permissions on WP config.

01:48.500 --> 01:50.100
The ownership is as follows.

01:50.240 --> 01:54.500
Your user is the owner of all the files and directories.

01:54.680 --> 01:57.500
The group owner is the web server.

01:57.500 --> 02:00.200
W w w hyphen TARTA.

02:00.230 --> 02:08.750
If you are using a commercial theme or plugin, you may need to change the ownership of the WP content

02:08.750 --> 02:16.400
directory to the web server as the owner and the web server as the group own getting the permissions

02:16.400 --> 02:23.480
right now just as important as ensuring the correct ownership your WordPress files as have permissions

02:23.480 --> 02:25.950
of six for four.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.160
That means the owner can read and write to the files.

02:30.200 --> 02:38.210
The group owner, the web server can read the files for all other users, can only read the files with

02:38.210 --> 02:39.200
directories.

02:39.230 --> 02:47.270
The owner can read, write, execute the group owner, the web server can read and execute.

02:47.450 --> 02:50.690
All other users can read and execute.

02:50.900 --> 02:58.880
WP content is where you store your uploads your themes, your plugins with WP content.

02:59.060 --> 03:07.550
The files need to have permissions of six, six, four and directories need permissions of seven seven

03:07.550 --> 03:08.150
five.

03:08.330 --> 03:15.680
The reason being, if you use the WordPress dashboard, the web server needs to be able to write inside

03:15.830 --> 03:17.470
those directories.

03:17.720 --> 03:26.090
This is applicable to Theme's plugins downloaded from WordPress dot org with commercial themes and plug

03:26.090 --> 03:26.510
ins.

03:26.660 --> 03:34.610
It's the same permissions on the entire site, including WP hyphen content, because with commercial

03:34.610 --> 03:40.190
themes and plug ins, the owner of WP content is the Web server.

03:40.220 --> 03:47.150
So having permissions on files of six for four will allow the Web server to read and write.

03:47.330 --> 03:54.650
When you update a theme or plugin or even uploading the few files, the permissions as well as the ownership

03:54.650 --> 03:58.160
on those files will end up being incorrect.

03:58.340 --> 04:05.540
If you use the WordPress command line interface to upload a file, the ownership will be your user as

04:05.540 --> 04:09.650
the owner and your user as the group owner.

04:09.650 --> 04:16.370
If you use the dashboard, the owner will be the web server and the group owner will be the Web server.

04:16.370 --> 04:17.960
No, that is not correct.

04:18.140 --> 04:24.770
The commands to change ownership as well as permissions are quite long and having to type them every

04:24.770 --> 04:28.580
single time you do an update ends up wasting a lot of time.

04:28.580 --> 04:31.820
We will make use of a Shell script.

04:31.970 --> 04:38.360
All the Shell script is that it will execute a series of commands you specify.

04:38.360 --> 04:41.090
I want to execute the following four commands.

04:41.120 --> 04:48.350
All you do is run the script and one after another, the script will execute those commands.

04:48.350 --> 04:56.240
We are going to make use of a shell script so we can speed up repetitive tasks like a shell script ends

04:56.240 --> 05:02.450
in DOT is A and it starts with what is called the Shabangu line.

05:02.450 --> 05:05.960
That is simply the path to the shell interpretor.

05:06.200 --> 05:12.440
The Shabangu line is hash, exclamation mark, slash, burn, slash bash.

05:12.740 --> 05:19.010
They are only three commands we will be using in this lecture, the S.H. own command, which is used

05:19.010 --> 05:22.790
to change ownership and the find to command the.

05:23.530 --> 05:32.650
Command is used to change ownership, the command with the hyphen uppercase R means that the command

05:32.800 --> 05:35.470
will be executed recursively.

05:35.620 --> 05:43.510
That means it's not only the top level directory, it's all the subdirectories and all the files inside

05:43.690 --> 05:46.690
those subdirectories after the hyphen.

05:46.690 --> 05:52.180
Or you type the user, which is the owner, Colon, and then the group owner.

05:52.390 --> 06:00.550
So in our case, it will be the user will be our user and the group owner will be the web server w w

06:00.550 --> 06:02.500
w hyphen darter.

06:02.620 --> 06:13.150
Then you type the path to your WordPress site, slash four, slash w w w slash site name slash public

06:13.300 --> 06:14.160
HTML.

06:14.290 --> 06:17.440
Then we're going to make use of the find command.

06:17.620 --> 06:24.310
We are going to say find in this path the type in the first case D for directory.

06:24.520 --> 06:29.560
Once all the directories have been found, execute this command.

06:29.740 --> 06:37.480
So we are going to execute the S.H. Mod which is used to change permissions and the permissions.

06:37.630 --> 06:42.520
We want seven five five to change the file permissions.

06:42.670 --> 06:51.160
We are saying find all the files in this path, then execute the sigmoid command and change the permissions

06:51.160 --> 07:00.130
of every file that you find to six full for the only configuration file we will be editing is WP hyphen

07:00.130 --> 07:02.030
config dot p.
