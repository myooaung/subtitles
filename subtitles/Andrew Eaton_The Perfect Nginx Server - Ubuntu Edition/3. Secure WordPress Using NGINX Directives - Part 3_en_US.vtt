WEBVTT

00:04.720 --> 00:08.840
I now want you to change to the global directory.

00:09.400 --> 00:15.910
We are going to create a new file, WordPress Security Dot seo in F.

00:24.270 --> 00:31.620
This file is going to contain the Engine X directives to help protect your WordPress site.

00:31.890 --> 00:37.800
Let's start with the directives to protect the important WordPress files.

00:38.040 --> 00:42.320
I've typed the directives on a single line.

00:42.330 --> 00:47.410
It's a location context containing a particular directive.

00:47.430 --> 00:56.850
If we look at the first one location, the equal sign is an exact match for the file, XML or PC dot.

00:57.960 --> 01:01.200
All access to that file will be denied.

01:01.320 --> 01:10.960
If we look at location told, Citrix indicates a case insensitive match for the file name.

01:10.980 --> 01:13.560
Read me Dot H.T. Emelle.

01:13.740 --> 01:22.380
So anybody tries to access read me dot html in lowercase or uppercase it will be denied.

01:22.590 --> 01:29.900
We also need to disable IP in the uploads plugins and theme directories.

01:30.060 --> 01:39.330
So if anyone manages to upload a file in one of those directories, they will not be able to execute

01:39.570 --> 01:42.120
that particular script.

01:42.450 --> 01:51.550
It is also a case insensitive match for a file in any one of those directories.

01:51.900 --> 01:55.670
We are also going to filter the request methods.

01:55.680 --> 01:59.460
The only method we will allow is post.

01:59.650 --> 02:07.590
Finally, we are going to filter suspicious query strings in the you are all non-standard requests.

02:07.600 --> 02:10.830
We are going to return a 403.

02:11.190 --> 02:15.920
You can exit saving your changes CD.

02:15.930 --> 02:17.670
We want to change directories.

02:17.880 --> 02:24.750
You want to go back one level and then change to the sites available directory.

02:25.650 --> 02:28.530
You can open your site's virtual host file.

02:28.530 --> 02:31.400
You need to be very careful where you place.

02:31.650 --> 02:33.840
They include file directive.

02:33.840 --> 02:43.230
Engine X will process the directives in order you don't place the include that prevents the execution

02:43.230 --> 02:47.730
of IP after the IP has already been processed.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.810
You place it before the context that is responsible for the processing of IP.

02:54.960 --> 02:56.490
Let me give you a demonstration.

02:56.490 --> 03:04.440
I'm going to include our WordPress directives after the location context that is responsible for handing

03:04.440 --> 03:09.030
over the scripts to see if PM I'm closing there.

03:09.040 --> 03:11.210
No saving changes to the file.

03:11.210 --> 03:15.580
Let's test the configuration and let's restart Ingenix.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.790
I'm changing directories to my sites.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.310
WP content directory.

03:20.340 --> 03:23.670
I'm then going to change to the uploads directory.

03:23.700 --> 03:25.410
Inside the uploads folder.

03:25.410 --> 03:28.500
I've created a simple info file.

03:28.500 --> 03:29.910
I've taught my domain name.

03:29.910 --> 03:33.210
WP Content Uploads one, two, three DOT.

03:34.350 --> 03:38.610
The IP is being executed in my uploads directory.

03:38.610 --> 03:40.530
That is not what you want.

03:40.530 --> 03:48.060
You do not want any IP to be executed inside the WP content directory.

03:48.180 --> 03:49.650
Let's go back to terminal.

03:53.660 --> 03:56.670
I'm going to open my sights configuration file.

03:56.690 --> 04:01.740
So what is happening now is they include DirecTV referring to the WordPress.

04:01.760 --> 04:11.030
Security has been placed after the location context that is responsible for processing Engine X will

04:11.030 --> 04:14.730
process these directives in order.

04:14.780 --> 04:17.330
I'm going to remove the include line now.

04:17.330 --> 04:26.270
I have placed the include DirecTV above the location context responsible for processing engine X will

04:26.270 --> 04:29.180
read the configuration file in order.

04:29.180 --> 04:36.760
It will process our include DirecTV before it processes the DirecTV exit.

04:36.770 --> 04:44.540
No, no saving the changes in T to test our configuration ingi or to reload Ingenix.

04:44.570 --> 04:46.370
Let's go back to our browser.

04:46.460 --> 04:51.440
I'm going to reload the same file this time for O3 forbidden.

04:51.470 --> 05:03.380
Exactly what we want cannot be executed in the WP Content Directory and all subdirectories of WP content.

05:13.780 --> 05:22.010
We now want to configure our HTTP response headers, please ensure you are in the Etsy slash Ingenix

05:22.060 --> 05:25.030
directory from the Etsy Ingenix directory.

05:25.060 --> 05:30.460
We want to change to the global directory inside the global directory.

05:30.670 --> 05:33.710
So you do not know it is not SEO enough.

05:33.730 --> 05:35.030
We want to create the file.

05:35.040 --> 05:40.540
It is not SEO enough to store our HTTP response header directive's.

05:40.780 --> 05:46.970
In the PDF file attached to this lecture you will find the ad header directive's.

05:46.990 --> 05:55.230
You can copy and paste the ad header directives from the PDF into this particular file headers dot seo.

05:55.240 --> 06:03.250
And if you can exit NENO saving your changes, a listing will now display headers dot seo in.

06:03.250 --> 06:11.500
If we want to go back one level and change to the sites available directory, we want to open our sites

06:11.530 --> 06:12.820
configuration file.

06:12.940 --> 06:19.540
You can scroll down to the line that contains Jutras Files Directive COMPRIS Enter twice.

06:19.630 --> 06:29.770
Now we are going to make use of the include directive include global slash headers dot seo in f semicolon.

06:29.770 --> 06:34.890
You can exit neno saving your changes to the site's configuration file.

06:34.900 --> 06:41.920
We want to test the configuration in G.T. to enable the changes in G.R..

06:47.720 --> 06:50.370
You can open your sites configuration file.

06:50.390 --> 06:54.620
You can go to the last curly bracket press, enter and then tab.

06:58.080 --> 07:05.700
I've already discussed with you the advantages of turning the access log file off, especially if your

07:05.700 --> 07:11.490
site is busy, if it's a new site you are busy creating, you can turn your access log on.

07:11.490 --> 07:15.810
It gives you insight as to who is visiting your site.

07:15.810 --> 07:23.370
Access log leave a space followed by the past's slash bar slash log slash Ingenix.

07:23.400 --> 07:30.960
Now, what I like to do inside each site's configuration file, if I turn on the log file, I don't

07:30.960 --> 07:37.200
have a single log file called Access for all of the sites on the server.

07:37.200 --> 07:47.130
Each site has its own log file access, underscore name of the site, log semicolon and I do exactly

07:47.130 --> 07:48.870
the same for the error log.

07:49.020 --> 07:51.840
It makes troubleshooting much easier.

07:56.530 --> 08:07.420
Era underscore log path var log Ingenix era underscore name of the site dot log semicolon you can exit

08:07.420 --> 08:10.780
neno saving changes to the file.

08:10.870 --> 08:14.680
Its test the configuration and restart Ingenix.

08:17.180 --> 08:26.300
The listing will display excess, underscore WPEC, a log log and error, underscore WPEC ally dot log.

08:36.510 --> 08:44.370
If I use the cat command, it will display the contents of that particular file, the error log file

08:44.370 --> 08:45.510
is empty.

08:45.690 --> 08:56.460
The location of your log files, CD slash file, slash log, Ingenix there is access WPC Alive Dot Log

08:56.790 --> 09:00.330
and error WPEC Ally Dot Log.

09:00.490 --> 09:05.480
If I use the cat command, I can display the contents of that file.

09:05.790 --> 09:16.050
If you look at the dates, 21, 22, 23, 24 hour log files are being rotated on a daily basis.

09:16.330 --> 09:23.220
CD slash ATC slash log rotate dot d.

09:23.460 --> 09:29.640
A listing of the log rotate dot d directory will display a file.

09:29.640 --> 09:34.380
Ingenix We can open that file using neno.

09:37.540 --> 09:40.040
This is your log rotate file.

09:40.210 --> 09:47.110
This is where you can specify how long do you want to keep a log file before it is rotated?

09:47.290 --> 09:52.360
Do you want to compress the file once the file has been compressed?

09:52.510 --> 09:54.890
How long do you want to keep it?

09:55.090 --> 09:57.700
I'm going to change daily to weekly.

10:01.410 --> 10:11.160
Rotate, I'll keep my log files for 52 weeks, you can exit saving your changes, your log files will

10:11.160 --> 10:20.900
be rotated on a weekly basis and the server will store 52 weeks worth of Engine X log files.

10:21.120 --> 10:28.440
In this lecture, we continued securing WordPress, this time using Engine X directive's.
