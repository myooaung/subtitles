00:15.000 --> 00:21.060
Please download the PDF attached to this lecture in this section, you are going to log into your server

00:21.060 --> 00:24.240
and start the process of pardoning the server.

00:24.300 --> 00:31.530
This is the process of enhancing server security through a variety of means which results in a much

00:31.530 --> 00:34.680
more secure server operating environment.

00:34.890 --> 00:41.580
This process will be completed firstly as the route user and then as a non route user.

00:41.590 --> 00:45.140
Please ensure that you have created a server instance.

00:45.180 --> 00:52.110
As per the lecture on websites, you will need to make a note of the server IP and the route user's

00:52.110 --> 00:52.890
password.

00:57.930 --> 01:04.890
Using S.H., you are going to log in to your server, it's most important that you have set up terminal

01:04.920 --> 01:07.030
as per the section software.

01:07.140 --> 01:13.470
We are going to open terminal and then log in to the server using SSL, which we will log in initially

01:13.620 --> 01:18.560
as the router user, the steps that we are going to complete as the route user.

01:18.570 --> 01:22.970
Firstly, after logging in, we will change the route user's password.

01:23.010 --> 01:27.560
Then we are going to add a new non-routine user to the server.

01:27.570 --> 01:33.900
We will give that new non route user the ability to invoke route privileges.

01:34.060 --> 01:39.720
We then you to configure the server to prevent anyone logging in as the route user.

01:39.780 --> 01:45.420
Finally, after completing these steps, we will log out of the server as the route user and log in

01:45.420 --> 01:48.750
as a non route user with route privileges.

01:48.900 --> 01:52.230
To log into your server, you need to open terminal and type.

01:52.230 --> 02:00.510
The SS command is actually the space user, which will be route at the server IP address after typing

02:00.530 --> 02:08.040
s h route at your service IP address, you will be prompted to accept or deny the server fingerprint.

02:08.040 --> 02:13.680
After accepting the server fingerprint, you will be prompted to type the route user's password.

02:13.680 --> 02:18.150
After typing the route user's password, you will log in to your server.

02:18.150 --> 02:21.990
Before we get to that step, let's look at the server fingerprint.

02:27.060 --> 02:34.830
Server authentication or the server fingerprint is a process that allows client applications to validate

02:34.830 --> 02:36.320
a service identity.

02:36.360 --> 02:43.320
When you connect to a server, you want to be sure it is the correct server you are connecting to.

02:43.440 --> 02:49.770
The first time you log into any server, you will be prompted to accept or deny the connection based

02:49.770 --> 02:51.980
on the servers fingerprint.

02:51.990 --> 02:58.170
When you accept the service fingerprint, it is stored locally on subsequent connections.

02:58.390 --> 03:04.140
It will check and compare the locally stored fingerprint with that on the server.

03:04.170 --> 03:07.470
If they match, the connection to the server will continue.

03:07.620 --> 03:12.810
If there is a mismatch, you will be warned that the service fingerprint has changed.

03:12.960 --> 03:20.760
If the server fails the host key authentication process, then it's possible that the servers host key

03:20.760 --> 03:21.750
has changed.

03:21.780 --> 03:28.170
This change could be due to an operating system reinstallation or it could mean someone has carried

03:28.170 --> 03:31.590
out a spoofing or man in the middle attack.

03:31.740 --> 03:36.930
If you didn't reinstall the server operating system, do not continue with the connection.

03:36.930 --> 03:43.230
Recheck the server details carefully, as it could also be due to you typing the incorrect details.

03:43.470 --> 03:49.980
If you reinstall the server operating system, the mismatch is a consequence of that reinstallation.

03:49.980 --> 03:56.970
You then need to remove the old or existing server fingerprint if you reinstalled the server operating

03:56.970 --> 03:57.460
system.

03:57.510 --> 04:04.850
This can be done by editing the known hosts file and removing the entry that corresponds to your server.

04:04.860 --> 04:12.330
You can open the file using a text editor and remove the entire line that contains your servers IP address.

04:12.570 --> 04:15.450
This is what a known hosts file looks like.

04:15.450 --> 04:18.600
The IP address followed by the server fingerprint.

04:18.810 --> 04:25.110
If you administer multiple servers, each service fingerprint will be added to the known post file.

04:25.110 --> 04:26.760
I'm going to log in to my server.

04:26.760 --> 04:30.090
So at this stage you need to open terminal Windows users.

04:30.120 --> 04:32.730
You can open Commander Mac and Linux users.

04:32.730 --> 04:35.550
You can open terminal the commander's SS.

04:35.620 --> 04:41.850
Actually, the space route at now I need my service IP address in the vulture control panel.

04:41.880 --> 04:44.580
I'll click on my servers hostname IP address.

04:44.580 --> 04:46.890
I can copy back to terminal.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.630
I can paste the IP address.

04:48.810 --> 04:53.790
The authenticity of host followed by my IP can't be established.

04:53.790 --> 04:56.220
Are you sure you want to continue connecting?

04:56.220 --> 05:00.900
The first time you log in, you will be prompted to accept the server fingerprint.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.610
We want to continue connecting.

05:02.610 --> 05:09.450
You need to type the word yes and then press enter route at my service IP password back to the vulture

05:09.450 --> 05:13.530
control panel and I will copy the password back to terminal.

05:13.560 --> 05:19.410
I can paste the password and I have logged in to my server as the route user.

05:19.410 --> 05:22.410
Periodically I will be typing the clear command.

05:22.470 --> 05:27.810
The clear command will clear the information from the screen and position the prompt at the top left

05:27.810 --> 05:30.690
hand corner in the Linux Essential Skill Section.

05:30.690 --> 05:32.850
We have looked at the terminal prompt.

05:32.850 --> 05:34.770
I'm briefly going to look at it again.

05:34.890 --> 05:37.650
The user is route at the hostname.

05:37.650 --> 05:40.980
My hostname a boonchu 20 zero four Kolon.

05:41.010 --> 05:47.670
The told indicates I'm in the user's home directory, so I am currently in the route user's home directory.

05:47.670 --> 05:51.210
The hash indicates I'm working as the route user.

05:51.240 --> 05:57.420
The flashing underscore is waiting for me to type a command current working directory TWD.

05:57.420 --> 06:01.770
I'm currently located in the slash root directory slash route.

06:01.770 --> 06:04.140
Is the home directory off the route.

06:04.140 --> 06:10.560
User vulture's method of providing the route pass through to you is secure enough, but I recommend

06:10.560 --> 06:12.930
you change the route user's password.

06:12.960 --> 06:16.920
Use a mixture of letters, numbers and special characters.

06:16.920 --> 06:22.200
The password must be secure to change the password of the current user.

06:22.200 --> 06:29.640
The current user that I'm working, as is the route user you type VSS, W.D., new password.

06:29.670 --> 06:33.660
You need to type your desired password as a security precaution.

06:33.660 --> 06:37.970
You will not see any characters appear on the screen as you type the password.

06:38.010 --> 06:40.530
The new password will need to be typed twice.

06:40.710 --> 06:44.370
Please make a note of the route users new password.

06:44.370 --> 06:49.320
I need to retype my password password updated successfully.

06:49.380 --> 06:52.140
Now I need to add a new user to the server.

06:52.170 --> 06:58.830
This user will be a non rude user, but the user will have route privileges by having route privileges

06:58.830 --> 07:05.010
means that my user will be able to perform administrative tasks on the server that are the job of the

07:05.460 --> 07:05.970
user.

07:05.970 --> 07:12.150
Before I add my user, I'm going to list the files to be found in the home directory.

07:12.150 --> 07:14.550
The home directory is empty.

07:14.580 --> 07:18.840
The command is add user Niva Space, followed by the user name.

07:18.840 --> 07:21.870
I'll use the user name Andrew in selecting a user name.

07:21.870 --> 07:26.430
Please use lowercase letters and numbers or just lowercase letters.

07:26.670 --> 07:34.020
After pressing into adding user Andrew, adding new group Andrew, creating a home directory slash home

07:34.020 --> 07:37.680
slash Andrew, now I need to type a password for the user.

07:37.710 --> 07:44.070
Andrew, I need to confirm the password for my user password updated successfully and I'll be prompted

07:44.070 --> 07:45.320
for full name.

07:45.330 --> 07:52.200
You can press, enter room number, enter work phone, enter home phone, enter other enter.

07:52.230 --> 07:53.820
Is the information correct.

07:53.820 --> 07:54.330
Yes.

07:54.570 --> 07:58.410
If you press your up there ok you will repeat the previous command.

07:58.410 --> 08:05.400
So if I press at once add user Andrew if I press my Baraki again Ellis slash home inside slash home

08:05.400 --> 08:11.820
we have a directory called Andrew above we can see creating a home directory slash home slash Andrew.

08:11.910 --> 08:17.110
The command to delete or remove a user is in the PDF attached to this lecture.

08:17.130 --> 08:20.040
So now we've added a non root user to the server.

08:20.040 --> 08:23.310
Now we need to give that user route privileges.

08:23.520 --> 08:32.580
The command is v.i. sudo visu do will open the file slash etsi slash sudo is dot tmp.

08:32.610 --> 08:40.110
Most important, this file is only edited with the command v.i. sudo do not attempt to edit this file

08:40.110 --> 08:40.800
manually.

08:40.800 --> 08:44.850
You can scroll down to the comment user privilege specification.

08:44.970 --> 08:50.400
Any line that starts with the hash is a comment underneath user privilege specification.

08:50.400 --> 08:52.350
We have route to the right of route.

08:52.350 --> 08:53.790
We have all equals.

08:53.790 --> 08:54.810
All, all, all.

08:54.810 --> 08:56.100
Now we top the user.

08:56.100 --> 08:56.760
We added.

08:56.820 --> 09:04.140
In my case, Andrew, now you need to top the falls as indicated above all equals open bracket.

09:04.140 --> 09:06.560
All colon, all closed brackets.

09:06.560 --> 09:07.620
Space all.

09:11.310 --> 09:19.380
The first all indicates that this rule will apply to all hosts, the second all the user is able to

09:19.380 --> 09:21.970
run commands as all users.

09:21.990 --> 09:27.650
The third, all the corresponding user is able to run commands as all groups.

09:27.690 --> 09:35.010
The last all indicates that these rules will apply to all commands, that all the above indicate that

09:35.010 --> 09:43.800
the corresponding user in my case, Andrew, will be able to run any command with SUDO if my user provides

09:43.830 --> 09:44.670
the password.

09:44.820 --> 09:46.650
Now we need to close the file.

09:46.770 --> 09:55.170
Saving the changes that we have made to the sudo is not peafowl control x save modified buffer you can

09:55.170 --> 09:58.080
tap Y for yes file name to write.

09:58.080 --> 09:59.700
Do not make any changes.

09:59.880 --> 10:01.670
You can simply press enter.

10:01.800 --> 10:08.270
If I press Mobarak to repeat the Vasudha command, my user has been given privileges.

10:08.280 --> 10:10.410
We have not made any changes to this file.

10:10.410 --> 10:17.430
If our top control x vasudha seduced or Tempy unchanged, one of the most important steps in server

10:17.430 --> 10:21.150
security route user login must be disabled completely.

10:21.240 --> 10:24.600
To do that, we need to edit a configuration file.

10:24.630 --> 10:29.280
This configuration file is the SS HD underscore config file.

10:29.400 --> 10:34.230
Its location in the file system is slash BTC slash.

10:34.260 --> 10:42.960
If each CD I want to change directories slash BTC, I'm going to press enter a listing of the contents

10:42.960 --> 10:45.150
of the directory.

10:45.270 --> 10:46.320
I'll scroll up.

10:46.500 --> 10:47.790
There is the directory.

10:47.910 --> 10:53.820
It says when you look at your prompt, your prompt is indicating your current location in the file system.

10:53.820 --> 10:56.580
You are in the slash EDC directory.

10:56.580 --> 10:59.220
We now want to change to the directory.

10:59.250 --> 11:03.470
That is a local path name change directory ESUs H.

11:03.690 --> 11:12.270
Look at the change in the prompt code slash ITC slash edge and this thing will display the SS HD underscore

11:12.270 --> 11:13.080
config file.

11:13.110 --> 11:15.030
That is the file we want to edit.

11:15.060 --> 11:16.650
We will come back to that file short.

11:16.650 --> 11:22.050
The top CD CD will always take you back to the home directory.

11:22.170 --> 11:23.670
I'm in my home directory.

11:23.670 --> 11:32.220
The file I want to edit is located in the slash EDC slash its directory CD Change Directory Slash indicates

11:32.220 --> 11:32.910
my route.

11:33.210 --> 11:42.000
Etsy is just off the route slash esus edge and enter the second slash is simply acting as a separator.

11:42.030 --> 11:43.890
Please make a note of the file.

11:43.890 --> 11:45.900
Is this underscore config.

11:45.900 --> 11:50.340
Its location in the file system is slash slash its edge.

11:50.370 --> 11:55.050
Before we edit any configuration file, make a backup copy of the file.

11:55.050 --> 12:01.200
You never know when disaster strikes and you need a copy of the original configuration file.

12:01.290 --> 12:08.150
Copy we want to copy, followed by the name of the file in this case SS HD underscore config.

12:08.220 --> 12:16.560
Leave a space, then you retype the file name is this H.T. underscore config but add a dot back to the

12:16.560 --> 12:18.510
filename after pressing enter.

12:18.630 --> 12:25.620
And if you list the files, we now have a new file added to the list is this underscore config the back.

12:25.770 --> 12:31.320
If you want to restore a particular configuration file, you reverse the filenames.

12:31.530 --> 12:37.260
The command to keep the file name is is this underscore config vacay.

12:37.440 --> 12:38.640
Then you leave a space.

12:38.760 --> 12:45.240
The new file name would be is this H.T. underscore config and you have restored the configuration file

12:45.390 --> 12:48.980
back to its original state using your backup file.

12:49.140 --> 12:51.120
Now we want to edit the file.

12:51.310 --> 12:53.460
This is HD Underscore Config.

12:53.580 --> 12:56.610
The editor that we use with the boon to is NENO.

12:56.730 --> 13:03.690
So you type NENO often and you type the file name which is is this HD underscore config.

13:03.690 --> 13:06.700
I'm going to top control X to close Nnenna.

13:06.720 --> 13:12.390
We made no changes to the file, therefore we were not prompted to save any changes.

13:12.390 --> 13:20.130
KDDI back to my home directory right at the top I typed CD slash EDC slash s h.

13:20.160 --> 13:24.480
I change to the directory that contained the file that I wanted to edit.

13:24.630 --> 13:30.360
Further down I typed and then followed by the file name to open that particular file, Inanna and start

13:30.360 --> 13:33.300
editing that is using the local Pauw name.

13:33.420 --> 13:36.030
I can also use the absolute last name.

13:36.060 --> 13:41.070
The absolute path name will be the path to the file from the root directory.

13:41.130 --> 13:41.730
So it's in there.

13:41.730 --> 13:44.670
No, the the space slash my route.

13:44.790 --> 13:53.010
The next directory is slash s h slash esus hd underscore config press enter.

13:53.040 --> 13:58.350
I will open the Asus HD underscore config file using the absolute path.

13:58.380 --> 14:05.190
I prefer you to use the first method change to the directory that contains the file and then open the

14:05.190 --> 14:07.800
file using a local POV name.

14:07.830 --> 14:10.670
It gives you practice using the CD copy.

14:11.270 --> 14:18.020
As well as a better understanding of where the various configuration files are located in the file system,

14:18.170 --> 14:22.160
KDDI Slash ETEK Slash is such a listing.

14:22.370 --> 14:28.750
The file we want to edit is this underscore config NENO followed by the filename press enter.

14:28.910 --> 14:31.250
We will open the file using Nannar.

14:31.430 --> 14:37.460
As with most configuration files and Ilan's starting with a hash is a comment.

14:37.700 --> 14:40.040
If you scroll down you will find a comment.

14:40.080 --> 14:44.200
Authentication underneath authentication permit login.

14:44.210 --> 14:47.870
Yes, you need to remove yes and type no.

14:47.990 --> 14:52.460
We now want to close neno control x save modified buffer.

14:52.460 --> 14:57.620
We are being prompted because we made a change to the file type y file name to write this.

14:57.620 --> 15:00.050
This would underscore config press enter.

15:00.170 --> 15:08.570
As with most changes in configuration to enable the change you need to restart the service that is associated

15:08.570 --> 15:11.450
with the configuration file that you were editing.

15:11.660 --> 15:16.130
The service that there is this HD config file controls is a Secich.

15:16.250 --> 15:23.930
So what we need to do now to enable the change in configuration, we need to restart the service.

15:28.180 --> 15:37.390
You need to type system CTL, the system ctrl command is used to restart or reload or to start or stop

15:37.390 --> 15:40.300
various services on the server system.

15:40.310 --> 15:45.760
CTL is the services manager utility, so we type system CTL.

15:46.090 --> 15:47.080
What do we want to do?

15:47.090 --> 15:49.460
We want to restart Uniacke space.

15:49.480 --> 15:55.330
Now you need to type the name of the service that you want to restart, which is a Secich.

15:55.690 --> 16:00.930
At this stage we are finished working as the root user to log out of your server.

16:00.970 --> 16:06.430
You can type the command exit log out connection to my IP closed.

16:06.670 --> 16:08.850
I have logged out of my server.

16:09.010 --> 16:15.310
