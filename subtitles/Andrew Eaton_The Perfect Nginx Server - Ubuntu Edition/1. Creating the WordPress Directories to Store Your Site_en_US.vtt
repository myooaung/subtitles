00:17.300 --> 00:23.630
In this lecture, we are going to create the directory structure for our various sites earlier in the

00:23.630 --> 00:24.230
course.

00:24.260 --> 00:35.150
I created the following entries using name keeps free DNS, WPEC allai, dot com and alias to WPEC ally

00:35.150 --> 00:37.550
dot com w w w dot.

00:37.550 --> 00:42.590
And I created two subdomains, blog and forum.

00:42.590 --> 00:57.490
The server web route is located in slash va slash w w w ownership of slash va slash w w w is root root.

00:57.500 --> 01:07.160
When you create directories, I recommend you name the directory, your domain name slash public underscore

01:07.370 --> 01:08.420
HTML.

01:08.450 --> 01:16.970
All your WordPress files would then be inside the public HTML directory to get an overview of the directory.

01:16.970 --> 01:20.470
Layout will use a utility called Tree.

01:20.630 --> 01:25.160
In this lecture we are going to be using the S.H. own command.

01:25.280 --> 01:27.410
That is to change ownership.

01:27.410 --> 01:31.790
We need to create a few directories mkdir.

01:31.940 --> 01:39.620
When you create a directory you can at the same time create the subdirectory by using the hyphen.

01:39.800 --> 01:43.610
P Flag Tree is a package that we will install.

01:43.640 --> 01:47.030
There are no configuration files in this lecture.

01:47.300 --> 01:57.410
Let's change to the slash via slash w w w directory listing with a half an L flag displays the ownership

01:57.410 --> 02:06.710
route route and at the moment there is an existing directory called H.T. Emelle inside slash file slash

02:06.710 --> 02:17.810
w w w the correct ownership is your user as the owner and the web server as the group owner.

02:17.810 --> 02:25.190
We are still in the early stages of setting up our WordPress sites so the ownership we can make our

02:25.190 --> 02:32.870
user our user, so the ownership we will make in my case, Andrew as the owner and Andrew as the group

02:33.470 --> 02:36.530
do we need to invoke route privileges?

02:36.740 --> 02:45.170
S.H. Own Hyphen R and it's an uppercase are the user we want to give ownership to is Andrew.

02:45.170 --> 02:55.570
The group we want to give ownership to is Andrew and the path is slash far slash w w w a long listing

02:55.580 --> 02:59.240
now will show us the ownership is Andrew.

02:59.570 --> 03:00.230
Andrew.

03:00.380 --> 03:03.160
It's no longer route route.

03:03.350 --> 03:06.710
Now we want to create the directory for our first site.

03:06.710 --> 03:13.910
MK Dei are followed by the domain name and there is WPEC allai dot com.

03:13.910 --> 03:15.680
It's changed to that directory.

03:15.830 --> 03:17.990
A listing will show you that it's empty.

03:18.020 --> 03:22.730
We want to create another directory and call this directory public.

03:22.730 --> 03:25.820
Underscore HTML a listing.

03:25.820 --> 03:32.090
There is directory public on the scope html, KDDI space two periods.

03:32.090 --> 03:36.780
We want to go back one level to the w w w directory.

03:36.800 --> 03:40.380
Now we have two more directories that we need to create.

03:40.610 --> 03:48.260
Log dot WP Ally dot com and forum dot WPEC yellow dot com.

03:48.260 --> 03:51.740
That is for our subdirectories mkdir.

03:51.800 --> 04:03.920
Only this time we add the hyphen p flag log dot wp seelie dot com slash public underscore html compress

04:03.920 --> 04:12.200
your up error key remove block and I'll add for change to the block directory unless there is our public

04:12.200 --> 04:19.940
underscore html directory sudo hepcat install and we want to install the package tree.

04:25.040 --> 04:33.500
You can type treat at the prompt and there is a view of our Web route directory, we have now created

04:33.770 --> 04:40.490
the directories and the subdirectories that are going to store our WordPress sites.
