00:05.030 --> 00:08.190
I'd like you to change to your home directory CD.

00:08.360 --> 00:10.470
I'm going to type the clear command.

00:10.490 --> 00:13.950
We are now going to create a Besch script.

00:14.120 --> 00:22.550
It's important that your WordPress files and directories always have the correct ownership and the correct

00:22.700 --> 00:23.620
permissions.

00:23.780 --> 00:30.950
When you install a plugin using WPEC ALLAI, your permissions will be your use for both the owner and

00:30.950 --> 00:33.030
the group when you use the dashboard.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.570
The ownership will be the Web servers.

00:35.570 --> 00:43.070
The owner and the web server is the group and it would be a waste of time to have to retype the commands

00:43.280 --> 00:45.020
that we talked a little while ago.

00:45.050 --> 00:50.980
Every single time that you happen to perform a plugin update or theme update.

00:51.170 --> 00:57.440
We are going to if I can use the term, automate the process, we are going to create what is called

00:57.440 --> 00:59.240
a Besch script.

00:59.420 --> 01:06.710
You can type NENO, followed by WP, underscore own and then her dot S.H..

01:06.710 --> 01:11.780
We are going to create a file called WP underscore ownership.

01:11.780 --> 01:15.440
Underscore permissions dot s h.

01:16.250 --> 01:23.490
All scripts start with what is called the Shabangu line, which is hash tag, exclamation mark slash

01:23.490 --> 01:27.590
open slash Besch underneath the Shabangu line.

01:27.590 --> 01:30.290
I'm going to add the commands that we talked.

01:30.470 --> 01:33.800
We start with ensuring the ownership is correct.

01:34.460 --> 01:35.570
Only half an hour.

01:35.720 --> 01:43.340
Your user is the owner w w w Dota is the group owner, followed by the path to our site.

01:43.490 --> 01:51.290
The first to find commands will ensure that the directories are seven five five and the files are six

01:51.290 --> 01:53.840
four for the last two find commands.

01:54.020 --> 02:03.140
The files need to have permissions of six six four and directories need permissions of seven seven five.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.040
You can exit.

02:04.040 --> 02:06.440
No, no saving your changes.

02:08.510 --> 02:15.350
To run a best script, it's period forward slash, followed by the following permission denied because

02:15.350 --> 02:19.580
our script does not have executable permissions.

02:19.790 --> 02:26.480
C.H. Mod you change permissions plus X followed by the name of the script.

02:26.900 --> 02:34.370
If I list the contents of my home directory, look at the permissions, read, write, execute, read,

02:34.370 --> 02:37.360
write, execute, read, execute.

02:37.400 --> 02:42.110
If I look at the listing above that read, write, read, write, read.

02:42.260 --> 02:44.030
Let's go back to our sites.

02:44.180 --> 02:45.950
Webroot, look at the file.

02:45.950 --> 02:47.900
Read me dot html.

02:47.930 --> 02:52.250
It has permissions of read write six read four.

02:52.310 --> 02:55.880
Read for permissions of six for for.

02:56.030 --> 02:58.700
Let's change the permissions to 400.

03:00.840 --> 03:06.370
Four hundred, only the owner can read that particular file.

03:06.390 --> 03:08.880
You can see the change in permissions.

03:08.880 --> 03:15.930
Let's go back to our Home Directory CD to run a best script period forward slash, followed by the name

03:16.260 --> 03:17.010
of the script.

03:20.280 --> 03:29.640
Let's go back to our sites root directory, read me dot html permissions are six four for WP content

03:29.640 --> 03:32.700
is correct seven seven five.

03:32.910 --> 03:35.640
Let's open our browser and view the site.

03:35.820 --> 03:40.020
I'm going to type the domain name without the W WW.

03:40.020 --> 03:42.000
I'm just going to tap in the address bar.

03:42.030 --> 03:50.580
WordPress has redirected WPC allai dot com to w w w dot its log into our dashboard.

03:51.060 --> 03:53.190
It's check the installed plug ins.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.420
Let's delete.

03:54.420 --> 03:55.260
Hello Dolly.

03:58.830 --> 04:01.140
And it's update kismet.

04:06.570 --> 04:10.780
Updating plug ins using the dashboard is working perfectly.

04:10.800 --> 04:20.310
However, if you are prompted for FTP, login details go back to terminal and all you do sudo system

04:20.320 --> 04:22.050
ctrl restart.

04:22.950 --> 04:30.390
If you should have no further problems updating your plugins and theme's using the dashboard, lets

04:30.390 --> 04:31.990
go back to terminal.

04:32.040 --> 04:35.390
It's changed to the WP content directory.

04:35.430 --> 04:37.020
Look at the directory upgrade.

04:37.050 --> 04:45.030
Ownership is the web server as the owner and the web server as the group owner gets changed to the plugins

04:45.180 --> 04:45.900
directory.

04:45.930 --> 04:52.560
It Kismet is owned by the web server, both the owner and the group owner.

04:52.680 --> 04:54.460
That is not correct.

04:54.480 --> 04:56.060
As I've already mentioned.

04:56.220 --> 05:04.680
If you update using the dashboard because the web server has right permissions inside the WP content

05:04.680 --> 05:12.350
directory, any plugins you add using the dashboard will automatically be owned by the Web server.

05:12.360 --> 05:20.220
If you were using WPEC allai, the ownership would be your user and your user code.

05:20.670 --> 05:22.410
Let's go to our home directory.

05:22.620 --> 05:25.380
There is our ownership and permissions script.

05:25.380 --> 05:31.560
I'm going to clear the screen period forward slash followed by the name of our best script.

05:31.830 --> 05:35.040
Let's change back to our site directory.

05:37.660 --> 05:44.860
If I change to the WP content directory, the ownership and permissions are now correct, looking to

05:44.860 --> 05:48.160
upgrade our user web server.

05:48.200 --> 05:50.710
That's changed to Plugins Kismet.

05:51.040 --> 05:56.530
Our user is the owner and the Web server is the group owner.

05:56.770 --> 06:05.980
If you log into your dashboard and you cannot delete a plugin, restart the FP service that will clear

06:06.160 --> 06:08.350
the IP up cache.

06:08.380 --> 06:12.440
We have now secured WordPress using the command line.

06:12.700 --> 06:16.860
Now we need to secure WordPress using Ingenix.

06:17.050 --> 06:23.920
We need to configure our Ingenix server block to aid in securing and optimizing WordPress.

06:23.950 --> 06:30.670
You can change to the Etsy Ingenix sites available directory and open your sites.

06:30.670 --> 06:32.890
Ingenix configuration file.

06:34.750 --> 06:40.420
In this lecture, we looked at securing WordPress, using the command line interface.
