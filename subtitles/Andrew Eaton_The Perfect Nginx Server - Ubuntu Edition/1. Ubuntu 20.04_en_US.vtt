00:05.050 --> 00:14.000
The to 220 04 was released in April of 2029, as with all previous long term support releases, 20 04

00:14.000 --> 00:18.900
will be supported for five years until April 2025.

00:18.950 --> 00:21.800
I've mentioned this countless times in the course.

00:21.800 --> 00:27.800
Kewaunee don't switch to a new server distribution a few weeks after the release.

00:28.010 --> 00:33.200
Take your time, test your site thoroughly before you move to the new release.

00:33.380 --> 00:37.300
The majority of my sites are using 18 04.

00:37.310 --> 00:49.340
I'm going to skip 20 04 and move to 22 04 sometime between December 2022 and March 20 23 unless there

00:49.340 --> 00:51.660
is a compelling reason to upgrade.

00:51.680 --> 00:55.310
I recommend you skip the next LTE release.

00:55.490 --> 01:05.690
So, for example, if you are using 18 zero for SKIP 20 04 and then move your sites to 22 04, what

01:05.690 --> 01:13.040
do I class as a compelling reason to look at the upgrade date for 14 04 to 16, 04?

01:13.230 --> 01:18.350
It was almost immediately after 16 04 was released.

01:18.470 --> 01:26.450
The reason was given the performance of B seven over five TotEx was incredible.

01:26.480 --> 01:29.210
That necessitated an early upgrade.

01:29.360 --> 01:34.490
The first and most important requirement of a server distribution is stability.

01:34.680 --> 01:39.070
18 04 has proven to be extremely stable and secure.

01:39.080 --> 01:46.310
I'm not going to risk moving my sites to a new server distribution without waiting at least six months

01:46.520 --> 01:51.330
that will allow time for any early bugs and vulnerabilities to be Ondaatje.

01:51.350 --> 01:58.580
Another topic that you may have read is that seven point four is faster than seven point two.

01:58.700 --> 02:05.060
That may be, but when you add caching to the configuration, the 10 per cent speed increase offered

02:05.060 --> 02:08.930
by seven point four over seven point two is negated.

02:09.140 --> 02:12.110
The speed increase will play a minor role.

02:12.110 --> 02:19.670
If no form of caching is used without caching, your site will be very slow as every request made to

02:19.670 --> 02:23.240
your site will hit up and the database.

02:23.390 --> 02:27.440
Once we've set up the WordPress site, we will secure that site.

02:27.440 --> 02:29.960
We will do this layer by layer.

02:30.110 --> 02:32.120
The same with optimization.

02:32.120 --> 02:37.640
We are not just going to install a WordPress site, add a caching plug in and leave it at that.

02:37.760 --> 02:42.410
We will look at HTP caching as well as object caching.

02:42.560 --> 02:49.430
The course optimization is set up as follows when a WordPress page or post is requested.

02:49.550 --> 02:54.230
Firstly, check the cache is the page or posts cached.

02:54.380 --> 02:57.050
If it is, serve the page or post.

02:57.230 --> 02:59.330
This is extremely fast.

02:59.480 --> 03:02.480
It's almost on a par with a static site.

03:02.720 --> 03:09.290
The reason it is so fast is that we have bypassed heating up and the database there.

03:09.290 --> 03:16.010
Again, it will make no difference if you are using P p seven point two or seven point four with reference

03:16.010 --> 03:22.160
to this course, the only updates that are of interest to us are the updated versions of Engine X,

03:22.160 --> 03:30.050
Maria DB and the newer versions address issues in earlier releases and improve performance.

03:30.260 --> 03:37.100
There is also a downside that there could be undiscovered issues and vulnerabilities that are only discovered

03:37.250 --> 03:42.380
as the new release becomes more widely used with reference to Engine X.

03:42.380 --> 03:48.500
In relation to this course, there are no configuration differences between one two eight zero four

03:48.500 --> 03:50.360
and twenty zero four.

03:50.390 --> 03:56.120
You need to be aware of the various versions that are used with each distro.

03:56.210 --> 04:05.000
Eight zero for users, seven point two twenty zero for users, seven point four with twenty point zero.

04:05.000 --> 04:14.810
For any directive that refers to the FBI process, you need to ensure it reads seven point four hyphen

04:14.810 --> 04:19.670
if PM and not HTTP seven point to hyphen if PM.

04:19.670 --> 04:24.620
There are no configuration differences that relate to the database management system.

04:24.620 --> 04:25.520
Marea DB.

04:25.610 --> 04:31.160
As I've mentioned, you need to be aware of the version that is released with each distro.

04:31.310 --> 04:40.520
This is only a concern when we manually create a configuration file and need to refer to the FPM process

04:40.700 --> 04:41.450
when needed.

04:41.480 --> 04:45.860
I'll be adding new updated lectures to the course to give you an example.

04:45.860 --> 04:53.600
The name stack to install, secure and optimize Ingenix, Maria DB and BB seven point four are the adding

04:53.600 --> 04:57.710
a new updated twenty point zero for lecture to the course.

04:57.920 --> 05:04.610
You need to make a note of this and when needed, jump to the relevant twenty point zero four lectures.

05:04.790 --> 05:11.510
Currently in the course under the lamp stack, you will have one two six zero four and eight zero four.

05:11.540 --> 05:16.550
I'm going to add Ubuntu twenty point zero four to that section of the course.

05:16.580 --> 05:24.470
You need to skip the six zero four and eight zero four lectures and watch the 20 zero four lecture with

05:24.470 --> 05:29.340
Ubuntu 20 zero four do not add any unofficial repositories.

05:29.540 --> 05:36.680
All packages will be installed from the official Ubuntu repositories only when the situation arises

05:36.680 --> 05:37.460
in the course.

05:37.610 --> 05:45.860
I will pointed out in that particular lecture the configuration of Ingenix Maria Debe and remains the

05:45.860 --> 05:46.370
same.

05:46.370 --> 05:52.070
No matter if you are using Ubuntu 18 zero four or 20 zero four.

05:52.220 --> 05:57.940
If there are any minor differences, I will indicate this in the lecture concerned.

05:58.190 --> 06:04.750
In this section, we looked at the latest Ubuntu release twenty point zero four in relation to this

06:04.760 --> 06:05.300
course.
