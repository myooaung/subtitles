00:17.520 --> 00:24.030
Hello and welcome to my course, the perfect Ingenix server, I'm Andrew Eidson, and I'm going to be

00:24.030 --> 00:26.070
your instructor for this course.

00:26.350 --> 00:29.700
I created this course for the complete beginner.

00:29.700 --> 00:33.570
You need no previous experience with unmanaged service.

00:33.870 --> 00:34.800
Holderness.

00:35.190 --> 00:39.180
I'll teach you everything you need to know in a step by step.

00:39.540 --> 00:47.010
Easy to understand method before you jump in and discover the wonderful world of Engine X and unmanaged

00:47.010 --> 00:47.670
service.

00:48.030 --> 00:52.830
I need to draw your attention to a few aspects about this course.

00:58.010 --> 01:05.720
I'm assuming that you are able to navigate the Udemy interface and view all the lectures, all my lectures

01:05.720 --> 01:13.580
are full of high definition, so please select the high definition option for Crystal-Clear lectures.

01:18.920 --> 01:26.480
I don't demonstrate anything to you, I teach you my teaching style is not to demonstrate how to do

01:26.480 --> 01:30.540
something, but rather to empower you to do it.

01:30.590 --> 01:34.310
I will never say do this, then do that.

01:34.460 --> 01:39.600
I will explain why you need to do it and then teach you how to do it.

01:39.620 --> 01:44.840
I will explain every step and why that step needs to be followed.

01:45.410 --> 01:51.290
You will gain the knowledge and most importantly, an understanding of the topic.

01:51.500 --> 01:57.110
You won't be faced having to listen to me reading from the screen for hours on end.

01:57.110 --> 02:03.620
You won't be faced by endless talking head shots with me waffling about unimportant topics.

02:08.690 --> 02:15.620
If you're not sure about something, please ask for my help and advice in the Course Q&amp;A section, I

02:15.620 --> 02:21.800
am very prompted responding to your questions regarding any aspects of the course.

02:21.830 --> 02:25.740
This course is not a copy and paste exercise.

02:25.880 --> 02:29.760
Please do not copy and paste commands.

02:29.900 --> 02:32.780
Take your time and talk about each command.

02:32.780 --> 02:35.090
You will make mistakes.

02:35.090 --> 02:39.820
Everyone does simply retype the command and move on.

02:39.830 --> 02:44.760
Please follow my lectures in order and don't skip lectures.

02:44.960 --> 02:48.580
This is essential, especially if you are a beginner.

02:48.590 --> 02:56.560
I'm teaching you step by step and each lecture builds on the skills you learned from the previous lecture.

02:56.570 --> 02:58.840
I need to mention forums and blogs.

02:58.850 --> 03:04.280
I will teach you how to set up a secure and fast engine powered server.

03:04.280 --> 03:11.570
Do not install any additional or unnecessary packages on your server just because you read on some blog

03:11.570 --> 03:15.380
or forum that you must install this package.

03:15.380 --> 03:18.740
A server is kept lean and fast.

03:18.740 --> 03:23.260
You only install what's needed, nothing else.

03:23.300 --> 03:28.940
If you have completed my other course, please feel free to skip the section.

03:28.940 --> 03:30.470
Lennix BASIX.

03:35.460 --> 03:43.200
If you are using Mac OS, Windows or Linux, you need to be proficient with your operating system of

03:43.200 --> 03:43.710
choice.

03:43.740 --> 03:50.730
By that, I mean you must be able to perform basic tasks such as downloading and installing software,

03:50.730 --> 03:57.430
creating directories, copying and moving files from one directory to another.

03:57.450 --> 04:00.970
You must also have a basic knowledge of WordPress.

04:01.020 --> 04:08.400
I won't be teaching you how to use WordPress, but rather how to set up and configure a secure, fast

04:08.400 --> 04:13.300
engine ICS based server, which in turn serves your WordPress sites.

04:13.500 --> 04:21.660
I will be covering the installation and configuration of certain plugins that aid in the usage and performance

04:21.900 --> 04:24.820
of your site to complete the score successfully.

04:24.840 --> 04:30.070
You need no experience using Linux or server administration.

04:30.090 --> 04:34.280
I will teach you step by step the skills you need.

04:34.290 --> 04:36.530
There will be no control panel.

04:36.540 --> 04:41.850
Every step you take is going to be accomplished by using the command line.

04:41.880 --> 04:49.620
A control panel can make server administration easier, but it's full of bloat and components you never

04:49.920 --> 04:50.480
need.

04:50.760 --> 04:55.400
We are going to start with only a username and password.

04:55.410 --> 05:01.440
Then layer by layer we are going to set up and configure your server.

05:01.440 --> 05:05.670
Configuring an unmanaged server is relatively easy.

05:05.730 --> 05:12.630
All it involves is installing a few software packages and editing a few configuration files.

05:12.660 --> 05:17.910
You will be amazed at how easy it actually is and you are going to wonder why.

05:17.940 --> 05:22.350
Why did it take me so long to move to an unmanaged server?

05:22.380 --> 05:29.130
At the end of the course, you will be serving your WordPress sites using the best web server available.

05:29.550 --> 05:36.990
Ingenix, give me a few hours of your time and with very little effort on your part, you will be serving

05:36.990 --> 05:39.660
your sites using Ingenix.
