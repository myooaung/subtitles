This lecture we are going to look at, nano nano is a very basic ed that we are going to be using to

00:30.170 --> 00:32.960
edit various configuration files.

00:33.050 --> 00:40.830
Nano is a very basic ed that is installed by default on most Linux distributions.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.570
We will be using Nano to edit various configuration files throughout the course.

00:47.810 --> 00:52.910
Nano has shortcuts for saving quiting searching.

00:53.300 --> 00:59.000
The most common shortcuts are listed at the bottom of the screen.

00:59.150 --> 01:06.290
When you look at the bottom of Nano, you see what are called the carrot shortcuts.

01:06.320 --> 01:16.310
The carrot symbol is short for control, for example, to exit control ICS, to search for a particular

01:16.310 --> 01:17.090
term.

01:17.090 --> 01:23.460
We use control w those are the carrot shortcuts.

01:23.480 --> 01:29.200
The most common shortcuts are the ones that you see at the bottom of the screen.

01:29.240 --> 01:34.880
There are a lot more for a list of shortcuts that NENO offers.

01:34.910 --> 01:41.260
You can use control G that will open a list of shortcuts at the top.

01:41.270 --> 01:44.840
You can see the carrot shortcuts further down.

01:44.840 --> 01:47.700
You see the M shortcuts.

01:47.900 --> 01:56.840
That's not the letter M instead of using control and the letter you would use out and the letter, if

01:56.840 --> 01:59.670
you look at the bottom, the shortcuts have changed.

01:59.690 --> 02:05.000
We want to exit Nanos, help control X throughout the course.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.560
We will only be using three shortcuts control X, that is to exit.

02:11.570 --> 02:19.760
If you open a file and you make changes to the file, if you then exit, you will be prompted to save

02:20.000 --> 02:24.320
the changes you've made to the file exactly the same as when you use the word processor.

02:24.350 --> 02:34.250
If it's a very large file, you can periodically save your file using control to write out or save the

02:34.250 --> 02:34.660
file.

02:34.670 --> 02:42.340
We will also be using control w where is that is to search for a particular term.

02:42.350 --> 02:46.760
So we have the correct shortcuts that are displayed at the bottom of the screen.

02:46.790 --> 02:49.490
Those refer to the control button.

02:49.490 --> 02:53.210
You have your M shortcuts, not the letter M.

02:53.390 --> 03:00.440
It is referring to using the alt button MAC users neno an assault on a Mac keyboard.

03:00.860 --> 03:02.870
Do not work on a Mac.

03:02.990 --> 03:05.480
You would press escape.

03:05.480 --> 03:09.650
We won't be using any alt shortcuts in this course.

03:09.650 --> 03:17.810
Only three of the carrot shortcuts control X to exert control over safe control.

03:17.810 --> 03:22.070
W to search to start using NENO on the command line.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.480
All you would do is type nenna.

03:24.500 --> 03:29.150
We will be using NENO to edit existing files.

03:29.180 --> 03:35.510
The command is almost the same NENO followed by the path to the file.

03:35.510 --> 03:37.880
In this lecture we looked at NENO.
