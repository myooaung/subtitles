00:20.120 --> 00:27.260
Now we need to create what is called a config file, a config file makes logging into servers much faster

00:27.260 --> 00:28.100
and easier.

00:28.280 --> 00:32.540
There is no need to remember different user names and IP addresses.

00:32.570 --> 00:36.020
You log in using what is called an alias.

00:36.050 --> 00:40.850
My server has been configured to only allow this key authentication.

00:40.850 --> 00:43.760
So to log into my server, I need to type a Secich.

00:43.760 --> 00:47.150
Then I need to specify the identity file hyphen I.

00:47.270 --> 00:50.420
The identity file is the path to my private key.

00:50.420 --> 00:55.930
Where's my private key dot SSA slash followed by the private key file name.

00:55.940 --> 00:56.930
Leave a space.

00:56.960 --> 01:01.580
Then I need to type my username at my service IP address.

01:04.270 --> 01:09.160
The command is fairly long to type every time you want to login to your server.

01:09.190 --> 01:16.360
A problem arises when you start administering multiple servers, having to remember different ipis,

01:16.360 --> 01:21.340
different usernames and possibly even different key files becomes an issue.

01:21.430 --> 01:29.200
Instead of having to type that command, a config file will allow you to type SSL followed by an alias.

01:29.210 --> 01:36.490
So instead of you having to remember multiple usernames, keys ipis, you simply need to remember the

01:36.490 --> 01:37.060
alias.

01:37.240 --> 01:44.200
Please note that the config file is created locally on your PC or Mac, not on the server, and the

01:44.200 --> 01:48.700
conflict file is created in the DOT SS directory of your PC or Mac.

01:48.730 --> 01:52.230
You need to specify the following variables in a config file.

01:52.270 --> 01:59.440
The host that is the alias for the server, the hostname that is your servers IP address the user,

01:59.590 --> 02:04.770
that is the ornon root user that you log into the server as the identity file.

02:04.810 --> 02:07.030
That is the path to your private key.

02:07.030 --> 02:15.580
The server alive Intervale sits atop of value in seconds after which if no data is received from the

02:15.580 --> 02:21.330
server, SSA will send a message to the server requesting a response.

02:21.550 --> 02:28.420
The server, Alaf Count Mac's variable sets the number of server alive messages that can be sent.

02:28.420 --> 02:32.680
Those two variables prevent your connection from timing out.

02:32.680 --> 02:37.080
Every few minutes I'm going to list the contents of the directory.

02:37.090 --> 02:40.080
Please ensure you are not logged into your server.

02:40.090 --> 02:42.460
You create a config file locally.

02:42.550 --> 02:47.650
Neno dot s h slash and the file name is config.

02:47.770 --> 02:53.200
In the PDF attached to this lecture you will find the variables host.

02:53.410 --> 02:57.000
That is the alias I'm going to call mine Lubutu.

02:57.160 --> 02:59.560
You can call it anything you like.

02:59.740 --> 03:02.590
Hostname is your service IP address.

03:05.400 --> 03:09.940
The user is the non-unique user that you log into your server with.

03:09.960 --> 03:18.660
In my case, it's Andrew, the identity file, as it sit told, which indicates how Slashdot is followed

03:18.660 --> 03:28.170
by your private key filename server love Intervale 60 server laugh Carmex 120 control x save modify

03:28.170 --> 03:36.230
buffer file name to write DSH slash config press mobarak to repeat the l e s h command.

03:36.240 --> 03:41.370
We have a new file added to the dot s directory and that file is called config.

03:41.490 --> 03:47.180
To log in to my server I type the command s s h followed by my adeus would.

03:49.590 --> 03:55.890
Into passphrase, that is the passphrase to unlock my private key and I have logged into my server using

03:55.890 --> 03:57.240
a config file.

03:57.270 --> 04:02.010
I'm going to top exit, so I've added one server to my config file.

04:02.040 --> 04:07.590
Now, you want to add an additional server to your config file, neno dot DSH slash config.

04:07.590 --> 04:12.810
Underneath the existing variables, you simply copy and paste the variables from the PDF.

04:13.020 --> 04:15.330
You go up just after host.

04:15.480 --> 04:17.310
Say it's a CentOS server.

04:17.340 --> 04:20.400
I'll call my alias C8 Hostname.

04:20.580 --> 04:28.740
You add your servers, IP address user, whatever user you have created on your server identity file,

04:28.740 --> 04:32.210
you can use the same key or you can generate a new Kippy.

04:32.400 --> 04:38.730
So that is how you add the second server, exactly the same procedure when you want to add the server.

04:40.800 --> 04:46.950
Control Kay will remove an entire line at a time, save, modify, buffer, no.

04:47.400 --> 04:52.620
So from this point forward, when you want to log into your server, you simply need to type this edge,

04:52.710 --> 04:54.750
followed by your alias.

04:56.750 --> 05:03.170
We need to unlock your private key and you will log into the server using a Secich key authentication

05:03.170 --> 05:04.910
and a config file.
