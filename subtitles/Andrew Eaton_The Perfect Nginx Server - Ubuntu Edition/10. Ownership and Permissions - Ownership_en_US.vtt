00:05.350 --> 00:14.020
When it comes to ownership, you have the owner, you have a group owner, and then you also have other

00:14.050 --> 00:20.980
uses, the owner is a user who created the file or directory.

00:20.980 --> 00:30.100
Any file or directory a user creates is automatically owned by that user and that users group.

00:30.340 --> 00:38.710
Whenever you add a user on your server, that user is created and a group with the same name is also

00:38.800 --> 00:39.560
created.

00:39.610 --> 00:45.190
We're now going to look at the owner, the group owner and other users.

00:45.400 --> 00:51.450
Let me start by referring you back to the listing of the Ingenix directory.

00:51.490 --> 00:59.920
There are two columns that are of interest to us, the non charactor permissions column and the ownership

00:59.920 --> 01:00.370
column.

01:00.400 --> 01:08.050
The ownership column displays the file or directory owner on the left and the file or directory group

01:08.050 --> 01:09.790
owner on the right.

01:09.970 --> 01:19.390
Looking at the list, all the files are owned by the route user and the group owner is the route group.

01:19.630 --> 01:27.910
When we work with permissions and ownership, there are three types of users the owner, the group owner

01:27.910 --> 01:30.910
and then the other user.

01:30.910 --> 01:36.310
The owner is a user who created the file or directory.

01:36.430 --> 01:45.340
Any file or directory a user creates is automatically owned by that user and that users group.

01:45.580 --> 01:54.760
Whenever you create a user on your server, that user is created and a group with the same name is also

01:54.970 --> 02:03.580
created by different users can be added to a group and that group of users can be given permissions

02:03.580 --> 02:06.550
on files or directories.

02:06.550 --> 02:10.810
Groups are used to organize users on a server.

02:10.840 --> 02:13.320
Now we get to other users.

02:13.510 --> 02:23.050
The other user is a user who didn't create the file and is not part of the same group as the owner.
