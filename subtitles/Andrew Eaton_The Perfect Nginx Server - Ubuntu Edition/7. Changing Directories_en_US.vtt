00:12.660 --> 00:20.550
If you look at the prompt, we are currently in the root directory of our hard disk drive, if you type

00:20.560 --> 00:29.670
CD followed by Enter, you will change to your home directory, which you can identify by the tool.

00:30.180 --> 00:40.890
If you type CD forward slash without a pass and press enter, you will change to the root directory

00:41.040 --> 00:42.930
from the root directory.

00:42.960 --> 00:47.250
I want to change to the FTC directory now.

00:47.250 --> 00:51.870
The Etsy directory is a local passed name.

00:51.900 --> 00:53.930
It is of the root.

00:54.090 --> 00:59.250
The change is reflected in our prompt from the Etsy directory.

00:59.310 --> 01:08.820
I would like to change to the PM directory that is a local path name CD back to home.

01:09.000 --> 01:20.760
If I wanted to change from my home directory to the CPM directory, I would need to specify the absolute

01:21.060 --> 01:27.480
PathÃ© CD, slash the root Etsy, slash PMB.

01:27.720 --> 01:37.770
If I type CD to change directress leave a space followed by two periods, I will go back to the parent

01:37.920 --> 01:38.800
directory.

01:38.820 --> 01:43.370
In this case, the parent directory of RPM is Etsy.

01:43.500 --> 01:47.160
We are now back in the Etsy directory.

01:47.310 --> 01:55.350
If I type CD, leave Espace followed by hyphen, I will change to the previous directory.

01:55.440 --> 01:59.790
The previous directory we were located Etsy PM.

01:59.790 --> 02:10.470
If I type CD Space Hafen I will go back to etsi CD all on its own will take us back to home if I type

02:10.470 --> 02:11.070
CD.

02:11.070 --> 02:18.510
Hafen what was the previous directory we were in etsi on back in EBC CD Halfon.

02:18.510 --> 02:22.290
It's very useful for switching between two directories.

02:22.290 --> 02:23.670
In my home directory.

02:23.670 --> 02:34.740
I have a directory called a it's not CD slash a the minute I add a slash after CD, I need to specify

02:34.860 --> 02:37.040
the absolute path name.

02:37.080 --> 02:40.740
That is the path name from the Roots.

02:40.770 --> 02:43.020
No such file or directory.

02:43.020 --> 02:47.790
I need to specify a local pathing CD.

02:47.970 --> 02:59.880
A If I wanted to specify the absolute path name to a CD, slash my route home my user a that is the

02:59.880 --> 03:12.810
local path name CDK versus the absolute path name where I specify the path from the Roots CD Slash will

03:12.810 --> 03:16.470
take us to our route directory from the root.

03:16.650 --> 03:19.710
I want to change to the VA directory.

03:19.860 --> 03:22.950
VA is just off the route.

03:22.950 --> 03:25.890
I don't need to specify slash.

03:25.890 --> 03:29.310
It is a local path name from VA.

03:29.340 --> 03:32.760
I'd like to change to the log directory.

03:32.760 --> 03:42.510
It's a local PathÃ© CD space followed by two periods will take us back to the parent directory.

03:42.570 --> 03:44.640
What is the parent directory of log?

03:44.790 --> 03:48.450
It is VA CD all on its own.

03:48.600 --> 03:51.780
Takes us back to our home directory.

03:51.930 --> 04:02.910
If I wanted to change to the VA log directory from my home directory, there is no VA directory in my

04:02.910 --> 04:04.020
home directory.

04:04.020 --> 04:08.430
Slash VA is indicating it is off the route.

04:08.760 --> 04:16.950
So if I typed Kadivar slash log, there is no such directory in my home directory to change from my

04:16.950 --> 04:26.160
home directory directly to VA slash log, I need to specify the absolute path name.

04:26.340 --> 04:34.110
Let's look at the commands that we have covered in the lecture lists is used to list the contents of

04:34.110 --> 04:35.340
a directory.

04:35.340 --> 04:38.940
There are two flags that I would like you to make note of.

04:39.090 --> 04:47.040
Hyphen A is to display all files and directories, including hidden files and hidden directories.

04:47.040 --> 04:52.620
Hyphen L for a long list to change to your home directory.

04:52.740 --> 04:58.020
The command is code to change to a specific directory.

04:58.020 --> 05:07.350
You can use the absolute path name or the local POS name, absolute path name it CD Forward Slash followed

05:07.350 --> 05:11.490
by the absolute POS if you are using a local post.

05:12.050 --> 05:21.350
Could leave a space followed by the local path to change to the parent directory, could leave a space

05:21.590 --> 05:31.070
to periods to change to the previous current directory, could leave a space followed by a hyphen at

05:31.070 --> 05:31.850
this stage.

05:32.030 --> 05:34.450
You may be feeling a little lost.

05:34.460 --> 05:40.400
You may be concerned that you don't have access to a limbic system to practice these commands.

05:40.400 --> 05:43.160
Don't worry about it at this stage.

05:43.190 --> 05:51.380
When we log onto our server, all of the commands I've shown you in this lecture, we will type and

05:51.380 --> 05:54.620
I will guide you step by step.
