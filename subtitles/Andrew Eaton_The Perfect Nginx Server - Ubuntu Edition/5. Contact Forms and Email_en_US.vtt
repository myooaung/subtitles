In this lecture, we are going to look at contact form seven and workpiece post is SMTP mail.

00:24.890 --> 00:29.270
We will also be looking at free and paid mail providers.

00:29.300 --> 00:35.090
I recommend to plugins contact form seven and post a SMTP mail contact.

00:35.090 --> 00:40.670
Form seven allows you to create contact forms for your site quickly and easily.

00:40.670 --> 00:45.490
Post a SMTP will handle the form submission process.

00:45.500 --> 00:50.090
Both of these plugins are installed from the WordPress repository.

00:50.120 --> 00:56.540
Attempting to configure your own mail server to handle contact forms is unnecessary.

00:56.570 --> 01:00.840
Mail server administration is extremely complex.

01:00.860 --> 01:03.800
There are so many different parts to configure.

01:03.830 --> 01:12.440
It's a job that's best left to experienced mail server admins to solve the problem of reliable delivery

01:12.470 --> 01:14.030
of your feedback forms.

01:14.060 --> 01:16.820
Installed Post is SMTP.

01:16.820 --> 01:24.940
Post SMTP replaces the default WordPress SMTP Library remailer with Zend Mail.

01:24.980 --> 01:26.420
It's easy to configure.

01:26.450 --> 01:33.790
All you do is provide a few details and you will experience error free delivery of your contact forms.

01:33.830 --> 01:40.780
The biggest problem facing you will be configuring an email address mail at your domain.

01:40.910 --> 01:46.990
It's unprofessional to respond using a Gmail or Yahoo email address.

01:47.120 --> 01:55.400
So you are left with two choices free or paid email for free mail at your domain email address.

01:55.400 --> 01:56.840
Try Zoho.

01:56.840 --> 02:02.560
Zoho is excellent and it offers you a free five gig mailbox.

02:02.570 --> 02:05.120
Best of all, it's ad free.

02:05.150 --> 02:13.250
You can access your mail using a browser, your preferred email client or the excellent Ionis or Android

02:13.250 --> 02:13.700
app.

02:13.700 --> 02:17.810
The apps are free for paid service g suite by Google.

02:17.900 --> 02:21.740
Gmail is the gold standard when it comes to email.

02:21.830 --> 02:29.030
So if you are prepared to pay five dollars per user per month, sign up for Gmail for business.

02:29.150 --> 02:36.050
In this lecture we looked at contact forms as well as free and paid mail providers.
