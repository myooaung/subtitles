Please check the resources section of this lecture.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.700
There is a PDF download available.

00:22.370 --> 00:29.090
In this lecture, we are going to look at how you back up your database as well as your site files on

00:29.090 --> 00:30.680
an unmanaged server.

00:30.710 --> 00:34.250
There are no new configuration files for us to look into.

00:34.310 --> 00:37.800
We'll start with backing up your database.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.430
The command is my escarole dump.

00:41.480 --> 00:50.960
What my Eskild dump does is it takes all the information contained in a specific database and dumps

00:50.960 --> 00:52.790
it into a file.

00:52.790 --> 00:58.870
That is, it creates a file and contained inside that file is your database.

00:58.940 --> 01:07.280
It's important when you start working with backups that you double, even triple check WP config for

01:07.280 --> 01:09.070
the database information.

01:09.110 --> 01:13.010
Make a note of the site database names.

01:13.250 --> 01:20.540
It is so easy when you have three or four sites on a server to get mixed up and you end up importing

01:20.540 --> 01:22.040
the wrong database.

01:22.070 --> 01:28.470
I also recommend you create a directory in your home directory to store your backups.

01:28.640 --> 01:34.040
We are also going to create the best script to speed up the entire process.

01:34.100 --> 01:36.800
There are two commands that we need to look at.

01:36.980 --> 01:41.330
Sudo my escarole -- high for new database user.

01:41.330 --> 01:45.020
The database user is root database name.

01:45.020 --> 01:51.590
That is the name of the database you want to back up greater than sign the name of the file you want

01:51.590 --> 01:53.540
to give the database done.

01:53.720 --> 02:03.170
Databases can get quite large, so it's convenient to compress the file sudo MySQL dump for new database

02:03.170 --> 02:06.590
user which is route database name Peiping symbol.

02:06.590 --> 02:12.680
That means the output of my Eskild will become the input of cheese.

02:13.160 --> 02:20.420
Four nine five four nine is the level of compression, the output of which will be your back up filename

02:20.420 --> 02:21.440
dot Eliscu.

02:21.440 --> 02:28.520
L thought, gee, let's look at these two commands I've changed to my site's directory listing will

02:28.520 --> 02:34.370
display all of the WordPress files file that concerns me is WP.

02:34.370 --> 02:39.360
I've been configured to open WP config using Nannar.

02:39.380 --> 02:43.250
You can scroll down until you find a database name.

02:43.430 --> 02:46.730
That is the name of the database that interests us.

02:46.940 --> 02:50.510
I'm going to use copy and copy the database name.

02:50.630 --> 02:57.320
I know the name of a database of my site WP Seelie dot com.

02:57.320 --> 02:59.450
Please make a note of it.

02:59.540 --> 03:01.400
Write it down some way.

03:05.000 --> 03:13.250
I'm going to log in to my escarole and talk to command show databases I have to database's, apart from

03:13.250 --> 03:19.730
the default database's, by using the show database's command, I don't know which database relates

03:19.730 --> 03:21.280
to which side.

03:21.320 --> 03:25.240
That is why I recommend you change to that site's directory.

03:25.250 --> 03:27.320
Open WP config.

03:27.320 --> 03:29.900
Check the name of the database.

03:29.900 --> 03:31.640
The command is Suda.

03:31.700 --> 03:35.540
My Esquibel done I've given you the user.

03:35.540 --> 03:38.680
Is the database name greater than sign.

03:38.720 --> 03:43.400
The output will be WPEC Allai DB rescuable.

03:43.520 --> 03:49.010
And there is our a school done file of the WPEC Allai database.

03:49.220 --> 03:55.730
I must mention to you do not open the database done file and make changes.

03:55.730 --> 03:59.210
I can open it but do not make changes.

03:59.210 --> 04:08.150
Sudo my eskild ifn you the user is route followed by the database name leave a space Peiping symbol.

04:08.180 --> 04:17.360
We want to redirect the output of my ESKIL dump to become the input of Jesus Jesus pirfenidone greater

04:17.360 --> 04:19.490
than sign the name of our file.

04:19.490 --> 04:25.220
WPEC allai db dot dot GZ.

04:25.220 --> 04:31.690
If you look at the two dump files, the first one is around 640000 bytes.

04:31.700 --> 04:38.270
If we look at the second file where we compressed the dump file, it's only one hundred fifty seven

04:38.270 --> 04:39.500
thousand bytes.

04:39.500 --> 04:43.970
I'm going to delete the Ezekial file to answer pages of file.

04:43.970 --> 04:53.840
We use the command G Anzu please add the flag hyphen K I think will keep the original Jesus file.

04:53.840 --> 04:57.380
I'll show you shortly what happens if you don't use.

04:57.410 --> 05:04.880
I think Jesus Python K followed by the name of the Jesus file will extract the escarole file from the

05:04.880 --> 05:05.720
Jesus file.

05:05.900 --> 05:10.730
It's remove our Eliscu Alpha G unsupported by the name of the file.

05:10.730 --> 05:13.190
The Jesus file has been deleted.

05:13.220 --> 05:16.280
All you are left with is the is Coulthart.

05:16.370 --> 05:22.610
Every time you want to perform a backup of your databases, it's time consuming to have to come and

05:22.610 --> 05:25.250
type the MySQL dump command.

05:25.340 --> 05:29.090
The other problem is one will end up forgetting to do it.

05:29.120 --> 05:32.810
Backing up your databases is extremely important.

05:32.900 --> 05:36.170
It's create two directories in our home directory.

05:36.170 --> 05:42.770
The first one DB underscore backup's the second I'm going to call scripts.

05:42.920 --> 05:44.960
There are two directories.

05:44.960 --> 05:52.370
We've created database backups, which I will use to store my daily database backups, scripts.

05:52.580 --> 05:59.630
We I'm going to create the scripts to perform the relevant backups while we are here mkdir.

05:59.630 --> 06:04.220
Let's make another directory and this one we can call file backups.

06:04.220 --> 06:06.860
There are three directories.

06:06.890 --> 06:09.170
You can change two scripts.
