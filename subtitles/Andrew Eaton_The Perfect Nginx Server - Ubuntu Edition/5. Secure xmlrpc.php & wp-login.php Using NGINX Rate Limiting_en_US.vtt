00:05.070 --> 00:11.870
In this section, we are going to further secure our sites using ancient X rate, limiting SML, our

00:11.890 --> 00:15.540
PC is a bundled WordPress script.

00:15.550 --> 00:23.730
It allows remote connections to WordPress without XML, RBC, various tools and publishing applications

00:23.730 --> 00:26.490
will not be able to access the website.

00:26.550 --> 00:35.700
Unfortunately, XML RBC is an attack vector for malicious bots that try to mount a distributed denial

00:35.700 --> 00:38.800
of service attack bot scan WordPress or Wukong.

00:38.800 --> 00:46.770
Most sites for WP log in, dot up there, then try a senseless amount of password attempts over and

00:46.770 --> 00:47.770
over again.

00:47.850 --> 00:52.250
This leads to your system being overloaded, dealing with these attempts.

00:52.290 --> 00:57.390
It slows everything down and could even lead to crashing your server rate.

00:57.390 --> 01:04.320
Limiting is used to limit the amount of git and or post requests a user can make in a given period of

01:04.320 --> 01:04.670
time.

01:04.680 --> 01:11.460
Rate limiting can be used for security purposes to slow down brute force, password guessing attacks

01:11.460 --> 01:18.630
and to protect your website against attacks by limiting the incoming requests right down to a value

01:18.630 --> 01:20.830
that is typical for real users.

01:21.030 --> 01:28.520
If you don't use Getback or concern yourself with pinback, simply block access to XML or PC.

01:28.680 --> 01:34.250
We already have this directive in the WP Security SEO NFR.

01:34.380 --> 01:38.890
If you make use of XML or PC, you cannot block access to that file.

01:38.910 --> 01:43.540
So you need to add rate limiting on XML or PC.

01:43.560 --> 01:50.490
We cannot block access to WPE logging login, so we need to limit the number of logging attempts through

01:50.490 --> 01:51.750
rate limiting.

01:51.750 --> 01:56.130
We are going to make use of rate limiting to slow down a brute force attack.

01:56.310 --> 01:57.840
If the rate is exceeded.

01:57.960 --> 02:01.690
Engin X returns a father of three error page.

02:01.740 --> 02:06.370
We can also make use of the limit request status directive.

02:06.570 --> 02:12.030
This will drop the request and not send any response back to the user.

02:12.060 --> 02:16.710
This will be a HTP for ForFour response.

02:16.920 --> 02:21.630
A 444 response is not part of the HTP standard.

02:21.780 --> 02:28.320
It was introduced by Ingenix for their server logs to indicate when the server simply did not send a

02:28.320 --> 02:30.530
response and closed the connection.

02:30.540 --> 02:39.660
We need to add the limit request zone directive to the HTP context of Engine X Dot SEO and if let's

02:39.660 --> 02:42.960
look at the variables that make up the limit requests.

02:43.230 --> 02:48.630
Director The Limit Request Zone Directive defines the parameters for rate limiting.

02:48.660 --> 02:54.720
Anri remote address holds a binary representation of the client's IP address.

02:54.750 --> 03:01.860
The Zone defines the shared memory zone used to store the state of each IP address and how often it

03:01.860 --> 03:04.020
has accessed a request limited.

03:04.020 --> 03:07.110
You are allowed ten means ten megabytes.

03:07.110 --> 03:09.060
That is the size of this one.

03:09.060 --> 03:14.010
Megabyte can hold approximately 16000 unique IP addresses.

03:14.010 --> 03:18.990
So our ten meg zone can hold around 160000 IP addresses.

03:19.140 --> 03:24.750
If you have lots of sites with very high traffic, you may want to increase that value.

03:24.750 --> 03:32.580
The rate sets the maximum request rate in the example, the rate cannot exceed thirty requests per minute.

03:32.580 --> 03:33.390
Ten R.

03:33.960 --> 03:40.140
S means that ten requests per second is allowed with a rate of thirty requests per minute.

03:40.140 --> 03:45.180
You are effectively restricting the request to one every two seconds.

03:45.330 --> 03:54.270
The limit request directive gets added to the server context of your site's Engine X configuration file.

03:54.450 --> 03:58.950
Let's look at the variables that make up the limit request directive.

03:59.100 --> 04:07.470
The directive itself limit request enables a rate limiting within the context where it appears the burst

04:07.470 --> 04:14.490
parameter defines how many requests a client can make in excess of the rate specified by the zone,

04:14.700 --> 04:20.000
a request that arrives sooner than what we have specified is put in a queue.

04:20.010 --> 04:24.080
Here we are simply setting the queue size to twenty.

04:24.240 --> 04:32.460
This means if 21 requests arrive from a given IP address simultaneously, ancient X forwards the first

04:32.460 --> 04:38.130
one to the upstream server group immediately and puts the remaining twenty in the queue.

04:38.280 --> 04:46.260
It then forwards a skewed request every two seconds and returns a favor three nearer to the client only

04:46.440 --> 04:51.690
if an incoming request makes the number of queue requests go over twenty.

04:51.780 --> 05:00.360
No delay makes sure as soon as a request limit exceeds the TTP status, code five zero three is returned

05:00.360 --> 05:04.470
to the client using limit request status 444 we.

05:04.790 --> 05:12.650
Drop the request and not send any response back to the user, the limited request directive is added

05:12.650 --> 05:17.210
to the server context of your site's Engine X configuration file.

05:17.420 --> 05:20.780
It gets added underneath the location block.

05:20.930 --> 05:28.940
It's important to note that the directives that make up the existing location block must added underneath

05:29.120 --> 05:31.720
the limited request status director.

05:32.090 --> 05:39.050
Please ensure you're logged into your server and you can change to the FTC slash Ingenix directory in

05:39.050 --> 05:40.890
the Etsy Ingenix directory.

05:40.910 --> 05:44.510
We can open engine Eckstut SEO in if using Nannar.

05:52.890 --> 05:56.190
We are going to add the limit to request zone directive.

05:56.460 --> 06:05.490
It must be added in the HTP context of ancient X.com and if there is are HTP context and the opening

06:05.490 --> 06:14.250
Brissy for the HTP context can add it just about anywhere as long as it's in the HTP context.

06:19.560 --> 06:25.500
I've added some comments, Ingenix right, limit, director of the Metro Quest Zone, Bayani remote

06:25.500 --> 06:30.690
address zone, 110 megabytes and the rate 30 requests per minute.

06:30.820 --> 06:34.920
You can close engine X.com enough saving your changes.

06:38.790 --> 06:45.900
Test the configuration, the configuration test is successful inside the engine next directory.

06:45.990 --> 06:48.330
I'd like you to create a new directory.

06:48.360 --> 06:55.250
We're going to call this territory includes our previous include files we added in Global.

06:55.410 --> 06:57.140
These are updates to the course.

06:57.450 --> 07:03.150
I like to keep newer configuration changes we are making in a separate directory.

07:03.390 --> 07:05.570
It makes troubleshooting easier.

07:05.760 --> 07:14.580
You can change to the includes directory Sudano the file name rate underscore limit dot seo and if the

07:14.580 --> 07:22.440
contents of regular mazzeo and if we have two location blocks, both are an exact match location equals

07:22.590 --> 07:27.980
an exact match for WP login and XML are picked up.

07:28.080 --> 07:33.530
Then we have our limit request directive and the limit request status directive.

07:33.660 --> 07:36.410
We're going to return a 444.

07:36.510 --> 07:40.770
We are not going to return a response when the rate is exceeded.

07:40.980 --> 07:47.310
What's important about these directives, the three existing directives underneath your limited request

07:47.310 --> 07:48.030
status?

07:48.240 --> 07:57.180
It's important to add the directives that make up the existing location block underneath limit request

07:57.180 --> 07:57.840
status.

07:58.050 --> 08:03.150
If you do not do that, the limit request directors will not work correctly.

08:03.180 --> 08:11.310
You can close the rate limit dogecoin if saving your changes can change to the sites available.

08:11.310 --> 08:15.090
Directory Etsy Ingenix Saaz available.

08:15.210 --> 08:18.650
I'm going to open my sites configuration file using Nannar.

08:18.900 --> 08:24.870
Your WordPress security directives were added before the location block.

08:24.870 --> 08:33.710
That process processes the rate limit directive's get added after the block that processes P.

08:41.330 --> 08:49.790
Include the path to the file we want to include ETEK Ingenix includes Right underscore limit dot CEO

08:49.800 --> 08:55.790
and if Semi Kotla you can close your site's configuration file, saving the changes.

08:56.300 --> 09:00.650
As always, test the configuration, duplicate location.

09:05.170 --> 09:10.850
Change to your global directory inside the global directory.

09:10.930 --> 09:15.400
Open WordPress security dot seo in.

09:15.400 --> 09:22.990
If there is the duplicate location directive we have location equals an exact match, for example,

09:22.990 --> 09:28.600
our PC that we need to comment or delete that particular directive.

09:28.620 --> 09:29.400
I'll comment.

09:29.410 --> 09:32.740
The directive close WordPress security directives.

09:33.460 --> 09:38.890
Saving your changes to the configuration test is successful.

09:42.380 --> 09:49.790
Reload Ingenix to enable the changes I've opened by site and requested the file XML AAPC.

09:52.070 --> 09:55.640
Let's do this a few times, request the file continuously.

10:03.240 --> 10:08.520
I've exceeded the rate, the site cannot be reached, WP logging.

10:09.990 --> 10:12.300
I'm going to tap login a few times.

10:16.660 --> 10:23.980
The site cannot be reached if I look at my site's error log file there you can see the rate limiting

10:24.130 --> 10:24.880
in action.

10:25.090 --> 10:32.080
Looking at the access log, WP login, notice the HTTP response codes, 202 under 200.

10:32.260 --> 10:33.820
The rate limit is exceeded.

10:33.980 --> 10:37.080
No responses sent to the client 444.

10:37.330 --> 10:43.510
In this lecture, we added an additional layer of security to our WordPress sites by adding Ingenix

10:43.510 --> 10:48.580
rate limiting protection to XML, RBC and WP login.
