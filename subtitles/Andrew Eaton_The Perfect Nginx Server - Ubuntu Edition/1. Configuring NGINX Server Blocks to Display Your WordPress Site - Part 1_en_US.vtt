00:00.150 --> 00:03.000
Please check the resources section of this lecture.

00:03.030 --> 00:05.730
There is a PDF download available.

00:23.320 --> 00:29.920
In this lecture, we are going to start configuring Engine X server blocks, the server blocks are responsible

00:29.920 --> 00:31.810
for displaying your sites.

00:32.290 --> 00:37.120
The initial steps we need to back up what is called the default file.

00:37.270 --> 00:41.730
Then we we're going to remove all the comments from the default file.

00:41.740 --> 00:50.530
And we need to confirm the path to see if there is only one configuration file and that is default and

00:50.530 --> 00:55.360
its path EDC Engine X sites available.

00:55.570 --> 00:57.840
The commands we will use in the section.

00:57.880 --> 01:06.460
You've used them all before except the find command sudo find slash indicates the route hyphen name,

01:06.730 --> 01:14.650
followed by the name of the file that will display the path to our seven FPM file.

01:14.680 --> 01:21.190
We still inside the ATC Ingenix directory on the right hand side sites available.

01:21.220 --> 01:24.340
It's changed to the sites available.

01:24.340 --> 01:31.810
Directory listing of the sites available directory indicates one file called default.

01:31.960 --> 01:34.390
We need to make a backup copy.

01:35.260 --> 01:37.510
I'm going to call a default dot back.

01:37.870 --> 01:43.750
We can now open the default file using neno sudo neno default.

01:43.930 --> 01:46.420
There are a lot of comments in this file.

01:46.450 --> 01:49.930
An easy way to remove them is to use control.

01:49.930 --> 01:51.070
CC control.

01:51.070 --> 01:54.970
CC will erase an entire line at a time.

01:54.970 --> 01:58.240
Please don't hold back down Tappet.

01:58.270 --> 02:05.350
You can stop once server reaches the top, you can go to the line SSL configuration and you can erase

02:05.680 --> 02:07.210
all those comments.

02:07.210 --> 02:08.800
Route stays there.

02:08.830 --> 02:11.150
The comment and index start up.

02:11.290 --> 02:20.020
We can leave under location first attempt and as you can remove past the scripts, you can remove two

02:20.020 --> 02:20.740
lines.

02:21.070 --> 02:24.280
The line in between include and with.

02:24.820 --> 02:32.110
You can remove with and force CGI pos you can remove, leave the rest intact.

02:32.110 --> 02:34.180
Deny you can remove.

02:37.880 --> 02:45.980
The last hash and the closing curly bracket you can remove underneath the closing bracket for the server

02:45.980 --> 02:50.660
context, you have virtual host configuration, you can remove all those.

02:53.960 --> 03:02.540
At location, remove only the hash the line hash with seven FPM, you can remove that entire line,

03:02.780 --> 03:10.940
you can remove the hash at Fast CGI Pass as well as the hash for the closing bracket for that particular

03:10.940 --> 03:12.710
location context.

03:12.890 --> 03:16.770
This is what your default file should look like.

03:16.940 --> 03:19.430
We have removed all the comments.

03:19.460 --> 03:22.830
The file is now a lot easier to work with.

03:23.030 --> 03:25.790
I'd like you to take note near the bottom file.

03:25.790 --> 03:31.610
CGI Pass Uniques Run P seven.

03:31.640 --> 03:33.370
If not suck.

03:33.380 --> 03:36.100
It's the path that concerns us.

03:36.140 --> 03:45.530
Slash, run, slash, slash the filename you can exit NENO saving the changes you have made to default

03:45.710 --> 03:46.520
its test.

03:46.610 --> 03:49.010
The configuration of Ingenix.

03:49.010 --> 03:52.580
The syntax is OK and the test is successful.

03:52.610 --> 04:00.200
Let's run the fine command sudo find slash ifour name seven hyphen fpm dot suck.

04:00.410 --> 04:05.660
The past that is being displayed to us matches the past in the default file.

04:05.660 --> 04:10.250
Slash run slash slash the filename.

04:14.340 --> 04:16.570
For one two eight zero four.

04:16.620 --> 04:26.130
You need to confirm the path to P seven point two if RPM was a one two six zero four, when we use defined

04:26.130 --> 04:30.270
command, we were looking for the location of the seven.

04:30.270 --> 04:41.760
If PM dot sackful with 18 zero four, we want to confirm the location of P seven point two hyphen fpm

04:42.120 --> 04:43.220
dot sukh.

04:43.440 --> 04:55.920
So in your default engine xfire the fast CGI pass run p p p p seven point two hyphen fpm dot soc.

05:01.080 --> 05:09.390
With 20 04, you will be using seven point four, so you need to confirm the path to the seven point

05:09.390 --> 05:09.830
four.

05:09.840 --> 05:18.060
If we suck for the command to find the path to the seven point four hyphen, if dot soc file is so,

05:18.130 --> 05:22.740
you do find slash hyphen name of seven point four hyphen.

05:22.770 --> 05:30.450
If hpm dot succ, you need to run that command and make a note of the past that that command will display

05:30.450 --> 05:30.930
to you.

05:31.020 --> 05:36.510
After running the fine command, you can confirm the path to the seven point four.

05:36.510 --> 05:45.600
If PM SSAFA the pass will be slash, run, slash, slash seven point four 1/2 and if not suck if you

05:45.600 --> 05:47.160
open the default engine.

05:47.160 --> 05:53.190
Exe file using then the directive of fast CGI underscore pos unix.

05:53.220 --> 05:57.930
Look at the pass slash four run speed followed by the soc filename.

05:57.930 --> 06:04.160
Now what you need to do is remove the slash far from the path to the seven point four sackful.

06:04.170 --> 06:10.260
I prefer to have the exact path listed in configuration files after making the changes.

06:10.260 --> 06:12.450
The first CGI pass directive.

06:12.510 --> 06:20.040
The pass is now slash, run, slash, slash seven point four hyphen fpm dot suck.

06:20.040 --> 06:24.810
That is the path that the sudo find command displayed the to match.

06:24.810 --> 06:29.820
Before we continue, we need to look at the location context.
