Step seven involves securing your WordPress site, using Ingenix directives, we have already secured

00:13.130 --> 00:15.140
the first site using this method.

00:15.260 --> 00:22.230
So all you need to do is add the relevant include file to your Engine X configuration file.

00:22.280 --> 00:28.760
I would like you to change to your Etsy Ingenix directory once you've changed to the Etsy Ingenix directory.

00:28.760 --> 00:33.240
That global directory contains all our include files.

00:33.320 --> 00:39.620
There are three files that we can include in our WordPress site at this stage WordPress security that

00:39.620 --> 00:47.510
contains the directives to secure our WordPress site headers that contains our HTTP response headers

00:47.660 --> 00:53.030
as well as fast CGI optimized to improve the performance of our site.

00:53.060 --> 00:54.580
We need to change directories.

00:54.590 --> 00:59.650
We want to go back one level and then change to the sites available directory.

00:59.690 --> 01:02.180
We can then open our site using NENO.

01:02.210 --> 01:07.810
You can scroll down and include the headers file as well as WordPress security.

01:07.850 --> 01:14.390
These two files must be included above the IP location context underneath.

01:14.390 --> 01:20.000
For CGI posts, we can include our past CGI optimization file.

01:24.860 --> 01:33.890
You can Xanana, saving your changes, njt, its test, the configuration, which is fine, or reload

01:33.890 --> 01:36.800
Ingenix to enable the changes we have made.
