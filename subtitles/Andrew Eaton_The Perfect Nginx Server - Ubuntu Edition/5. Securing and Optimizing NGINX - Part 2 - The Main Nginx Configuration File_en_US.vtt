00:00.150 --> 00:03.000
Please check the resources section of this lecture.

00:03.030 --> 00:05.700
There is a PDF download available.

00:18.690 --> 00:25.650
The main engine X configuration file is located in the UTC slash engine X directory.

00:25.740 --> 00:29.670
Let's change to that directory listing of the files there.

00:29.670 --> 00:37.290
We can see the file that we are about to edit, engine X, Dot SEO in F, as always, create a backup

00:37.290 --> 00:42.360
copy of the configuration file before you edit the file.

00:42.390 --> 00:43.830
Before we open the file.

00:43.830 --> 00:51.210
Two commands, we need to run all this CPU to determine the number of CPUs our server has.

00:51.240 --> 00:56.520
The server I'm using has won the second command you limit hyphen in.

00:56.520 --> 01:02.070
That is to determine the number of worker connections one zero to four.

01:02.250 --> 01:08.070
So you do then are followed by Ingenix, not SEO enough worker processors.

01:08.220 --> 01:13.800
That is the number of CPU course we can change auto to one.

01:14.100 --> 01:18.690
We need to add a directive to the main context worker.

01:18.720 --> 01:20.640
Our limit no file.

01:20.670 --> 01:26.340
You can leave a space and type in fifteen thousand semi code.

01:26.550 --> 01:29.280
That is the main context taken care of.

01:29.460 --> 01:33.030
Now you can move down to the events context.

01:33.150 --> 01:40.470
Worker connections would normally be subject to the value that you limit displayed one zero to four.

01:40.470 --> 01:45.540
Because we added the worker or limit directive to the main context.

01:45.630 --> 01:51.210
We can increase the worker connections to two zero four eight.

01:51.480 --> 01:55.470
We can uncommented multi except to turn it on.

01:55.890 --> 02:01.200
We can add a new directive, use Epel semicolon.

02:01.200 --> 02:05.790
Now we can move down to the HTTP context, keep alive time out.

02:05.910 --> 02:07.980
I would like you to comment.

02:08.100 --> 02:12.990
We will add our keep alive settings to include file server tokens.

02:12.990 --> 02:15.660
We need to enable that directive.

02:15.660 --> 02:20.880
You can uncommented server tokens, server names, hash bucket size.

02:20.880 --> 02:24.180
We need to uncommented login settings.

02:24.180 --> 02:31.200
As I've already discussed with you, the access log can be a tremendous resource hog comment that you

02:31.200 --> 02:39.120
can move to the line above and type access log or semicolon that will turn off the access log.

02:39.120 --> 02:44.490
We can, of course, override the access log in the server context.

02:44.580 --> 02:47.480
Now we get to Jesus settings.

02:47.490 --> 02:48.930
Jesus is on.

02:48.930 --> 02:52.920
It's disabled for Microsoft Internet Explorer six.

02:53.100 --> 02:54.510
Jesus Peery on.

02:54.720 --> 03:03.630
We need to uncommented Jesus feary on will tell proxy's to cash both the Jesus and the regular version

03:03.630 --> 03:05.520
of the resource Jesus.

03:05.520 --> 03:09.810
Proceed any you can also uncommented that will compress data.

03:09.810 --> 03:15.180
Even if clients are connecting through a proxy Jesus compression level.

03:15.180 --> 03:20.160
You can uncommented but change the level from six to five.

03:20.250 --> 03:25.290
Five is a perfect compromise between size and CPU usage.

03:25.290 --> 03:30.690
It offers approximately a 75 per cent reduction for ASCII files.

03:30.720 --> 03:39.420
The Jesus Buffer's directive you can uncommented it sets the number and size of Buffer's used to compress

03:39.420 --> 03:40.470
a response.

03:40.620 --> 03:49.950
You can uncommented Gizab HTP version that will enable compression for both HTP one and one point one.

03:49.950 --> 03:53.310
You can also uncommented GS types.

03:53.310 --> 03:56.670
I would then like you to go to the end of that line.

03:56.760 --> 03:58.590
JavaScript semicolon.

03:58.590 --> 03:59.520
Leave Espace.

03:59.520 --> 04:09.060
I'd like you to add the following mime types to the Giese types image slash SPG plus XML application

04:09.060 --> 04:16.920
slash ex html plus XML and application slash atem plus x.

04:16.920 --> 04:17.550
Mel.

04:17.550 --> 04:25.500
The Jesus types directive is where you specify the mime types that you would like to compress virtual

04:25.500 --> 04:26.850
host conflicts.

04:26.850 --> 04:27.840
We leave alone.

04:27.840 --> 04:35.010
The lost curly bracket you see is the closing block for the H TTP context.

04:35.010 --> 04:42.330
With NENO you can use control K and you can remove the directive's underneath the control X.

04:42.330 --> 04:46.380
We want to exit NENO Y we want to save our changes.

04:46.380 --> 04:49.740
File name to write is correct in your next stop.

04:49.740 --> 04:51.720
C in F straight.

04:51.720 --> 04:59.790
After editing a configuration file you run the command sudo ingenix hyphen t syntax is OK.

04:59.820 --> 05:01.710
Test is successful.

05:01.800 --> 05:11.010
Now you need to reload engine X to enable the changes we have made inside the engine x dot C NFR.
