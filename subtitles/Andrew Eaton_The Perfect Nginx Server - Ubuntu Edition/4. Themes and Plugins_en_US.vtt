00:00.120 --> 00:08.040
You can use WPC Illi to administer your themes and plugins, I must mention that you can install commercial

00:08.040 --> 00:14.730
themes and plug ins, but it cannot be used to perform updates of commercial themes and plug.

00:15.240 --> 00:20.890
The updates are for the themes and plugins obtained from the WordPress repository.

00:21.030 --> 00:23.190
Let's look at some of the commands.

00:23.190 --> 00:34.740
The commands for themes and ins are identical except you specify WPEC or WP plugin WPEC illi can be

00:34.740 --> 00:43.500
used to list, install, delete, activate, activate, update themes and plugins WP followed by either

00:43.500 --> 00:49.140
theme or plugin, followed by the variable WP plugin list.

00:49.140 --> 00:52.680
And there is a list of the currently installed plug ins.

00:52.800 --> 00:56.970
It's extremely straightforward to use post hyphen.

00:57.070 --> 01:04.930
SMTP is currently deactivated WP plugin activate followed by the name of the plugin post.

01:05.070 --> 01:10.620
A SMTP success activated If I Lost My Plug INS posted.

01:10.620 --> 01:18.690
S.P. is now activated to configure the plugin further, I would need to use the WordPress Dashboard

01:18.870 --> 01:22.860
WP plugin update double hyphen all.

01:23.010 --> 01:25.320
All my plugins are up to date.

01:25.470 --> 01:30.180
That is a very useful option if you have numerous plugins that need to be updated.

01:30.270 --> 01:39.780
The same applies for Theme's WP Themeless WPEC activate, followed by the name of the theme My 2017

01:39.780 --> 01:43.410
Child Success Switch to my 2017.

01:43.590 --> 01:48.630
If I list the themes my 2017 child is now the active theme.

01:48.660 --> 01:52.950
You will notice 2017 is listed as the parent.

01:53.160 --> 01:56.880
See, most of the variables are self-explanatory.

01:57.030 --> 02:05.920
If you want a particular action to apply to all plugins or themes, you include a double hyphen or WPC

02:05.940 --> 02:14.520
Allai is useful for searching for a particular theme or plugin WP theme or plugin search, followed

02:14.520 --> 02:15.420
by the term.

02:15.420 --> 02:22.590
If you are using more than a single word, enclose the words in apostrophes.

02:22.770 --> 02:25.950
WP Theme Search Multipurpose.

02:25.950 --> 02:28.590
I will come back to the page shortly.

02:28.620 --> 02:35.550
WP Theme Search Multipurpose showing ten of 372 themes.

02:35.550 --> 02:42.360
Now you will notice when you use the search variable you have the name and you have the slug.

02:42.360 --> 02:45.240
The name is obviously the name of the theme.

02:45.240 --> 02:50.910
The slug is what is used to install a particular plugin or theme.

02:50.910 --> 02:57.660
If I want to install the multi-purpose shop, the WPEC install followed by the slack.

03:00.510 --> 03:02.460
Theme installed successfully.

03:03.280 --> 03:11.800
WPEC Nyst There is our multi-purpose shop, see, you will notice when I use WP theme search showing

03:11.800 --> 03:14.810
10 of 372 themes.

03:15.070 --> 03:26.440
This is where you can add per page I've specified per page equals 50 success showing 50 of 372 scenes

03:26.710 --> 03:29.100
by changing two three seven two.

03:29.140 --> 03:32.170
It will display all 372 themes.

03:32.290 --> 03:43.450
The same method applies to plugins WP plugin search cache showing 10 of 3300 and 52 WP plugin search

03:43.450 --> 03:50.350
super cache enclosed in apostrophes showing 10 of 513 plugins.

03:50.470 --> 03:58.870
If I wanted to install WP super cache, clear cache menu success installed one of one plugin above that.

03:58.870 --> 04:03.850
You can see what happened when I left out the, you know, plug ins installed.

04:04.060 --> 04:10.060
I lost my plug ins, WP super cache, clear cache menu has now been installed.

04:10.240 --> 04:18.970
If I wanted to lead a plugin WP plugin delete followed by the slack after using WPEC ALLAI to administer

04:18.970 --> 04:25.930
themes and plugins or using the dashboard to administer themes or plug ins, we created a script in

04:26.020 --> 04:30.100
our home directory called WP Permissions.

04:30.280 --> 04:38.440
If you use WPEC Allai to install plug ins, your user will be the owner as well as the group owner.

04:38.590 --> 04:39.730
That is not correct.

04:39.880 --> 04:45.700
If you use the dashboard, your web server will be both the owner and the group owner.

04:45.700 --> 04:47.650
That is also not correct.

04:47.770 --> 04:56.560
So after updating or installing any themes and plug ins, run your WPE ownership and permissions script

04:56.560 --> 05:01.990
my dashboard appearance themes active my 2017 child theme.

05:01.990 --> 05:08.770
And there is multipurpose shop and corporate source that we installed using WP CLIA.

05:08.800 --> 05:16.030
You will also notice Posman is not configured and is mimicking out of the box WordPress email delivery

05:16.060 --> 05:21.010
I activated Posman is SMTP using WPEC Allai.

05:21.010 --> 05:26.770
You need to specify further settings and that is done using your dashboard.

05:26.770 --> 05:34.750
You can use WPC Allai to install commercial themes and plugins, upload the zip file containing the

05:34.750 --> 05:36.520
theme or plug in to your server.

05:36.520 --> 05:41.710
Then using the WP theme or WP plugin install command.

05:41.710 --> 05:45.100
Specify the path to the zip file.

05:45.190 --> 05:50.820
If I uploaded a theme to my home directory, the file name is called Theme Up.

05:50.860 --> 05:59.560
I would change to my site's public HTML directory and I would type WP theme install, followed by the

05:59.560 --> 06:02.830
path to the theme Dot Zafar.

06:02.860 --> 06:04.870
The same applies to plugins.

06:04.870 --> 06:10.510
In this lecture we looked at various WP CLIA commands.
