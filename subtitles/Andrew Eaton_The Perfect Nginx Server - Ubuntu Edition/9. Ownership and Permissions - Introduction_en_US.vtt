I cannot emphasize the importance of understanding ownership and permissions when you work on a Linux

00:26.180 --> 00:33.800
server, when you've completed this lecture, if it's necessary, repeat the lecture repeated even for

00:33.800 --> 00:35.300
a third time.

00:36.020 --> 00:44.630
When you work on a server, you will continually be looking at and changing ownership and permissions.

00:44.810 --> 00:51.500
Ownership refers to who owns the file or directory permissions.

00:51.500 --> 01:01.580
Specify what a particular user may or may not do with respect to files or directories.

01:01.580 --> 01:10.670
Ownership and permissions are important because you need to create a secure environment on your server.

01:10.670 --> 01:17.890
Ownership and permissions are one of the most misunderstood concepts when it comes to Linux.

01:17.930 --> 01:24.890
It's also one of the most difficult concepts for especially a Windows user to understand.

01:25.010 --> 01:33.920
When you work on a Windows PC, you can copy and move files and directories without thinking twice.

01:33.920 --> 01:37.770
On a Linux system, things are very different.

01:37.970 --> 01:46.870
You may be wondering why I continually emphasize the importance of understanding ownership and permissions.

01:46.880 --> 01:53.420
I'm going to give you an example before you even consider a security plugin, you need to ensure that

01:53.420 --> 01:59.410
the ownership and permissions of the WordPress files are correct.

01:59.420 --> 02:05.750
Here is a table with the correct ownership and permissions for a few WordPress directories.

02:05.870 --> 02:13.400
At the end of the lecture, I'm going to show you the same table and what you are seeing will make a

02:13.400 --> 02:14.930
lot more sense.

02:14.930 --> 02:19.570
You will, at the end of this lecture, understand what you are looking at.

02:19.730 --> 02:25.430
Look at the slash WP hyphen admin directory owned by your user.

02:25.580 --> 02:29.210
That's ownership writable by your user only.

02:29.240 --> 02:33.250
That is permissions readable by the Web server.

02:33.290 --> 02:37.980
That's a combination of both ownership and permissions.

02:38.000 --> 02:44.810
If we look at WP content owned by your user, that's ownership writable by your user permissions.

02:44.960 --> 02:51.290
It must also be writable by the Web server that is again ownership and permissions.
