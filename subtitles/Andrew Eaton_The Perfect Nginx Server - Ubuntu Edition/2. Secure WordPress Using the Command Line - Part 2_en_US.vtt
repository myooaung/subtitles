00:05.060 --> 00:13.760
Let's start with a foul python config that the owner is your user, the group owner is your user.

00:13.790 --> 00:14.900
That is incorrect.

00:15.050 --> 00:17.680
We will get to ownership shortly.

00:17.720 --> 00:22.460
The permissions six six for that is also incorrect.

00:22.640 --> 00:24.740
We will get to permissions shortly.

00:24.860 --> 00:27.680
Let's open up config using Nenna.

00:27.710 --> 00:32.330
You don't need to use Sudo because you are the owner of the file.

00:34.300 --> 00:41.140
I'd like you to scroll to the end of the file, we have added four lines to the WP config file allow

00:41.140 --> 00:43.860
direct updating without FCP.

00:43.930 --> 00:51.450
The defined IFIs method direct will allow you to use the dashboard to update your themes and plugins.

00:51.670 --> 00:58.630
The next line disallow file edit true that will disable the WordPress theme and plugin.

00:58.630 --> 01:02.030
Ed, you can exit neno saving your changes.

01:02.200 --> 01:04.300
Now we need to change the ownership.

01:04.300 --> 01:12.460
The correct ownership is your user is the owner and the web server is the group owner.

01:12.460 --> 01:15.460
Sudo C.H. own hyphen R.

01:15.580 --> 01:18.600
We want the command to act recursively.

01:18.610 --> 01:26.470
If you look at the directories, WP Admin, WP content, WP includes, we want this command to act on

01:26.470 --> 01:29.170
those directories and subdirectories.

01:29.200 --> 01:31.320
The owner is your user.

01:31.330 --> 01:38.410
In my case, Andrew, the group owner is w w w hyphen daughter, the web server.

01:38.530 --> 01:47.080
Now you type the path to your site so it's slash bar slash w w w slash your domain name.

01:47.080 --> 01:50.110
Finally public underscore HTML.

01:50.140 --> 01:54.040
A long listing will now display the change in ownership.

01:54.040 --> 01:58.240
Your user is now the owner of those files and directories.

01:58.270 --> 02:00.610
The Web server is the group.

02:00.610 --> 02:04.900
Only now we need to change the permissions of our files and directories.

02:04.900 --> 02:07.300
You cannot use the sigmoid command.

02:07.300 --> 02:15.370
We need to make use of the find command sudo find the path where the files and directories are located.

02:15.400 --> 02:24.340
So it's slash va slash w w w slash your domain name, slash public underscore html.

02:24.520 --> 02:25.960
What do you want to find.

02:25.960 --> 02:28.750
I find type D for directory.

02:28.780 --> 02:31.630
Once you found all the directories, what do you want to do.

02:31.630 --> 02:36.640
You want to execute a command mod and what permissions do you want.

02:36.640 --> 02:39.180
Seven five five.

02:39.220 --> 02:40.870
A double curly bracket.

02:40.870 --> 02:48.940
Leave a space backslash semi colon that is to run that command on every single directory.

02:49.090 --> 02:52.540
Before I type the list command look at WP admin.

02:52.540 --> 03:03.720
It is our W, X or W X it is now or w x r x permissions of seven five five.

03:03.760 --> 03:06.400
You don't need to type the find command out again.

03:06.400 --> 03:13.060
Pressure up hierarchy, change the D to a if for files and the permissions on the files.

03:13.090 --> 03:16.750
We want six four for the owner.

03:16.750 --> 03:21.370
Read write the web server read other users read.

03:21.400 --> 03:26.980
Look at WP ifn logging six six four.

03:27.850 --> 03:31.000
Now it is six four four.

03:31.180 --> 03:35.900
Now we need to change the permissions of WP IFN content.

03:35.950 --> 03:44.050
The Directory WP hyphen content is the only directory where your web server needs to be able to write.

03:44.230 --> 03:46.720
You can press your up Iraqi twice.

03:46.720 --> 03:51.310
So for WP hyphen content are permissions for directories.

03:51.310 --> 03:55.090
Needs to be seven, seven, five and four files.

03:55.090 --> 03:57.970
It needs to be six, six, four.

03:58.150 --> 04:02.770
So let's go to the six for four and change it to six six four.

04:02.770 --> 04:05.980
But you need to specify the POS.

04:06.190 --> 04:13.000
You need to add WP content slash after the public underscore HTML.

04:13.480 --> 04:21.520
You can press your Ibaraki and we can change the six six four to seven seven five and change the F four

04:21.520 --> 04:24.940
file to a D for directory.

04:25.120 --> 04:31.090
If you look at the screen, WP content on the extreme left D indicating a directory.

04:31.090 --> 04:37.060
Read, write, execute, read, execute, read, execute wp content.

04:37.210 --> 04:42.850
Read, write, execute, read, write, execute, read, execute.

04:43.090 --> 04:52.750
Its change to the hyphen content directory a long listing indexed p rewrite read write read six six

04:52.750 --> 04:58.870
four uploads read, write, execute, read, write, execute, read, execute.

04:59.050 --> 05:07.060
So we have now set the correct ownership as well as the correct permissions on our WordPress files and

05:07.060 --> 05:07.800
directories.

05:07.990 --> 05:12.170
I'd like you to go back one level and display a long listing.

05:12.190 --> 05:18.230
One important file which we need to change the permissions off is WP config.

05:19.090 --> 05:26.440
If you intend to install any caching plugin or any security plugin with a current permissions, your

05:26.440 --> 05:33.520
web server would not be able to write to that file certain plugins when you install them.

05:33.720 --> 05:41.610
Need to be able to write to that file when you configure the plugin, so it's sigmoid six six four,

05:41.610 --> 05:44.010
followed by WP config DOT.

05:45.180 --> 05:51.150
So at this stage, any security or caching plugin, when you configure the plugin using your dashboard,

05:51.150 --> 05:54.860
will be able to write to that particular file.

05:54.960 --> 06:01.530
When you finished configuring your caching or security plugin, you come back to your WordPress directory

06:01.530 --> 06:05.030
and change those permissions to six forfour.

06:05.070 --> 06:10.110
We will when we are configuring engine X, we will deny access to that file.

06:10.230 --> 06:19.440
So with Engine X as your Web server, you can safely leave the permissions of WP Config two six four

06:19.620 --> 06:20.160
for.
