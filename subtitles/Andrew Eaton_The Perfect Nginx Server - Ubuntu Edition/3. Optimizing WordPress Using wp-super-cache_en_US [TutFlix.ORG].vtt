WP super cache is a WordPress plugin that creates and serves static pages to non logged in users, it

00:15.040 --> 00:18.440
can improve your site speed tremendously.

00:18.490 --> 00:24.850
You can install WP super cache using the dashboard or WP CLIA.

00:25.180 --> 00:32.950
Once you have installed WP super cache, you need to configure the Engine X directors before you activate

00:32.950 --> 00:34.390
WP super cache.

00:34.420 --> 00:39.490
I have included the directive's in a PDF file attached to this lecture.

00:39.610 --> 00:47.230
I'll use our WordPress dashboard plugins, add new WP super cache, install now install plug ins.

00:47.380 --> 00:49.510
There is WP super cache.

00:49.510 --> 00:51.520
While I'm about it, I'm going to delete.

00:51.520 --> 00:52.300
Hello Dolly.

00:52.450 --> 01:01.030
The minute you use the dashboard, all WPEC you like to update or install new plug ins or theme.

01:01.300 --> 01:08.950
Run the script in your home directory to ensure that your files and directories have the correct ownership

01:08.950 --> 01:10.260
and permissions.

01:10.270 --> 01:16.780
I've changed to my home directory and I'm going to run the WP permissions script takes a few seconds,

01:16.780 --> 01:22.870
but it ensures that your files and directories have the correct permissions and ownership you can change

01:22.870 --> 01:28.000
to the Etsy Engine X directory and then to the global directory.

01:28.030 --> 01:30.400
We are going to create a new file.

01:30.430 --> 01:37.210
Sudano, followed by WP hyphen super hyphen Dot Seo.

01:37.210 --> 01:42.760
And if you can paste the directives from the PDF attached to this lecture.

01:42.760 --> 01:50.170
Now, what's important about these directives in your site's configuration file, you have a draft files

01:50.170 --> 01:50.950
directive.

01:51.070 --> 01:58.360
Now what we are doing is we are going to replace that TRA Files Directive with a draft files directive

01:58.360 --> 02:01.240
for WP super cache.

02:01.240 --> 02:03.850
You can exit saving your changes.

02:03.880 --> 02:08.920
We want to go back one level and then to your sites available directory.

02:08.920 --> 02:13.660
Once we in the sites available directory, we want to open our sites configuration file.

02:13.720 --> 02:17.410
You can scroll down until you find the TRA Files directive.

02:17.410 --> 02:21.250
You can delete those three lines control.

02:21.610 --> 02:28.720
OK, now we are going to use the include directive and we are going to include global slash WP super

02:28.720 --> 02:29.650
cache, not SEO.

02:29.650 --> 02:38.290
And if semicolon you can exit NENO saving your changes in the syntax is OK.

02:38.710 --> 02:43.630
In order to reload Ingenix, let's switch back to our browser.

02:44.110 --> 02:49.510
We can activate WP super cache and then go to settings.

02:49.510 --> 02:51.550
We have a problem warning.

02:51.550 --> 02:57.190
Could not update WP hyphen config from a previous lecture.

02:57.370 --> 03:04.450
When we discussed WP config, I mentioned to you that our permissions are strict on that particular

03:04.450 --> 03:04.900
file.

03:04.930 --> 03:11.950
You will have difficulty in installing security or caching plug ins with the permissions set as they

03:11.950 --> 03:12.850
currently are.

03:13.090 --> 03:15.940
Let's go back to plug ins, install plug ins.

03:16.090 --> 03:18.220
Now we need to change back to terminal.

03:18.310 --> 03:22.930
You need to change to your site's public HTML directory.

03:23.080 --> 03:27.250
Along listing will display the permissions on WP config.

03:27.250 --> 03:30.570
The owner, our user can read and write to the file.

03:30.580 --> 03:31.690
The Web server.

03:31.690 --> 03:33.850
Ingenix can only read the file.

03:33.850 --> 03:36.040
Other users can only read the file.

03:36.040 --> 03:37.420
That is a problem.

03:37.450 --> 03:44.650
WordPress cannot update or make any changes to WP config because the web server does not have right

03:44.650 --> 03:46.000
permissions on the file.

03:46.600 --> 03:51.880
Mod six six four followed by the filename WP Config six.

03:51.880 --> 03:54.070
Our user can read and write six.

03:54.070 --> 03:58.150
The Web server can read and write for other users can only read.

03:58.180 --> 04:00.040
Notice the change in permissions.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.320
Read, write, read, write, read.

04:02.350 --> 04:09.430
I recommend you restart the FPM service this change back to our browser WP super cache settings.

04:09.550 --> 04:12.670
We still have a permissions problem.

04:12.670 --> 04:14.100
Let's go back to terminal.

04:14.140 --> 04:20.800
A long listing of our public HTML directory will display the permissions on WP config.

04:21.100 --> 04:23.050
Read, write, read, write, read.

04:23.170 --> 04:26.770
The web server has right permissions on that file.

04:26.770 --> 04:28.390
Let's go back one level.

04:28.390 --> 04:35.410
A long listing will display the permissions on our public underscore HTML directory.

04:35.440 --> 04:40.630
Now the problem we have with permissions, we have given the web server right permissions on the file.

04:40.630 --> 04:48.460
But if you look at the public underscore HTML Directory seven five five, our user can read, write,

04:48.460 --> 04:52.060
execute, the web server can read and execute.

04:52.060 --> 04:57.580
The Web server has no permissions to write inside the public.

04:57.580 --> 05:00.340
Underscore HTML directory.

05:00.370 --> 05:06.400
We need to give the web server write permissions inside the public HTML directory.

05:06.500 --> 05:17.690
Sudo chmod 775 public underscore html, I recommend you restart the service that will clear the up cache.

05:17.870 --> 05:24.800
So at this stage we have given right permissions to the file WP config and we have also given the web

05:24.800 --> 05:29.360
server right permissions inside the public HTML directory.

05:29.390 --> 05:33.470
Let's go back to our browser WPK Super Cache Settings.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.130
Error configuration file is missing.

05:36.140 --> 05:38.330
Please reload the page.

05:38.330 --> 05:44.510
WP cache constant, edit its turn, caching on and update our status.

05:44.520 --> 05:46.340
Let's test the cache.

05:46.340 --> 05:50.480
WP super cache has been installed and working correctly.

05:50.520 --> 05:53.570
I would like you to click on the advanced tab.

05:53.750 --> 05:57.620
Enable caching is selected your cache delivery method.

05:57.770 --> 06:00.400
I would like you to select expert.

06:00.410 --> 06:07.790
We have added the WP Super Cache Engine X configuration files so the expert option can be enabled.

06:07.940 --> 06:13.190
I would also like you to select don't cache pages for known uses.

06:15.740 --> 06:18.410
You can then click update status.

06:19.960 --> 06:28.200
Now likely to click on Preload, Preload will create static files of every published post and page on

06:28.200 --> 06:33.660
your site, creating static pages will speed up your site tremendously.

06:33.810 --> 06:36.330
Refresh preload cache files every.

06:36.330 --> 06:43.410
I normally like to set it at 1200 minutes and then select preload mode garbage collection disabled.

06:43.410 --> 06:48.840
Send me status emails, no emails and you can click save settings.

06:48.990 --> 06:51.270
You can then click preload cache.

06:51.270 --> 06:58.650
Now in this lecture we optimize WordPress using Engine X directive's and WP super cache.
