A WordPress site or any content management system doesn't only consist of a database, they are also

00:24.240 --> 00:30.900
files that we need to back up 170 directories, one thousand six hundred thirty two files that we need

00:30.900 --> 00:32.610
to also back up.

00:38.620 --> 00:44.590
In our home directory, we have a directory file backup's that is where we are going to store our file

00:44.710 --> 00:45.460
backups.

00:45.490 --> 00:50.210
It's changed back to scripts to back up the site files.

00:50.230 --> 00:54.040
We are going to make use of tor tors like zap.

00:54.100 --> 00:59.310
We will use Tor to compress an entire directory of files.

00:59.320 --> 01:07.210
We have already created a file backups directory in our home directory to store our site files.

01:07.390 --> 01:15.280
The best script for creating a site backup your Shabangu line, then you specify your destination folder.

01:15.310 --> 01:18.450
That is the folder where you want to store your backup.

01:18.460 --> 01:22.000
In our case, home user file backups.

01:22.000 --> 01:29.700
Your archive file name the domain name often followed by two back ticks in between the two back ticks.

01:29.860 --> 01:32.650
Date time, dot, dot, dot cheesa.

01:32.890 --> 01:42.760
Then you have the actual talk slash open slash tor is the POS hyphen C, Z, VLF are the variables that

01:42.760 --> 01:45.730
we want to use with the tile command.

01:45.730 --> 01:48.490
See is to create a new file.

01:48.550 --> 01:51.460
Z is to compress automatically.

01:51.520 --> 01:57.670
V is to display the files on the screen while they are being processed by tau.

01:57.670 --> 02:07.120
And if is to specify we are creating an archive file the dollar destination folder slash dollar archive

02:07.120 --> 02:07.710
file.

02:07.750 --> 02:12.160
That information will be obtained from the variables above.

02:12.160 --> 02:17.980
We've already specified the destination folder and we've specified the archive file.

02:17.980 --> 02:22.750
Slash VA slash w w w slash side name.

02:22.780 --> 02:25.330
That is the path to your site.

02:28.880 --> 02:38.270
I'm going to create a new file using nano files, the school WPC Ally Dot is a first line is my Shabangu

02:38.270 --> 02:41.260
line, second line slash home user.

02:41.270 --> 02:46.520
I need to change user to my user on the server aka file.

02:46.520 --> 02:50.330
We need to change domain name to the name of the site.

02:50.390 --> 02:57.720
Slash, burn, slash tor followed by the variables, a destination folder slash archive file.

02:57.740 --> 03:00.410
Now we need to specify the POS.

03:00.440 --> 03:05.270
All I do is change site name to WPEC allai dot com.

03:05.270 --> 03:08.480
You can Xanana saving your changes.

03:08.480 --> 03:11.900
We need to change the permissions of files.

03:12.110 --> 03:15.220
WPEC July to plus x.

03:15.260 --> 03:20.810
All that's left is to add period forward slash followed by the name of the script.

03:22.010 --> 03:31.550
The entire slash far slash w w w slash WPEC allai dot com slash public html and every single directory

03:31.550 --> 03:36.180
thereunder flash past you while it was being taught KLD.

03:36.290 --> 03:38.600
Let's go back one level and list.

03:38.630 --> 03:45.950
It's changed to our file backup's directory and there is a back up of the WPEC allai dot com followed

03:45.950 --> 03:48.170
by the date and the time.

03:48.170 --> 03:52.490
The backup file size is a little over nine and a half megabytes.

03:52.490 --> 04:00.010
That backup SaaS will grow as you start adding media and more content to your WordPress site.

04:00.050 --> 04:05.420
So that is how you would back up your database as well as how you would back up files.

04:05.450 --> 04:10.820
In this lecture, we looked at performing database and site backups.
