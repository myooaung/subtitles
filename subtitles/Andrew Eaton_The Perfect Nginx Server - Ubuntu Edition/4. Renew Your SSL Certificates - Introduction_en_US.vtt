00:17.720 --> 00:25.040
In this lecture, we are going to look at renewing a let's encrypt SSL certificate, there are no new

00:25.040 --> 00:27.500
configuration files in this lecture.

00:27.650 --> 00:29.300
There are two commands.

00:29.810 --> 00:33.500
One command has two options, which we will look at.

00:34.400 --> 00:42.830
Firstly, to display the currently installed certificates sudo cert, but certificates that will display

00:43.130 --> 00:49.600
the certificates that have been installed on your server as well as the expiry date.

00:49.970 --> 00:54.170
I'm logged into my server Sudo Surgut certificates.

00:54.740 --> 00:58.610
There is one certificate installed WPC Allied dot com.

00:59.090 --> 01:02.330
The expiry date is also being displayed.

01:02.330 --> 01:12.120
It's valid for another 52 days to renew your certificate sudo cert but renew now you have two options.

01:12.140 --> 01:18.110
Dry Run will simulate the renewal to renew your actual certificates.

01:18.110 --> 01:20.570
Sudo should not renew.

01:20.600 --> 01:26.810
I like to use dry run initially just to check if I'm going to run into any problems.

01:26.930 --> 01:30.080
Sudo cert but renew double hyphen.

01:30.080 --> 01:31.070
Dry run.

01:38.100 --> 01:46.390
Congratulations, all renewals succeeded once, if confirmed that my renewals will run without any problems,

01:46.560 --> 01:55.200
I can use sudo cert but renew our Enuma certificates once a month, you will not be able to renew your

01:55.200 --> 02:00.830
certificates once a month unless you use the force renewal option.

02:00.990 --> 02:05.760
Sudo surfboat renew double hyphen force hyphen renewal.

02:13.890 --> 02:18.980
Congratulations, all renewals succeeded, you deserved what certificates?

02:19.520 --> 02:28.200
If I look at the expiry date now valid for 89 days after renewing or installing a let's encrypt certificate,

02:28.230 --> 02:31.020
you must reload Ingenix.

02:35.770 --> 02:37.600
Akron is a scheduler.

02:37.870 --> 02:44.260
It allows you to run a specific command at a specific time that you specify.

02:44.290 --> 02:49.400
So we will look at automated renewal shortly in this lecture.

02:49.540 --> 02:54.490
We looked at renewing our let's encrypt SSL certificates.
