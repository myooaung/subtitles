00:19.750 --> 00:26.830
In this lecture, we are going to configure Vasella files, Zila is an FTP client that allows us to

00:26.830 --> 00:30.050
upload and download files from our server.

00:30.250 --> 00:37.690
I've split the installation and configuration into two lectures, so please view the relevant lecture

00:37.690 --> 00:39.730
based on your operating system.

00:45.880 --> 00:53.080
For Mac users, you need to visit the foul on website and download the installation file, you install

00:53.080 --> 00:57.910
Farzana in the same way as with any other software package.

00:57.910 --> 01:04.870
Linux users, please use your package manager to download and install files in the configuration.

01:04.880 --> 01:09.820
Steps for both Mac and Linux is identical.

01:09.880 --> 01:11.510
I'd like you to open terminal.

01:11.530 --> 01:13.390
Do not log into the server.

01:13.390 --> 01:18.050
We will be using terminal locally in your home directory.

01:18.100 --> 01:22.450
I want you to use the Mac Directory Command, M.K. Diaa.

01:22.570 --> 01:28.120
And we want to create a directory called Files and Disco Keys.

01:28.330 --> 01:32.970
I then want you to change to your dot ss h directory.

01:33.190 --> 01:35.410
We want to copy our servers.

01:35.560 --> 01:36.530
Private key.

01:36.550 --> 01:45.640
In my case it's dō underscore course, underscore VPs and we want to copy to the files the Keys directory.

01:45.790 --> 01:54.130
So it will be Sepi followed by your private key file name, double period forward slash files keys.

01:54.310 --> 01:56.410
There is a copy of our private key.

01:56.410 --> 01:59.700
Inside the directory files are the Keys.

01:59.710 --> 02:06.310
I'd like you to open files folder once you've opened files and I'd like you to toggle the display off

02:06.310 --> 02:09.460
the local tree as well as the server tree.

02:09.580 --> 02:12.730
Those two settings take up too much real estate.

02:12.730 --> 02:16.750
On the screen you can click, file and then site manager.

02:16.840 --> 02:19.210
We want to create a new site.

02:19.210 --> 02:21.400
I'm going to call it VPs.

02:21.550 --> 02:24.310
The protocol is is FCP.

02:24.550 --> 02:28.090
The host is your servers IP address.

02:28.120 --> 02:31.930
Log on top will be key for the user.

02:31.930 --> 02:36.160
That is your server username in my case, Andrew.

02:36.220 --> 02:37.030
Key file.

02:37.030 --> 02:40.420
You can click browse, you can click on your home directory.

02:40.420 --> 02:43.840
Vasilakis followed by the private key.

02:43.930 --> 02:51.250
You've been warned that the format of the private key is not supported by files and it's asking you,

02:51.250 --> 02:53.500
would you like to convert the key?

02:53.710 --> 02:54.700
Yes, we would.

02:54.940 --> 02:58.660
You need to type your private key passphrase.

03:03.300 --> 03:05.430
That will unlock your private key.

03:05.560 --> 03:09.100
Now it's asking you for a new file name.

03:09.180 --> 03:11.500
You are again saving the private key.

03:11.520 --> 03:14.430
Only this time in a different format.

03:14.620 --> 03:19.940
I'm going to save it as the private key underscore fz save.

03:20.070 --> 03:21.860
You can click OK.

03:22.050 --> 03:25.050
Would you like Vasella to remember your password?

03:25.170 --> 03:28.050
Safest do not save passwords.

03:28.290 --> 03:33.180
File side manager under my sites our site is selected.

03:33.750 --> 03:36.570
Click Connect Unknown Host Key.

03:36.780 --> 03:38.400
That is your server fingerprint.

03:38.430 --> 03:41.130
You can always trust this particular host.

03:42.480 --> 03:48.060
We have been prompted for the passphrase to unlock our private key.

04:04.520 --> 04:12.590
And we have successfully made an s, if deep connection to our server at a later stage, I will be uploading

04:12.590 --> 04:16.440
and downloading a few files from our server.

04:16.460 --> 04:23.060
But at this stage, we've configured Vasella to log into our server so we can upload and download files

04:23.240 --> 04:26.780
to navigate double click the double period at the top.

04:26.780 --> 04:33.050
That will take you to the parent directory, which in this case would be home.

04:33.350 --> 04:37.790
If I double click it again, it will take me back to the root directory.

04:37.970 --> 04:41.240
There is our slash var directory.

04:45.050 --> 04:54.170
You can also manually type a location you would like to open, in this case, slash far slash W w w.

04:57.700 --> 05:06.850
And they are site directories, so for now, that is files in this lecture, we installed and configured

05:07.210 --> 05:08.050
files of that.
