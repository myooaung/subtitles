In this lecture, we are going to look at the steps you are going to follow when configuring Ingenix

00:23.790 --> 00:31.230
to start your journey using Engine Ingenix, the first step is to secure and optimize the main engine

00:31.230 --> 00:32.930
X configuration file.

00:32.970 --> 00:39.170
Then you need to create the relevant directories that will store your WordPress sites.

00:39.390 --> 00:46.130
Then it's back to Engine X, where you need to configure Engine X to serve your various sites.

00:46.140 --> 00:51.570
You can think of this as configuring Engine X virtual hosts.

00:51.630 --> 00:57.320
In Engine X terms, there are no virtual hosts, but rather server blocks.

00:57.540 --> 01:04.920
The next step involves creating the database that will store all your WordPress site information.

01:04.950 --> 01:12.570
The WordPress command line interface makes administering multiple WordPress sites exceptionally easy.

01:12.720 --> 01:18.350
It's during this stage that you will discover the true power of using the command line.

01:18.360 --> 01:27.840
We need to install WPEC Allai and look at a few of the commands by typing a few WPEC Alah commands.

01:27.870 --> 01:30.630
You are going to install a WordPress site.

01:30.840 --> 01:34.590
Securing WordPress is extremely important.

01:34.720 --> 01:39.240
You will start by securing WordPress using the command line.

01:39.360 --> 01:48.090
Then you will continue securing WordPress, this time using various Ingenix Directive's cert but offers

01:48.090 --> 01:50.370
free SSL certificates.

01:50.400 --> 01:57.800
There is no reason why you can't take advantage of this and serve all your sites over SSL.

01:57.840 --> 02:01.020
It's also good for search engine rankings.

02:01.050 --> 02:09.000
After creating the SSL certificates, you then need to configure secure Ingenix server blocks.

02:09.000 --> 02:17.400
Support SSL certificates are only valid for 90 days, so let's set up our server to automatically renew

02:17.400 --> 02:19.440
the certificates once a month.

02:19.630 --> 02:28.200
I'd like to point out that I've included the database and WPEC ally in the Engine X configuration section

02:28.350 --> 02:34.770
as it's all part of using Engine X as your web server to display your WordPress sites.

02:34.770 --> 02:42.360
When you configure a content management system, you cannot look at one component in isolation engine

02:42.360 --> 02:46.860
X, Marea, DB P, seven WordPress.

02:46.860 --> 02:48.810
They are all related.

02:48.840 --> 02:51.240
There is a lot of work that awaits you.

02:51.600 --> 03:01.350
But as always, I'll take you step by step explaining why every step needs to be completed before performing

03:01.350 --> 03:01.980
that step.

03:01.980 --> 03:08.790
Take it one step at a time and very soon you will master how to configure Engine X on your very own

03:08.790 --> 03:09.450
server.

03:09.600 --> 03:14.730
If you are not sure about something, please remember the course Q&amp;A.

03:14.760 --> 03:20.370
I'm there to help and guide you if you run into any problems with the course content.

03:20.520 --> 03:26.940
That was a brief overview of the steps we are going to follow in configuring Engine X.
