00:17.490 --> 00:24.720
In this lecture, we are going to use Chron to schedule our database and site backups, there are no

00:24.720 --> 00:28.520
configuration files to concern yourself with in this lecture.

00:28.740 --> 00:30.990
The command is crosstab.

00:31.170 --> 00:37.630
The half an hour FLAC will list the current cron jobs to create a new cron job.

00:37.650 --> 00:39.150
It is crosstab.

00:39.150 --> 00:40.050
I Finnie.

00:40.050 --> 00:43.440
We are going to create two green jobs.

00:43.470 --> 00:46.270
The first one will back up our databases.

00:46.320 --> 00:49.950
The second one will back up our site content.

00:50.190 --> 00:53.910
Because Maria DBI runs with elevated privileges.

00:53.910 --> 01:02.880
We need to create a Suja Cron job to back up our database and 538 m every day of the week I'm going

01:02.880 --> 01:09.720
to run the script WPC Allai DB up on the sixth day of every week.

01:09.720 --> 01:14.520
I'm going to run the script WPEC Allai site backup.

01:14.520 --> 01:20.610
I recommend you backup your databases on a daily basis, your site content.

01:20.670 --> 01:22.350
You can back up once a week.

01:22.360 --> 01:25.260
Sudo Crosstab Ifni.

01:25.260 --> 01:29.820
We are creating a route krunch up from a previous lecture.

01:29.970 --> 01:39.150
They are the two scripts which we run at three thirty and 40 am on the 14th day of each month to renew

01:39.150 --> 01:41.580
our Let's Encrypt certificates.

01:41.790 --> 01:50.940
I've added an additional job 530 am every day of the week slash home Andrew scripts followed by the

01:50.940 --> 01:54.480
name of the script WPC Allai DB backup.

01:54.480 --> 01:59.160
That script will back up our databases on a daily basis.

01:59.280 --> 02:07.680
You can exit NENO saving your changes, you can show up error key and change the hyphen E to a half

02:07.680 --> 02:12.630
an hour and there is a listing of our sudo cron jobs.

02:12.630 --> 02:18.930
Backing up your SOC files does not require elevated privileges crosstab e.

02:19.050 --> 02:28.980
So it's six thirty a.m. on the sixth day Saturday slash home Andrew scripts WPEC Allai site backup will

02:28.980 --> 02:30.660
run control x.

02:30.840 --> 02:31.350
Yes.

02:31.350 --> 02:33.000
You want to save the changes.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.870
Compress your up, change the hyphen E to a half final and there is a listing of the current jobs.

02:39.870 --> 02:46.740
In this lecture we looked at using Chron to schedule our database and site backups.
