In this lecture, we are going to restore a database and the site content files, there are no configuration

00:24.930 --> 00:31.660
files to concern yourself with in this lecture, the 12 steps to configure a site using Ingenix.

00:31.680 --> 00:35.040
We need to concern ourselves with step five.

00:35.280 --> 00:43.710
With step five, we need to restore the database and the site content from our backup files.

00:43.710 --> 00:50.460
You would complete steps one to four, step five, and then carry on from six to 12.

00:50.640 --> 00:58.840
What's important, the database dump file, as well as the backup file located in your home directory.

00:58.860 --> 01:05.580
You don't want to start copying it to other directories and end up having permission problems and listing

01:05.580 --> 01:14.280
of my home directory displays the L dot GZ file as well as the top dot GZ file, my database backup

01:14.280 --> 01:21.810
and MassArt content backup to restore the database, create a new database, create a user, give that

01:21.810 --> 01:26.070
user privileges on the database that you have created.

01:26.070 --> 01:33.150
It's most important that you make a note of the database name, the database user and the password.

01:33.150 --> 01:40.620
We will use the database name with the Restall command, the database name, user and password we need

01:40.770 --> 01:42.930
for the WP config file.

01:42.990 --> 01:48.320
Please note when you create a database backup, it's the greater than sign.

01:48.330 --> 01:54.210
When you restore the database back up, we will use that less than sign.

01:54.240 --> 02:00.700
If your database dumb file is an excuse, I'll file sudo MySQL.

02:00.750 --> 02:09.540
I find you root to log in to Maria DB, the name of the database lists and sign followed by the name

02:09.540 --> 02:11.670
of the HQ Alpha.

02:11.700 --> 02:22.110
What will happen is the contents of the file will be dumped into the database name that you have provided.

02:22.110 --> 02:25.110
Do not use the wrong database name.

02:25.140 --> 02:28.320
If Yuji's about the issue, I'll file G.

02:28.320 --> 02:38.270
Unzip this then sign followed by the GZ backup file name Peiping Simbel Sudo my Eskil I find you route

02:38.280 --> 02:41.280
followed by the database name.

02:41.460 --> 02:44.520
Do not use the wrong database name.

02:44.580 --> 02:46.650
These commands are straightforward.

02:46.890 --> 02:54.450
Only problems you have with these commands are getting mixed up with the database names and the backup

02:54.660 --> 02:55.680
file names.

02:55.800 --> 02:58.500
Make a note as you go along.

02:58.500 --> 03:06.660
I'm currently in a va w w w w pecola dot com public html directory listing displays.

03:06.660 --> 03:15.840
All my WordPress files sudo are in our M is used to delete if'n or include all directories as Strix

03:15.990 --> 03:17.460
means everything.

03:17.460 --> 03:20.310
I've erased my entire WordPress site.

03:20.460 --> 03:22.740
I've changed back to my home directory.

03:22.740 --> 03:31.710
I've copied my two backup files to my home directory, Ezekial Dot GZ, my database backup tor dot GZ,

03:31.710 --> 03:34.020
my site content backup.

03:34.140 --> 03:37.680
I've created a new database as well as a user.

03:37.710 --> 03:42.780
I've given that user a password as well as privileges on the database.

03:43.080 --> 03:46.010
Answer this then signed the name of the HQ.

03:46.050 --> 03:50.040
I'll file Peiping Simbel Sudo MySQL.

03:50.100 --> 03:59.180
I find you it followed by the database name that I want to dump the contents of the HQ I'll fall into.

03:59.340 --> 04:06.720
So we have just dumped the contents of Eskil file into the database we created.
