00:12.730 --> 00:15.650
Please check the resources section of this lecture.

00:15.670 --> 00:19.510
There is a PDF download to accompany this lecture.

00:24.010 --> 00:29.110
In this lecture, we are going to look at the software you need to complete the course.

00:29.260 --> 00:35.790
We also need to look at two important terms Shell and secure shell.

00:35.800 --> 00:43.600
You can use any operating system to complete this course, Windows, Mac and Linux.

00:43.630 --> 00:51.580
I do need to point out that certain lectures are specific to certain operating systems.

00:51.590 --> 00:59.220
If the lecture does not specify an operating system, then it's for all operating systems.

00:59.260 --> 01:04.110
They are full categories of software that you need.

01:04.210 --> 01:12.150
Firstly, the text editor, a text editor is the most widely used software for any web developer.

01:12.160 --> 01:18.280
I'm sure you have your favorite text editor, so please feel free to use it.

01:18.310 --> 01:26.460
You also need a SFP client to upload and download files to and from your server.

01:26.470 --> 01:35.170
I use and recommend only files if you Google files the very first entry files.

01:35.170 --> 01:40.570
Zillah hyphen project dot org is the file Zyla site file.

01:40.570 --> 01:42.550
Zila is cross platform.

01:42.940 --> 01:49.420
So Windows and Mac users you can download and install files onto the next users.

01:49.420 --> 01:53.920
You will find files in your distributions repositories.

01:53.920 --> 01:56.820
The choice of browser is yours.

01:56.860 --> 02:02.120
The last category of software we need is a terminal emulator.

02:02.140 --> 02:07.000
Now you may be wondering what is a terminal emulator.

02:07.000 --> 02:12.240
Before I get to that, I want to introduce you to two terms.

02:12.280 --> 02:16.840
What is the shell and what is secure shell?

02:16.870 --> 02:22.390
The Shell is a program that allows for user interaction.

02:22.420 --> 02:29.470
It takes your commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform.

02:29.500 --> 02:37.450
The programs you use to interact with the shell are called terminal emulators as we are giving commands

02:37.720 --> 02:39.010
from the keyboard.

02:39.370 --> 02:43.150
It is called the command line interface.

02:43.150 --> 02:51.910
In easy terms, you type a command, the shell accepts the command and passes it on to the operating

02:51.910 --> 02:53.530
system to perform.

02:53.710 --> 03:00.700
The shell is like a layer of software between you, the user and the operating system.

03:00.700 --> 03:09.640
Secure Shell is also abbreviated using is this which you will be using in this age to connect to your

03:09.640 --> 03:10.330
server?

03:10.350 --> 03:18.640
Is this is a program that allows you to connect to remote servers safely by safely.

03:19.240 --> 03:27.280
What I mean is all the data exchanged between you and the server is encrypted.

03:27.280 --> 03:36.490
An attacker cannot hijack the connection when encryption is enabled, encryption is transparent.

03:36.670 --> 03:44.530
What that means is you can work normally knowing that your daughter is safely encrypted on the network.

03:44.980 --> 03:51.940
What all that means is you connect to your server using a secure shell and the connection is encrypted.

03:51.940 --> 03:57.670
Each operating system has its own choice in terminal emulators.

03:57.670 --> 04:05.140
For Mac users, you will be using terminal terminal as found in your utilities folder.

04:05.140 --> 04:11.620
The utilities folder can be opened with command shift and you command shift.

04:11.620 --> 04:15.760
You will open the utilities folder.

04:15.760 --> 04:18.190
It's track terminal to the dock.

04:21.480 --> 04:24.840
I'd like you to open terminal with terminal.

04:25.020 --> 04:28.590
I'd like you to open preferences at the top.

04:28.800 --> 04:32.270
We have general profiles, window groups.

04:32.280 --> 04:40.560
I'd like you to click on profiles, the color scheme, fonts, etc. can be customized to your liking.

04:40.590 --> 04:44.010
There is one setting that I'd like you to disable.

04:44.010 --> 04:46.080
Profiles advanced.

04:46.140 --> 04:55.650
I'd like you to uncheck the set local environment variables on start up keeping the setting enabled

04:56.010 --> 04:59.600
generates local errors on your server.

04:59.610 --> 05:04.590
You can close preferences and close terminal for Linux users.

05:04.590 --> 05:13.460
You have a tremendous selection of terminal emulators terminal Terminix Terminator terminology.

05:13.710 --> 05:17.460
What I suggest is download each one, try it.

05:18.060 --> 05:20.250
If you like it, stick with it.

05:20.250 --> 05:28.110
Windows users, you don't have a built in terminal emulator, so we are going to be using command rather

05:28.110 --> 05:30.380
than my previous choice of party.

05:30.600 --> 05:35.940
Many students have had issues using Patty, Patty, Gene and Patty secure copy.

05:35.940 --> 05:41.220
It's time for Windows users to start using a modern day terminal emulator.

05:41.490 --> 05:48.040
We are going to cover downloading, installing as well as the configuration of commander.

05:48.240 --> 05:51.540
We also need to look at copying and pasting.

05:51.810 --> 05:53.220
Using Camarda.

05:53.520 --> 05:57.090
I'd like you to open your browser and then open the site.

05:57.240 --> 06:03.870
Commander Dot net s.m Deol dot net on the command home page.

06:04.290 --> 06:08.850
If you scroll a little way down, you'll reach the download options.

06:09.150 --> 06:12.570
You have to download many or download full.

06:12.570 --> 06:16.380
I would like you to please download the full version.

06:16.380 --> 06:20.430
You can download either the zip file or a seven.

06:20.430 --> 06:26.620
So far I've downloaded Commander, there is the seven zip file, CMT or DOT seven zip.

06:26.850 --> 06:28.620
I'd like you to copy the file.

06:31.410 --> 06:38.610
Then I'd like you to click on local desk, see in the right hand pane, we want to create a new folder.

06:38.640 --> 06:42.220
You can right click new folder folder.

06:42.240 --> 06:45.540
We want to create is s.m DVR.

06:45.840 --> 06:52.920
You can then open the commander folder and paste the seven or the file into that folder.

06:52.950 --> 06:57.410
You can extract all the files in the folder you created.

07:00.560 --> 07:08.930
I'm going to delete my seven Sopra, there is no set up file, you can record Camarda as a portable

07:08.930 --> 07:09.980
app commander.

07:11.030 --> 07:17.150
You can right click something to create a shortcut on your desktop that makes it somewhat easier when

07:17.150 --> 07:18.980
you need to open, commander.

07:20.870 --> 07:27.140
You can open, commander, initially, when you open commander, commander will automatically generate

07:27.140 --> 07:32.890
a few configuration files, you can ignore the automatically generated config files.

07:33.020 --> 07:39.860
I'd like you to put your mouse pointer somewhere on the title and right click and then select settings.

07:40.070 --> 07:47.120
The settings under general fonts, size and position, appearance, etc. allows you to customize the

07:47.120 --> 07:48.650
appearance of commander.

07:48.830 --> 07:52.360
Please feel free to customize Commander to your liking.

07:52.640 --> 07:59.680
There are a few settings that we need to make start up specified name task.

07:59.720 --> 08:04.490
You can click the dropdown arrow and select Besch Besch.

08:04.490 --> 08:08.570
When we start, Commander, we want you to run as a Besch console.

08:08.750 --> 08:16.400
Under environment, you can click the blank area on the right hand side you can add sit home equals

08:16.520 --> 08:19.680
C colon backslash s.m.

08:19.730 --> 08:22.790
The home is in uppercase.

08:22.970 --> 08:26.630
What we have done there is set the home directory.

08:26.660 --> 08:31.640
You can scroll down and click on keys and macra to hotkeys.

08:31.640 --> 08:36.860
You can click, you can type in C tr control W.

08:36.980 --> 08:41.660
That is a shortcut that we are going to be using with the editor.

08:41.660 --> 08:46.160
Neno we cannot allow Commander to overrule that key shortcut.

08:46.460 --> 08:50.690
So what we do is control, change it to win.

08:50.930 --> 08:56.750
So we have changed control w to when w you can click paste.

08:57.810 --> 09:05.580
Beast mode, one paced mode to multi lions, multi lions, so for the purposes of the course, those

09:05.580 --> 09:10.260
are the settings I'd like you to change taking care of under General.

09:10.560 --> 09:16.830
Please decide on which font you would like the size and position of the command window, the appearance

09:16.830 --> 09:20.220
of the window, those settings you can change on your own.

09:20.250 --> 09:23.250
I'd like you to click save settings.

09:23.970 --> 09:27.290
We need to create the dot s h directory.

09:27.330 --> 09:34.370
I'd like you to type in M.K. DII or make directory devah space dot s h.

09:34.710 --> 09:39.600
If I talk ellis' to list you won't see DSH today.

09:39.630 --> 09:41.610
This is a hidden directory.

09:41.640 --> 09:45.720
Any file or directory that starts with a period is hidden.

09:46.050 --> 09:55.290
Adding the hyphen, a flag will display dot ss h that is command configuration taken care of when it

09:55.290 --> 09:58.440
comes to copying and pasting with Commander.

09:58.530 --> 10:04.830
If you want to copy and paste some text inside the Camarda window, drag over the text.

10:04.830 --> 10:10.640
When you let go of the left button, the text that is highlighted has been copied to your clipboard.

10:10.650 --> 10:12.720
If you click all right, click.

10:12.720 --> 10:18.180
You will deselect that text and then right click to paste.

10:18.390 --> 10:26.220
If I want to copy and paste some text from an outside application, you select a text and then select

10:26.550 --> 10:27.840
copy in the command.

10:27.840 --> 10:29.160
A window, right.

10:29.160 --> 10:32.430
Click to paste bag over the text.

10:32.460 --> 10:36.900
You can paste it into any other application at any stage.

10:37.140 --> 10:42.060
If I ask you to open terminal and log into your server, you will open.

10:42.300 --> 10:46.890
Commander, the very first command you're going to be talking is to log in to your server.

10:46.920 --> 10:47.820
Is this OK?

10:47.940 --> 10:54.000
The user will be reached at followed by your servers IP address.

10:54.840 --> 11:02.190
Using commander is exactly the same as using terminal on A or terminal on and the next machine that

11:02.190 --> 11:04.590
is command get used to command.

11:04.620 --> 11:08.970
You are going to be using commander frequently throughout the course.

11:09.150 --> 11:13.380
In this lecture we looked at setting up various terminal simulators.

11:13.380 --> 11:18.270
For additional information, please refer to the PDF attached to this lecture.
