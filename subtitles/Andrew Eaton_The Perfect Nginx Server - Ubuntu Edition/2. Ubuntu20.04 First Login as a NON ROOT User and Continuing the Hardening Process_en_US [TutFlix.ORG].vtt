00:15.020 --> 00:21.510
Earlier when we logged in, we simply talked about this route at the server IP, we have now edited

00:21.510 --> 00:24.530
the SS HD underscore config file we restarted.

00:24.530 --> 00:31.110
This is a service you will not be able to log in as root root logging has been disabled.

00:31.130 --> 00:35.420
You need to log in as the non-routine user that you added to the server.

00:35.450 --> 00:37.270
I called my user, Andrew.

00:37.370 --> 00:43.880
So what we need to do is we need to log in as our non-unique user and then continue the hardening process.

00:44.030 --> 00:51.020
I'm going to type clear this each route et followed by my servers IP address route's password.

00:56.290 --> 00:57.340
Permission denied.

00:57.370 --> 00:58.350
Please try again.

01:01.040 --> 01:02.040
Permission denied.

01:02.150 --> 01:09.560
Please try again, control, see, to cancel that particular command, I'm unable to log in as the route

01:09.560 --> 01:10.110
user.

01:10.130 --> 01:17.540
I'll press my up error key, but instead of this route at my service IP address, I'll remove root and

01:17.540 --> 01:20.840
type the non route user that I added to the server.

01:20.850 --> 01:25.010
So in my case it is S.H. Andrew at my service IP.

01:25.010 --> 01:31.400
I can type my user's password and I've logged into the server as the non route user I created earlier.

01:31.400 --> 01:33.680
I'm going to type clear look at the prompt.

01:33.860 --> 01:41.420
The user, Andrew at the hostname Ubuntu 20 zero for the told indicates I mean the user's home directory.

01:41.480 --> 01:48.020
This time a dollar sign, not a hash sign dollar sign indicates Andrew is a non rugosa current working

01:48.020 --> 01:50.240
directory slash slash.

01:50.240 --> 01:53.770
And so I'm in the user andrews' home directory.

01:53.900 --> 01:58.700
We need to continue hardening the server by implementing the following measures.

01:59.000 --> 01:59.750
This is a key.

01:59.750 --> 02:07.340
Authentication will replace password usage with a public private key authentication system.

02:07.340 --> 02:11.840
When logging into your server, then we need to create what is called a config file.

02:11.840 --> 02:17.960
Config file makes logging into a server using SSL key authentication a lot faster.

02:17.960 --> 02:23.840
We need to look at server updates, server updates, deal with ensuring that all the packages on the

02:23.840 --> 02:25.190
server are up to date.

02:25.190 --> 02:32.150
One of the most important security steps is implementing a firewall policy that will close any unused

02:32.150 --> 02:34.820
ports and services that are not being used.

02:34.970 --> 02:38.750
Finally, we need to protect our server from brute force attacks.

02:38.900 --> 02:43.940
Failed to ban is an intrusion prevention framework that will do that for us.
