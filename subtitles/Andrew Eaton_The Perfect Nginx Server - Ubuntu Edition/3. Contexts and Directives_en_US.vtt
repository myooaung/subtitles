00:17.660 --> 00:25.850
In this lecture, we are going to look at contexts and directives, a directive is an instruction and

00:25.850 --> 00:30.140
it consists of an option and an option value.

00:30.260 --> 00:41.330
A directive ends in a semi colon server name is the option domain dot com and w w w dot domain dot com

00:41.330 --> 00:45.830
is the option value ending in a semicolon.

00:45.830 --> 00:49.850
That line is the server name directive.

00:49.880 --> 00:57.610
A context is also a directive, but it encloses other directives in its block.

00:57.800 --> 01:05.690
If you look at events to the right of events, we have a open curly bracket underneath the open curly

01:05.690 --> 01:06.240
bracket.

01:06.260 --> 01:10.070
We have the Worker Connections Directive.

01:10.070 --> 01:14.240
Underneath we have the closed curly bracket.

01:14.360 --> 01:17.420
That is the events context.

01:17.630 --> 01:21.320
Context contains other directives.

01:21.560 --> 01:29.000
What's important to remember is that directives can only be placed in the context that they were meant

01:29.000 --> 01:33.910
for in the event you place a directive in the wrong context.

01:33.920 --> 01:38.330
Engine X will produce an error on testing the configuration.

01:38.340 --> 01:47.270
There are five main contexts, main events, HTP server and location.

01:47.300 --> 01:53.930
The main context is the only context not contained within the context WLOX.

01:54.110 --> 02:00.080
The context blocks are indicated by the open and closed curly brackets.

02:00.090 --> 02:07.450
The main context is used to configure details that affect the entire Ingenix application.

02:07.580 --> 02:14.540
The events context, the events context is contained within the main context.

02:14.570 --> 02:20.480
It sets global options that affect how Ingenix handles connections.

02:22.290 --> 02:32.250
The HTP context is contained within the main context, the HTP context enables an configures the HTP

02:32.250 --> 02:34.260
service in Ingenix.

02:36.780 --> 02:45.270
The server context is contained within the HTP context, the server context contains the configuration

02:45.270 --> 02:52.860
for virtual hosts in Engine X terms of virtual host is referred to as the server block.

02:54.180 --> 03:02.370
The location context is contained within the server context, the location context lets you configure

03:02.580 --> 03:10.500
how Engine X will respond to requests for resources within the server, you can clearly see how the

03:10.500 --> 03:15.920
location context is contained within the server context.

03:15.930 --> 03:26.100
When we look at the five main engine X contexts, we have main events and HTP inside the HTP context.

03:26.100 --> 03:34.230
You have the server context, inside the server context, you have the location context.

03:34.230 --> 03:43.770
When you look at this diagram, the server context is a child of HTP and the location context is a child

03:43.770 --> 03:46.460
of the server context.

03:46.470 --> 03:52.830
When we start working with Ingenix configuration files, you may find that you have the same directive

03:52.830 --> 03:58.260
inside the HTP context and the server context.

03:58.260 --> 04:08.130
When you work with Engine X, a directive in a child context will override the parent context so child

04:08.130 --> 04:13.070
context can override the directives in the parent context.

04:13.080 --> 04:19.200
In this lecture we looked at contexts and directives with reference to Engine X.
