00:00.390 --> 00:09.600
The location context is contained within the server context, the location context lets you configure

00:09.880 --> 00:16.470
our engine X will respond to requests for resources within the server.

00:17.010 --> 00:24.480
The location match defines what Engine X should check the request you are against.

00:24.510 --> 00:32.910
The existence or nonexistence of a modifier affects the way that Engine X attempts to match the location

00:32.910 --> 00:33.360
block.

00:33.540 --> 00:41.490
When you work with Engine X and you start working with location contexts, you need to identify the

00:41.490 --> 00:46.560
various modifiers and what those modifiers do.

00:46.740 --> 00:54.330
Engine X processes requests based on whether there is a modifier or not.

00:54.660 --> 01:04.800
In order of importance, the order that Engine X will process the modifier the equals sign is an exact

01:05.160 --> 01:05.940
match.

01:06.180 --> 01:11.610
The carrot told is a preferential prefix match.

01:11.940 --> 01:22.740
The told is a regular expression case sensitive match that told esoterics is a regular expression case

01:22.950 --> 01:25.080
insensitive match.

01:25.290 --> 01:29.220
And finally, you have no modifier.

01:29.220 --> 01:34.980
The equals sign is an exact match if a request is made.

01:35.160 --> 01:44.760
Site dot com slash favourite's icon in the location context, it says if an exact match for that particular

01:44.760 --> 01:49.530
file is made, apply the EXPIRES Directive.

01:49.980 --> 01:56.550
The EXPIRES Directive states that that file will be cached for one year.

01:56.730 --> 02:01.440
A preferential prefix match is your carrot told.

02:01.620 --> 02:09.810
A preferential prefix match is more important than a case sensitive or case insensitive.

02:10.080 --> 02:11.760
Regular expression.

02:11.940 --> 02:22.140
If you have a location context with the carrot told, Ingenix, will apply that context, even if there

02:22.140 --> 02:26.400
is a better match through a regular expression.

02:26.580 --> 02:33.090
The told is a case sensitive regular expression match.

02:33.300 --> 02:42.150
If somebody attempts to access site DOT, Slashdot, H.T. access, this location context will apply

02:42.150 --> 02:51.030
and a directive Dinni all will apply to anyone attempting to access a file dot H.T. Access.

02:51.210 --> 02:58.500
The told esoterics is for a case insensitive regular expression match.

02:58.710 --> 03:06.110
If you look at the location context slash uploads, slash asterisks dot p.

03:06.330 --> 03:14.790
If somebody happens to upload a malicious script to your server and they then try and access that file,

03:14.820 --> 03:23.460
they would use site dot com uploads, slash the directory name followed by the name of the IP script.

03:23.580 --> 03:32.900
We are using a case insensitive match for anyone attempting to access a file in your uploads directory.

03:32.910 --> 03:40.920
That case, insensitive regular expression, will match a file typed in uppercase and lowercase and

03:40.920 --> 03:49.380
apply the directive to NEI or they will not be able to run the file in your uploads directory.

03:49.500 --> 03:54.360
Yeah, we have a location context with no modifier.

03:54.390 --> 04:00.420
A no modifier is a prefix match in this particular case.

04:00.420 --> 04:08.910
This is the TRAI Files directive and how this works is when a request is made to your server, engine

04:08.910 --> 04:10.920
X will check for the file.

04:11.130 --> 04:19.350
Firstly at the you are l then if it doesn't find it, it will then look for a directory to match the

04:19.350 --> 04:20.100
request.

04:20.310 --> 04:29.760
If it doesn't find a file or directory, it then does an internal redirect to index dot p p passing

04:29.760 --> 04:33.390
the query string arguments as parameters.

04:33.420 --> 04:41.340
As we start configuring the various directives inside the server blocks, I'll discuss the various modifiers

04:41.340 --> 04:47.910
and look at why we are using that particular modifier in that particular case.
