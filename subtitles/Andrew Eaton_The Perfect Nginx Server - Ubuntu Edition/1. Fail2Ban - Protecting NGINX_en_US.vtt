WEBVTT

00:00.150 --> 00:02.950
Please check the resources section of this lecture.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.700
There is a PDF download available.

00:23.080 --> 00:29.440
As we've discussed before, failed to ban is an intrusion prevention framework in this lecture, we

00:29.440 --> 00:35.770
are going to further configure, failed to bear to provide some additional protection for our Web server.

00:35.770 --> 00:41.200
Ingenix, we are going to configure for gaolers engine X bot search.

00:41.410 --> 00:47.830
This jail will block bots searching for exploitable content that doesn't exist.

00:47.830 --> 00:49.660
Engine X bad bots.

00:49.870 --> 00:54.010
This jail will catch spambots, engine X, no home.

00:54.010 --> 00:59.980
This jail will block an IP attempting to locate the home directory on your server.

00:59.980 --> 01:02.620
And finally, Ingenix no proxy.

01:02.620 --> 01:08.800
This jail will block an IP attempting to use your server as a proxy server.

01:08.800 --> 01:12.730
They are five configuration files that we are going to work with.

01:12.910 --> 01:21.340
The main fail to ban configuration file Gmail DOT local it's found in the ITC fail to ban directory

01:21.520 --> 01:23.620
the three Gmail files.

01:23.620 --> 01:26.500
Bad bots, no home, no proxy.

01:26.530 --> 01:33.340
They are all found in the ITC fail to ban filter dot d directly.

01:33.520 --> 01:42.640
The default Debian file is where you enable the jails and that's located in etsi fail to ban Gmail.

01:42.790 --> 01:48.580
Dot d also want to remind you of the location of your failed to ban log file.

01:48.610 --> 01:51.940
It's in the slash bar slash log directory.

01:52.060 --> 01:56.290
This letter is all about editing various configuration files.

01:56.410 --> 02:02.920
You will need to use NENO to edit the files once we finished editing the various configuration files.

02:02.920 --> 02:09.040
You need to restart the fail to burn service to enable the changes we have made.

02:09.220 --> 02:15.880
After logging into your server, I'd like you to change to the EDC Engine X sites available directory.

02:15.880 --> 02:19.840
I don't like you to open one of your site configuration files.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.330
I'll open Mac Web dev dot com.

02:22.330 --> 02:27.880
I'd like you to scroll to the end of the file and above the last Brasi.

02:27.910 --> 02:35.170
We are going to add our custom log files for this particular site so the directive's will be accessed

02:35.170 --> 02:39.460
underscore log and then the path to our log file file log.

02:39.460 --> 02:47.020
Ingenix the access log file name for Mac Web dev will be Mac Web Dev underscore access dot log.

02:47.140 --> 02:53.620
The same for the error log except to file name will be Mac Web dev underscore error dot log.

02:53.620 --> 02:58.060
In this fashion, each one of my sites can have their own log files.

02:58.270 --> 03:06.190
We can exit our sites configuration file saving the changes can test the configuration and then restart

03:06.190 --> 03:12.310
engine x kd double period forward slash double period forward slash fail to burn.

03:12.340 --> 03:16.060
We want to change to the Etsy fail to bend directory.

03:16.270 --> 03:21.940
We want to open the main fail to burn configuration file Gmail dot local using.

03:21.940 --> 03:25.840
Then you can scroll down till you find the section Ingenix.

03:30.220 --> 03:36.310
We have Ingenix HTP else we won't be dealing with that engine export search.

03:36.340 --> 03:42.870
I'd like you to take note of the log pass because I'm making use of custom log file names.

03:42.880 --> 03:45.220
I need to change the log pass.

03:50.100 --> 03:58.860
So my blog posts will be var log Ingenix as Strix error asterisks dot log in the companion to this lecture.

03:58.980 --> 04:03.310
I have given you the entries for the jail dot local file.

04:03.330 --> 04:13.960
We can look at bad bots port http https the log pos file log ingenix Strix access asterisks dot log.

04:14.100 --> 04:20.160
The same applies to Ingenix no proxy and no home under Ingenix bot search.

04:20.220 --> 04:26.870
You can go to the max retry equals to Antep control k to remove that line.

04:26.880 --> 04:32.210
So that is our main fail to ban file taking care of jail dot local.

04:32.250 --> 04:35.830
You can exit jail, dot local saving your changes.

04:36.030 --> 04:39.930
We now want to change to the full to dot the directory.

04:40.050 --> 04:43.620
We already have the Ingenix bot search jail.

04:43.650 --> 04:52.680
We need to add the additional three jails sudo neno Ingenix hyphen badmouths dot seo and if you can

04:52.680 --> 05:01.770
copy and paste the contents of Ingenix bad bots dot seo and if you can exit Ingenix bad, what's saving

05:01.770 --> 05:02.760
your changes.

05:02.940 --> 05:10.410
Sudo neno Ingenix hyphen no homecourt SEO and if once you've pasted the contents of no home dot seo

05:10.410 --> 05:19.140
and if you can exit saving your changes the last file so you engine Ingenix hyphen no proxy dot seo

05:19.140 --> 05:22.260
and if you can then exit Ingenix no proxy.

05:22.470 --> 05:29.730
Saving your changes and listing will display the three additional channels that we have just created.

05:29.900 --> 05:32.280
CD Double Period Forward Slash.

05:32.310 --> 05:33.300
Jill Dougherty.

05:33.300 --> 05:38.550
We want to go back one level and change to the jail, dot the directory.

05:38.580 --> 05:42.600
We then want to open the defaults Debian file using Nenna.

05:42.600 --> 05:48.150
We already have an entry that is our SS hgl in the companion to this lecture.

05:48.180 --> 05:53.460
I have given you the entries for bot search bad bots, no proxy and no home.

05:53.470 --> 05:57.360
All we are specifying is that those jails are enabled.

05:57.540 --> 06:01.950
The bantam is a week and we will allow two attempts.

06:02.070 --> 06:06.300
You can exit defaults, Debian saving your changes.

06:06.300 --> 06:10.590
Now we need to restart the failed to bad service sudo system.

06:10.600 --> 06:13.050
Ctrl restart failed.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.330
Too bad it may take a while.

06:15.330 --> 06:21.690
Please be patient that for Stachelberg Kett failed to Ben.

06:21.720 --> 06:27.920
I'm going to scroll up to look at the entries in the log file exiting failed to ban creating new GL

06:27.960 --> 06:39.120
ss HD creating new Jo Ingenix bot search creating Dujayl Ingenix Bad bots Dujayl Ingenix no proxy Dujayl

06:39.120 --> 06:44.070
Ingenix no her look at the log files, how they are being monitored.

06:44.160 --> 06:54.020
The Asterix Access Strix McQuaig Dev underscore access WPK Allai Access and the access dot log file.

06:54.060 --> 07:00.690
So at this stage we have provided an important additional layer of security to our server.

07:00.690 --> 07:07.680
In this lecture we configured failed to band to provide additional layers of security to Ingenix.
