00:05.330 --> 00:08.540
Please download the PDF attached to this lecture.

00:13.820 --> 00:19.820
I recommend you purchase a cheap domain name for the purposes of completing this course, you are free

00:19.820 --> 00:28.130
to use any domain name registrar, but I don't recommend you use the domain registrars DNS servers,

00:28.160 --> 00:32.930
rather use the free DNS service offered by CloudFlare.

00:32.990 --> 00:39.620
The speed, security and propagation time cannot be matched by any domain name registrar.

00:39.680 --> 00:46.700
I recommend you sign up for a free CloudFlare account and then follow the easy steps to start using

00:46.700 --> 00:48.590
cloud flea's name servers.

00:48.830 --> 00:54.650
The process involves simply changing the name servers at your domain registrar.

00:55.100 --> 00:59.420
The proxy status must be set to DNS only.

00:59.570 --> 01:05.870
CloudFlare needs to be configured correctly to take advantage of the performance and security benefits

01:05.870 --> 01:12.710
that the proxy status offers that we will look at later in the course to change the proxy status from

01:12.710 --> 01:20.270
proxy to DNS only select, edit and simply click on the icon to change to DNS only.

01:27.430 --> 01:31.660
And both my records have been changed from proxy to DNS only.

01:36.780 --> 01:43.830
This course was not designed to be completed on your PC or Mac using one of the many available virtual

01:43.830 --> 01:44.520
machines.

01:44.730 --> 01:47.910
Oracle's virtual box is one example.

01:47.950 --> 01:55.560
The aim of this course is to instruct you on how to set up a secured and hardened hosting environment

01:55.560 --> 02:02.760
and then host multiple WordPress sites on a commercially purchased VPN or a dedicated server.

02:02.820 --> 02:08.500
This course is not a lab experiment with no real world application.

02:08.520 --> 02:12.030
I want you to be able to look at the server logs.

02:12.060 --> 02:19.310
I want you to see how malicious users and bots scan your server are they probe for vulnerabilities.

02:19.530 --> 02:24.410
You need to be able to see the result of your hardening in your server logs.

02:24.570 --> 02:27.750
None of this can be done in a virtual machine.

02:27.780 --> 02:30.800
The only advantage of a VMS is the cost.

02:30.810 --> 02:37.860
It's free, although hosting a site locally using a VM is free, it's rather pointless for the reasons

02:37.860 --> 02:38.770
I've just mentioned.

02:38.880 --> 02:44.720
I think it's rather obvious hosting a WordPress site is going to cost you money every month.

02:44.760 --> 02:49.830
You need to pay a Web host for the server rental in the section web hosts.

02:50.010 --> 02:52.530
I've given you a coupon code for vulture.

02:52.530 --> 02:54.330
Create a vulture account.

02:54.510 --> 02:58.800
Using that code, vulture will give you 100 dollars credit.

02:58.960 --> 03:03.000
That means you will have a free server for 30 days.

03:03.180 --> 03:09.510
The 30 day period is more than enough time for you to complete the course two or three times.

03:14.570 --> 03:21.560
You are free to use any Web host of your choosing, but I recommend you sign up and use Vulture for

03:21.560 --> 03:22.990
the purposes of this course.

03:23.210 --> 03:29.300
I say this because some hosts customize the server distribution installed on their servers.

03:29.310 --> 03:37.430
And what happens is you run into issues that are a consequence of that customization by you using the

03:37.430 --> 03:43.200
same hosting environment as I am using issues that are host related.

03:43.220 --> 03:47.650
I removed this makes troubleshooting so much easier.

03:47.720 --> 03:51.560
There are a few reasons why Vulture is my recommended Web host.

03:51.740 --> 03:54.190
Vulture is stable and reliable.

03:54.230 --> 03:55.940
The pricing is excellent.

03:56.120 --> 03:59.330
Its quick and easy to create a new server.

03:59.330 --> 04:02.540
You have a choice of locations around the globe.

04:02.840 --> 04:06.940
Excellent support in the event of you experiencing issues.

04:07.160 --> 04:14.180
One of the most important factors is that the server distribution that vulture offers is very close

04:14.180 --> 04:16.130
to the official distribution.

04:16.250 --> 04:23.570
Attached to this lecture is a PDF that contains a vulture link that will give you 100 dollars free credit

04:23.660 --> 04:24.560
from Vulture.

04:24.590 --> 04:28.930
That translates into 30 days free VPs hosting.

04:28.940 --> 04:32.690
I must point out that this offer is subject to change.

04:32.690 --> 04:38.930
So please check the vulture website for any terms and conditions related to this offer.

04:43.920 --> 04:50.640
The minimum service specifications that I recommend for a development server are as follows, a single

04:50.640 --> 04:59.010
CPU core, one gig of RAM solid state drive and a multi gigabit per second network connection for a

04:59.010 --> 05:00.220
production server.

05:00.270 --> 05:09.000
I recommend a dual core CPU two to four gigs of RAM, a solid state drive, as well as a multi gigabit

05:09.000 --> 05:10.800
per second network connection.

05:10.830 --> 05:18.210
I cannot emphasize the importance of having enough RAM a mostly static or informational type WordPress

05:18.210 --> 05:23.010
site can get by with two gigs of RAM but are highly dynamic.

05:23.010 --> 05:26.410
WordPress site definitely needs more RAM.

05:26.430 --> 05:30.780
Don't go for the cheapest deal when selecting your production server.

05:30.780 --> 05:38.550
Hosting an e-commerce site on a free or low memory server is going to end up being an exercise in patience.

05:38.760 --> 05:42.720
Be prepared for hours of frustration while you troubleshoot.

05:42.720 --> 05:45.720
Why is my server giving so many issues?

05:45.810 --> 05:51.300
No amount of caching and optimization can replace physical hardware.

05:51.330 --> 05:55.320
By that, I'm referring to adding more ram to your server.

05:55.320 --> 06:03.120
Too much ram is always better than too little or just enough for most hosts offer hardware upgrades.

06:03.300 --> 06:10.260
So if you want to increase your RAM and CPU cores after you have created your server, it can be done

06:10.380 --> 06:12.510
with zero downtime.

06:12.510 --> 06:19.410
For the duration of this course, I'll be using a commercially purchased one gram walcher FPS.

06:24.400 --> 06:29.800
Now we are going to create a survey, for instance, after creating your vulture account and logging

06:29.800 --> 06:34.420
in on the left hand side, you can select products once the products page opens.

06:34.420 --> 06:37.900
On the right hand side, the big blue plus sign, you can point to it.

06:37.900 --> 06:41.470
And then I want you to select the option to deploy new server.

06:41.500 --> 06:49.180
We are going to deploy a new server instance to server cloud compute, cloud compute and VPs are the

06:49.180 --> 06:49.750
same.

06:49.750 --> 06:51.750
It's just different terminology.

06:51.820 --> 06:54.450
The next step is server location.

06:54.460 --> 06:59.650
It's always best to select a server that is closest to your target market.

06:59.800 --> 07:06.850
If your site is targeting the German market host in Germany, the location isn't important for a development

07:06.850 --> 07:07.390
server.

07:07.390 --> 07:14.650
But for your production server it's advantageous as the response times will be much lower for your site

07:14.650 --> 07:15.340
visitors.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.260
I'll select Amsterdam.

07:19.100 --> 07:26.360
The next step is server type, this refers to the distribution or the server operating system, Ubuntu

07:26.360 --> 07:28.400
twenty point zero for.

07:29.920 --> 07:37.570
Services for development server, single CPU core gig of RAM one terabyte bandwidth is more than adequate.

07:38.870 --> 07:45.920
Additional features you can ignore, as well as start up script and SSL keys to the server hostname

07:45.920 --> 07:48.890
is important when you are configuring a male server.

07:48.910 --> 07:56.330
But in our case, we can name the server simply to identify it with the server hostname restrict the

07:56.330 --> 07:59.750
hostname to alpha numeric characters only.

07:59.750 --> 08:07.130
I'm going to type my hostname as one to 20 zero for all that's left is to click deploy now, which will

08:07.130 --> 08:08.930
create your server for instance.

08:11.240 --> 08:14.030
Give the process a few minutes to complete.

08:16.090 --> 08:21.980
Status has changed from installing to running once the status has changed to running.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.580
You can click on your servers hostname.

08:28.230 --> 08:33.960
Please take note of the Amber warning your server is currently being installed, most server actions

08:33.960 --> 08:36.690
will be unavailable until this has completed.

08:36.720 --> 08:38.790
Give it a few minutes to finish.

08:38.790 --> 08:42.630
Vulture will notify you once the process has completed.

08:42.690 --> 08:44.190
The warning has been removed.

08:44.190 --> 08:49.170
Our server has been created successfully after clicking on your servers hostname.

08:49.170 --> 08:55.710
The information that is important to us is the servers Internet protocol address or servers IP address

08:55.740 --> 08:59.850
the server username which is route and then the password.

08:59.880 --> 09:02.940
That is the password for the route user.

09:02.970 --> 09:09.260
You can click on the option to show password, which will then display the password for the route user.

09:09.270 --> 09:13.980
You also have an option to copy the IP address as well as copy the password.

09:14.010 --> 09:18.680
In the next section of the course, we are going to log in to the server for the first time.

09:18.690 --> 09:23.970
It makes no difference if you are using Windows, Mac OS or Linux.

09:23.970 --> 09:30.840
When I ask you to log in to your server as the user, what you need to do is open your terminal emulator.

09:30.870 --> 09:33.890
The command is S.H. You leave a space.

09:33.900 --> 09:38.700
The first time we log into the server, we log in as the router user.

09:38.700 --> 09:44.700
So you type route at now you need to specify the IP address of your server.

09:44.700 --> 09:49.680
You could switch back to the vulture control panel, IP address, copy, IP address.

09:49.800 --> 09:55.380
I'll switch back to terminal and paste my IP address immediately after the aside.

09:55.440 --> 10:00.480
The warning that you receive after pressing enter refers to the server fingerprint.

10:00.480 --> 10:06.420
When we start the actual lecture on logging into your server for the first time, I will look at the

10:06.420 --> 10:09.090
server fingerprint in more detail for now.

10:09.120 --> 10:11.580
Are you sure you want to continue connecting?

10:11.580 --> 10:16.470
You need to type the word yes and then press enter route at your servers.

10:16.470 --> 10:18.120
IP address password.

10:18.360 --> 10:22.590
Switch back to the vulture control panel and copy password.

10:22.830 --> 10:25.200
Switch back to terminal and paste.

10:25.380 --> 10:32.430
You have now successfully logged into your server as the route user you can type exit.

10:32.610 --> 10:37.430
The exit command is used to log out of your server at any stage.

10:37.470 --> 10:42.930
If you would like to start the course over again on your service information page that we are looking

10:42.930 --> 10:45.720
at, we have an option to destroy the server.

10:45.750 --> 10:51.140
Yes, you need to confirm you want to destroy the server and then click destroy the server.

10:51.150 --> 10:52.740
This can be done at any time.

10:52.740 --> 10:58.470
If you want to start the course over again after destroying the server, point to the plus sign.

10:58.470 --> 11:01.860
Deploy new server to server cloud compute.

11:01.860 --> 11:03.060
Choose the location.

11:03.060 --> 11:08.820
I'll select Amsterdam server, type the operating system open to the services.

11:08.820 --> 11:14.670
If I have done a server, I can use the same hostname Ubuntu twenty point zero four and then click on

11:14.880 --> 11:16.080
deploy now.

11:21.730 --> 11:28.180
Wait a few minutes for the initial installation process to complete once the status changes from installing

11:28.180 --> 11:31.270
to running, we can click on the server hostname.

11:37.530 --> 11:43.050
The status has changed to running, I can click on the host name, the next page will display my new

11:43.050 --> 11:47.250
IP address as well as the new password for the user.

11:47.250 --> 11:49.060
I'll copy the IP address.

11:49.110 --> 11:56.250
The procedure is exactly the same as each route that followed by your servers IP address.

12:01.310 --> 12:08.210
In this section, we looked at where posts and server specifications, I logged in to Vulture and deployed

12:08.210 --> 12:12.610
a new server instance, please check the PDF attached to this lecture.

12:12.710 --> 12:16.610
There is a link that will give you 100 dollars free credit with Vulture.

12:16.640 --> 12:20.660
That translates into 30 days free VPs hosting.

12:20.660 --> 12:28.280
With that, all that's left is to log in as the route user and start the process of securing our server.
