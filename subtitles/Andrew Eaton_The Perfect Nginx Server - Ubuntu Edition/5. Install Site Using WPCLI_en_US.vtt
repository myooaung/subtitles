00:05.060 --> 00:07.970
I've combined the fourth and fifth steps.

00:08.150 --> 00:15.020
This is where you create your WordPress site first you need to create the database and then you need

00:15.020 --> 00:23.660
to install the site using WP CLIA as the first site you created, use your text editor and create what

00:23.660 --> 00:25.730
I call a site file.

00:25.760 --> 00:31.480
This file contains all the database and WP CLIA commands.

00:31.490 --> 00:34.460
It makes life much easier doing it this way.

00:34.490 --> 00:38.930
I've created my MAC Web, their file with all the relevant information.

00:38.990 --> 00:43.520
All that's left for me to do is to copy and paste the commands.

00:43.550 --> 00:49.970
One important aspect you must take note of, and that is the installation you are.

00:50.360 --> 00:58.960
Have you used the naked domain name or have you used w w w dot the domain name?

00:58.970 --> 01:02.520
I have seen so many problems arising from this situation.

01:02.540 --> 01:11.300
Please make note if you've used the naked domain name, that is the domain name without w w w or you've

01:11.300 --> 01:16.150
decided to use w w w dot followed by the domain name.

01:16.190 --> 01:25.670
If you look at my site file WP or install the u r l http domain name, there is no w w w we need to

01:25.670 --> 01:31.820
log in to Maria db sudo MySQL for new root.

01:31.820 --> 01:38.570
You will be prompted for your sudo password from my site file and pasting the commands.

01:38.570 --> 01:44.660
Create database, grant all privileges to that user on the specific database.

01:44.660 --> 01:51.710
And finally I am flashing the privileges once we've created our database you can exit Miria DB.

01:52.250 --> 02:02.120
You then need to change to your site's public underscore html directory cd slash var w w w domain name

02:02.420 --> 02:03.890
papic html.

02:03.920 --> 02:14.240
You can then paste your w PCR commands from your site, file WP Core Download WP or config and finally

02:14.240 --> 02:16.250
WP core install.

02:21.930 --> 02:29.400
Success WordPress installed successfully a listing of our public HTML directory displays our WordPress

02:29.400 --> 02:31.130
files and directories.

02:31.380 --> 02:35.670
Open the site using my browser, there is the default WordPress page.

02:35.700 --> 02:38.400
We also need to enable pretty permalink.

02:38.760 --> 02:46.290
You need to change to your Etsy Ingenix sites available directory and then open your site's configuration

02:46.290 --> 02:46.770
file.

02:46.800 --> 02:55.740
Using NENO, you need to remove the equals for, for and change it to slash indexed questionmark dollar

02:56.550 --> 03:01.410
is semicolon that will enable pretty permalink.

03:01.770 --> 03:06.270
You can exit your site's configuration file, saving your changes.

03:06.300 --> 03:08.090
Lets test the configuration.

03:08.100 --> 03:09.270
Everything is fine.

03:09.400 --> 03:12.960
It's reload Ingenix to enable the change.

03:13.110 --> 03:17.130
I've logged in to my site's dashboard settings permalink.

03:17.460 --> 03:19.770
I want to change it to post name.

03:24.530 --> 03:27.260
We have now enabled pretty permalink.
