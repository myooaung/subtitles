00:19.770 --> 00:26.670
In this lecture, we are going to configure Vasella files, Zila is an EFTPOS client that allows us

00:26.670 --> 00:30.070
to upload and download files from our server.

00:30.270 --> 00:37.710
I've split the installation and configuration into two lectures, so please view the relevant lecture

00:37.710 --> 00:39.750
based on your operating system.

00:48.890 --> 00:55.460
Windows users, you need to visit the files in a website and download the installation file, you install

00:55.460 --> 01:00.560
files in the same way as with any other software package.

01:00.590 --> 01:04.740
Let's look at configuring files for Windows Windows users.

01:04.760 --> 01:10.190
You can open files on the first day before we start with our files in a configuration.

01:10.340 --> 01:14.740
This is the local tree and that is the remote tree.

01:14.780 --> 01:21.390
We can turn off the local tree as well as the remote tree on the extreme left.

01:21.440 --> 01:24.130
We have open site manager.

01:24.290 --> 01:26.840
We want to create a new site.

01:26.990 --> 01:29.090
I'm going to call it VPs.

01:29.090 --> 01:35.570
One protocol is FCP host is your service IP address port.

01:35.570 --> 01:36.560
You can leave blank.

01:36.950 --> 01:41.360
It will default to Port 22 login type Kifah.

01:41.510 --> 01:44.930
The user is your username on the server.

01:48.120 --> 01:54.900
Kifah, we need to browse Seedorf when we set up the software for this course, when you download it,

01:54.900 --> 01:55.630
Commander.

01:55.650 --> 02:00.600
We created a directory on your C drive called s.M DCR.

02:00.690 --> 02:04.470
You can open that directory inside the command directory.

02:04.740 --> 02:12.930
You have another directory called DOT, which you can open DSH the moment it says no items match your

02:12.930 --> 02:13.660
search.

02:13.680 --> 02:17.070
We need to change the file type PPK.

02:17.070 --> 02:19.950
You need to change to all files.

02:20.280 --> 02:24.980
Once you've done that, find your private key for your server.

02:24.990 --> 02:29.460
In my case it is S.T. You can open the private key.

02:29.820 --> 02:36.930
The format of my private key is not supported by files and files of the will convert it for us into

02:36.930 --> 02:38.850
a supported format.

02:38.850 --> 02:41.310
Yes, we want to convert now.

02:41.310 --> 02:47.550
You need to provide your private key passphrase to unlock your private key.

02:57.680 --> 03:04.500
Select filename for converted Kiefel files Zeller's asking us to save the converted private key.

03:04.550 --> 03:08.270
Use the same name except add a underscore.

03:08.270 --> 03:12.650
If Z. then select save you can then click ok.

03:12.680 --> 03:18.530
Go back to your site manager, ensure your VBS is selected and click connect.

03:25.280 --> 03:31.670
It's the first time we are connecting to the server, using Vasella files is prompting us do we want

03:31.670 --> 03:33.860
to accept the server fingerprint?

03:33.890 --> 03:39.760
We do and we also want to cache the fingerprint that iStore the fingerprint locally select.

03:39.770 --> 03:40.400
Okay.

03:46.880 --> 03:53.660
You need to type in your private key passphrase to unlock your private key, and we have logged into

03:53.660 --> 03:59.920
our server using Vasella, there are our files, there is the directory backups.

03:59.930 --> 04:05.240
If I double click backups, it will open that directory and there is DB and site.

04:05.240 --> 04:12.410
If I double click DB, it will open that directory and display the contents of the DB directory.

04:13.930 --> 04:20.170
To download any one of these files, you can right click and select download if you want to change to

04:20.170 --> 04:26.170
a particular directory, you can click in the section remote site and you can type the path to the directory

04:26.170 --> 04:27.150
you would like to open.

04:27.190 --> 04:36.190
I want to open slash va slash w w w and there is the contents of slash va slash w w w in this lecture

04:36.190 --> 04:39.530
we installed and configured files into.
