Please check the resources section of this lecture.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.730
There is a PDF download available.

00:24.280 --> 00:32.440
In this lecture, we are going to create a database using Maria DBI, they are no configuration files

00:32.590 --> 00:33.570
in the section.

00:33.790 --> 00:39.640
We will not be using my admin to administer our databases.

00:40.240 --> 00:43.770
Be my admin is a tremendous security risk.

00:43.960 --> 00:50.740
It's an overkill to install my admin to only create the databases.

00:51.550 --> 00:55.060
My admin is a frequent target of attack.

00:55.270 --> 01:00.370
From the beginning of the course, we only install what's needed.

01:00.460 --> 01:05.500
Using the command line to administer databases is Hezi.

01:05.500 --> 01:09.400
The steps to create a database are as follows.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.670
You log in to Maria DB.

01:11.800 --> 01:14.870
The first step, you create the database.

01:14.920 --> 01:18.910
The second step you give that user privileges.

01:19.060 --> 01:22.740
That is certain rights on the database.

01:22.780 --> 01:27.090
All that's left is then to refresh the database.

01:27.280 --> 01:28.810
Two important points.

01:28.810 --> 01:38.410
All database commands end in a semicolon and when needed, you need to use an apostrophe for the database,

01:38.410 --> 01:40.650
name, username and password.

01:40.660 --> 01:49.030
I recommend you use randomly generated characters, at least eight characters long, preferably ten

01:49.030 --> 01:49.930
characters.

01:49.930 --> 01:55.410
You can visit random dot org to generate a list for you.

01:55.450 --> 02:00.820
You can open the site, random dot org in your browser, under lists and more.

02:01.030 --> 02:03.130
You have strings.

02:03.280 --> 02:06.070
We want to generate 200 strings.

02:06.490 --> 02:09.310
Each string should be 10 characters long.

02:09.340 --> 02:15.300
We would like numeric digits, uppercase letters and lowercase letters.

02:15.310 --> 02:18.220
You can then select get strings.

02:20.670 --> 02:27.960
I recommend you select the list that was generated for you and copy, open your text editor, create

02:27.960 --> 02:33.220
a file random strings and paste the list into that far.

02:33.270 --> 02:36.450
There are quite a few commands that we need to cover.

02:36.690 --> 02:42.300
When you create databases, the commands are relatively straightforward to use.

02:42.300 --> 02:51.650
Firstly, to log in to Maria DB sudo my Esquibel hyphen, you leave a space followed by route.

02:51.660 --> 03:01.380
We are logging in as the root user, all my skirl commands and in a semicolon to display a list of all

03:01.380 --> 03:02.490
databases.

03:02.490 --> 03:12.390
The commands show databases to create a database, create database, leave a space followed by the database

03:12.390 --> 03:15.360
name granting privileges on a database.

03:15.360 --> 03:22.500
You are giving that database user that you created certain rights on the database.

03:22.710 --> 03:24.410
This command is quite long.

03:24.660 --> 03:32.520
What's important with the grant all privileges command is that you do not leave out the apostrophes.

03:32.940 --> 03:41.580
The database username is enclosed in apostrophes, localhost apostrophes, password apostrophes.

03:41.580 --> 03:47.400
I've split the command up into three lines just for display purposes.

03:47.400 --> 03:56.490
The command must be typed on a single line, grant all privileges on the database name dot asterisks

03:56.520 --> 04:06.900
to apostrophe the database username apostrophe at apostrophe localhost apostrophe identified by password

04:06.930 --> 04:12.440
that is also enclosed in two apostrophes semi colon.

04:12.450 --> 04:16.140
Once you've created a database, you've added a user.

04:16.140 --> 04:18.060
You've given that user privileges.

04:18.060 --> 04:21.090
You need to flush the privileges.

04:21.240 --> 04:23.880
That is, refresh the database.

04:24.030 --> 04:31.680
If you would like to view a particular user's privileges, you can use the show grants for the user

04:31.680 --> 04:33.450
name at localhost.

04:33.450 --> 04:42.360
Please make note of the apostrophes to delete the database drop database followed by the database name.

04:42.360 --> 04:48.720
If you would like to delete a user drop user followed by the user name.

04:48.810 --> 04:53.520
Finally to exit Marea DB you would type exit.

04:53.670 --> 04:56.940
There is no semicolon after exit.
