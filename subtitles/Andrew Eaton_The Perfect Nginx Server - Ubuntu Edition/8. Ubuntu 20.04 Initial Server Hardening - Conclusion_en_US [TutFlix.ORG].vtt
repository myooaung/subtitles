00:19.920 --> 00:27.090
If you feel unsure about any of the steps, please ask for my advice and help using the course Q&amp;A,

00:27.360 --> 00:34.530
what I even recommend at this stage, destroy the server instance, create a new server instance and

00:34.530 --> 00:36.970
start the section of the course over again.

00:37.110 --> 00:41.310
It's good practice to repeat the steps of a very important section.

00:41.370 --> 00:44.190
This is a very important section of the course.

00:44.200 --> 00:48.510
You have taken major steps in hardening your server.

00:48.510 --> 00:54.240
Further hardening will continue as we start installing additional packages on the server.

00:54.270 --> 01:00.660
For example, we install Engine X, we they need to harden engine X that we will do as we start installing

01:00.660 --> 01:01.770
additional packages.

01:01.770 --> 01:05.730
The next part of the course involves Engine X, Maria DB and.
