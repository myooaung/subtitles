00:19.790 --> 00:26.450
In this lecture, we are going to look at how you point your domain name to your server for the duration

00:26.450 --> 00:32.480
of this course, I will be using the domain registrar name Cheap Dotcom.

00:32.750 --> 00:41.810
You are free to use the registrar of your choice name cheap offer an excellent free service called Free

00:41.810 --> 00:42.680
DNS.

00:42.950 --> 00:46.550
I must emphasize it's absolutely free.

00:46.550 --> 00:53.750
If you want to make use of the free DNS service, I must mention that you will not be transferring your

00:53.750 --> 00:55.590
domain names to name cheap.

00:55.640 --> 00:59.690
You will only be using the free DNS service.

00:59.720 --> 01:03.680
It's a straightforward procedure to use free DNS.

01:03.680 --> 01:12.200
You sign up for the free DNS service and then at your current domain registrar you change the name servers

01:12.200 --> 01:15.200
to those of the free DNS service.

01:15.230 --> 01:24.170
That is the entire procedure you need to be able to set up to DNS records and a record and a C name

01:24.170 --> 01:32.510
record with a record the host is at and the value is the IP address of your server with the C name record.

01:32.510 --> 01:38.100
The host is W w w and the value is your domain name.

01:38.120 --> 01:42.950
In my example, my domain name is WPEC Earline dot com.

01:42.950 --> 01:48.230
My record is at and the value is the IP address of my server.

01:48.230 --> 01:54.260
My C name record is w w w and the value is the domain name.

01:54.420 --> 01:58.730
Please make note of the period after the domain name.

01:58.730 --> 02:03.350
Some registrars require a period after the domain name.

02:03.530 --> 02:11.150
By creating these two records, visitors will be able to access your site using your domain name and

02:11.150 --> 02:18.110
w w w dot your domain name if you require or want to use a subdomain.

02:18.110 --> 02:25.690
For example, forum dot WPEC allai dot com or shop dot WPEC allai dot com.

02:25.700 --> 02:31.930
You need to set up additional aid records when configuring a subdomain.

02:31.970 --> 02:35.060
The record type is and a record.

02:35.060 --> 02:42.050
