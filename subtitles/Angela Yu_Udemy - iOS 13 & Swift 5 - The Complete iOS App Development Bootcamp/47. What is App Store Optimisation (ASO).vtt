Alright guys. Let's talk about App Store optimization or ASO.
1

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.340
So this is the little brother to SEO which is Search Engine Optimization
2

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.290
although that little brother is getting chubbier and chubbier by the day.
3

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.760
And that's because App Store optimization is becoming more and more important.
4

5
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.460
So similar to search engine optimization when you're trying to make your website appear on the first
5

6
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.680
page of Google, App store optimization is about how to make your app appear on the top
6

7
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.510
when a user is looking for a particular keyword. So revisiting some of those stats, when you search for
7

8
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.330
a particular keyword in the App Store the top five apps that show up account for 72% of the
8

9
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.000
downloads.
9

10
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.660
And the first app alone takes 35% of all the bacon.
10

11
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.010
So as you can imagine as we talked about apps on these earlier in the course, if you are listed below
11

12
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.590
the 25th app then there's really no chance at all for you to soak up any of those users or downloads.
12

13
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.360
So how can we get your app to appear at the top like Clumsy Ninja or Ninjump?
13

14
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.950
Well this is the science and art of App Store optimisation.
