So as we said previously when we spoke about how to figure out if your app icon is optimal or if your
1

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,430
description is optimal,
2

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:14,730
the key to any sort of successful marketing is split testing. It's actual scientific experiments that
3

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:15,660
get you results.
4

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,350
So it's the same thing with your Facebook ads.
5

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,450
Don't just make a single ad copy. Make ten, make twenty.
6

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,470
Make sure that you have different descriptions for each of the ads.
7

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:32,100
Make sure you have different images or you can have different text for the button for the action button.
8

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:38,730
So for example, the get off a button probably will convert more people than the like page button.
9

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,490
And Facebook allows you to do split testing quite easily.
10

11
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:47,070
You basically just create a whole bunch of ads and it shows you which ones are getting more clicks, which
11

12
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,960
ones are people lingering over,
12

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,820
which ones are converting more people. And that is crucial data that they're going to use in order to
13

14
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:57,600
refine the ads and also get a higher conversion rate.
14

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,200
So remember when we spoke about using the cheaper CPM or cost per thousand people or cost per thousand
15

16
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,510
impression way of advertising?
16

17
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:12,960
Well this is where you optimize your ad so that you make those 1000 people really count and you grab
17

18
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,650
a high proportion of those people's attention.
18

19
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,210
So one of the things that we tend to do is that if we're launching an app that is in a particular niche
19

20
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:27,800
say using our coffee example, I will go and like every single other app that is within the same niche.
20

21
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:34,050
Because once you've like those pages, every single time they put on a sponsored ad you will see it. And
21

22
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:39,930
you can look at how some of these big spenders are structuring their ads. What are the app icons they're
22

23
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:40,710
using,
23

24
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,770
what are the images that they're using,
24

25
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,920
what are they writing in their description,
25

26
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:50,940
So for somebody like Clash of clans or mobile strike, you can bet that they've thrown millions and millions
26

27
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,280
plus a load of people's time into optimizing these ads.
27

28
00:01:54,390 --> 00:02:00,600
These ads have been split test to death and you can benefit from their ad budget by trying to figure
28

29
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,300
out what it is about these ads that work.
29

30
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,170
Maybe it's because of the annotations,
30

31
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:11,040
maybe it's because of the human faces. Whatever it is try and benefit from your competitors ad budget
31

32
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,740
by figuring out how they're split testing has resulted in the ways that they are advertising.
