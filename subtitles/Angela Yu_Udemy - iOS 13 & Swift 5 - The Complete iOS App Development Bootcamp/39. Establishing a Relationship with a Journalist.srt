Now the next thing I want to stress if I haven't stressed it enough already is build a relationship with
1

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,430
journalists.
2

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:14,310
If you are cold-pitching out of the blue your chances of success are way lower than if you are pitching
3

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,780
somebody who you have a relationship with.
4

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:21,810
So this could include you know following them on Twitter, getting to know what the journalist is all
5

6
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:22,170
about.
6

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:28,080
What do they care about, what they feel passionately about and responding intelligently to some of the
7

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,590
things that they tweet about so that you start to establish a relationship.
8

9
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:37,360
You're not just some joe bloggs off the street who is mass emailing every single journalist.
9

10
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:44,280
No you're Joe who always read Steve's intelligent tweets and you reply with your own intelligent conversation
10

11
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,110
and you are a somebody. So as I mentioned before, every single tech journalist worth their salt has a
11

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:49,970
Twitter handle.
12

13
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:55,390
So follow your favorite journalist or follow the people who cover topics that are related to your niche.
13

14
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,750
And there's a whole lot of really interesting content that people share exclusively on their Twitter.
14

15
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,760
Their thoughts or their updates or their progress.
15

16
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:06,680
And yeah and just have a intelligent conversation.
