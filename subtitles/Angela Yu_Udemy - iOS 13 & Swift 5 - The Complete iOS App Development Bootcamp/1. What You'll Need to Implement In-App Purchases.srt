Hello, everyone. It's Angela from the App Brewery here again.
1

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:10,580
And in this module, we're going to learn all about In-App Purchases and how to implement them
2

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:16,490
for our apps to start earning extra bucks for all of the apps that you make. Now, if you ever played any sort
3

4
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:20,300
of game on the iPhone, you should be familiar with in-app purchases as well.
4

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:28,490
A lot of apps will push them heavily onto you. And you can buy a whole wide range of in-app
5

6
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:36,120
purchases from gems, the time, the energy, the coins, and, basically, everything that you can imagine.
6

7
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,530
Now, the most important thing to notice about in-app purchases is that they are virtual.
7

8
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:45,120
So essentially, it doesn't cost you any money
8

9
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,830
when a user purchases one of these in-app purchases. It's only digital bits and bytes being moved around
9

10
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,960
on Apple's servers and it's not something that you have to provide like an actual physical T-shirt that
10

11
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,110
you're selling them or sending them an Uber car driver who'll drive them around.
11

12
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:07,640
And this is why Apple has the privilege of charging you 30% of everything you make through in-app
12

13
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,600
purchases.
13

14
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:15,230
So if you charge a pound, they'll take 30p. If you charge a dollar, they'll take 30 cents, essentially.
14

15
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,780
Now, it's really important that you remember that. In-app purchases are only for virtual products and
15

16
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:26,660
all virtual products that you sell through the App Store has to go through Apple, and therefore, you have
16

17
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,550
to pay them the 30%.
17

18
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:31,670
It's a little bit like a Mafia protection money.
18

19
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,040
But, anyways, let's move on.
19

20
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,130
So why do we need in-app purchases anyways?
20

21
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:42,970
Well, because it's a really good way of increasing conversions on your free apps.
21

22
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:46,000
So this allows you to put out your apps for free,
22

23
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:52,460
making it more tempting and easier for users to download your app, giving it a go, and seeing what the
23

24
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:59,890
features are before you start charging them for, say, premium features or to remove ads. And in-app purchases
24

25
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,080
work extremely well.
25

26
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:06,830
This is one of the reasons why if you search on the App Store and you look at the top grossing iPhone
26

27
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:11,110
apps, you can see that pretty much all of them are free to download,
27

28
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,030
but they all include in-app purchases
28

29
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,910
every single one of these, usually. And that is how they make big bucks.
29

30
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:25,460
So the best way of implementing in-app purchases, from my experience, is giving the user about 80 percent
30

31
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:33,440
of all the functionality of your app for free, and only then put up a pay wall where they have to pay
31

32
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:40,340
to get an in-app purchase to upgrade to the premium version or to remove ads, or whatever it is that
32

33
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,280
gets them that last 20% out of your app.
33

34
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:50,600
This is what has worked really well in a lot of other apps including one of my favorite which is called
34

35
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,560
Overcast.
35

36
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:58,700
It is one of the best podcast apps out there. Hands down. And the developer is a really cool guy called
36

37
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:05,620
Marco and he's an incredible developer, but he's also managed to implement this 80:20 with a paywall
37

38
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:09,160
in a middle type of strategy really well.
38

39
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,080
So check out the app and see how he implements these in-app purchases.
39

40
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:21,080
Now, before we get started adding in-app purchases to our app, there are two things that you have to have
40

41
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,250
before you can actually even run or test the code.
41

42
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:33,530
First thing is you need a full Apple developer program and you have to enroll on this program before
42

43
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:39,410
you can start adding in-app purchases to your apps in Xcode and start testing them.
43

44
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:46,340
So this means that you stop paying them $99 per year and, ideally, you are close to releasing
44

45
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,210
your app.
45

46
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:53,000
Now, the other requirement is that you have to have a physical iPhone device to test in-app purchases.
46

47
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,400
Even if you write all of the code right,
47

48
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:02,360
it just won't work on the simulator, and it doesn't tell you very explicitly that it's not working because
48

49
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,090
you're running on a simulator.
49

50
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:10,190
So just be aware you need a full Apple developer account and you need to have a physical iPhone device
50

51
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,380
to test it on.
51

52
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,700
It doesn't have to be the latest or the greatest.
52

53
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,840
It just has to be one that can run and side load your apps.
53

54
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,550
So, now let's check out what we'll build by the end of this module.
54

55
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:31,250
So this is a really simple app which will display a table view of motivational quotes for the user, and
55

56
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,630
they get 6 for free when they download the app for free.
56

57
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,580
And then there's another six or however many you want to put in there that are hidden behind the paywall
57

58
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:46,760
and they have to purchase an in-app purchas in order to view the rest of the quotes.
58

59
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:55,160
So when they tap on Buy, then they will be a pop-up and they'll have to enter their Apple ID and password.
59

60
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,070
And once they've been charged, then you give them access to the rest of the content
60

61
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,710
or whatever other content you want to give them.
61

62
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:09,800
So in the process, we're going to be looking at how you restore in-app purchases, how you make purchases,
62

63
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,730
and how you detect
63

64
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:16,730
once they've been successful or if there are any errors. And so by the end of this module, you should
64

65
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:22,580
understand how to implement in-app purchases for any future app that you decide to build and be able
65

66
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:28,520
to listen for when the purchase has gone through successfully so that you can enable the premium features
66

67
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,750
in your app and give your users access to more of your app.
67

68
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,050
All right.
68

69
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:36,020
So I hope you're as excited as I am about this tutorial.
69

70
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,160
So once you're ready,
70

71
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,320
head over to the next lesson and we'll get started.
