00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:08,310
So those are some of the most popular ways of piggybacking off a large audience if you don't have your
1

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:08,960
own.
2

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:15,210
Now this doesn't replace building an email list and this doesn't replace getting inbound traffic. But
3

4
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:20,950
it is just another thing that you can do in order to get more traction and more growth.
4

5
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:27,150
So one thing to remember though is that if your launch fails, don't worry, don't be disheartened because
5

6
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:32,400
just like SpaceX where your rockets can explode, you can launch and launch again.
6

7
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:41,340
So very often when we do our chat with a Pro Series when we talk to especially app founders, your launch
7

8
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:49,080
day is not a magical date that you set you know far in advance and then once it's done, it's done. No, your
8

9
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,230
launch day is determined by your growth.
9

10
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,930
So if over a short period of time you see an uptake, then that is a launch day and that's what you will
10

11
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:58,920
tell journalists.
11

12
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,640
So for example a friend of ours who launched the double app which is a tinder style double dating app mention
12

13
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,830
how their first launch date was when they were featured on Product Hunt.
13

14
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:17,310
It grew their user base massively and they told the press like they had just launched right?
14

15
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:23,520
Their second launch date was when they got featured on I think the Daily Mail newspaper which again
15

16
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,970
brought a load of traction and that was their second launch day. Their third launch date was when they
16

17
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,040
got featured on Dragon's Den which is the UK version of Shark Tank.
17

18
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,980
So each of these days they treat as their launch day and it's a term that doesn't really mean anything.
18

19
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,450
So don't worry if you launched
19

20
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,890
and it basically fell with a thud or exploded like a rocket.
20

21
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:54,090
Essentially, the point is to launch and launch again until you see traction and then that is your launch
21

22
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:54,680
day.
22

23
00:01:54,870 --> 00:02:00,390
Incidentally, it's very interesting to mention that Gary who's one of the founders of the double app, comparing
23

24
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:09,960
the amount of growth and user acquisition he got from launching on Product Hunt versus being on a televised
24

25
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:18,210
popular show like Dragon's Den, he actually ended up with more users more downloads more press and more
25

26
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,690
attention from the Product Hunt launch.
26

27
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:28,210
So it really matters where your audience are. If you're going to get a feature in a very serious newspaper
27

28
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:33,920
but your app or your product targets 14 year olds then it's not going to help you all that much.
28

29
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,450
So think about where your audience is before you start trying to acquire those users.
