1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:06,080
All right. So once you've created your own apps and you're ready to put them onto the App Store,
1

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:07,320
what do you do then?
2

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,470
How do you go about it?
3

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:15,430
Well, it's actually pretty easy for iOS. And with Apples, that one has always pay them some money.
4

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:21,310
So in order to be able to list your apps on the App Store for sale, you have to sign up for the Apple
5

6
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:27,760
developer program, and that is a $99 per year commitment which is not much depending on how much you
6

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,170
make of the App Store.
7

8
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:34,480
And that will give you some super powers including being able to develop more than three apps per week,
8

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,680
for example.
9

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,440
So, essentially, most of your Xcode limits that you've seen in previous tutorials with free accounts
10

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,190
disappear.
11

12
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,100
So your code signing are valid,
12

13
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:51,250
so your provisioning profiles for your apps are valid
13

14
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,200
for a year at a time.
14

15
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:59,680
So if you install a testing app onto your phone, you don't have to reinstall it from X code every week,
15

16
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,830
as you do with the free accounts.
16

17
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:09,040
So once you sign up for the Apple developer account, and I strongly urge anybody who's thinking about
17

18
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:16,210
doing this to wait until they're ready to put their first app onto the App Store, because as with all
18

19
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:23,620
App project, your estimate of how long it takes is usually a lot shorter than how long it actually takes.
19

20
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:30,670
So given that you're buying into a yearly recurring subscription, I would recommend to just wait until
20

21
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,090
you're actually ready to put it on the App Store.
21

22
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:39,370
And then once you are ready and once you sign up as an Apple developer, you get access to iTunes Connect.
22

23
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:47,020
And this is the main portal that you'll be using to upload new apps, manage previous versions of apps, update
23

24
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,790
your apps, check out the analytics in terms of how many people are using it,
24

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,350
where are most of your users based,
25

26
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,800
all of that kind of stuff.
26

27
00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:00,870
And you can look at, of course, sales and trends, look at how much money you're making per day or per week,
27

28
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:06,010
then you can look at the payments, financials, as well as define users and roles.
28

29
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:11,110
So the rest of them are pretty self-explanatory. But when you're ready to upload your app, the one that
29

30
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:18,970
you want to head into is My Apps. And then once you're here, you want to click the Add Button to add a new
30

31
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,550
app. So you select the platform that you want to target.
31

32
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:28,220
You give your app a name and your name has to be unique on the App Store.
32

33
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,590
So just search for it on the App Store first.
33

34
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,250
It avoids you having to refill this form.
34

35
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:39,670
So if you have a name like Hello, then it's probably quite likely that somebody else has named an app
35

36
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,900
called Hello.
36

37
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,600
So increasingly, you're seeing longer and longer app names.
37

38
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:50,120
Apple's guidance is that your name shouldn't be a load of keywords.
38

39
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:56,410
So I think you get something like 100 characters, but don't try to fill it all up because it gets truncated
39

40
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,350
on the App Store,
40

41
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:03,280
and it's actually frowned upon to have just a bunch of keywords, you know, like, say, if you were a weight loss
41

42
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:08,540
app, calling your app weight loss, Weight Loss, Weight Loss, Weight Loss, it's not going to endear you to anybody
42

43
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,270
essentially.
43

44
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,820
Give it something that people can actually remember and recognize.
44

45
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,110
Okay.
45

46
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,920
So the next thing is that you choose your Primary Language so that it knows how to format your listing,
46

47
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,130
and then you choose a Bundled ID.
47

48
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,820
And this is very important.
48

49
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,500
The Bundle ID is this part of your app.
49

50
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:33,700
And once you've signed your app using your developer account, that Bundle ID should show up somewhere in
50

51
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,280
this dropdown lists.
51

52
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:40,310
Now, if it doesn't, then you'll have to go to the developer portal, and add it manually,
52

53
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,990
and Apple guides you through that.
53

54
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,250
But in most cases, you'll see it show up over here.
54

55
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:51,730
Now, the next thing is the SKU, or the stock-keeping unit, and that is something that is just for your
55

56
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,690
reference only.
56

57
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:59,080
It's just a way of giving each app a unique ID amongst all your other apps, so that you can identify
57

58
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,410
it.
58

59
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,090
And finally, you can limit user access, so you can say that maybe the developer doesn't get to change
59

60
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,490
the bank account that the money gets paid into,
60

61
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,380
et cetera.
61

62
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:14,080
And finally, once you're ready and once you've satisfied all of these requirements, then you can go and
62

63
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,300
hit Create.
63

64
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:21,790
Now, once you've successfully created an app, then you get taken to this page. And here, you can change
64

65
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,990
the category in which to put your app.
65

66
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,710
You can update a Privacy Policy URL.
66

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,820
You can change the Bundle ID.
67

68
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,070
You can set the Pricing,
68

69
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:38,020
so how much you want to charge for the app, whether you want to set any sales periods, whether if there's
69

70
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,030
a volume discount, et cetera.
70

71
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,390
But the most important part is here.
71

72
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,740
This is the part where you submit most of the information for your app.
72

73
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,870
And one of the things that you need to provide are screenshots for your app.
73

74
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:59,050
So, in the App Marketing course, we go into detail about how to optimize your screenshots for maximum
74

75
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,820
downloads.
75

76
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,890
And we talk about that quite a lot over there,
76

77
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:08,660
so I'm not going to repeat that. But essentially, you just need to upload screenshots of your app whist in use
77

78
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:14,390
to specify what should get shown on the App Store listing of your app.
78

79
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,780
And then, you enter a Description.
79

80
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:21,950
So in here, you're going to want to put in some of the keywords that you want to target a couple of
80

81
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,040
times.
81

82
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:27,120
And you also have a 100 character keyword field.
82

83
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:32,630
And if you remember from the app marketing modules, we spoke about how to do keyword research, how
83

84
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:39,740
to do App Store optimization, and how to try to rank highly for your target keywords. And then you're going
84

85
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,640
to submit your Builds.
85

86
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:49,330
So the Build will show up here once you submitted it using Xcode or using Application Loader.
86

87
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,600
So in order to do that, you first have to connect a physical device.
87

88
00:05:54,770 --> 00:06:01,070
So make sure that you've got your physical device plugged in and connected and you should build your
88

89
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:04,690
app to your physical device, and make sure that it works.
89

90
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:11,720
Then, next, you want to go to Product and you want to hit Archive, and that's going to archive your project.
90

91
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:20,780
And this takes a little bit of time. But once it's done, It'll show you a pop-up. So once that's complete,
91

92
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,600
then it's going to take you to an archive of your project.
92

93
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:30,860
And at this point, you want to first hit Validate just to make sure that everything checks out and
93

94
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:37,430
Xcode is happy with you, and then you want to just go ahead and click upload to App Store, then you select
94

95
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:46,090
the development team which is, of course, your account with Apple developer license, hit Choose. And then
95

96
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:53,710
it's just asking you, "Do you want to send this project to Apple?" and you can go ahead and hit Upload.
96

97
00:06:53,710 --> 00:07:00,800
Now, once you do, it's going to start a long and arduous process of uploading your app to Apple's servers.
97

98
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:07,240
And that process can take anywhere between 10 minutes to an hour and I've had everything in between.
98

99
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:11,760
Depending on the size of your project, depending on the complexity of your project,
99

100
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,170
that process can take a while.
100

101
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:17,700
So don't be in a rush when you're at this stage, basically.
101

102
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:24,460
And once your app has been uploaded and Xcode is telling you that everything's succeeded, then if you
102

103
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:32,170
wait for about five to ten minutes after that, after you get the green tick from Xcode, then it should
103

104
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:35,390
show up over here in your list of Builds.
104

105
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:40,990
Now, that will depend on whether you selected the right Bundle ID right in the beginning,
105

106
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:47,080
so making sure that your Bundle ID, under the General Information is the same as the Bundle ID in your
106

107
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:54,740
Xcode. And all going well, you'll see a version of your app appear here and you can select it.
107

108
00:07:54,790 --> 00:08:01,030
Next, you have to upload an app icon. And this has to be, I think, 1024 by 1024 pixels.
108

109
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,150
And, again, before you make your app icon, please have a look at the App Marketing Module, so that you can figure
109

110
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:13,630
out how to optimize that icon for the most number of downloads and increase your chances of getting
110

111
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,730
more revenue.
111

112
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,060
Now, finally, App Preview Information, this is not public at all,
112

113
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:25,390
this is basically where you put down some contact information, so that if your review does not pass, they
113

114
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:30,590
know who to contact and they can e-mail you and tell you to fix something in your app.
114

115
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:35,070
And, historically, Apple have been pretty militant with their reviews.
115

116
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:41,290
They are very serious about their Review Guidelines and you should definitely read them if you have
116

117
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:44,230
not already, and I'll link to it in the text below
117

118
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:50,800
this video. It includes things like, "The App Store is not a place for your Hello World apps."
118

119
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:55,030
And if you are a new developer and you've just built something that's terrible,
119

120
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,580
don't upload it to the App Store.
120

121
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:59,710
I'm paraphrasing here, but essentially, that was the gist.
121

122
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:05,790
But anyways, this is for your App Review Information. And this box is actually very, very useful.
122

123
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,930
Most people think that it's notes like "What are notes?", but this is actually a place where you can write something
123

124
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:17,890
that shows up for the app reviewer when they're reviewing your app. So it can be really useful to point
124

125
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:22,430
them towards certain things and reduce delays in your review process.
125

126
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:32,040
So, for example, if you implement in-app purchases in your app, you have to have a restore purchases button.
126

127
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:38,920
So if the user updates their OS or if they upgrade their phone, et cetera, that they can reclaim all of their
127

128
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,380
paid in-app purchases.
128

129
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:46,890
And sometimes some Apple reviewers really have problems finding that restore button,
129

130
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:52,810
so that could be something that you might want to write to them. Just say on the screen, you'll find the
130

131
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:55,510
button on the bottom left corner, et cetera.
131

132
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:01,090
And trust me, in the past, I've had, you know, five to ten emails just batting back and forth about a button
132

133
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,970
and where it is located.
133

134
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,330
So it can be really useful to anticipate these problems.
134

135
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:12,880
And finally, you've got a Release option, so whether you want to release it on a particular date, if you've
135

136
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,200
got a big press release coming out on a certain day, you might want to time the app release with that, et cetera.
136

137
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:22,370
So that is the gist of how you upload an app to the App Store.
137

138
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:29,520
And this process can take anywhere between one hour to ten hours.
138

139
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:35,460
And never underestimate how much work it takes to complete these fields.
139

140
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:42,460
So give yourself plenty of time, make sure that you've got your screenshots and your app icon ready,
140

141
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:48,850
and that you've got your optimized keywords and your description as well, so that you don't end up typing it on
141

142
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:54,200
the spot because that will usually result in a less than optimal outcome.
