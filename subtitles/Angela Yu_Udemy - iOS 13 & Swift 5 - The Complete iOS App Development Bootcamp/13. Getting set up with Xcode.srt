00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,280
So we're now ready to download and install Xcode 11.
1

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,980
So this is the application that we'll be using to write our code and build our iOS apps.
2

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:15,060
It's developed by Apple and it's free to download so you don't have to worry about paying for it or
3

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,770
paying for upgrades or any of that.
4

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,420
But before we start, there's a couple of things that you need to check to ensure that your download and
5

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,400
installation go smoothly.
6

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,560
First thing is to make sure that you have enough space on your hard drive.
7

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:34,140
So even though Xcode is only about 4.5 GB you need about 10 GB for the download and installation.
8

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,850
So first check to make sure that you have enough space and to do that.
9

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:38,940
It's pretty simple.
10

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,500
Just head over to the Apple icon at the top of your menu bar and go to About This Mac.
11

12
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,530
And when you're here you can click on the Storage tab to see how much free space you have to play with
12

13
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,500
and just make sure that that it's over 10 GB.
13

14
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:59,310
So the next thing that you need to check is to make sure that your macOS - your operating system - is updated
14

15
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,750
to the latest version.
15

16
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,520
So to make sure that you've got the right operating system. It's as simple as going to the Apple icon
16

17
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,930
and going to again About This Mac and you can see here which version you've got.
17

18
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:17,040
And ideally, you should be on macOS Catalina version 10.15 or above.
18

19
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,040
And depending on the age of your laptop you might be limited to a previous version of macOS, something
19

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,720
like High Sierra or even El Capitan.
20

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:31,590
In those cases, you won't be able to download and install the latest version of Xcode, which is
21

22
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,460
Xcode 11.
22

23
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,030
And in that case, I recommend you following one of my previous courses such as the iOS 11 or the iOS 12
23

24
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,720
course.
24

25
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:45,420
So, once you've done those two things, the last thing that you need to make sure is that: don't download
25

26
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,250
a beta version of Xcode.
26

27
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,300
It's actually not that easy to download it by accident, because as long as you're going through this
27

28
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:56,250
video and following along with what we're doing, you're going to be downloading the official release version
28

29
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,640
of Xcode and you won't have any problems.
29

30
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:03,780
The reason why we don't like our students to be working with betas is because beta software is meant for
30

31
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:09,060
testing so it can contain bugs and it might end up giving you more headaches than it's worth.
31

32
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:14,790
So, no betas. Stick with what we're going to do and you'll have a much, much better experience developing
32

33
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:15,690
for iOS.
33

34
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:15,970
All right.
34

35
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:20,590
So let's go ahead and do it together. So, head over to the App Store.
35

36
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:26,640
You can either use Spotlight by holding down command and spacebar to bring it up using the shortcut
36

37
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:33,030
or you can head over to the spotlight icon over here or if you want to be really fancy, you can even
37

38
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,140
get Siri to do it for you.
38

39
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:40,120
"Siri, open the App Store."
39

40
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:40,750
There we go.
40

41
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:47,890
So head over to the search bar here and just type in Xcode and then hit enter. And you can see it come
41

42
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,210
up over here.
42

43
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:54,600
And if you just click on this button here, you'll be able to install it onto your system.
43

44
00:02:54,610 --> 00:03:01,350
Now, this can take a little while. And sometimes you'll see it just hanging and it refuses to do anything.
44

45
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:06,170
So have a look and see if some of those things I mentioned earlier might be the problem.
45

46
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:13,690
So, downloading Xcode can take anywhere between 30 minutes to 2 hours depending on your network connection.
46

47
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:19,090
You have to make sure that you have a good strong stable network connection so that it doesn't fail
47

48
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,200
in the middle of downloading.
48

49
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:26,950
Now while you're waiting it might be worth heading over to a bonus video that I've included which is
49

50
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:33,880
a talk that I often give to companies as well as students on how to make an app from beginning to end.
50

51
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:39,250
But once you're done with downloading Xcode, then feel free to head over to the next lesson where we're
51

52
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:44,500
going to get started by looking at Xcode and walking through all of the important parts.
