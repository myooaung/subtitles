Now the second launch site I'm going to talk about is called Beta list. And I have to say Beta list has
1

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,430
gradually declined in popularity.
2

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:15,610
They came before Product Hunt and they were doing quite well initially but then they kind of changed them
3

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:16,720
monetisation model.
4

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,980
And personally I'm not a big fan of it.
5

6
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:27,700
So the idea is that if you are in beta i.e. if you are if you have yet to launch, you can submit your
6

7
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:34,360
project or your product to Beta list and they will distribute it among that email list containing
7

8
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:39,910
a whole bunch of angels or a whole bunch of VCs important people etc. and also you get displayed on
8

9
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,360
their website and gain a bit of visibility.
9

10
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,810
Now the problem I have with Beta list is that I think since a year ago or so, they started saying that
10

11
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:56,350
you know there's so many products that come in that you know vying for space on our website. That they've
11

12
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,680
had to start charging people to skip the queue.
12

13
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,930
To be fair it's not a lot. It's something like $200. But that daily traffic is lower than Product Hunt.
13

14
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:11,290
Usually even if you get featured the number of hits is you know within the thousands rather than the
14

15
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,340
tens of thousands.
15

16
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:18,760
So for an unknown outcome, I just don't think that parting with your money is always the wisest thing
16

17
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,320
to do.
17

18
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:25,030
But I want to tell you about it because it is one of the big product because it is one of the big launch
18

19
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,260
sites.
19

20
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,840
But check it out and make up your mind for yourself.
