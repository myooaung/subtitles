Now another tol I want to talk to you about is pretty new
1

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:09,630
actually. It only came about because Apple has recently introduce something called Search Ads.
2

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:15,870
So if you haven't heard about this, this is where basically they now allow apps to appear as ads. So similar
3

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,940
to when you go into Google and you search for something like Weight-Loss all the top results,
4

5
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:26,870
these three which are labeled ads, have been paid for in order to appear right at the top for this keyword.
5

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,650
Now for the Apple and the Google App Store you can now do the same for your apps. So you can create
6

7
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,980
an ad for your app to show up for certain keywords
7

8
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,560
even if you don't organically rank.
8

9
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:46,290
So this can be helpful if you have a new app that has you know virtually no downloads or no notoriety
9

10
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,430
or no reviews.
10

11
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:52,220
But from a lot of testing on our side, it seems quite expensive to get those conversions.
11

12
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,880
Now the thing I want to talk to you about is not to go and create ads but instead I want to show you
12

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,150
a good tool inside the search ads platform.
13

14
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,070
If you head over to searchads.apple.com and you hit start.
14

15
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,620
Then you log in with your Apple ID, you are able to create a new search ad campaign.
15

16
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:16,170
Now if you click on that you get access to a keyword research tool and you don't have to actually pay
16

17
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,630
and you don't actually have to put on an ad or pay Apple anything in order to use this keyword tool.
17

18
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,710
So this is very similar to the Google Adwords keyword tool.
18

19
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,810
It basically allows you to get from the horse's mouth the search popularity of certain keywords.
19

20
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:36,060
So for example, if we have a coffee app and I type in the keyword coffee, then Apple will suggest to me
20

21
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,440
various keywords that have high popularity.
21

22
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:46,850
So unlike Sensor Tower where a lot of this data is inferred and estimated, this is data from Apple itself.
22

23
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:52,740
So the words that are related to coffee that ranked really highly are coffee or coffee spelt badly or
23

24
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,840
coffee cafe, Starbucks.
24

25
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,250
So people might not be looking for coffee app but maybe they're looking for the Starbucks app then in which
25

26
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,750
case they're probably coffee drinkers might be interested in your app.
26

27
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,340
So this is another cool tool for you to play around with.
