00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:07,500
So in the module where we talked about idea of validation I went into detail about how you set up a product
1

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:14,490
launch page, how you go about validating your idea by channeling traffic through Facebook or through
2

3
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:20,760
Google or through whatever means to your landing page and having a brief explainer about what your app
3

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:27,270
is about or what your product is about, and having the all important email collection box so that you can have
4

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:34,170
a list of emails on the day of launch who you can contact and tell them "Hey do you remember when you
5

6
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,140
said that you want to download this app?
6

7
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,490
Well now it's finally available.
7

8
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,320
Go ahead and download it here."
8

9
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:46,650
That's going to be so much more powerful than just spamming people on forums or you know putting out
9

10
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,340
ads at that time.
10

11
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:57,180
So one thing that you might notice here is this line where it says become founding member number 
11

12
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,670
80,512.
12

13
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:06,000
Now the backstory is that the founder who created Great little Place, and I know I've been using this
13

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,220
example a lot because it's actually a really interesting case study.
14

15
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:16,230
But the guy who found Great little Place put in this line for essentially social proof.
15

16
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:22,740
So the idea is that you land on this page, you see that wow 80000 people already signed up and put down
16

17
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,850
their email.
17

18
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:29,070
This has to be something worthy. This has to be something that's going to be really great because otherwise
18

19
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,240
why do all these people want to sign up?
19

20
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,750
And we as humans have a great deal of herd mentality.
20

21
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,240
We like to do what other people do. No matter how much we think that we are special snowflakes,
21

22
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,320
we're really not.
22

23
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:47,820
We have a bunch of heuristic rules in our brains that determine how we act and how we make decisions.
23

24
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,880
And this is one of those cognitive biases where when we see a lot of people doing something we're more
24

25
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,680
likely to do that thing.
25

26
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,580
But the relatively unknown backstory is that the founder of this app actually went onto this website
26

27
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:11,370
and manually updated that number every day to a new random sounding number that's greater than the one
27

28
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,700
that was there yesterday.
28

29
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:22,620
So ethics of this, I don't know, but it worked really really well and he had tens of thousands of emails
29

30
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:30,480
on the day of launch who he can email and get that massive download spike within the first 24 hours
30

31
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:37,290
of launch on the App Store which eventually led to him being featured on the App Store which got more
31

32
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:44,110
traction and sustained him within the top free apps category for quite a while.
32

33
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,510
So it's really really worth doing.
33

34
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,600
And the common advice that we give to people is that if you're going to build a product you should have
34

35
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,150
a landing page yesterday.
35

36
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,610
If you can't do yesterday, then today is second best.
36

37
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,530
So build one now and start collecting emails.
37

38
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:06,900
Now some of the things I've mentioned and I'm going to mention in this course is a lot about psychology
38

39
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:13,380
and psychology plays a huge role in marketing which is why I find it actually really fascinating because
39

40
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:22,410
you know we all think that we're so unique that we make decisions based on our personality etc. But
40

41
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:29,490
actually the rules that govern human behavior are very simple and there's a lot of great cognitive psychologists
41

42
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:37,290
who have gone in to explore some of these things and also a lot of marketers exploit these cognitive
42

43
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,930
biases in order to sell you things.
43

44
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,830
So one of the best places to see this is in a supermarket.
44

45
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:48,420
So why is it that when you go into the supermarket in any supermarket the first section that you're
45

46
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,470
confronted with after you enter the door is the fresh fruit section?
46

47
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,440
Why is that?
47

48
00:03:53,460 --> 00:04:01,260
Why is it that the the the brands that make the supermarket the most money are usually stacked at eye
48

49
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:01,950
level?
49

50
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:08,810
Why is it that a lot of supermarkets have a bakery even if they don't bake a lot of the goods on site?
50

51
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:14,370
It's just to put out the scent of freshly baked bread so that you start secreting hormones and you
51

52
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,630
start feeling hungry
52

53
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,260
and we all know what happens when we're hungry in a supermarket.
53

54
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:22,370
We just end up buying or at least I end up buying everything.
54

55
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:27,540
So it's really fascinating to me and to really be able to market effectively
55

56
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:33,690
you do need to know about this. And also even if just to know how you are being manipulated by the powers
56

57
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,280
that be.
57

58
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:40,560
So you have a read of some of these great terms on psychology in marketing.
58

59
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:50,130
This is a really good book by Robert Cialdini and it's on influence and a lot of great marketers have
59

60
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,370
recommended it and I certainly would.
60

61
00:04:52,370 --> 00:05:01,640
And it's just a really simple distilled book on how marketers use various cognitive biases to influence
61

62
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:06,580
you in various ways. And once you get into this kind of stuff you start noticing it everywhere.
62

63
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:12,800
And yeah, so this is something I would really recommend the other  book if you're interested in cognitive biases
63

64
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,070
or heurisitics is a book by Daniel Kahneman which is called Thinking Fast and Slow.
64

65
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,820
So Kahneman and Tversky were two really really influential psychologists.
65

66
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:27,200
And I remember studying them a great deal when I was doing my degree in neuroscience.
66

67
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:32,820
This is a really good book on thinking about decision making and how we use heuristics every day.
67

68
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,220
So the idea that you know we can't be bothered to think through every single decision
68

69
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:45,350
and instead as humans we've come up with various ways of simplifying decisions by following certain
69

70
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,930
rules.
70

71
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:49,010
And one of those rules is herd mentality,
71

72
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,700
so doing what the majority of your tribe does will usually keep us safe,
72

73
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,470
you know as a neonatal. Whether will keep us safe nowadays I don't know.
73

74
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:06,850
But the other thing that is relevant to what we're talking about in this module is the idea of consistency.
74

75
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:12,320
So when people put down that email it's them declaring I want access to this app.
75

76
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,290
And as humans we have a consistency bias.
76

77
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:19,260
We like to be consistent with what we say and what we do.
77

78
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:24,200
And this is why sometimes you can get into arguments with people that are impossible to win.
78

79
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:29,350
So people might have declared in the past that they're pro-life or pro-choice whatever it is.
79

80
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:36,380
And it's very difficult to change their view on something because their identity is so closely linked
80

81
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,080
to that decision they made previously.
81

82
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,880
Now coming back to something like this, it's a very similar psychological construct.
82

83
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:49,700
When you email your list on the day of launch, you're saying "Hey do you remember when you said that you really
83

84
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,340
wanted to download this app?
84

85
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:59,270
Well now it's available and you can actually download it." and just by the force of being consistent with
85

86
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:02,600
their past selves you will see a high conversion rate
86

87
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,260
than if you just cold-emailed them.
87

88
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,880
So in summary build a landing page as soon as you can
88

89
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:15,230
even if you just have an inkling idea of an idea for your product. Drive traffic towards that landing
89

90
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:21,860
page whether it's through posting in Facebook groups or posting in Slack channels or creating Google
90

91
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:27,770
ads or Facebook Ads, driving traffic towards it and start building that list.
91

92
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:33,890
The second thing is think about some of these cognitive biases that a lot of marketers use in order
92

93
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,910
to influence people in their behavior.
93

94
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:42,610
Even if you're not going to use any of them it's important to know what is being used on you.
94

95
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:48,890
And finally think about how you're going to make your stats stand out during those crucial periods of
95

96
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,650
your app launch on the App Store.
96

97
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,310
And the best way of going about that is using email marketing.
