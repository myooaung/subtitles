Now the third thing I want to talk about is Hacker News.
1

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.250
Now this is basically a really simple forum that's hosted by YCombinator.
2

3
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.300
And the thing that you realize about and the thing that you realize Hacker News is that it's incredibly
3

4
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.250
technical.
4

5
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.220
So the audience are people who work within tech and are not afraid of tech.
5

6
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:28.530
And what this means is that usually the things that do well on Hacker News are things that are a little bit more
6

7
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:34.500
technical than say for example Product Hunt or Beta list. But they do have the section which is called
7

8
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.860
show Hacker News. And this is showing what you've made or what you've created what you've coded up etc.
8

9
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:48.540
and the lure essentially is that if you do get to the front page of Hacker News i.e./news, if you
9

10
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.750
get up to the top over here, the top 10 even, there is a huge amount of traffic to be had.
10

11
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.080
And it is a huge audience to piggyback off.
11

12
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.030
But the problem with Hacker News is that you thought that trying to launch on Product Hunt with all of
12

13
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.950
the rules I mentioned was hard,
13

14
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.270
Hacker News is even harder.
14

15
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.750
The algorithm is incredibly-- the algorithm is incredibly geared
15

16
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.520
again it's like the sort of vote cartels.
16

17
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.850
So you have to really think very hard about how you're going to appear on there.
17

18
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.030
For example when you submit something new, you need quite a few of upvotes within the first hour to even
18

19
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.490
appear anywhere.
19

20
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.400
So basically if you don't get any of votes within the first hour you're essentially dead in the water.
20

21
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.240
But the other thing is that you can't get your upvotes from the same IP address because you can't get
21

22
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.350
everybody in your office to upvote your product.
22

23
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:44.460
So you're going to need people who are either geographically or VPNed and with different IP addresses to
23

24
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.790
upvote you. Additionally like the timing really matters.
24

25
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.880
Additionally the timing matters as well as how many comments you get matters.
25

26
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.190
So what I would say is that the algorithm is really difficult to game.
26

27
00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.170
But if you do submit something and you get a couple of friends from you know across the world to upvote
27

28
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.590
within the first hour of the submission, then you have a decent chance of getting organic traction.
28

29
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.450
And if at that point then it still doesn't pick up because nobody is interested, then
29

30
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.800
not a lot else can help you.
30

31
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.270
But if it does gain traction and managed to stick up here, then again it's a massive load to traffic
31

32
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.650
and you can pretty much just sit back and watch your downloads grow.
