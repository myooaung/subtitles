00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:00.810
All right.
1

2
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.590
So in this module we're going to talk about your app listing.
2

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.050
So this is the part where you go into the app store whether it's on your iPhone or your iPad and you
3

4
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.170
type in some keywords for the app that you're searching for. Your app listing is what appears over here.
4

5
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.760
So you get an app icon, your app name,
5

6
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.610
you'll see the ratings of the app as well as two screen shots usually side by side.
6

7
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.040
Now the first component of your listing that I want to talk about is the app icon.
7

8
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.170
Now if you've done the app design course then you'll have seen me stress over and over again just how
8

9
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.630
important design is because design is so emotional.
9

10
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.810
It really conjures up feelings in your users. And at the end of day when a user is looking through the
10

11
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.010
app store you know the selection process is very simple.
11

12
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:53.040
It's usually down to how the product looks, whether it draws you in at the first instance and what are the
12

13
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.420
ratings that it's got.
13

14
00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.000
So for example typically if you're searching for a To-Do list app, you know your mind will wander down
14

15
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.340
the list and see ugly icon, ugly icon, bad reviews, bad reviews, bad reviews. So you narrowed down a huge
15

16
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:13.350
list of maybe 10 apps to only two or three that look relatively good and has relatively decent reviews.
16

17
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.470
So essentially to make your app one of those, you have to think about design you have to think about
17

18
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.270
your app icon and your screenshots.
18

19
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.570
So how do you go about making an app icon if you're not a graphic designer yourself?
19

20
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.330
Well there's quite a few freelance designers out there and an easy way of reaching them is through a
20

21
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.080
website called fiverr.com.
21

22
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:42.210
Now the premise of fiverr.com is that you can pay anybody $5 for them to do a really simple task
22

23
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.790
or a simple job for you.
23

24
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.600
Now there's a lot of people on their who advertise their services for designing professional app icons
24

25
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.870
and you can get an app icon designed for you know $5 which is nothing. But the thing to be wary about
25

26
00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.000
when you're procuring services on Fiverr is that 1) you have to make sure that the designs that they
26

27
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.850
give you are for commercial use.
27

28
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.270
So that might incur a little bit of extra cost and most of the designers will list it as an add on. But
28

29
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.860
it just means that down the line you won't end up with a lawsuit that you infringe somebody's rights
29

30
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.590
etc. So always look out for that.
30

31
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.090
And if they don't have that listed be sure to message them and get something in writing.
31

32
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.090
The second thing to note about Fiverr is that the quality is really variable.
32

33
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.740
So there's a lot of people who pass off as designers
33

34
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:37.560
and the final job that you get might not look similar to what they've displayed on their portfolio.
34

35
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.430
But, given the fact that the cost is relatively low you should get multiple designers to do the gig for
35

36
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.900
you so at least thinking about 5 or 6.
36

37
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:55.200
Now the other thing to remember is that the images that these designers are creating for you can be,
37

38
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.330
and sometimes I've seen it, taken from other sources.
38

39
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.670
So they didn't actually design it themselves.
39

40
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.860
So when you do get a design well from one of these designers, be sure to do a reverse Google search on
40

41
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.970
that and check to make sure that they haven't basically just stolen from the Internet.
41

42
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.270
Again Fiverr's a great platform and it has its uses.
42

43
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.760
But just keep some of those caveats in mind when you are going about procuring services on there.
43

44
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.580
Now another thing that I want to talk about is a website called 99designs. And this works slightly
44

45
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.370
differently from Fiverr.
45

46
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:39.120
The premise here is that you put out a gig, so you're saying that for example I want a book cover called
46

47
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:46.230
becoming superhuman and it's about X Y and Z. And a whole bunch of designers will come and pitch for
47

48
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.110
your job by producing designs.
48

49
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.730
So the designs are already there for you to see,
49

50
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.100
you won't get the final files or the larger files but that's fine.
50

51
00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:02.700
It's just about you seeing if out of any of these that you actually like. And you only pay when you decide
51

52
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.700
that one of these is something that you would definitely want.
52

53
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:12.900
So this way it means that instead of buying 5 or 6 gigs like the way that you do on Fiverr you are
53

54
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.900
guaranteed something that you want because if there's nothing in there that you like then you don't
54

55
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.410
have to pay anybody the gig essentially.
