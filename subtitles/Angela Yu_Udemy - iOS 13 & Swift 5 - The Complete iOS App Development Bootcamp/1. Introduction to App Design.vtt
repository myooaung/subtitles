Hello everyone and welcome to Learn App Design.
1

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.890
This is Angela from the London App Brewery and I'm going to be taking you through this introductory course
2

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.250
into the art of mobile design.
3

4
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.300
So we designed this course with a set of students in mind.
4

5
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.810
Now during the time that we've been working as a development studio, we've had many clients who've come
5

6
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.200
on board wanting to develop apps and start an app company. But we've also noticed that while everybody
6

7
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.620
owns a mobile phones and have visions and ideas about app companies that they could create but a lot
7

8
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.740
of people don't have a good grasp of the fundamentals of app design.
8

9
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.660
And so we crafted a course for these app entrepreneurs, people with no fore background in design, to get an
9

10
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.290
overview of all of the important aspects of app design.
10

11
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:52.290
We've put together some of the core fundamentals of graphic design, digital design, as well as user interface
11

12
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.000
and user experience design in relation to mobile app design.
12

13
00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.880
So anybody who's met me knows I'm a big believer in the Pareto Principle which states that in life 80%
13

14
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.520
of the results or 80% of the gains come from 20% of the results. And this course
14

15
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.030
is structured to be that 20% of information that you need to know in order to achieve 80%
15

16
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.410
of the gains in terms of creating beautiful, emotional, lovable app designs.
16

17
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.130
It's not aimed at people who want to get jobs as a user interface or user experience designer.
17

18
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.270
It is intended to be a fast track way for somebody with no formal background in design to understand
18

19
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.220
the most important and the most rewarding parts of app design.
19

20
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.920
So with that goal in mind it's time to get started.
