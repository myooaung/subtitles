00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.640
Okay. So we've spoken about some of the most obvious things that spring to mind when we're thinking about
1

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.870
designing for iOS or Android.
2

3
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.340
I hope at this point you can see that there's definitely clear differences between the two environments
3

4
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:19.110
and that you should think quite carefully when you're designing for either one whether if your designs
4

5
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.890
are fitting with the particular environment.
5

6
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.290
Now if you want to read up more about designing for iOS or designing for Android, then you're in luck.
6

7
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.820
Apple produced a book called the human interface guidelines and it's quite a significant tome that's
7

8
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:43.070
available for free on iBooks and the digital link is in the text below this video.
8

9
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.930
Now on here, they go into way more detail about what you should and shouldn't not do when you're designing
9

10
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.200
for when you're designing iOS apps.
10

11
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.880
And similarly Google produces a document called material design guidelines.
11

12
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.750
Again the link's in the text below.
12

13
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:03.590
And this essentially dictates, you know, what are material colors, how should you design for Android etcetera
13

14
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.260
etcetera.
14

15
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.100
So they're both fascinating reads especially for bedtime.
15

16
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.070
But I would actually recommend you have a look at it if you are interested in diving a bit deeper into
16

17
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.900
into untangling the different design concepts.
17

18
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.750
Now very often one of the problems that students have is what do you do when your primary device is
18

19
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.620
a iphone and you're making Android apps for work vice versa.
19

20
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.970
And the problem is that because you haven't used a particular environment, you're not used to the navigation
20

21
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.100
you're not used to the layout and the presentation.
21

22
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.390
Then it can be incredibly tempting to design something that you feel like would work on your native
22

23
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.960
environment.
23

24
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:53.900
So I'm an iPhone user. So I have to try really hard to actually get into the mindset of an Android user.
24

25
00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.570
And the best way to do this is actually to get a physical device that is not something that you normally
25

26
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.110
use. So if you're an iPhone user
26

27
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:09.810
grab an Android phone and vice versa and make it your primary device for at least a month.
27

28
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.390
Now initially the process is usually frustrating if you've ever undergone these platform changes. But after
28

29
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.460
a while you'll start to experience the way that users think on a particular environment.
29

30
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.920
And I think this is probably the best piece of advice that I can give to students who are designing for
30

31
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.340
these different environments.
31

32
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:36.380
So that was a little bit about the difference in design concepts between iOS and Android. In the next module
32

33
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:43.440
we're going to do a deep dive on the process that a digital designer goes through in order to get a
33

34
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:50.590
concept or an idea from their head out onto paper and into a markup or prototype.
34

35
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.210
So there's going to be some hands on work and I'm looking forward to taking you through.
35

36
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.980
So I see you there.
