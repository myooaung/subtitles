00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:07.180
The next thing to talk about is that both platforms iOS and Android prefer native apps.
1

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.680
So as most of you know there are native apps.
2

3
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:17.190
So for example Android apps made with Java and using the Android SDK or iOS apps made an Xcode using
3

4
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.990
Swift or Objective-C.
4

5
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.900
Finally there are other hybrid or cross-platform apps made with frameworks like Appcelerator or Xamarin
5

6
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.840
or PhoneGap etc. So basically using non-native tools but the advantage is that you can create an app
6

7
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.910
that can be deployed both onto the Android and iOS App Store.
7

8
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.440
Now students ask us this question a lot.
8

9
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.490
Why should I learn to create native apps?
9

10
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.760
Why don't I just make one app that can be deployed on both App Store saving me time and money?
10

11
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.690
Well those are some of the pros of developing hybrid apps. But on the other hand the cons are that you
11

12
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.480
will usually get inferior user experience.
12

13
00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.500
If you've been on the app design course, you will hear a stress about how important it is to understand
13

14
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.890
what optimal user experience is like on your platform.
14

15
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:12.030
So for example on Android it's common to use these menu draws or hamburger menus whereas on iOS the
15

16
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.330
default should be a tab bar.
16

17
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:20.540
So there's a lot of subtleties in the user experience that makes an app feel native and it does matter.
17

18
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:28.140
Now in this case, another reason why not to develop a hybrid app or cross-platform app is that both app
18

19
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.580
stores
19

20
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.170
the Google Play and the iOS App Store, prefer featuring native apps.
20

21
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.030
So looking back at the data in the last three or four years if you look at the featured apps, the vast
21

22
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.750
majority are native apps and this might be one of the factors that will sway you away from cross-platform
22

23
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.940
options.
23

24
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.990
Now of course having said that there are some really great tools being developed currently and React
24

25
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.030
Native is one of those really exciting things and definitely worth checking out.
25

26
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.400
But from an app marketing point of view, it's far easier for you to try and pitch Apple or Google on
26

27
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.900
a native app than a cross-platform written in Javascript for example.
