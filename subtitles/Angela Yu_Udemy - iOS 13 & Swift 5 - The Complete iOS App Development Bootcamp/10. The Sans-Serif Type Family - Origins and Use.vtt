00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.460
So now we've spoken a little bit about the serifs
1

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.070
I'm going to move on to the san serifs which of course is differentiated from the serifs by not having
2

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:14.530
these tiny little feet or decorative elements along the central beams and the top bars etc.
3

4
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.380
Now san serifs are of course slightly more modern than the serifs but similar to the serifs,
4

5
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.870
they are also subdivided into four families with Grotesque being the oldest.
5

6
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.400
So this is your Franklin Gothic,
6

7
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.560
this is your news Gothic.
7

8
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.420
Then as we go into the future you've got the neo-grotesque
8

9
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.670
so this is Helvetica,
9

10
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.430
this is Arial and going even further into future
10

11
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.250
you've got the Humanist family of sun surfs and this is your Gill Sans your Tahoma your Verdana etc.
11

12
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.710
And finally you've got the Geometric fonts for example Futura.
12

13
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:53.550
Now the way that you can tell if a typeface is Geometric is by looking at the os. And the os in a Geometric
13

14
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.280
typeface should look exactly like as if you drawn it with a protractor.
14

15
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.140
It is perfectly round. Now similar to the serifs, as you move from the older Grotesque family--
15

16
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.020
as you move from the older grotesque to the new Grotesque to the Humanist, you can see this difference
16

17
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.560
in the thickest and the thinnest parts of the font starting to get more and more exaggerated.
17

18
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.690
When you look at the Grotesque it's almost equidistant at all points and when you look at the Humanist
18

19
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:27.180
typefaces you start to see this variation or modulation as we call it. Now the geometric typeface is
19

20
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.390
a bit similar to the slab serif typeface. Even though it's one of the most modern typefaces in this family,
20

21
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.400
it bucks the trend and pretty much has no modulation and is equidistant at all point.
