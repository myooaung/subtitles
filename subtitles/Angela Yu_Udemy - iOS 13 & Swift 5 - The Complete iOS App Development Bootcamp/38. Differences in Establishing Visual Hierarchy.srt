00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,970
The next thing is visual hierarchy.
1

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:09,480
So in terms of what is the most important, second most important, third most important thing on the page.
2

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,920
And on Android this is established using size.
3

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,380
So the title will always be bigger than everything else
4

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:23,700
and the subtitle will be slightly smaller and the text will be even smaller. But on iOS the visual hierarchy
5

6
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,400
is established using the weight of the typography.
6

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:34,200
So for example, the title will be something that's bold and the subtitle will be regular and the text
7

8
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:40,350
will be thin or light. And through the thickness of each of these letters essentially you're establishing
8

9
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,460
where you want the user's eye to flow from and to.
