Hey.
1

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,800
Well done for completing the last module.
2

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:11,070
Today I want to talk about something that has really helped me in my life. And it's in these moments
3

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,510
when something is needed of me
4

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:20,160
say somebody is asking me to give a talk to 2,000 people or somebody else who wants to fly me
5

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,500
somewhere to teach their entire engineering team.
6

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,720
And it's in these moments when I say to myself "Oh, I can't possibly do that.
7

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,660
That's for-- that's for somebody who's much much better than me."
8

9
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:41,420
And it's these moments when if I just ignore that inner voice and I tell myself, "You know what? I'm going
9

10
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,400
to study for it, I'm going to prep for it.
10

11
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,750
I'm going to make sure that I'm more ready than anybody else for this position for this role for this
11

12
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,010
task."
12

13
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,240
It's these moments that we learn and we become better.
13

14
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:02,280
So, always look out for these moments where you're doubting yourself and you're being asked to step up.
14

15
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:09,090
If you really do step up then I promise you are going to go so much further than if you just stayed in
15

16
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,240
the same place.
16

17
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,030
So keep going
17

18
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,950
and remember I'm here to cheer you on.
