Hello everyone and welcome to Learn App Marketing.

00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,080
This is Angela from the London App Brewery

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:12,300
and in this course I'm going to be covering all aspects of app marketing and how you can launch your
3

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,180
app into the app stores for success.
4

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,510
So this is a huge topic
5

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,770
and I could literally talk about it for days and days on end.
6

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:27,110
So you'll find that there's a large number of modules that cover various aspects of app marketing from
7

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:34,230
idea validation to the how you list your app on the app Store to apps store optimization and much much
8

9
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:34,470
more.
9

10
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:39,180
Basically everything that you need to know in order to make your app a success.
10

11
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,370
So without further ado let's get started.
11

12
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:47,190
And as always if you have any questions or anything that you want to add to the topics that we're talking
12

13
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:53,070
about to start a discussion et cetera feel free to put that at the end of the video and you can view
13

14
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,410
the comments section as a discussion forum for anything that you've come across,
14

15
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:01,410
anything that's worked or not worked for you so that everybody can benefit.
15

16
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:01,740
All right.
16

17
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,190
So let's get started.
