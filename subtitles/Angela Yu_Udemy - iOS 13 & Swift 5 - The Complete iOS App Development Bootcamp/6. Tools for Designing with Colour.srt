00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,190
So that was a bit of theory behind how different colors can be combined to look pleasing to the eye
1

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,700
and achieve certain effects.
2

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,840
But as a busy app developer or entrepreneur, you might not have the time to sit there and combine different
3

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:19,140
hex codes so tweak it ever so slightly and perform experiments with some of these color theories.
4

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,050
So what can you do to be lazy?
5

6
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:25,950
Let me show you some of my favorite tools in terms of providing color palette for my design projects.
6

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:31,890
One of my favorite websites is colorhunt.com and you'll be able to find the links to all of these
7

8
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,140
tools that I talk about in the text box below.
8

9
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,090
Now we're not sponsored by anybody that I mention here.
9

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,650
It's just tools that I really like and can be used quite easily and can be really really helpful when
10

11
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,730
you're designing apps or websites.
11

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,650
So colorhunt.com is a place where professional designers go to curate their favorite color palettes
12

13
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:58,650
and you can search them by hot or popular or random. And depending on the mood of the color palette, you
13

14
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:02,340
can find one that fits your particular project.
14

15
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,930
Now if you're even lazier than this and can't be bothered to browse through thousands of thousands of
15

16
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:13,140
color palette, there's another solution for you called flatuicolors.com and this is a 15 color
16

17
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,570
palette that was formulated to work especially well on the iOS platform.
17

18
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:25,020
So you'll see a lot of apps on the iOS app stores that use these exact shades and exact tones from this
18

19
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:25,620
website.
19

20
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,570
For example if you ever looked at the first seven minute workout app, they pretty much just use all of
20

21
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,360
these colors in their color palette.
21

22
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,390
That tends to mesh really well on the iOS App Store.
22

23
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,890
Now similarly for Android designers out there,
23

24
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,750
you've got something called materialpalette.com which is a website that allows you to pick two different
24

25
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,970
colors from all of these rather androidy looking colors and it automatically generates for you
25

26
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:55,260
a 8-color palette complete with an accent tone. So it's really helpful and really useful for making your Android
26

27
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,100
designs.
27

28
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,920
And one final tool that I'm going to talk about that I really love is a free Chrome and Firefox browser
28

29
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,040
extension called ColorZilla. And it basically just acts as a little color dropper that sits in your browser.
29

30
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:13,050
So when you come across a website that has a particularly nice color palette and you want to find out
30

31
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,140
what is the hex code of the color that they're using so that you can use it in your later project,
31

32
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:22,290
you can use ColorZilla to spy and save that hex code for later use.
32

33
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:27,540
So by using a combination of some of these tools as well as the theory behind mixing and matching different
33

34
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,880
colors and the mood of different colors, you should be up to arrive at a color palette that is suitable
34

35
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:39,890
for your app project and makes your app look appealing as well as to evoke a certain idea or emotion within your
35

36
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,570
user.
36

37
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:45,420
And the next module we're going to talk about typographic and how to combine different fonts.
