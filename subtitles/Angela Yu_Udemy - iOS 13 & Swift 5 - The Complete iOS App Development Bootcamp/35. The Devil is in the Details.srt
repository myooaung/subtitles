The next difference that we're going to talk about is title placement. On Android
1

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:09,760
the title is always left aligned, so it will extend towards the right.
2

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:16,860
But on iOS the title is always centered. So it's always small details like this that users pick up on
3

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,530
and can make them feel like this is an app that was really carefully thought out and made in such a
4

5
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:29,380
way that takes into consideration of their platform you know or it could feel like it was cobbled together.
5

6
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:38,510
And then there's also things which are only on Android which you don't actually have an equivalent on
6

7
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:39,300
iOS.
7

8
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,570
An example of this would be the drop down menu. On Android
8

9
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:48,560
what you can do is you can tap on one of these selectors and it will drop down a list of items for you
9

10
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,750
to choose from.
10

11
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:58,720
Now the equivalent in iOS is the sliding wheel. But it looks and feels and animates very very differently.
11

12
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,100
So this is something that actually doesn't exist on iOS. If you did implement it
12

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,910
it'll be quite confusing for a user that's used to iOS.
13

14
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,790
So again, a lot of food for thought.
