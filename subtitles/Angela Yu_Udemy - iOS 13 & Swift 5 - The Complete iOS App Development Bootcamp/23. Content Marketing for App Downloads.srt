Now the other type of blogging I want to talk about is essentially a form of what's called Content Marketing.
1

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:16,330
And this is where you create content that's worth sharing that's worth spreading and you're essentially
2

3
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:23,140
giving people some of your secret sauce or some of your life learnings. And you giving it away for free
3

4
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:29,860
in the hope of spreading your message. And that message might be that you're launching an app or it might
4

5
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,720
be that you're setting up a startup, whatever it may be.
5

6
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:39,490
And some good examples of this relating to apps are actually people who talk about how they did well
6

7
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:44,560
on the App Store. For example Stuart Hall with the 7 minute workout app.
7

8
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:51,850
And for example the guys behind the Fitmen cook app. They all had these posts that pretty much had very
8

9
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:58,930
clickBaity titles that looked like it was from BuzzFeed you know something like "The one weird trick
9

10
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:02,910
that got me 2 million downloads on the App Store" or something like that.
10

11
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:07,930
And the secret about them is that not only do they have a really catchy title and have mass appeal, but
11

12
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,980
actually they're very open about you know their secrets and their progress.
12

13
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:17,170
Whereas a lot of people are you know very hush hush like you know I don't want to give away my tactics.
13

14
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,170
But actually you find that even if you give away your secret, sauce even if you give away your best tactics,
14

15
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:27,320
the number of people who actually take advantage of it or use it are in the minority.
15

16
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:32,630
And if they do it still takes a lot of sweat and tears and determination to make it work.
16

17
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,190
So in which case they probably deserve the success that they'll get.
17

18
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:42,790
So think about how you can create some piece of content that's interesting to people that are within
18

19
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,980
your app's or within your product's target audience.
19

20
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:52,870
So for example if you're creating a coffee app, what you need to think about is how can I create a piece
20

21
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:56,940
of content that can appeal to coffee heads.
21

22
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:04,390
So it could be something to do with a review of the latest and greatest coffee gear or it could be something
22

23
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:10,240
about how I finally made that God shot or like-- And essentially just content that would appeal to people
23

24
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,500
that overlaps with your target audience for your app or your product.
24

25
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:20,050
So this requires quite a bit of thinking and a bit of research and very often what you see people
25

26
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:28,180
doing is putting out small taster articles like you know not like 500 words but with a very catchy title.
26

27
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:34,420
And looking at the stats of how many people read it, what percentage of the article gets read which you
27

28
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,670
can see with Medium,
28

29
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:40,730
you can see how much interest there is and then you can build a part 2 and a part 3 etc.
29

30
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:47,870
And people are far more likely to share good interesting content or information with their friends with
30

31
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:51,510
their network than just something like download this app.
31

32
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:57,460
And in all of these articles, you get a chance to plug your app and at the same time an appeal to the
32

33
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,990
right audience.
33

34
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:05,890
So how have a think about how you can implement content marketing or how you can start a blog that documents
34

35
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:12,400
the journey of your app creation and think about doing it as soon as you start having an idea and building
35

36
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,300
a product.
