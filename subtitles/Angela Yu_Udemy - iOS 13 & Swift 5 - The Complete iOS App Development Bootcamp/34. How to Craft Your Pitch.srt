Now this is a slide from the Founders Institute and this is something that served me personally really
1

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,190
well over the years
2

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:14,430
no matter what it is that I was doing because it's a very succinct way of structuring what it is that
3

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,480
you're doing so that anybody can understand.
4

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,050
Very often you get pitched by people who say "we are a data integration social analytics company helps you
5

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,640
connect with your prospective leads."
6

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,500
Now I'm not going to point out which company this is but just by having read this paragraph over and
7

8
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:34,990
over and over again giving this course, I still to this day do not know what it is exactly that they do.
8

9
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,840
So don't be like that. Instead structure at something like this.
9

10
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:45,960
So for example my company Spacex is developing reusable rockets to help space agencies reduce the costs
10

11
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,720
of rocket launches.
11

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,220
That makes sense to everybody.
12

13
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:55,680
The other thing that you have to remember about the elevator pitch is that if you've ever been to Sand
13

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,150
Hill Road in San Francisco,
14

15
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,100
so the street where basically all the biggest venture capitalist firms are, you'll notice that none of
15

16
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:08,910
the buildings are more than two stories high. So that elevator ride is maybe 30 seconds or 20 seconds
16

17
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,100
and you have to get your point across in that limited time span.
17

18
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,130
It's not Trump Tower.
18

19
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,840
You don't have time to fluff around what you're talking about.
19

20
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,170
Get to the point. And this is great
20

21
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:25,260
not just for pitching journalists, but for pitching investors or for telling people what you're doing
21

22
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,920
or pitching customers even or pitching B2B customers.
22

23
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,880
So think about how you can structure your own company or your own app in this way and start practicing
23

24
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,610
using it and you'll see some really great responses.
