00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,100
All right guys.
1

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:07,680
So you've signed up to the best iOS development course in the world and you're going to find out very
2

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,720
shortly why.
3

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,390
Over 17,000 people have rated this course ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ stars.
4

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,040
But in order to get the most out of the course there's a couple of things I want to draw your attention
5

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:17,310
to.
6

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:23,760
Firstly, the majority of the course is going to be dedicated to programming and learning iOS development, but
7

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:30,110
there are also full modules on app design and app marketing which will supplement your knowledge on
8

9
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,130
the entire process of app development.
9

10
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:38,880
So be sure to look through the curriculum to find these extra modules and you can work through it alongside
10

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,300
the coding tutorials.
11

12
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:46,080
So very often I find that students do best when they do a little bit of programming and then switch
12

13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,950
their mind to a different problem such as learning some design skills or learning some marketing skills.
13

14
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:56,610
So feel free to dip between the design marketing and coding parts of the course.
14

15
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:04,210
Now while you're learning iOS development I tend to recommend that students code on your main computer.
15

16
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:11,700
Now this is just my recommendation but I find that students benefit a huge deal if you can watch these
16

17
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:18,300
lectures on a separate device so that can be an iPad or that could be another laptop or could be even
17

18
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,710
a Windows computer.
18

19
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:26,370
It doesn't really matter but having the tutorial videos side by side with the code allows you to more
19

20
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:31,830
easily compare the code and also code along and complete the challenges in the tutorials.
20

21
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:37,560
Now while you're watching the tutorials I find that it's helpful to have a small notebook to note down
21

22
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,700
some of the things that you might want to do a bit of background research on or you might want to read
22

23
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,440
up more on something that's mentioned in the tutorials that you find fascinating or something that you
23

24
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,410
just want to understand more deeply.
24

25
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,000
So having that there is also really useful.
25

26
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,110
Now at the beginning of the course you should have already downloaded the entire syllabus.
26

27
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,530
If you haven't you can head over to the giant course resources list and right at the top the first link
27

28
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,230
will be pointed towards this PDF.
28

29
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:10,890
And in this syllabus I've documented all of the skills that were going to be acquiring as we're building
29

30
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,320
apps and as we're progressing through the course.
30

31
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:19,530
Now I find that it's really helpful when students refer to the syllabus and just check off as they go
31

32
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,090
along.
32

33
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,170
The things that they are comfortable with.
33

34
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:27,780
So for example in the second module when we learn about the Xcode Interface Builder, you can see that
34

35
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:34,230
some of the learning points include things such as how to size UI elements or how to arrange UI elements
35

36
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,370
by sending coordinates.
36

37
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,820
So I'm gonna be showing you how to do this in the tutorials.
37

38
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:44,340
And once you're certain that you've acquired these skills and understand each of the syllabus points
38

39
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,320
then you go ahead and just check it off.
39

40
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:52,560
Now some of these things might require a couple of reviews so you can market for a review at a later
40

41
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,500
date or you come back to it.
41

42
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:00,540
And that way you'll be at to keep track of the skills that you're acquiring but also which parts need
42

43
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,820
further review.
43

44
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:07,020
Now the coding tutorials were built so that it's a little bit like taking a hike up a mountain and the
44

45
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:13,370
slope is carefully designed so that each new tutorial builds on the previous one.
45

46
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:20,340
So it's really essential that you don't skip coding tutorials and instead you complete the curriculum
46

47
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,950
in the order that it was designed.
47

48
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:27,600
And this is really important because I know that when I look at a new course and I see something really
48

49
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,860
exciting like learning machine learning then I'm really tempted to just head straight there.
49

50
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:38,850
But it's really really important that you resist the temptation to do each of the tutorials in sequence
50

51
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:44,730
because of the fact that everything builds on top of the previous tutorial then it's very easy to get
51

52
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,630
stuck and get frustrated when you jump around in the curriculum.
52

53
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:54,030
Now in the course, there's also a whole bunch of coding challenges and the challenges are there to make
53

54
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:59,700
the process of learning iOS development feel a little bit less like school learning and feel a little
54

55
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,230
bit more like a video game.
55

56
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:08,430
So that means that there's plenty of small coding challenges dotted all over the course that are kind
56

57
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,380
of like, you know, the skeletons in your video games.
57

58
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,340
You're pretty confident that that you can slash them down.
58

59
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,710
You know it doesn't take too many hits before you can beat them.
59

60
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:23,100
But then there's also end level boss fights and these are kind of meant to be a little bit larger of
60

61
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,030
a challenge.
61

62
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:30,030
So you'll be building an app by yourself or you'll be completing a longer coding challenge and this
62

63
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:35,430
is so that not only can you prove to yourself that you've understood the concepts in the tutorials but
63

64
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:40,710
also just providing that little bit of extra challenge that makes everything a lot more fun and really
64

65
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:45,490
test your skills and pushes you to level up as a programmer.
65

66
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:51,030
Now for those you guys who are learning programming for the very first time then I tend to like in the
66

67
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:56,880
process of learning programming to a bit like putting a puzzle together because in the very beginning
67

68
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:02,910
I'm going to be presenting you with the corner pieces and then I'm gonna give you the side pieces and
68

69
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:06,120
then finally I'm gonna give you more of the centerpieces.
69

70
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,260
And at the beginning it's very difficult to see the bigger picture.
70

71
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,550
Right you're only seeing the outer edge.
71

72
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:19,410
But, as you add more pieces; as you increase your knowledge and your understanding of different concepts
72

73
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,990
in programming, at some point during the course, you can have an aha moment where the picture suddenly
73

74
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:30,030
becomes more and more clear and you realize the relationship between all of these different programming
74

75
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,470
concepts and how they fit together.
75

76
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,960
So the important thing is to be patient.
76

77
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:40,920
And if a concept is particularly challenging then continue for a few more modules and then coming back
77

78
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:44,270
and reviewing that same concept a little bit later on.
78

79
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:49,770
So that by the end you'll gain a complete picture of iOS development and Swift programming.
79

80
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,910
Oh and one last thing.
80

81
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:58,320
If you find that I talk too fast or too slow then if you look at the bottom of the video player there
81

82
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:05,790
are settings we can see and I probably have us or you can slow the video down so that I talk a little
82

83
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:09,150
bit slow like this.
83

84
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,460
So depending on which way you learn best.
84

85
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,880
Feel free to change the speed of the videos so that it suits you.
85

86
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:22,020
So I hope that's helpful in guiding you through the course and a little bit of a sneak peek of what's
86

87
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,020
to come.
87

88
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:27,090
But the thing I want to emphasize is that you're not doing this alone.
88

89
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:33,630
There are loads of other students on the student community who you can chat with and share your experience
89

90
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,800
help each other.
90

91
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,240
And also I'm gonna be here for you every step of the way.
91

92
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,720
So in the next lesson I want to talk about how you can get help at any point through the course.
92

93
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,820
So see you over there.
