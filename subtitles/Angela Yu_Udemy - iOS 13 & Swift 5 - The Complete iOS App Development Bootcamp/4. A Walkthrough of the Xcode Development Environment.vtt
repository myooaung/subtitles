00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:07.530
So now that we've seen how to create and set up a brand new iOS project and we've landed inside Xcode,
1

2
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.560
it's time to get an overview of this piece of software that we'll be using to do all of the work of
2

3
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:21.060
building iOS apps, including designing the app user interface, as well as programming the code for the
3

4
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.190
functionality of the app.
4

5
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:29.790
So the first thing you want to do if you haven't already is to expand your Xcode to take up as much
5

6
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.880
space as you have on your computer.
6

7
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.460
Now I don't recommend going full screen because then it's harder to get access to the menu items and
7

8
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.270
it makes it difficult
8

9
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.640
dragging and dropping files into our Xcode project as well.
9

10
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.930
So without having to go to full screen, make sure the Xcode window is as large as possible.
10

11
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.790
And then we're going to go on a guided tour of the Xcode software.
11

12
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.430
So the first place we're going to look at is the page that we land on when we first create an app which
12

13
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.100
is the General tab here.
13

14
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.100
So you can always come back to the screen if you select your Project, go to the target.
14

15
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.710
So this is your app and then go to the general section.
15

16
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:19.200
And here we have bits of data that we've already entered such as the display name and the bundle identifier
16

17
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.920
and you can change things such as the version. Now scrolling a little bit further down,
17

18
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.310
we've got information for how our app is going to be deployed.
18

19
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.030
So when it's run, where is it going to be running on?
19

20
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.380
So, for example, we can change the iOS versions that we target. And keeping in mind that this is going
20

21
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.430
to be the minimum version that we want to target.
21

22
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:52.020
So if we select iOS 13, then it means that anybody who has an iOS version that's above 13 will be
22

23
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.180
able to use our app and download it.
23

24
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.220
But if it's lower than that, then they won't be able to access it.
24

25
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:05.760
So depending on how far back you want to support, you would select a minimum target here. And then we
25

26
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:12.180
get to select whether if our app should be able to run on iPad and iPhone or just the iPhone.
26

27
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.780
Now later on we'll take a look at Project Catalyst which will allow us to run our app on Mac as well.
27

28
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.360
But for now, let's just keep everything as the default.
28

29
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.650
And then let's take a look at where we get to select the device orientation. If you want your app to
29

30
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.070
be able to displayed in all four dimensions,
30

31
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:39.270
so when you turn the phone, it should turn with you to show the app upside-down, landscape left, right,
31

32
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:46.740
then you have all these checkboxes checked. But if you want to limit it to only portrait or one particular
32

33
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:53.180
landscape orientation, which you'll see in a lot of games, then you can select the ones that you need.
33

34
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.310
But again, I'm going to leave it as the default.
34

35
00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.620
Now finally you get to choose your status bar styles, so whether if you want a white status bar or a
35

36
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.770
dark status bar, and whether if you just simply want to hide the status bar, you can set those things right
36

37
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.130
there.
37

38
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:16.950
That's pretty much all for the settings page. And some of these other tabs will explore as we build more
38

39
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:23.190
and more complex apps that might actually need us to go into some of these settings and tweak them around.
39

40
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.900
But in most cases, you'll be keeping these settings as the default,
40

41
00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.120
and we'll be doing most of our important work inside the Swift files.
41

42
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.860
So these are your code files and the storyboard files which are your design files.
42

43
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.940
So notice how they have different icons depending on which type of file they are.
43

44
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:48.210
So if you see the little Swift bird, that's a Swift programming file, and the design files have a yellow
44

45
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.400
icon like this.
45

46
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:57.990
So this is a good time to point out that. Usually, the default layout of Xcode is split into four areas.
46

47
00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:04.960
First, we've got the top status bar here which kind of reminds me at least a little bit of things like
47

48
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.160
iTunes and other music players because you have to play and stop button.
48

49
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:17.280
You have the status of your app and you have the selection for where you want to run your app.
49

50
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:24.120
Now if you hit the play button, it's going to run your app onto whatever device you selected here.
50

51
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.390
And if you press stop, then obviously it just stops running the app.
51

52
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:35.490
Now over here on the left-hand side, we've got the navigator pane. And inside each of these panes, there's
52

53
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.220
further subdirectories because there are lots of little tab bars.
53

54
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.480
Now for most of these, I'm going to mention as they come up as we have a need for them.
54

55
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:53.400
But the most important one, you'll always pretty much want selected is the project navigator here. The
55

56
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.300
one on the left most.
56

57
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.710
And this simply displays your project.
57

58
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:05.210
So if I open my project inside the Finder and I expand my project, my I Am Rich,
58

59
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:12.590
then you'll see that each of these files correspond to what we see in Xcode in our project navigator.
59

60
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:20.460
Now because it usually takes multiple files to actually create a single app, it's really handy when we
60

61
00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.300
can see all of them at a glance right here, where we need them.
61

62
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:31.290
So when we need to go into our code, we can simply click into the ViewController.swift. If we need
62

63
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:32.650
to go into our design,
63

64
00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.720
then we click on our Main.storyboard.
64

65
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.940
Now the Main.storyboard is where you'll be designing most of your app.
65

66
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:50.830
And here you get to access various components: things such as Labels, Buttons, all of the default iOS
66

67
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:56.250
components. And you can simply drag and drop them onto the screen like so.
67

68
00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:02.070
And once you have something on screen, then the right-hand pane becomes really handy.
68

69
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.760
The right-hand pane are a bunch of inspectors.
69

70
00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:11.490
So when you click on something in your design or in your code, you might be able to inspect certain things
70

71
00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:12.460
about them.
71

72
00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:19.620
Now, by default, you will usually see the Attribute Inspector selected, especially when you're designing
72

73
00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:20.590
your app.
73

74
00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.300
And this allows you to change various things about the components that you've selected.
74

75
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.550
For example, we can change the color.
75

76
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.480
We can change the alignments.
76

77
00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.130
We can change wether if there's text shadows.
77

78
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:41.100
And it's pretty much similar to any sort of other design program you might have come across like Photoshop
78

79
00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.080
or Illustrator.
79

80
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.800
Now there's a couple of other tabs here.
80

81
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.200
One that's really useful is the Size Inspector.
81

82
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:57.180
And this one simply tells you the positioning of our component that's selected.
82

83
00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:03.890
So, in this case, it's 144 pixels from the left and 228 pixels from the top.
83

84
00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.680
Next, we've got the width and height which is pretty self-explanatory.
84

85
00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:13.380
And we've got lots of other inspectors as well which we're pretty much going to leave as it is.
85

86
00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:17.920
But at the point where we need to use them, then I'll explain them in detail.
86

87
00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:24.050
So now that you see we have a label on screen, you can see that this little pane becomes quite handy.
87

88
00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.820
And this is what we call the Document Outline.
88

89
00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:32.030
So it shows an outline of all the components that are in your design file.
89

90
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:37.320
So if you've ever used any sort of design software, you'll probably understand this best if you think
90

91
00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.790
of this as where the layers exist.
91

92
00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:46.980
So if I had two labels one on top of each other, then we'll be able to see them both as separate layers
92

93
00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.370
inside our Document Outline.
93

94
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:54.000
Now if you don't know what a layer is or you've never used Photoshop or Illustrator, it doesn't matter.
94

95
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.430
This is just where your components are listed.
95

96
00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:05.040
And as you drag on different things, such as a Button and a Label or a Slider, then you see them show up.
96

97
00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:11.010
And sometimes when your design has a lot of these components, which are very close to each other, then
97

98
00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:13.880
it's actually quite hard to select the right one that you need.
98

99
00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:19.050
So it's much easier doing it inside here. But if you don't like this taking up the extra space, then you
99

100
00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:25.440
can just pop it away using this little button here. And all of these panes can be toggled.
100

101
00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:30.710
So the main toggles are for the three major panes, so the right side pane is here,
101

102
00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:33.660
the left side pane and the bottom pane.
102

103
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:41.130
Now the bottom pane is called the debug area and this is where you get messages
103

104
00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:42.870
if your app crashes.
104

105
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:46.670
So this is the area that is pretty much just for the developer.
105

106
00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:52.770
So while you're developing the app and you need to see what's going on with your app, then this is where
106

107
00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:53.920
we'll be looking to.
107

108
00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:58.160
And we'll be exploring that a lot within the course.
108

109
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:05.070
So if you want to get rid of these screens, then you can always use these toggles, but if you prefer using
109

110
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:06.150
shortcuts,
110

111
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:11.610
so, for example, to pop this bottom the screen down you can hold down the command, the shift, and press
111

112
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:19.170
the Y key on your keyboard, and you can toggle that. And if you look inside the resources for this lesson,
112

113
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:27.500
there you will find a list of shortcuts, which are commonly used with Xcode to speed up your workflow.
113

114
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:33.180
Now, a word of warning, it does take a little bit of memorization if you want to go down this route. And
114

115
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.220
everything that you can do with a keyboard shortcut,
115

116
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.220
you can always do with the mouse.
116

117
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.970
So depending on what sort of person you are, you might want to choose what kind of path where you want
117

118
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:45.680
to go down: shortcuts or clicking with mouse.
118

119
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:49.320
So now I'm going to go ahead and delete everything that I have on screen.
119

120
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:55.860
I don't need it anymore and I'm going to pop the bottom area away to give myself as much space as I
120

121
00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:56.730
can.
121

122
00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:02.210
And I'm going to go over to the ViewController.swift file to take a look at it.
122

123
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.390
Now this is where most of your code will live.
123

124
00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:10.310
So when you want to change the behavior of your app, then you're going to be writing some code right
124

125
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:11.400
here.
125

126
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.640
And notice when we head over to the code file, then the inspector tabs,
126

127
00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:22.040
they actually change. Because when you're in a code file, then you can't change, say, the color of your
127

128
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:28.820
code or the size of your code, so it doesn't make sense to have a Size Inspector or to have the color
128

129
00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:29.840
menu dropdown.
129

130
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:35.270
But it does have other things that are related to the code files, such as if you want to change the name
130

131
00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:38.450
of the code file or what type of file it is,
131

132
00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:42.260
then you might be doing it inside the inspector over here as well.
132

133
00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:48.200
So the right-hand pane is for changing certain properties of what's showing in the middle.
133

134
00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:53.520
The left-hand pane is mostly used for navigating between different files.
134

135
00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:57.660
Now the last thing I want to show you is something to do with settings.
135

136
00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:05.270
So if you head over to Xcode and go to Preferences, and you'll notice that in the General section, you
136

137
00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:13.250
can change the appearance of your Xcode version. So you can change it to the light mode, which is what
137

138
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:20.690
I currently have, or the dark mode, which you might prefer because it's easier on the eyes.
138

139
00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:26.690
Now you can also change the way that your code is being colored by going to the fonts and colours. And
139

140
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:31.460
there's a whole bunch of different themes that you can choose from. So you can click through each of
140

141
00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:36.060
these and see what you prefer and land on whichever one you like.
141

142
00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:42.110
But I'm going to be choosing the default light version. And if you're a beginner to programming, then
142

143
00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:48.260
I recommend you choose the same theme as I have because it means that all the keywords in your version
143

144
00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:53.690
of Xcode will be highlighted in the same color as mine that you'll see in the videos and it just makes
144

145
00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:58.160
it a little bit easier to keep up with what's going on in the lessons.
145

146
00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:03.470
But if you're already a programmer and you have strong preferences as to what you like to see in your
146

147
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:06.450
color scheme, then feel free to change that here.
147

148
00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:11.080
Now more important than colors are actually the font sizes.
148

149
00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:16.370
Now I know from teaching a lot of students in class, they like to have a really small font, and I don't
149

150
00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:22.820
know if it's because I'm going blind, but I find it really hard to read font sizes that are very small.
150

151
00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:29.770
So if you have a font size that's this big, then it's really going to hurt your eyes
151

152
00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:34.180
after a few hours of coding. So make life easy for yourself.
152

153
00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:39.350
Increase the font size, so that you can actually see what's going on. And the shortcut to do that is
153

154
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:45.230
holding down command and hitting the minus key on the keyboard or the plus key on the keyboard, and adjust
154

155
00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:51.990
it to a point where you're happy and you can see quite easily. For me, I'm going to keep that font a little
155

156
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:57.940
bit bigger than usual just so that you can see it easily if you're watching this on a phone or an iPad.
156

157
00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:01.050
But feel free to adjust yours as you see fit.
157

158
00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:05.040
So that's pretty much the grand tour of Xcode.
158

159
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.660
Now, if you enjoyed the tour, then feel free to leave me a review.
159

160
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:14.870
But in the coming lessons as we come across different parts of Xcode that will need to use,
160

161
00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:18.210
then I'll introduce them to you individually as well.
161

162
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.340
And don't worry if all of this is a little bit overwhelming - 
162

163
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:26.220
you can't remember which part was the Navigator pane or the Identity Inspector,
163

164
00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:31.220
I'll always be showing you exactly where you need to go and what you need to do anyways.
164

165
00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:37.950
Plus, if you head over to the resources for this lesson, you'll also find a map of Xcode, so you'll be
165

166
00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:40.300
able to see the areas highlighted,
166

167
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:47.670
say, the status area at the top, the inspectors area on the right, and the navigator pane over here. And
167

168
00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:53.220
it might just be worth getting used to some of those words that might be used quite frequently,
168

169
00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:59.970
and as well as for you to get used to the different areas of Xcode and their purpose.
169

170
00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:07.260
But now that we've toured Xcode, it's time to actually do some work and build the design and the layout
170

171
00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:07.920
of our app.
171

172
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.890
So, that's what we're going to be doing in the lesson.
172

173
00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:12.030
So, I'll see you there.
