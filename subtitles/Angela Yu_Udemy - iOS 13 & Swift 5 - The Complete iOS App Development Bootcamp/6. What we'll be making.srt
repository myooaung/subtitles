1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:00,600
All right.
1

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,890
So what are we making
2

3
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:02,730
exactly?
3

4
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:10,020
Well, in the later seasons, Season 4 of Silicon Valley, there was an app that JÃ¬an-YÃ¡ng created called
4

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,340
the Seafood app.
5

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:17,550
Now, if you are as big of a fan of Silicon Valley, as we are, then you will be completely up to date and
6

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,080
know exactly what I'm talking about,
7

8
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,660
so you can just go ahead and skip to the next lesson.
8

9
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:27,030
Now, if you're new to the show or if you don't know what I'm talking about, I'm going to show you a quick
9

10
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:36,000
clip that demonstrates what exactly the app does.
10

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,270
Okay, it's ready.
11

12
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:39,830
Please, God.
12

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,780
-What would you say if I told you there's an app on the market... 
-Well, pass that part, just demo it.
13

14
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,350
Okay. Let's start with a hotdog.
14

15
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,180
-Oh, yes.
-It works!
15

16
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,630
-Do pizza.
-Yes, do pizza.
16

17
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:06,930
-Pizza.
17

18
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,240
-Not hotdog?
18

19
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,000
-Wait. What the [REMOVED]?
-Huh?
19

20
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,030
-That's... that's it.
20

21
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,450
It only does hotdogs?
21

22
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:21,080
-No.
22

23
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,610
And a not hotdog.
23

24
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:22,910
All right.
24

25
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,660
So you've seen the Silicon Valley version.
25

26
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,780
Let's look at the version that we'll be building.
26

27
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:33,890
So this is what our app will look like. And when you tap on the camera button in the navigation bar, you'll
27

28
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:42,590
be able to take a photo of something and click, use photo, and it will show you whether if that image
28

29
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:47,390
was classified as a hotdog or as not a hotdog.
29

30
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:50,090
So let's try out some test pictures.
30

31
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:58,250
So I've got a Google image of a hotdog here, and I'm going to click Use Photo, and there we go.
31

32
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,170
It's a hotdog.
32

33
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:00,160
Correct.
33

34
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:06,160
Now, I've also got a Google image of myself and I'm going to try it out, so I could really be shooting
34

35
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,070
myself in the foot if this classifies as a hot dog,
35

36
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,780
But let's click Use Photo, and not a hotdog.
36

37
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,040
I'm so happy.
37

38
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,660
All right cool.
38

39
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,460
So you've seen what the app does.
39

40
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,310
Let's go and create it.
