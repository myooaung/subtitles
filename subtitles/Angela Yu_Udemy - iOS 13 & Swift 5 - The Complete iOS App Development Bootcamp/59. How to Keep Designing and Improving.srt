00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:07,300
So that was our introduction to digital design, app design, user interface and user experience design.

00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:12,560

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,710
Now I want to tell you about something called The L.A.B Report.

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:25,550
This is a bi-monthly digest that we curate every two weeks,

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,120
so it's not too frequent.

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:33,660
And essentially what we do is we update you on some of things are happening in the tech world, in the
8

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:42,510
app world, and we curate list of some of our favorite articles on programming, on app design, on app business

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,810
and we send it to your email inbox on a Sunday so you can browse through it leisurely and continue on

00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:53,610
your journey of learning more about design or app programming or whatever it is that you're interested

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:53,940
