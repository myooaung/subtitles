00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:07.260
Now the second method that I want to talk about is using Google to gauge how much interest there is
1

2
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.760
in your app idea or your startup idea.
2

3
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:17.760
So a really useful tool is called Google Trends and you can find the link in the text box below this
3

4
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.550
video.
4

5
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.830
And essentially what it does is that it shows you interest over time of a particular search term and
5

6
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.080
you can compare search terms with each other.
6

7
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.740
So this is the way you put in a particular niche that you're interested in targeting, be that Pokemon
7

8
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.750
go or be that travel apps or whatever it is that you are looking to build.
8

9
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:46.860
You can put in the problem that your idea addresses or the potential positive effect that your idea
9

10
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.500
or product will provide.
10

11
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.320
So basically you just put your search time in here and you could determine whether if you're looking
11

12
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.380
at worldwide data or a particular country and look at the time period.
12

13
00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:03.020
So for example the word Pokemon started really hitting the search engines around summer of 2016
13

14
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.730
when Pokemon go was due to be released.
14

15
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.290
And then you see this huge spike and then you see the interest waning here.
15

16
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.430
So you can look at things like interest over time whether it's growing whether it's waning
16

17
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.550
and to see if you are at a time point where it's optimal to launch. And the other thing is that you can
17

18
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.260
look at interest by region to see which countries you should be targeting with your particular ideas.
18

19
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.830
So it seems like most people who are searching for Pokemon is actually in the Philippines or in Chile
19

20
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.860
or in Singapore and you know that might guide your localization efforts it might mean that you might
20

21
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.850
translate your app et cetera et cetera.
21

22
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.550
The other thing that you can look at is the related topics that people search for when they're looking
22

23
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:45.290
for pokÃ©mon.
23

24
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:52.710
So people are looking around GPS, they're looking for the sun and moon which is the Pokemon game that we've released
24

25
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.130
recently.
25

26
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.170
And you can look at essentially the search terms around your search term.
26

27
00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.100
So for any given topic you can see what is it that people are interested to know about.
27

28
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.410
And then if you look at the search volumes of a particular search term you can estimate how much of an
28

29
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.940
audience or how much interest people will have around the things that you're going to build and you're
29

30
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.800
going to make.
30

31
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.770
So a slightly more refined way of doing this is using the Google Adwords tool called keyword planner.
31

32
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.970
And keyword planner gives you a little bit more information.
32

33
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.420
So this tool is intended for people who are looking to create Google ads.
33

34
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.190
That's essentially you know that top part in Google search which is an advertisement for a web site.
34

35
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.410
But it's also really useful for gauging how much competition your idea has and how much in terms of
35

36
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.840
numbers are people actually searching for these particular search terms.
36

37
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.920
Essentially all you're doing is putting in keywords.
37

38
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.610
Now they can be as long or as short as you want.
38

39
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.600
And the key words are essentially what you expect people to be putting into google search.
39

40
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.790
So essentially when you are in keyword planner you want to go for the Get search volume data and trends and
40

41
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.960
you want to put in your keywords that relate to what it is that your app or your idea does or what problems
41

42
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.310
it solves for the user.
42

43
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.280
These are words that the user would put into Google.
43

44
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:21.180
So for example say if you were going to sell hair extensions you know you could just put hair extensions
44

45
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.950
and get search volume to see in the US over the last 12 months
45

46
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.980
how many people are searching for hair extensions.
46

47
00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.650
You see the average per month you get about 100K to 1 million searches so
47

48
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.690
that's quite a lot and the competition is quite high.
48

49
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.250
That means there's other people who are targeting this keyword to advertise.
49

50
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.410
That means you've got other people who are trying to monetize something relating to this.
50

51
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:53.070
Now these numbers are only there as a guide but they can help you determine whether if you will have
51

52
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.980
a large enough audience who will want to buy whatever it is that you're making.
52

53
00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:06.970
So if we're making an app that is about tattoo ideas see how much the search volume there is for that.
53

54
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.110
Now there is about 100K to 1 million monthly searches
54

55
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:12.690
so that's again high.
55

56
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.100
There's a lot of people looking for tattoo ideas but the competition is low.
56

57
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.570
There's not a lot of people targeting it. That's good on one hand but then you have to ask yourself you
57

58
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.040
know why aren't there other people doing this?
58

59
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.000
Is it because they're not able to?
59

60
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.670
Or is it because they can't monetize it?
60

61
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.960
So these are questions that you have to answer about your particular niche or your particular idea.
61

62
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:40.500
But Google Adwords combined with Google Trends are both really really useful ways of gauging how much
62

63
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.500
interest there could be in your idea or in your product.
63

64
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.030
And one of the key things is looking at trends.
64

65
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:55.080
So this is the search data for hair extensions over something like 10 years. And you can look at the
65

66
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.360
trends for people searching.
66

67
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.170
So for example if you are out this part of the graph, you know maybe you would feel like yeah it's probably
67

68
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:06.680
a good idea to start a business that still something to do with hair extensions.
68

69
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.640
But when you're at this part of the graph does it still make sense?
69

70
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:16.450
You can essentially look at this as a predictor for how much interest there is in your niche or in your
70

71
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:23.290
product and use it as a guide to determine whether if your idea is a good one that you should pursue
71

72
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.060
or if you should think about some of your other ideas that might be better.
