Okay.
1

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:06,770
So the last thing I'm going to talk about is using social media to your advantage.
2

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:12,820
So the thing about social media is that it basically can suck up as much time as you have. Now unless
3

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:19,060
you have a dedicated social media person, then you're really going to have to focus on where are your
4

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,110
audience at.
5

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,200
So say if you have a product that's related to food, you want to be all over Instagram because it's such
6

7
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,420
a visual thing.
7

8
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,560
Instagram is so geared towards that.
8

9
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:34,790
Now if you have a news app on the other hand then Twitter is going to be your platform.
9

10
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:41,350
But basically the idea is that you only have so much time that you can dedicate to this activity of
10

11
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,500
building social media following.
11

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,730
If you try to spread yourself too thin or get all of your team to be on all of the social's, you will
12

13
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:49,840
never win.
13

14
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,520
So figure out who your users are.
14

15
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:58,900
Figure out where they are at and then go and target that one platform and do it really really well.
15

16
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:05,710
But on the other hand, make sure that you grab the handles for your app or for your product
16

17
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,330
on the big four.
17

18
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,910
So that's Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Instagram.
18

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,420
Because if you've ever tried to buy back a handle, it is so expensive and so tedious that you will kick
19

20
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,050
yourself for not thinking of getting it
20

21
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:24,190
when you first launched. And in fact there's professional squatters who basically to sign up all these random
21

22
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:29,380
words and hope that some poor company is going to need it someday and they'll sell it for a couple of
22

23
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,240
thousands.
23

24
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,280
So grab your handles and focus on one platform.
24

25
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,190
Now the other thing you want to do especially if you're making an app is to make your app do your social
25

26
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,080
media for you.
26

27
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,100
What do I mean by this?
27

28
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:47,830
So here's a story. I think about a year and a half ago, there was this article on The New York Times about
28

29
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:52,250
36 questions to accelerate intimacy between strangers.
29

30
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:58,390
And it was quite a fascinating read. It was based on the research of a sociologist who discovered that
30

31
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:03,850
if you get two strangers to ask each other really intimate questions like "If you have to save your mom
31

32
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,980
or dad who would you pick and why?"
32

33
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:14,050
So not your usual Tinder date kind of conversations. But if you got two strangers to reveal themselves
33

34
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:19,420
and expose themselves in this way and then at the end there was this like super creepy four minute stare
34

35
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,920
into each other's eyes, until it hurts.
35

36
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,090
Kind of is.
36

37
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:28,620
Then apparently it will accelerate intimacy between two parties.
37

38
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:34,090
So this article really made the rounds on all of my social media feeds. I saw it on Twitter come up again
38

39
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:34,440
again.
39

40
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,530
People were discussing it,
40

41
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,710
people were sharing it.
41

42
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,230
It was all over Facebook.
42

43
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:44,650
And clearly there was a huge amount of interest in this idea. And I ended up spending about two hours
43

44
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:50,270
creating this really really simple app that basically made it really easy to try it out.
44

45
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:56,410
So instead of having to zoom in and swipe around on a blog post, you had an app that basically split
45

46
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,730
the screen into two so that you can lay the phone down on the table
46

47
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:05,950
and both parties can see the questions the right way up and the app would indicate whose turn it was
47

48
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:11,550
to go when and then at the end of course there's the four minute timer for the creepy staring.
48

49
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:17,030
But finally once you're done, you get given a compatibility score.
49

50
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,550
Now this is where I reveal to you my secret sauce.
50

51
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:28,630
For those guys who've done the iOS and Android programming courses, then you'll know what a random function
51

52
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,560
is and this is all it is.
52

53
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:36,280
It's a random function that pulls up a random number between 0 and 100 percent.
53

54
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:42,270
The numbers are skewed to show up more between 0 and 10 percent and 90 to 100 percent.
54

55
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:49,930
And that's by design because through data, we found that if that compatibility score was very low or
55

56
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:57,760
very high, people were incensed to share and shout about it. And to facilitate that action there's a button
56

57
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,460
called share on Facebook or share on Twitter. And then when they click one of those buttons the pop up
57

58
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:09,820
the shared dialogue is pre-populated with the URL of the app and their compatibility score.
58

59
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:15,100
So you see a lot of people posting on Facebook or Twitter saying "Oh you know me and my Tinder date we
59

60
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:22,120
have 99% compatibility or me and my husband we have 0% compatibility."
60

61
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,400
For some reason people are really interested in sharing this. And I hope that this is never a contribution
61

62
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:33,340
to the breakdown of a relationship. But essentially the idea is get your app to do your social media
62

63
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,740
for you try. Try and leverage the network effect.
63

64
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:43,120
You can only reach so many people. But if all of your users reached all of their friends who then reached
64

65
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,050
their friends, then those numbers are massive.
65

66
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,510
So try and see if you can get your social media to be automated.
