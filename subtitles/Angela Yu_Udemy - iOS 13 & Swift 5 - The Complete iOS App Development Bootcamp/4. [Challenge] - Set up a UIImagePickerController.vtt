00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:01.020
All right.
1

2
00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:06.630
So we're going to create a brand-new Xcode project and it's going to be a Single View App, and it's
2

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.320
going to be called WhatFlower or whatever you want to call it.
3

4
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.900
And we're going to hit Next and I'm going to save it on my desktop.
4

5
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:15.210
All right.
5

6
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.530
So the first thing that we're going to need to do is to import our 
6

7
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.320
FlowerClassifier.mlmodel file into this brand-new Xcode project.
7

8
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.520
So we've done it before.
8

9
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.420
Why don't you pause the video and give it a go?
9

10
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:26.780
All right.
10

11
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.550
So if you don't remember, all you need to do is to locate it.
11

12
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.190
And remember, we saved it inside this folder called Flower Classification,
12

13
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.470
and here is our FlowerClassifier.mlmodel, and all that we need to do is just to click and drag
13

14
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:48.570
it into our Xcode project, making sure that copy items if needed is checked, and hit Finish. And we'll
14

15
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.930
let Xcode get on with the work of creating a class for our model.
15

16
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.840
All right. So the first thing that we need to code up is 
16

17
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.860
a UIImagePickerController.
17

18
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.080
So you've done this in past modules and I want to set it as a challenge.
18

19
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.830
So go ahead and set up a UIImagePickerController that allows your app to take a photo, and then display
19

20
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.200
it on the screen.
20

21
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.090
So this is what it should look like.
21

22
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.990
So let's look at the functionality.
22

23
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.780
We've got an image view in the background here that's clear on startup and we've got a nav bar at the
23

24
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.520
top, as well as a bar button item on the right.
24

25
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.550
And this is in the shape of a camera.
25

26
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.660
And when we tap on it, it brings up the camera and we're able to take a photo.
26

27
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.670
And then we can tap the Use Photo to set that photo that we took as the image that's inside the image
27

28
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.380
view.
28

29
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.230
So pretty simple.
29

30
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.670
And you've done this before
30

31
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.170
and see if you can code it up.
