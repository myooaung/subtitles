It's just like the story that Benjamin Franklin once told in terms of his life advice.
1

2
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.180
So he found that by normal logic, if you do a favor for somebody they should feel indebted to you and
2

3
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.070
they should be more willing to help you in the future.
3

4
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.770
But in fact in reality, it's almost the opposite.
4

5
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:25.940
So he told a story where he was trying to befriend somebody who was of a higher rank than he was.
5

6
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.210
And he went about it in a very interesting way.
6

7
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.910
He asked this man, a stranger, for his most prized possession, a book in his library.
7

8
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.820
Benjamin Franklin asked him if he could borrow that book for a week.
8

9
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.760
And you know it's kind of hard to say "No you cannot borrow my book." That's a bit mean.
9

10
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.500
So the man agreed and then so Benjamin Franklin took that book and locked it away for a week and then
10

11
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.920
gave it back as it was. He didn't need the book.
11

12
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.630
He just needed the other guy to do him a favor.
12

13
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.600
So he found that if he needed a favor from somebody, it's actually easier to ask them for a small favor
13

14
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.950
first because people feel- because people need to feel consistent because people need to feel consistent.
14

15
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.740
Your brain needs an explanation of why you gave this strange your most prized book and that must
15

16
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.240
be because you like him.
16

17
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.280
And so that means in the future bigger favors were actually easier to come by
17

18
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.380
from this man
18

19
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.420
and you can make yourself more likeable by asking for favors.
19

20
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.160
So why am I telling you about all of this in a user experience design class?
20

21
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.950
Well, the reason why a lot of people really enjoy user experience design is because it's closely tied
21

22
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.580
to human psychology.
22

23
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.650
A lot of times you're trying to persuade users to take certain actions such as stay in the app for longer
23

24
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.450
or make a purchase or play your game more often.
24

25
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.430
And there are what's known as light patterns and dark patterns. Now like patterns are things which are
25

26
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.180
kind of white hat. You know there are user experience design patterns that you can use-
26

27
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:10.770
you can use to nudge users towards a certain direction and they are usually beneficial both for the
27

28
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.530
user and for yourself.
28

29
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.810
And then there's dark patterns which is where you use design to trick people into performing certain
29

30
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.430
actions that are only beneficial to you and are bad for them.
30

31
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.710
So coming back to this SitOrSquat app.
31

32
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:34.410
If you needed the user to agree to the terms and conditions or if needed their GPS location, you have
32

33
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:41.190
to do it incrementally. Step one is getting the user to agree to something quite innocuous like the terms
33

34
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.890
and conditions.
34

35
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.520
And as you build trust and as the user gets used to using the app and then you can explain why you need
35

36
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.070
some slightly more sensitive data like turning on the GPS so that you can actually locate them and
36

37
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.710
find them the nearest bathroom.
37

38
00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.030
Because otherwise if you do it all in one go right at the beginning where the user has no relationship
38

39
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:06.450
with your app and you're asking them for their location for notification access then most people tend
39

40
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.330
to say no
40

41
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:14.070
and it cripples the app making the user experience poor and therefore users will never get to enjoy
41

42
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.570
it.
