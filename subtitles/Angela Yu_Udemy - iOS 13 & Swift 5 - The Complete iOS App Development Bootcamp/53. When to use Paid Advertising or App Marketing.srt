All right.
1

2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:04,490
So the next thing I want to talk about is paid advertising.
2

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,570
Now if you watched the module on growth hacks to get downloads, you'll realize that there are a lot of
3

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:16,400
free options that you can explore and play around with before you have to start forking out cash.
4

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:23,550
Now your-- now your motivations for going down the paid advertising route should not be for vanity i.e.
5

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:29,130
you have no users, you need users fast, pay Facebook and Google a load of money in order to buy those
6

7
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:29,900
users.
7

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:35,700
No. Instead it has to be a calculated decision where you figure out how much on average can you monetize
8

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,690
per user and what is the maximum cost of user acquisition you can stomach in order to continue bringing
9

10
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,110
in profits.
10

11
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:49,740
So once you've answer those questions, once you're at a stage where you know how much per user makes you,
11

12
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,250
then you can start exploring paid advertising.
