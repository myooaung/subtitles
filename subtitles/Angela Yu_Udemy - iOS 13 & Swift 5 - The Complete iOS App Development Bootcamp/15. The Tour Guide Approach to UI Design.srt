00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:02,960
So let's get started.
1

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:08,350
And the first thing I want to talk about is that you should imagine your app as a journey.
2

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:13,930
So every single user that downloads your app right from spotting your app in the App Store through using
3

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:14,460
it,
4

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,060
achieving goals or completing tasks within the app,
5

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,280
it should be a journey and it should be a delightful one at that.
6

7
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:29,770
And you, as the app designer, is the craftsman that designs this journey. So you don't want to throw all
7

8
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:33,630
the information on screen and hope that the user will pick it up.
8

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,740
That's the very opposite of user interface design.
9

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:43,840
Instead, you are the tour guide that takes the user on a wonderful journey through your app. And in order
10

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,440
to do this you have to be able to shift and move their attention from place to place guiding them from
11

12
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,080
A to B to C.
12

13
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:53,850
Now let me show you what I mean.
13

14
00:00:53,890 --> 00:01:00,010
Everybody who looks at this graphic will first look at the big bold title up here and then you will
14

15
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,190
look over here
15

16
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,110
and finally you will look down here.
16

17
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,090
And this is human nature.
17

18
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:12,100
Our attention is programmed in such a way that it's always drawn to the biggest the boldest the brightest
18

19
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:17,860
thing first and then it moves to the rounder things and then it moves the smaller thing and it moves to the
19

20
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,150
lighter shaded things.
20

21
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,120
So this is just how our brain works.
21

22
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:27,370
But as a designer you can use this information to curate the experience of your user.
22

23
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,160
So instead of chucking them a block of text that just looks like this,
23

24
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,220
and this is pretty much the website that you saw in 1999
24

25
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,830
a whole load of text with a lot of blue links.
25

26
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,440
Now instead a well-designed web page or app should be a visual journey.
26

27
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:49,090
The user should first be drawn to the title and then to the subtitle and then you guide them through
27

28
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,650
some large images, smaller images a little bit of body text.
28

29
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:58,180
And this one of the reasons behind the success of medium.com which is a blogging site that takes
29

30
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:04,660
away the burden of designing a good blog post from the writer and essentially gives you a really easy
30

31
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:12,250
way to format your article so that you go from title to subtitle to body in a very easy visual way.
31

32
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:18,340
And the benefits of having a well-designed website app is that you'll have higher user retention. When
32

33
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,550
confronted with a large block of text like this
33

34
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,110
how long do you think you'll last
34

35
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:28,030
reading it? This is something that's really curated on your reading journey is tailored.
35

36
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:32,830
Imagine how much more you can hold onto that user and you can tell them about things that you want to
36

37
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:37,570
tell them and show them the things that you want to show them instead of them simply being scared away
37

38
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,560
by your design.
38

39
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,590
Now this is a really cool website slash tutorial by a designer called Jeremy Thomas and the link for
39

40
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,550
it is in the text below.
40

41
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:54,100
And he basically dissects how we went from literally having no web design to something that is guided,
41

42
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,320
curated and a visual journey for users to go on.
42

43
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:02,830
And he's presented this information in a really interesting way through hyperlinks.
43

44
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:08,380
If you're interested in learning a bit more about tailoring a user journey in terms of user interface
44

45
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,160
design then I would highly recommend checking it out.
