1
00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.100
All right.
1

2
00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:07.620
So now that we've successfully added the pod to our project and our project now build successfully,
2

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.290
we can actually start making use of the CLTypingLabel module that we just added.
3

4
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.550
So how would we find out what code to write to actually make use of this pod?
4

5
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.900
Well, for that, we'll need to take a look at the documentation under the section Usage Instructions.
5

6
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.500
You can either go back to the GitHub repository's read-me page or you can go back to the page that
6

7
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.510
you saw on CocoaPods.
7

8
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.260
But either way, we have a look at the usage section to see how we can actually use this library.
8

9
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:48.020
So first, it tells us to change the class of a label from a default UILabel to a CLTypingLabel.
9

10
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.810
So let's go ahead and do that in our Interface Builder as we can see here.
10

11
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.220
So let's open up our Main.storyboard and I'm going to select the label that I want to animate which
11

12
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.020
is this one, of course.
12

13
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.050
And then when we open up the Attributes Inspector, we go over to the Identity Inspector,
13

14
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.750
you can see that by default, it has a class of UILabel. But we're gonna click on the dropdown list and
14

15
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.020
change it to a CLTypingLabel instead.
15

16
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:23.340
And we're able to see this because we've successfully incorporated the CLTypingLabel module into
16

17
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.330
our project using CocoaPods.
17

18
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.450
So now that we've done step one, let's see what step two involves.
18

19
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:38.340
Step two tells us to programmatically set a new string to its text property at runtime,
19

20
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.490
and the animations would be triggered automatically.
20

21
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.440
The English is not great here but we're getting a vague idea of what they want us to do.
21

22
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:57.410
So, essentially, they want us to set the label to a new value when the view loads up. Let's go ahead and
22

23
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:04.160
comment out all of this code that we've written and change this IBOutlet for our titleLabel which
23

24
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.190
used to have a UILabel as the date type,
24

25
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.270
but now it's actually a CLTypingLabel.
25

26
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.470
And when you put this in, you'll see that it doesn't actually recognize what a CLTypingLabel is.
26

27
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:24.380
So we have to remember to import the module that we installed using CocoaPods which was called
27

28
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:31.190
CLTypingLabel. And once that's done and you hit command build, you should see that it now recognizes this
28

29
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:38.690
data type. And inside of viewDidLoad, instead of all of these lines of code which you can keep if you
29

30
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.630
want just as reference to how we use the for loop in here, but in my case, I'm going to try and keep things
30

31
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.640
clean and I'm just going to delete it.
31

32
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.080
And in our viewDidLoad, in order to trigger the animation,
32

33
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:59.690
we're going to set the titleLabel.text to equal that string, which in our case was the emoji
33

34
00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:00.860
and the words "FlashChat."
34

35
00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:09.380
So, now by using this pod file, the CLTyping label which contains code that we didn't write, righ?
35

36
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:17.330
This entire file, CLTyping Label.swift comes from this CocoaPod and it sets up the animation, and it
36

37
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:24.210
basically does similar to what we got it to do, but perhaps, in a slightly better, more advanced way.
37

38
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.920
And if we go back to our WelcomeViewController, all we have to do was change the class of the label that
38

39
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.470
we want to animate, and then tell it what the text should be that should be typed into it.
39

40
00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.800
So, now let's go ahead and hit run and see what happens.
40

41
00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.590
And now once we run the app, you'll see that animation occur exactly the same as what we had before,
41

42
00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.600
but now we are able to achieve that using just one line of code.
42

43
00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:02.060
So this is a taster into the powers of using third party libraries that you can incorporate into your
43

44
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.660
project.
44

45
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:09.920
And it's up to you if you want to continue using this pod or if you want to go back to what we had before
45

46
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.180
which is the animation that we generated manually.
46

47
00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:21.890
Now, while you're running this CLTypingLabel, you might notice that you get a warning here talking
47

48
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.850
about something about pies.
48

49
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.630
Sadly, it's not anything that's edible.
49

50
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.060
So what is this all about?
50

51
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:34.700
Let's go ahead and copy this and paste that warning message into Google to see what we might get.
51

52
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:41.310
So we're not seeing the exact thing down here so let's try and make this a little bit more specific.
52

53
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:48.500
We can add some quotes around the word pie and see if we can get some results that are specifically relating
53

54
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.180
this pie thing.
54

55
00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.930
And, indeed, we do. We have one right here.
55

56
00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:01.670
So it seems like this pie relates to something called the Position-Independent Executable and it's telling
56

57
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:08.060
us that the way that we can disable it for our pods, which seems to be the problem we're getting, is to
57

58
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:16.360
go over to our pods project, build settings, and then search for position, and then change this part to
58

59
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.960
Yes.
59

60
00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:24.130
So let's try that and see if it works. So let's go over to our Pods projects, select it here, and then
60

61
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.400
let's select Pods right here as well,
61

62
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:37.600
and then we go to Build Settings and we search for "position." And where it says, "Generate
62

63
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.740
Position-Dependent code,"
63

64
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.460
we're going to change it
64

65
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.250
to Yes.
65

66
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.230
So, now let's hit run again
66

67
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.090
And you can see that this time, we no longer get that warning.
67

68
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:57.120
So that's the solution for that warning if you're getting it. And if you're getting a different warning,
68

69
00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.110
I also recommend the same system just searching Stack Overflow
69

70
00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.240
or Google for the warning message.
70

71
00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.530
There's usually somebody else who's encountered it.
71

72
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.840
All right.
72

73
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:14.170
So at this point, we've seen how to create a pod file, generate an xcworkspace, add a CocoaPod, and successfully
73

74
00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:16.190
use the pod inside our project.
74

75
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.800
There's only one step that I haven't showed you yet and that's removing a pod.
75

76
00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.710
In fact, I'm going to remove the CLTypingLabel from my project.
76

77
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:31.060
That way, you'll learn how to remove a pod if you're no longer interested in using it in your project
77

78
00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.950
anymore.
78

79
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.940
Of course, you have the option to leave your code as it is and keep the pod.
79

80
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:41.440
So you don't have to follow along with me. But I'm going to remove this pod in the completed version
80

81
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.000
of this project and use the code that we wrote ourselves previously.
81

82
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.970
Well, let me restore my titleLabel to a UILabel. And if you want to keep the pod, then you don't have
82

83
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:52.910
to change your code.
83

84
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:59.620
You can just watch me as I change my file, and then remove that input statement as well.
84

85
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:06.820
And the other thing I had to change was to go into our Main.storyboard and change the identity of this
85

86
00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:10.950
back from CLTypingLabel to a UILabel.
86

87
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:16.140
So once I delete that class, you can see it defaults back to a UILabel.
87

88
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:20.410
So, now the pod, though, is still right here living in our project,
88

89
00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:26.950
so it means that when we upload our project to the App Store, it's adding maybe a couple of more characters.
89

90
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:32.170
In this case, it's not particularly bad. It's a really small file. It's really not going to make much of
90

91
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:32.980
a difference.
91

92
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:39.340
But if it's a really large module that we've added, you might want to actually remove it from your project.
92

93
00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:40.510
So how do you do that?
93

94
00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:45.500
Well, we go back to the pod file. We remove this particular pod,
94

95
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:48.280
this line of code, hit save.
95

96
00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:53.370
We close down our project and then we go back into Terminal
96

97
00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.040
and we run pod install again.
97

98
00:07:56.170 --> 00:08:01.300
But in this case, we're actually not installing. We're actually uninstalling and you can see that it has
98

99
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.960
removed our CLTypingLabel from our project.
99

100
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:13.630
Now, if we go back into our FlashChat workspace, you can see that in the pods there are actually no pods
100

101
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.820
in here anymore.
101

102
00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:18.600
We don't have any modules that are being added to our project.
102

103
00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:23.980
But don't delete the pod file because we're going to be using it to add Firebase to our project very
103

104
00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:24.300
soon.
