00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.750
Now, one of the things you often hear from people is, “Oh, programming is easy.
1

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.830
Every beginner, everybody can do it.
2

3
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:14.070
If you're an 8 year old, if you're a 60 year old, everybody can learn to code and it's super easy.”
3

4
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:23.930
And my response to that is that it's really really irresponsible for people to say this because, quite
4

5
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.560
honestly, programming is hard.
5

6
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.260
Like, don't fool yourself, and don't listen to people who say like, “Oh yeah,
6

7
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.030
so easy.”
7

8
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.440
Yeah maybe like the first part,
8

9
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.320
like, you know, when you just create like a variable and you add 2 to it.
9

10
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.170
Yeah that's easy.
10

11
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.220
But it's hard
11

12
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.260
like actually being able to master code.
12

13
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.660
It's not easy.
13

14
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.760
It's definitely not easy.
14

15
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:56.230
And, you know, you can't think like, “Oh, why is it that everybody's saying it's so easy,
15

16
00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.780
but like I'm finding it so hard?
16

17
00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.340
Does that mean I'm dumb?”
17

18
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.270
It's not true.
18

19
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.310
It's a hard thing that you're doing.
19

20
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:08.110
And just by getting this far you've really shown what you're made of.
20

21
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.420
And you've already learned so much.
21

22
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:18.570
But, you know, the other sort of side where people flip to you as well is like, “Programming’s impossible.
22

23
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.830
Like you either have to be like a genius or you're not going to get it.”
23

24
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:31.480
And that's not true either, because, you know, very often like I look at like, you know, people, students
24

25
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:39.770
who say like, “Oh, you know, like you're so great, like, I can't be like you.” But like, there is nothing,
25

26
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.160
there is nothing that anybody has on you.
26

27
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.840
Like if you go on YouTube and you look at all the developers who talk about, like, a day in the life of
27

28
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.280
the developer, or, you know, I am a developer.
28

29
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.980
Like, if you look at those people, or me, like there is no difference between these developers and these
29

30
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.100
people who have learned it and you. Like nobody is better than anybody.
30

31
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.250
It's just the amount of work that somebody has put in.
31

32
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.860
If you put in more work you end up with more results.
32

33
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:10.850
That's all it is.
33

34
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:17.870
So what I want to say is that, don't be fooled by these two things people say: programming is easy or
34

35
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:25.370
programming is really hard and impossible. They’re both not true. Programming is hard, but it's doable, and
35

36
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.690
it's doable by you as long as you keep going like you have been.
36

37
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.010
Then you're going to get there.
37

38
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.990
And I believe in you.
38

39
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.960
So keep going and we're going to do great.
