Now the next question is, what exactly makes a good app icon?
1

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,500
What should you tell your designer to create?
2

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,240
The first thing that's most important is that never have text in your app icon.
3

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,450
Just never do it.
4

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:19,710
The reason for that is because text scales really badly. So it might look really nice when that icon
5

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,780
is huge and on Photoshop,
6

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:26,760
but if it's displayed on an Apple Watch or if it's displayed on an iPhone 4
7

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,440
trust me
8

9
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,650
you can't see what it says.
9

10
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,330
And if you can't read it then there's no point having it there at all.
10

11
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:40,350
So try to stay away from text i.e. words as much as you can. Instead keep it clean, keep it simple, keep it
11

12
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,270
iconic.
12

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,870
So something that makes it so unique so people can recognize it just by the font, just by the color
13

14
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:46,540
scheme.
14

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,950
For example, you know any of these five Apple icons if I just took away the word that showed you which
15

16
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,930
app they're from, you'll know that the icon is Pinterest and you'll know that's Pocket if you've used
16

17
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,520
Pocket and you'll know that's Vine.
17

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,940
So just like a logo, it's simple, it's iconic and it encapsulates the brand.
18

19
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,820
So try and aim for something like that.
