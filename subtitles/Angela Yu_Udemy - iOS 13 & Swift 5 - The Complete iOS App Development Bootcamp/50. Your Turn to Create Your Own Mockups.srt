One of the most common questions that we get from students is what is the easiest way to place those
1

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:11,090
mockups into real products like iPhones or having it in somebody's hands?
2

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:16,380
Well there's a website called www.placeit.net which makes it pretty simple for you to just drag
3

4
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:21,960
and drop your app mockup into a whole bunch of images so that you can show off you know the app being
4

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,620
in use by a real person.
5

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,060
Now I think they do charge for this service.
6

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:33,600
So an alternative if you are happy using Sketch is going on to a www.sketchappsources.com and you'll be able
7

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:42,240
to find quite a few mockups where you can simply just drag and drop your mockups into the iPhone frame
8

9
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,680
or any of the other frames.
9

10
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:51,540
All right. So enough watching me doing things. It's time for you to build up your mockup for your recipe
10

11
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:51,960
app.
11

12
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,570
Now you've already created the use of flow diagram,
12

13
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,010
you already know how the navigation is going to work.
13

14
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,490
You've then gone on to create a wireframe using pencil and paper.
14

15
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:10,440
Now the next step is turning that concept into beautiful photorealistic mockups using some of the tools
15

16
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,230
and methods that we discussed in this module.
16

17
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,370
So if you have access to a Mac then use some of those methods
17

18
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,770
I showed you just now in order to create your mockup using Sketch.
18

19
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,760
Now if you don't have access to Sketch I'm going to show you something else that you can use.
19

20
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,580
So if you have a Mac then go ahead and download the trial version of Sketch 3 and have a play around
20

21
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,090
with it.
21

22
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,870
Try using some of the methods that I showed you in this module and create your beautiful mockup using
22

23
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,630
Sketch.
23

24
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:49,080
Now if you don't have a Mac or access to Sketch, then you can use Canva as we showed you in the previous
24

25
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,630
lesson.
25

26
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:55,170
Alternatively I've listed some other websites and tools that you can have a look at in the text box
26

27
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:55,730
below.
27

28
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:01,530
But either way, you'll be able to turn those wireframes into beautiful high fidelity mockups.
28

29
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,340
So go ahead.
