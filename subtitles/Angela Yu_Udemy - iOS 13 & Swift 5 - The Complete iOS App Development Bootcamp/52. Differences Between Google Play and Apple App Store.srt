00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,680
Now I've been talking about the Apple App Store and the Google Play store and there are a lot of things
1

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,840
that are common to both
2

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,010
for example keyword research or traffic versus difficulty.
3

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,430
But there are a few things that are different between the two of them
4

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,080
and this is just a table that summarizes some of those things.
5

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,390
So for example Apple app store
6

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,340
gives you more characters in the app name but Google only gives you 30 characters.
7

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,090
The other thing that's really important is your description.
8

9
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:31,080
Now in the Google Play store that is pretty much where most of your keywords will get taken out of
9

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:37,050
whereas on the Apple App Store it doesn't impact your keyword ranking so much although we are seeing
10

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,920
it becoming picked up. For the Apple App Store
11

12
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,670
as we mentioned before the majority of the keywords will come from the keywords field which is limited
12

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,570
to 100 characters whereas the Google Play store does not have a place where you can enter your keyword.
13

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,320
It has to be like a website.
14

15
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,330
They gather the information on the words that appear the most frequently in your app name and in your
15

16
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,110
description.
16

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,650
And the closer to the beginning of each of those fields the heavier the words are weighted.
17

18
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,990
Now the other thing that's really interesting is that words are counted as keywords in places that you
18

19
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,100
won't expect.
19

20
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,870
So for example when you name your in-app purchases, you'll think that "Oh you know I'm just going to come
20

21
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:18,060
up with a name that makes the most sense" but in fact those also count as keywords.
21

22
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,040
So make those names something that you want to rank for.
22

23
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:27,420
And finally through observing a lot of app performance on the Google Play and Apple app stores, you can
23

24
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:33,780
actually see that the things that people write in their reviews actually count towards your keywords.
24

25
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,690
Now obviously this is something that you can't control unless you decide to go and pay people for reviews.
25

26
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:44,340
But it's something just to be aware of and the reason why we know this is because somebody wrote on
26

27
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,090
the Pandora app, they wrote a review saying "I hate this app.
27

28
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:55,260
I prefer Spotify." And you start seeing the Pandora app appear when you search for Spotify which is really
28

29
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:55,890
interesting.
29

30
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,900
So this is just a couple of differentiation between ASO on the Apple App Store and the Google Play
30

31
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,530
store.
31

32
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:07,530
As always, study the platform that you're going to target and really understand how it works. For both
32

33
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,280
of these app stores listing your app on it is pretty straightforward.
33

34
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,230
The platform guides you through it's just filling in a whole bunch of fields but the intricacies lies
34

35
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:21,900
in knowing which fields get counted towards your keywords and how to make those keywords count towards
35

36
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,340
getting your ranking higher.
