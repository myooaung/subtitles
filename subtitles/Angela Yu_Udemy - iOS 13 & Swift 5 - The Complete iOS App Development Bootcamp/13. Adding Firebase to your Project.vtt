00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:00.970
All right.
1

2
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:08.920
So in this lesson, we're going to be setting up our project to be able to use Firebase. Firebase is a
2

3
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:18.190
all of one suite of tools that is backed by Google, and allows you to do lots of things, such as see what
3

4
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:25.900
all the crashes that are happening on your app, or store data in the Cloud, or authenticate users and
4

5
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:32.680
store their passwords and login information securely, as well as other things, such as incorporating
5

6
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.110
Google analytics or A/B split testing, load and loads of things essentially.
6

7
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:44.080
So in order to get started, you should sign into your Google account. And if you don't have one, then you
7

8
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.180
might have to set one up now.
8

9
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:53.270
Once you've signed in, you can go ahead and click on this button here to go to your console, and then
9

10
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.300
go ahead and click on this tab to add a new project.
10

11
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.480
It's going to start by asking you for your project name.
11

12
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:07.230
So I have lots of FlashChats as you can see in here, but I'm going to call this one Flash Chat iOS13.
12

13
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.980
And then go ahead and click continue.
13

14
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.350
Now, I'm actually going to switch off Google Analytics for this project just because it involves a lot
14

15
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.790
more testing and I actually don't need any of these features right now.
15

16
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.710
And then go ahead and click Create Project.
16

17
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:34.530
And once this is done, it will tell you that your new project is ready and you can go ahead and click
17

18
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.420
Continue.
18

19
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.110
So, now we're in the console for our Flash Chat iOS 13 project and we're going to go ahead and get started
19

20
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.530
by adding an iOS app which is what we have.
20

21
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.340
So click on that button and we're going to register our app.
21

22
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.280
Now, the first thing that I asked you is the iOS Bundle ID. So we should be able to find 
22

23
00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.510
the Bundle ID in the General tab for your app's primary target and  Xcode.
23

24
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.320
What does that mean?
24

25
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.220
Well, if we head back into Xcode and we select our Flash Chat project, select Flash Chat iOS13 as
25

26
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.570
the Target,
26

27
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.100
then this is our Bundle identifier right here.
27

28
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.490
So go ahead and copy it. And make sure that yours is unique, so that you're not using co.appbrewery
28

29
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.710
because, otherwise, it might have difficulties registering you,
29

30
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:27.930
so be sure to replace this with your own unique name or your website. And then copy this entire string
30

31
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.980
over into this field right here. And then you can provide an app nickname or an App Store ID which
31

32
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.480
you wouldn't have one just yet.
32

33
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.790
It's when you've launched your app that you actually get this number.
33

34
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.360
These two are both optional.
34

35
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:49.710
So we're going to skip both those and click Register. Once our app has been registered, then you can go ahead
35

36
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:56.430
and click on this large button here to download the configuration file for your project. And this will
36

37
00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:03.780
have to move into our Xcode project right here in the root directory of our Xcode project.
37

38
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.960
So you should see it down here, but you should also be to find it in your downloads. Now, a really important
38

39
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:17.130
tip right here is if you download more than one of these GoogleService-info.plist, see if I click
39

40
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:24.000
on this twice or I click on it from a different project, then what Apple actually does is it appends
40

41
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.650
at the end
41

42
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:31.620
this brackets one or brackets two depending on how many different versions you have of the same thing.
42

43
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.940
And when we add it to our project, it has to look identical to this. It has to say, 
43

44
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.350
GoogleService-Info.plist.
44

45
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.610
It has been named exactly like this because it's what Firebase is going to look for.
45

46
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.900
So make sure that you haven't got any duplicates in your downloads.
46

47
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:55.890
And if you do, then just delete all of them and then download a fresh copy of your config file, and make
47

48
00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:02.190
sure that when you look at it in the Finder, it doesn't have anything between the word info and .plist.
48

49
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.100
So, now that we've got it here, we're ready to add it to our project.
49

50
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.180
The easiest way to do this is to, first, navigate to our Xcode project. And notice how we're going to
50

51
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.840
drop it somewhere near the original Info.plist, and then let's bring up our Finder, so our downloads
51

52
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.170
folder, and then click and drag it just below the Info.plist, and make sure it says, "Copy items if
52

53
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.680
needed."
53

54
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.800
So check that and also check the Add to targets: Flash Chat, and then click Finish.
54

55
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.500
So, now that we've added our GoogleService-Info.plist, you should see it written exactly as
55

56
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.370
I have here.
56

57
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:47.080
And we're ready to move on to the next step which is to add the Firebase SDK using CocoaPods.
57

58
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.810
So this is Google's recommended way of working with Firebase.
58

59
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.550
And now that we know all about CocoaPods and we've already installed it, then we can simply add this
59

60
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.050
as a pod to our project.
60

61
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.980
Now, normally, if you've created a new Xcode project that doesn't have a pod file, then you would use
61

62
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.760
that keyword "pod init" in order to create a new pod file.
62

63
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:14.220
But in our case, because we've already got one right here in our Flash Chat project, we don't have to
63

64
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.150
do that.
64

65
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.370
All we need is to add the pod files that we need.
65

66
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:24.540
So sometimes I've noticed that this page changes, sometimes the Google team like to put the pods that
66

67
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:25.630
you might want,
67

68
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:32.790
other times, it gives you a URL. But either way, if you go ahead and head over to this link, and you
68

69
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:40.270
can see we're at this stage step four: adding the Firebase SDK. And we have to add the pods that we need.
69

70
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.450
But because Firebase has lots of different services, we don't want to add all of them.
70

71
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.760
We only want to add the ones that we're going to be using.
71

72
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:54.300
So right now, the only ones that I need are authentication and Cloud Firestore.
72

73
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.190
So I'm gonna go ahead and copy pod Firebase.Auth,
73

74
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:05.520
so command C, and then paste that in here just between this comment and the "end" keyword.
74

75
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:10.350
And I'm also going to add the pod Firebase/Firestorm.
75

76
00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.380
So it's just these two that we need.
76

77
00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:20.090
Now, I'm going to hit save, closed down my project, and then go ahead and run pod install.
77

78
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:25.800
So now back in our Terminal making sure that you're still within that parent folder Flash-Chat-iOS13,
78

79
00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:33.620
and then we're going to run pod install. Hit enter. And it should pull down all of those codebases that we
79

80
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:33.990
need.
80

81
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:41.840
So the Firebase core module is gonna be incorporated automatically, as well as the authentication and
81

82
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.730
Firestore modules.
82

83
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.190
Now, this might take some time,
83

84
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:52.320
so just give it a little moment and let it do its thing. Now, you'll know that it's done once it says,
84

85
00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:57.660
pod installation complete, and you see your prompt and the dollar sign again.
85

86
00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:04.650
So you'll notice that it's actually installed a whole bunch of modules and this is because the FirebaseAuth
86

87
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:12.600
and FirebaseFirestore modules actually have dependencies, so other code and packages that they
87

88
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.220
themselves depend on.
88

89
00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:18.550
So all of these things gets pulled down and added to your project.
89

90
00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:26.190
So, now we're ready to get started working with Firebase, so you can close down Terminal and go back to
90

91
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:34.460
the Flash Chat Console and click Next. So it tells us to connect Firebase when your app starts up.
91

92
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:39.510
We have to add the initialization code to your main AppDelegate class.
92

93
00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.280
So let's go ahead and do that in our project.
93

94
00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:47.740
And remembering again that whenever we add dependencies using CocoaPods, we need to be working with
94

95
00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:54.040
this white icon the xcworkspace, instead of the Xcode project.
95

96
00:07:54.040 --> 00:08:00.850
So let's double click on this white icon and then go ahead and open up our AppDelegate.swift which
96

97
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:08.980
is under our Flash Chat project inside the Flash Chat folder. And right here, we've got something called
97

98
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:16.810
didFinishLaunchingWithOptions. And we're going to delete this comment and add the Firebase Initialization
98

99
00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:17.570
code.
99

100
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:23.320
So first things first, we have to import the Firebase module into this file.
100

101
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.480
So let's go ahead and do that just below
101

102
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.320
Import UIKit.
102

103
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:31.430
Next, we have to add this line FirebaseApp.configure.
103

104
00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:39.080
So let's click this to copy that line of code and paste it right here above where it says "return true."
104

105
00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:46.480
Now, let's hit command B to make sure that everything's working properly and that our Firebase pods have
105

106
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:54.200
been incorporated without any errors. So this time building our project will take a little bit longer
106

107
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:59.180
than before because there's a lot more dependencies in our project now because we're building a more
107

108
00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:00.570
serious app.
108

109
00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:05.090
So just give it some time and maybe grab a cup of tea and it should be done shortly.
109

110
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:12.990
Once it's finally done building the project, you should see succeeded up here. And, hopefully, there
110

111
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:16.550
are no warnings and errors left for you.
111

112
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:21.240
So now we're done adding Firebase to our iOS app.
112

113
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:26.950
And if you want, you can get started by reading the Firebase getting started guide for iOS projects.
113

114
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:33.360
And the thing to note is that Firebase has really good documentation, which as we're getting used to
114

115
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:39.210
Apple Documentation, you'll notice a world of difference just to how much extra effort they've put in
115

116
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.400
to their documentation.
116

117
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:47.280
And once you're happy with that, in the next lesson, we're going to get started registering new users
117

118
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:50.020
to our FlashChat project.
118

119
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.880
So all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson.
