Question number 6, can I teach without teaching?
1

2
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:11.230
Now, there's something that is said of a lot of digital products and it's the word in intuitive.
2

3
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.460
It gets used so frequently even I'm to blame sometimes.
3

4
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:21.680
So when we say intuitive like we say you know the iPad is so intuitive to use, we don't actually mean
4

5
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.860
intuitive because that would suggest that we were all born with the ability to interact with a digital
5

6
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:34.940
screen. But actually all it means when we say intuitive is just that it's really easy to learn how to
6

7
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:35.860
use it.
7

8
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.620
So this takes us to this idea of can I teach without teaching?
8

9
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.780
And we're going to bring up the NBC News app again.
9

10
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.980
So these are examples from their previous versions just to show you some of the anti-pattern.
10

11
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:54.890
Now when you first download the NBC News app, they have a tutorial to teach you how to use it. And it
11

12
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.130
says you know here's a quick rundown of the new features.
12

13
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.720
You can search by tapping the search icon. When you get to the bottom of the list
13

14
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.480
more stories will be added so you'll never run out of news.
14

15
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:13.250
Whoever designed this must have really assumed that people are idiots because if they were using the
15

16
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.200
app and they're going to scroll down to look at more when they get to the bottom and suddenly new stories
16

17
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.060
appear they would have learned this.
17

18
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.140
You don't have to make everything so explicit.
18

19
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.930
Now let's look at a better example of this.
19

20
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:32.960
Flipboard is one of my favorite apps and it's really well-designed and it was really really groundbreaking
20

21
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.270
when it first came out.
21

22
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:42.060
And one of the things that it uses to it's advantage is the swipe gesture and some pretty nifty animations.
22

23
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.040
Now when you first open up Flipboard if you didn't know that the way to use it was you swipe up and
23

24
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.510
you go to the next page,
24

25
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.710
after a few seconds if the user hasn't interacted with the screen yet, you'll see the bottom half popping
25

26
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.130
and peaking showing you that "Hey there's something else on the next screen" you know. And it pops up and
26

27
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.330
then goes down.
27

28
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.270
So intuitively, there's that word again,
28

29
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.680
so without having to learn this or without having been taught anything you will try to swipe up and
29

30
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.460
there you go. You've learned how to use Flipboard.
30

31
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.820
There wasn't a tutorial,
31

32
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.070
there wasn't a whole paragraph about how you can swipe up to flip to the next page. You've learnt without
32

33
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.780
learning.
33

34
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.610
So think about how you can implement this in your own app.
34

35
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.650
Nobody wants to be talked at.
35

36
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.070
So trying to teach without teaching.
