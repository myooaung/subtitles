00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:00,970
All right.
1

2
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:03,340
So you've watched me do a lot of hard work.
2

3
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,760
It's now your turn.
3

4
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:10,030
So going back to that recipe app that you've already fleshed out, so you've already got to use a flow
4

5
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:15,910
diagram, you've created the wireframes, you've created mockups for them and now it's time to create the
5

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:16,860
prototype.
6

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:23,020
So using one of the software that we mentioned either using Keynote or using Marvel, you can start creating
7

8
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,790
some fully functional apps.
8

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,900
And the nice thing about Marvel is that you can actually put it onto your phone.
9

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:34,860
There's a Marvel app that you can download for free from both the Android and iOS app stores.
10

11
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:40,270
And then if you log into your account you'll be able to use your prototypes on your phone and you can show
11

12
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,680
other people with it as well.
12

13
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:48,310
So I'm going to share the URL of the workout prototype that I've created in the text box below in
13

14
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:55,240
a link. So feel free to go and have a look at it and see if you can be inspired as to how you're going
14

15
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,160
to create your recipe app prototype.
15

16
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:02,680
So once again if you're particularly proud of your design we would love to give it a shout out.
16

17
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,330
So just share your links in the comment box below.
17

18
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:11,380
And as always, if you have any questions or anything that's unclear, feel free to leave us a comment.
18

19
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,240
So that's pretty much all from me.
19

20
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,560
I'll see you on the next lesson.
