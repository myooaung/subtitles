00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:01.090
All right.
1

2
00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:08.130
So now that you've got all the setup out of the way, let's get started by creating our very first app.
2

3
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.810
Now this app is called I Am Rich and it comes from something really interesting that happened back in
3

4
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.930
the days when we first had access to the iOS App Store.
4

5
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.830
So there was a guy called Armin Heinrich who created this app called I Am Rich.
5

6
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.050
And the interesting thing was that it's a really simple app.
6

7
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:36.370
It was put into the art and lifestyle category, but he charged a whopping $999.99.
7

8
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:45.670
And all it does is it just displays a single red ruby on the screen, nothing
8

9
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.210
else.
9

10
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.780
It had no functionality, basically.
10

11
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:55.480
And this app that took him probably two seconds to create ended up getting bought by about eight people.
11

12
00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.540
Some of whom thought it was a joke and they just clicked buy to see what would happen.
12

13
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.300
Well, what happened was that they got charged the full amount and there's a lot of really funny reviews
13

14
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.790
for this app on the App Store.
14

15
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:17.050
So, subsequently, Apple actually removes this app because it doesn't actually have much functionality
15

16
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.320
and it somewhat goes against the rules of the App Store.
16

17
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:29.320
But the guy who created it still netted around $5,600 after Apple took a
17

18
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.330
30% cut from what he made selling those 8 apps.
18

19
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:42.790
And to this day, you can still find copycat apps on the Android and Windows App Stores for maybe a little
19

20
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:43.930
bit less.
20

21
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.730
The bargain bin price of $499, you can get yourself an I Am Rich app that
21

22
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:55.990
does nothing on Windows. But it's all really, really funny story of how, I guess, a relatively ingenious
22

23
00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.600
guy decided that he would create this app for rich people to show off how rich they are.
23

24
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:08.540
And it didn't really do anything at all other than display something on screen. But the reason why I'm
24

25
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.940
telling you this story is because it's the perfect jumping off point for us to start figuring out how
25

26
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.430
to create Xcode projects and iOS apps from scratch.
26

27
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.320
So in this module, we're going to learn how to create and set up new iOS projects.
27

28
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.140
We're going to, again, take an overview of Xcode and how it works.
28

29
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:37.900
We're going to design our app using Xcode and Apple's pre-built iOS components and also incorporate some
29

30
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.780
of our own image assets that we get either off the Internet or our own pictures and images into the
30

31
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.560
app.
31

32
00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:52.000
And finally, we're going to create a custom app icon to put onto our app and run it on a simulator and
32

33
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.380
on a device. Once you're ready, head over to the next lesson and let's get started.
