All right. Let's talk about something that a lot of people seem really interested in and that is getting
1

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,540
press for your app or for your business.
2

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:14,460
And one of the first things that people tend to ask is "Do I need a PR firm" Do I need somebody to professionally
3

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,440
try and get me press? On one hand
4

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,230
there's some great PR firms out there and they can get you a lot of exposure.
5

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,510
On the other hand, you have to ask yourself can you afford the $100 per hour rate?
6

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:29,190
In most cases and a lot of tech journalists will tell you the same thing, if you're a small company if
7

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:35,490
you're a startup, they're far more willing to write a story that came from the founders rather than from
8

9
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,080
some PR firm that they hired.
9

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,120
So unless you have a lot of cash to burn or you're growing startup with more than 20 employees, don't
10

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,170
worry about getting a PR firm just yet.
11

12
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:50,550
Just pitch as yourself as the founder and you will have equal if not better success than hiring a PR
12

13
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:50,960
firm.
