All right.
1

2
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.290
So we all know that ratings and reviews are really important.
2

3
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.120
If I haven't stressed that enough up to now then I'll stress it again.
3

4
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.970
Your ratings and reviews matter a huge deal not only to the users who see it i.e. they see that you've
4

5
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.240
got lots of five star reviews and are probably assured of the quality of the app,
5

6
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.170
but the other part is that the more ratings you get and the more reviews you get, the more visible you
6

7
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.490
are on the App Store.
7

8
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.860
So the more that you will rank for more competitive keywords for example.
8

9
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.510
But one of the things that a lot of app developers do wrong with ratings is their rating prompt.
9

10
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.430
Now if you've been on the app stores for more than a day then you would have seen a rating prompt like
10

11
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.450
one of these.
11

12
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.120
It says "Please rate my app, rate it
12

13
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:52.320
now, remind me later, or no thanks. And I want to say that this is a really really poor way of implementing
13

14
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.760
a rating prompt.
14

15
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.810
So it is a good idea to have a rating prompt.
15

16
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.470
People have shown again and again that if you don't remind your users, nobody is-
16

17
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:08.070
very few people will voluntarily go and rate your app unless they really hate it or they really really
17

18
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.770
love it.
18

19
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:15.630
And the skew is more towards the hating i.e. if they i.e. if they sort of hate your app they will go
19

20
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.160
and rant about it on the App Store.
20

21
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.190
But if they sort of like your app then that's not enough momentum to get them to take action.
21

22
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.680
So basically what I'm saying is that the user has to be infatuated with your app to rate it or they
22

23
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.410
just have to dislike it slightly.
23

24
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.420
But what you want as the app developer is you want more control over this process.
24

25
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.650
You do want to remind them and it's important remember that please don't implement one of these reminders
25

26
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.230
as soon as they download the app.
26

27
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.750
I've seen it time and time again that I download an app and the first thing I see when I open up the
27

28
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.750
app is one of these prompts. If I have not even interacted with your app then it is a) impossible for me
28

29
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.350
to rate it
29

30
00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:02.060
and b) it will probably send me to delete your app straight away because this is really poor user experience.
30

31
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.810
Now instead the way that you should be doing it is very similar to the way that Ember does it. The question
31

32
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.530
that you should be asking your users is "how do you feel about this app?" and from there you'll channel
32

33
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:20.520
them down a number of paths. If they feel really happy about your app then you should ask them to rave
33

34
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.300
about you rant about you anywhere they like. So tweet about it, Facebook about it, write a review,
34

35
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.320
contact us, do anything you like. But if they are unhappy then the only person that they should be contacting
35

36
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.120
is you, the developer.
36

37
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:39.270
Because very often when users are upset or when they really don't like an app, the reason is usually
37

38
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.220
technical.
38

39
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.570
It's usually because something crashed or something broke or something didn't work for their particular
39

40
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:45.130
phone.
40

41
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.610
And this is a conversation I believe that should take place between the user and the developer in order
41

42
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.420
to resolve what the issues are, in order to make their experience better.
42

43
00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.150
So personally I always take these emails really seriously. When I use a tells me that there's an issue
43

44
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.170
that they've encountered with their app,
44

45
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.710
I will tell them that I'm on it straight away and I will try and fix it as soon as I can.
45

46
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.480
And once I have and uploaded the updated version, I will email them to let them know
46

47
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.390
again. This is just a basic way of keeping in touch with your users.
47

48
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.930
Very often you can actually convert an angry mob into diehard fans by doing this.
48

49
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:26.070
So it's really worth giving users that ability to contact you and to resolve these situations.
49

50
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:31.260
It's only when that channel doesn't exist do people feel the need to go into the app store and rant
50

51
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.810
about how bad or terrible your app is. Now having that in a public forum, it does nobody any good.
51

52
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.420
It doesn't help you as the app developer, it doesn't motivate you but instead brings you a lot of grief
52

53
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.910
and also reduce credibility on the App Store.
53

54
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.790
So when you're implementing your ratings prompt, consider asking the user about how they feel.
54

55
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.070
And the third option is of course to target the confused users, the ones who didn't really get how the
55

56
00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:01.170
app works in which case you can take them back to the onboarding or getting started guide. Or they can
56

57
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.740
just contact you with their particular queries.
57

58
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.680
So always be available for your users and try to differentiate the happy users from the unhappy users.
