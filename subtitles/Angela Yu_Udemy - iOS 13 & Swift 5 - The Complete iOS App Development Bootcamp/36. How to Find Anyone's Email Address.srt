00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,850
Now that you know who you want to approach, the next question is how do you approach them?
1

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,170
For example, how would you find their contact details?
2

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:15,630
Well there's a website called VoilaNorbert.com and it has a really simple interface but it does
3

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:16,800
something really powerful.
4

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,110
It allows you to put in the first and last name of your potential journalist or person that you want
5

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:26,700
to contact and then put down the company that they work for, their domain.
6

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,730
So for example it would be something like MikeButche@Techcrunch.com.
7

8
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:37,500
And then once you hit Work for me Nobert, it will go through all the different variations that most
8

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,850
companies use in order structure their corporate email so that will be.
9

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:47,100
So they'll be initials or a full name or initial plus surname etc. and it pings all those email addresses
10

11
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:53,670
until it gets one with a successful response. And then it will tell you what is the email of that journalist
11

12
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,680
or that person you're trying to contact.
12

13
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,160
And usually when we tell this in class in person, there's two reactions that we get in the classroom.
13

14
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,120
One is people who are really shocked and really angry.
14

15
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,720
This is how people have been getting my email.
15

16
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,520
This is how all these strangers have managed to reach me. And the other response that you get are really
16

17
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,810
mischievous people going like "ha ha ha.
17

18
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,680
Now I know how I can enact my evil plans on the world."
18

19
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,780
But either way it's a really useful service and it's useful not just for pitching journalists but for
19

20
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:27,540
finding venture capitalists or angel investor details or doing B2B sales when you're looking for like
20

21
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,180
say the V.P. of sales at a particular company etc..
21

22
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,480
So really really powerful tool.
22

23
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,320
Try it out.
