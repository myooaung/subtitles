Right.

2
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:06.480
So let's address flat design because I've spoken about it quite a few times. And this is actually quite
2

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:14.130
interesting because initially if you're remember iOS 6 and previous, the iPhone home screen was always
3

4
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:22.470
like these glassy, jiggly icons which were very 3D and had a lot of contrast and they obviously stood
4

5
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.630
out from the screen.
5

6
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.380
Now since iOS 7 the design concept has been going towards something called flat design.
6

7
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.710
Now a typical representation of flat design is something like this image on the right. You can see that
7

8
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.000
there's very little if any shadowing,
8

9
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.370
there's pretty much no contrast and there's no gradients.
9

10
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.060
So the idea is that it's like as if it's a piece of glass.
10

11
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.790
There's nothing that stands out up from the screen. On the left
11

12
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.440
is Google's design principle which is material design.
12

13
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.820
And it's funny because previous to material design, the concept at Google was flat design.
13

14
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.130
It's like as if Apple and Google did a swap on each other.
14

15
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.340
And iOS is now flat
15

16
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.070
and Google is now slightly 3D, what they call material design.
16

17
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:23.350
So material design is meant to be exactly that. It's meant to feel like paper and card, real materials.
17

18
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.080
So for example, if we look at something that looks a bit like the Instagram screen,
18

19
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:35.910
so where you display your images. On iOS it's like as if you're looking at a piece of glass. On Android
19

20
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:42.300
however it's more like if you've got a piece of paper that's lying on a piece of card and personally
20

21
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.510
even though I spend most of my time designing for iOS and working with the iOS environment I prefer
21

22
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:57.570
the material design look and feel because as humans we need indications as to what can we interact with
22

23
00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.530
on a digital screen.
23

24
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:06.210
And I believe something that just looks like a plain piece of glass with no indications as to what is
24

25
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.950
a button,
25

26
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.120
what is a label, what is just text.
26

27
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.080
Makes it very confusing for users and I don't think it's optimal user experience. Whereas something like
27

28
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.580
this where there's subtle hints,
28

29
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.040
what is something that you can interact with, I think is a better design. And I think I would predict
29

30
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.890
that in a few more years you'll see the iOS environment going more towards something like this as well
30

31
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.850
just simply because it's better user experience.
