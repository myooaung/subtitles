Okay. Last question. Am I treating my users like a [REMOVED]?
1

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,800
This sounds really strange and I'll explain what I mean by this.
2

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,210
So on the left here you'll see the Amazon app for Android.
3

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:21,230
And what happens is that when you select an item and you click on Add to carts, you'll see this pop
4

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,440
up and it'll tell you that item was added to cart.
5

6
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:30,530
"Yeah, I know because I just pressed on that button." And then it asks you if you want to go to cart or if
6

7
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,510
you want to continue shopping.
7

8
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,930
Now this is a pattern that you see actually on a lot of e-commerce apps.
8

9
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:42,890
And I want to make the case to you that this is not what you want to do because by clicking on the add
9

10
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:46,090
to cart button I already know that I've added it to cart.
10

11
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:52,430
You don't have to show me a pop up. And if I wanted to go see the cart I will click on the cart button.
11

12
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,270
But otherwise I would continue shopping.
12

13
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:01,850
Now the reason why I think its bad is because if I was intent on buying 10 things and every single time
13

14
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:07,910
I added something to cart I had to be confronted with this pop up asking me "Do I really want to continue
14

15
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:08,700
shopping"
15

16
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,060
maybe I've indulged in my shopping behavior a little bit too much.
16

17
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:17,810
So every single time you show this pop up you're asking the users to stop what they're doing and re-evaluate.
17

18
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:23,600
And similarly this is another example of this in the Jamie Oliver recipe app. And what happens here is
18

19
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,730
that when you are in a particular recipe and you click on Add to a shopping list, it actually send you
19

20
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:34,850
a pop up saying "Do you want to add the ingredients for Thai-green curry for two people to your shopping
20

21
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:36,190
list? Add.
21

22
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,130
I mean that's what I wanted to do when I pressed that button.
22

23
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:47,120
I don't know why I feel like an idiot having to confirm my action given that it wasn't like
23

24
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,520
I just entered the nuclear codes or something.
24

25
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:54,280
And similarly it does the same thing when you press on the delete all button in your shopping list.
25

26
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,680
This is not my bank details we're talking about.
26

27
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,380
It's so not a big deal
27

28
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:04,490
and by interrupting my flow instead you prevent the users from having a good user experience.
28

29
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,650
So when you're doing this in your app, this is essentially what you're saying to your users. You are
29

30
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,390
stupid and you should feel bad
30

31
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,080
and nobody wants to feel bad or feel stupid.
31

32
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,680
So don't do this.
32

33
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,660
Now this is a quote from one of my favorite books and it says that a person enters a highly productive
33

34
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,190
mental state by working in harmony with her tools.
34

35
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:30,950
Interrupting a user's flow for no good reason is stopping the proceedings with idiocy.
35

36
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:34,890
And this is why this particular design pattern is called the idiot design pattern
36

37
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:42,470
because you're designing your app for idiots essentially. And this is from a book called about face by
37

38
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:48,230
Alan Cooper and some other people and it's a really good book on Interaction Design if
38

39
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,610
you're interested.
39

40
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,850
Now how should you implement this?
40

41
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:58,940
Well this is the Amazon app for iOS and what happens here is that when you click on Add to Cart, you'll
41

42
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:07,450
see an image of your item fall into your cart and there will be a badge on that cart to show that there's
42

43
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:11,300
one extra item in there and that it's not empty.
43

44
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:16,330
So now you're free to choose either to go to cart and check out or you can continue shopping.
44

45
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:22,370
But nobody forced a pop up on you to confirm that action because you already did so by pressing on the
45

46
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:22,990
button.
46

47
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:29,070
So this is a way better way of implementing that same functionality without the idiot pattern.
47

48
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:32,230
So think about your own designs and think about your own app.
48

49
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,460
Are you treating your users with respect?
49

50
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:38,240
Are you treating them as the intelligent individuals that they are?
50

51
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:41,960
So try to take your users actions at face value and try to avoid this
51

52
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,650
if you can.
