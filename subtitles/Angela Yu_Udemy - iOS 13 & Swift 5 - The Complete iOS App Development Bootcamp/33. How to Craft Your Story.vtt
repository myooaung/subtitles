00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.600
Now the other thing you have to think about is crafting a story. Because nobody can write about you if
1

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.720
you just pitch a journalist saying "Hey my name is Angela.
2

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.750
I made a great app. Please write about me." And sadly nobody's going to really take that bait.
3

4
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.800
So instead what you need is you need to craft a story.
4

5
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.910
Think from the journalist point of view.
5

6
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.330
Imagine that you're the guy who needs to get X number of clicks per day in order to stay employed.
6

7
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.170
They need to be able to show that the stories they write gets shared, gets liked and gets views.
7

8
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.000
And this unfortunately is the way that modern journalism works.
8

9
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.500
Now journalism standards aside, this is unfortunately the reality that you're faced with.
9

10
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.210
So imagine that you are that tech journalist who has to churn out article after article after article.
10

11
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.050
Forget about things like writer's blog.
11

12
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.800
You know imagine having to create a masterpiece every 30 minutes. Because in reality, those are some of
12

13
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.360
the constraints that tech journalists face nowadays.
13

14
00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.990
And so a) be considerate. When you are pitching a journalist give them everything that they need in order
14

15
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.510
to put together a story quickly.
15

16
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.010
So that means images, that means the media, portraits of the founders, anything that they could just drag
16

17
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.980
and drop into the story instead of you know playing sort of email ping pong with you because nobody
17

18
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.100
has the time for them.
18

19
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.500
The other thing to do when you're imagining yourself in the shoes of a journalist is how do you not
19

20
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.220
get fired?
20

21
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.480
How do you create a story that people actually want to read?
21

22
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.060
And I can bet you that story is not going to be some unknown company started yesterday, brought out a
22

23
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.200
new app. That's just not exciting anymore.
23

24
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.120
Instead think about helping them in their jobs.
24

25
00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.650
Craft an angle.
25

26
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.710
Think about something that is exciting, something that allows readers to imagine the future. Or something
26

27
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.050
that's just pure funny and very shareable.
27

28
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.930
So unless you're Apple or Google, if you pitch journalists with boring stories or just facts about your
28

29
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.340
company or your app, you can bet that nobody's going to pick them up.
29

30
00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.470
So you know it's fine for Apple to say "Oh we made a new support app." and Tech Crunch will write about
30

31
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.800
it.
31

32
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.530
If you are a nobody if your company is not known,
32

33
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.690
the fact of the matter is that nobody cares and you have to make-- and you have to figure out how you
33

34
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.170
can make people care.
34

35
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:18.210
So for example, a friend of ours decided to jump onto the Christmas season quite literally by creating
35

36
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.560
these humping reindeer Christmas jumpers.
36

37
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:27.120
It was kind of an off the cuff idea. But it had two really powerful things going for it.
37

38
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.710
One is seasonality.
38

39
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.840
It's coming up to the Christmas period,
39

40
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.300
Journalists will have to write about Christmas whether if they like it or not.
40

41
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.240
And this is a good story that coincides with the gift giving and gift buying period of time. And the
41

42
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.540
second thing is that they managed to have a story that's pretty clickbaity like "Frisky reindeers inspire
42

43
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.230
Scotts gran to design naughty Christmas jumper."
43

44
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.740
Now that is a BuzzFeed title. And usually the way that press goes nowadays is that you target a small
44

45
00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:01.350
paper, some local paper but something that gets syndicated by the larger newspapers.
45

46
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.110
So for example journalists at the larger publications will read a whole load of blogs as well as local
46

47
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.130
newspapers just to tap into what's going on in the world.
47

48
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.350
Very often what happens is that you start off going for the easy bake, you know targeting the smaller
48

49
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.170
publications. And once you get a success there if it's interesting enough it'll get picked up by some
49

50
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.310
of the larger publications and national publications
50

51
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.960
even. So for example that story ended up getting picked up by the Daily Mail and that gave them back links
51

52
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.910
that gave them exposure and that helped them sell a whole load of humping reindeer Christmas jumpers.
52

53
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.390
Now coming back to our point,
53

54
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:46.080
this all started from crafting a story. And their story happened to be that the founders grandma came
54

55
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.920
up with a rude Christmas jumper idea.
55

56
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.570
She saw some humping ranges and decided to knit one for her grandson or something like that.
56

57
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.340
Now this is completely false
57

58
00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.400
according to the guys who made this. They essentially worked backwards in terms of what is the current
58

59
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.800
season, what will journalists write about,
59

60
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.830
what is something that can get attention, get clicks, get shares.
60

61
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.410
Well maybe a rude Christmas jumper.
61

62
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.510
It's the perfect combination of traditional versus comical.
62

63
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.160
So his grandparents were sporting enough to wear the jumpers and let him go along with this story.
63

64
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.810
But at the end of the day it was actually completely made up.
64

65
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.340
They decided to make a product and they tried to figure out what is the best angle for a journalist
65

66
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.420
to pick up the story.
66

67
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.220
And whether you like it or not, this is something that you have to think about.
67

68
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.480
And I'm not saying that you have to create a false story but you have to think about what is the angle
68

69
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.350
of your story that can make it exciting and can make journalists want to write about it.
69

70
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.080
Maybe you created something that shows what the future will be like
70

71
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.600
or maybe you created something that nobody ever thought about.
71

72
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:56.440
But essentially the important thing to take away is to craft your story even before you start the pitch.
