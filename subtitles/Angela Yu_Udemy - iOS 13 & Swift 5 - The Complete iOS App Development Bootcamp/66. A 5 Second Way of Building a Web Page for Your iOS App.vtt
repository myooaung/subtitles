All right.

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:07.740
So this is a bonus chapter where we talk about how you can go about creating a product page for your
2

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.550
app that has been launched. Now in order to rank on Google search
3

4
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.360
it's a really good idea to create a product page.
4

5
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.620
It's meant to be something really simple. It's just something that shows a screenshot or a video and
5

6
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.080
has the all important download links.
6

7
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.320
So basically the difference between a website and a web app is that the web apps or web applications
7

8
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.480
actually do something but websites are mainly for displaying images or displaying information.
8

9
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.290
And in the current day and age, making a website or designing a website is as easy as pie and you should
9

10
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.140
not be paying somebody to do this.
10

11
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.770
So I'm going to show you just how easy it is to create your own product page and put it online.
11

12
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.500
So the first way I'm going to show you is using a tool called AppStop that was very kindly developed
12

13
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.170
by a guy called Nick Parrott. And this is really cool because basically what it means is that if you launch
13

14
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:06.060
an iOS app all you have to do is just copy the URL of your app listing on iTunes and then you just
14

15
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.480
paste it into here.
15

16
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.500
And once you hit create, it will automatically make a app product page for you.
16

17
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:22.110
So it takes all of the images that you've uploaded to iTunes, so your screenshots, your description, your
17

18
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.700
links, as well as giving you a really simple one page at the top.
18

19
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:27.710
So it looks beautiful.
19

20
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.030
It took me less than a second to do.
20

21
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.750
And then once you're done you can click on this get shareable URL and this is the URL that
21

22
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.590
now links to your new website
22

23
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.720
and you can show off your product to your heart's content.
23

24
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.190
Now this is the easiest way I know in order to create a product page.
