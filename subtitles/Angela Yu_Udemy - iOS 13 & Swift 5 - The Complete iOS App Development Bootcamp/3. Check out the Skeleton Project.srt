00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:00,900
All right.
1

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:07,080
So first things first, go ahead and download the skeleton project called in InspoQuotes for this module
2

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,460
from the giant course resources list.
3

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:17,370
And once you've either git cloned or unzipped, then you should see this Xcode project.
4

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:21,010
Now, if you want to create the stub by yourself, then that's perfectly fine as well.
5

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,790
Just go ahead and create all of the features that we're going to talk about now.
6

7
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:31,740
So firstly, I've got a table view controller that is linked to a class called Quote TableViewController.swift.
7

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,430
That's that one there.
8

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,080
And this contains prototype cells that are named QuoteCell,
9

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,020
and it's also got a right bar button item that's called Restore.
10

11
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:50,120
And this is linked to my QuoteTableViewController.swift file with an IBAction called restorePressed
11

12
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,880
so that we can detect when that button gets pressed.
12

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:59,700
Now, this entire table view controller is then embedded in a navigation controller,
13

14
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,980
and this is our entrance point,
14

15
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,240
and this is the only screen that we currently have for this app.
15

16
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,910
Now, if you head over to the TableViewController.swift file, you can see that the class is called
16

17
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:16,210
QuoteTableViewController and it's all of our UITableViewController class,
17

18
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,500
and I've got one variable here called quotesToShow that contains six quotes which we're going to give
18

19
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,890
the use of for free,
19

20
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:29,970
and then I've got a constant code premiumQuotes which contains a further six quotes that we're going
20

21
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,770
to expose to the user
21

22
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:37,920
once they've successfully paid for the in-app purchase. I will explain a little bit shortly why this one is a "var"
22

23
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,210
and this one's a "let." So don't worry too much about that for now.
23

24
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,320
Now, the rest of this file contains a whole bunch of code that you get for free whenever you create a
24

25
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,370
new table view control.
25

26
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:55,500
So remember that you can create a new object of anything by simply hitting command N, and then creating
26

27
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,180
a new Cocoa Touch Class,
27

28
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:03,000
and then we just change the subclass to UITableViewController, renamed it QuoteTableViewController,
28

29
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,930
and we get all of this slightly junky code for free.
29

30
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:13,470
Now, I'm going to be deleting most of it, but I just wanted to show you this is what it looks like when
30

31
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,920
you create a new table view control from scratch.
31

32
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:22,320
And finally, at the bottom, we've got the IBAction that's linked to the restoreButton, so that we can
32

33
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,850
detect when it gets pressed, and that's all that I've done in the skeleton project.
33

34
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:32,580
So if you want to save time, then go ahead and use my skeleton project. if you want to do it from scratch,
34

35
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:39,030
then feel free to recreate everything that we've got here. And in the next lesson, we're going to get started
35

36
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,790
setting up our account on the Apple website. So see you there.
