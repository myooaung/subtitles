00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:06.540
So in terms of implementing screenshots there's a Web site called mockuphone.com that allows
1

2
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.410
you to essentially drag and drop your screenshot designs into a phone mockup so that way your app looks
2

3
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.570
like it's actually in use and makes it look a lot nicer and more professional on the app stores.

4
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.210
Another really great free toolkit that I like is something called launchkit.io and they have a
4

5
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.450
screenshot builder that allows you to upload a screenshot and they will put the iPhone or Android phone
5

6
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:36.000
frame around it and then allows you to change the background image or background color and put a little
6

7
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.760
bit of text above or below the design.
7

8
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.820
And it's a really simple easy way of creating your screenshots with not a lot of effort. And once you're
8

9
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.420
done designing all the screenshots,
9

10
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.690
when you download it gives you all of the Android images in all of the different sizes, all of the
10

11
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.150
iOS images of a different phone mockups.
11

12
00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.360
So if somebody is looking at the App Store on a iPhone 5, you'll actually have an image with the iPhone
12

13
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.360
5 frame around your screenshot.
13

14
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.800
And they also do ones for Apple Watch as well. So it's really really nice and easy and definitely recommended.

15
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.670
So check out some of those services
15

16
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.870
and again remember to split test your designs to let the users decide which designs are the best.
