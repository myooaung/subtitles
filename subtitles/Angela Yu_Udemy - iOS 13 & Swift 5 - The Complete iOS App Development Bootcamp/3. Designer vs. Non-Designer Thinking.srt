00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:06,530
So one of the first things that we want to introduce to you is designer vs. non-designer thinking. And
1

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,180
it's almost like that advert about the Mac versus the PC guy.
2

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,660
There's fundamental differences in the way that designers think and non-designers think and simply by
3

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:21,090
learning about some of the concepts relating to design, the beneficial effects go much further than just
4

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,960
simply creating a beautiful app.
5

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,010
So what do I mean by designer vs. non-designer thinking?
6

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,490
Let's look at colors for example.
7

8
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:33,080
So way back in primary school we learn about the seven colors of the rainbow.
8

9
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,030
And a lot of us go around thinking that there are in fact only seven colors in the rainbow. It's either
9

10
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,900
red or orange or it's yellow.
10

11
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,590
But actually to a designer, of each of these different shades have a different mood associated with it
11

12
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,870
and you would use them differently depending on the situation or the project.
12

13
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:57,270
So for example right at the top you know that one might be quite candylike and might be useful for
13

14
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:02,800
a project that's more fun and playful whereas at the bottom you've got something that's called wine
14

15
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:08,430
and it's got more of an elegant sophisticated mood which you might use for something that targets adults
15

16
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,250
for example.
16

17
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,940
So one of the first modules that we're going to dive into is color theory, how do you combine different
17

18
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:15,630
colors,
18

19
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,060
how do you use different colors and in which situations.
19

20
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:25,390
And the second arm that makes up the fundamentals of digital design is typography,
20

21
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:32,310
so how to choose the appropriate type for your project, how to modify it to grab user's attention or
21

22
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,330
how to make different typefaces work well together to produce a harmonious design.
22

23
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:45,000
So most non-designers will look at these typefaces and see regular italic and bold and this knowledge
23

24
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,320
we acquired through using word processing software such as Word.
24

25
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,240
But actually it's so much more nuanced
25

26
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:58,560
and as a designer you might be looking at this and seeing a regular and a sans serif or italic and a serif
26

27
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:02,950
typeface or bold and slab serif. So in the typographic module
27

28
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,890
we're going to look into this in more detail.
28

29
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,380
We're going to learn about different type families, how you would combine different funds and how you
29

30
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,080
would use typography
30

31
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,660
not just for form but also for function in your designs.
31

32
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:22,580
So essentially you should see this course as demystifying digital design. For a lot of people
32

33
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:30,420
good design is a bit like a unicorn. You know it's this magical beast that is very easy to identify once
33

34
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,650
you've seen it but it's not something that comes into intuitively.
34

35
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:41,190
So, for example, as humans it's very easy for us to see design A and compare it against design B and decide
35

36
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:48,240
that you know I prefer design A over design B. But as a designer, it's your job to come up with design A and
36

37
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,240
design B according to the specifications.
37

38
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:57,390
Now it's easy to see exposed how you know one of these designs might fit the category of contemporary
38

39
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,010
better,
39

40
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:03,770
but the skill of the designer is coming up with those designs A and B in the first place
40

41
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,470
according to those specifications.
41

42
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:11,280
So we're going to teach you about the fundamentals of digital design as well as the most important aspects
42

43
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,890
of user interface design and user experience design especially relating to mobile design.
43

44
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:22,020
So hopefully by the end of the course, you'll know a thing or two about how beautiful apps are designed
44

45
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:28,010
and how you can go about creating your next project and making it look as beautiful as you can.
45

46
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:29,830
All right.
46

47
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,770
So without further ado let's begin.
