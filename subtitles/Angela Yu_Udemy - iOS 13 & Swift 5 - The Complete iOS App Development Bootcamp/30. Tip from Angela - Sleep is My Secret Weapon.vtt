Hey!
1

2
00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:03.940
Thumbs up for completing another module.
2

3
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.570
Now today I wanted to talk to you about the importance of sleep.
3

4
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:12.400
I know I'm laughing as I say it because sounds like such a silly thing right?
4

5
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:19.570
Who doesn't know how to sleep? But actually there's a lot of things I've tried over the past like few
5

6
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.660
years that have really helped me.
6

7
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.760
Firstly when I was working in Medicine, when I was training in surgery, the sort of consensus that people
7

8
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.990
told me is like,
8

9
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:35.950
"Look if you're gonna be hardcore, if you are going to be really good at your job, you have to be good
9

10
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.530
at being sleep deprived."
10

11
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:44.410
Like just you know like people would like show off how like oh, "I only slept for like two hours yesterday."
11

12
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.220
And actually you know at the time, I was really impressed.
12

13
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:54.310
I was like, "Wow! They're like so hard core. They work really hard and they don't sleep and they have more
13

14
00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:04.150
hours." But as time has gone on and as I've found more objective measures of my sort of brain performance,
14

15
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.990
I've realized that this is such a silly way to think about things like sleep is so important. It helps
15

16
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.960
your brain get rid of a lot of the sort of things that build up during the day
16

17
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:16.770
right?
17

18
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:25.420
A lot of the byproducts and it's essentially helps you regenerate.
18

19
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:33.460
So the nights when I sleep really you know like two hours or three hours, I really feel it the next day.
19

20
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:40.820
I can do things that I've already learned how to do like things by rote, but I can't do anything creative.
20

21
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.320
I really struggle to learn things.
21

22
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.770
I struggle to make connections in my brain.
22

23
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.740
And it made me realize like, "What am I doing? Why am I living life like a zombie trying to attain this
23

24
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.350
like level of...
24

25
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.970
It's like sort of approval of people when I know that I'm a much better person?"
25

26
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.020
I'm also a friendly person when I sleep more.
26

27
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:17.950
So one of the things I've been trying to do is to have an alarm that goes off like about an hour before
27

28
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:18.840
I have to go to sleep.
28

29
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:25.150
So instead of having like a wake up alarm, having an alarm that tells me, "OK it's time to wind down. It's
29

30
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.460
time to switch off the screens." I've even got this...
30

31
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.990
I've even got this like red tinted glasses that I wear at home when I'm like looking at something like
31

32
00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.900
if I have to watch something with other people.
32

33
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.650
And just like wind down with like a non... like a...
33

34
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.820
And just wind down with like a fiction book of some sort,
34

35
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.960
so that once I'm actually in bed I'm like fully calm and I'm not so like agitated that it takes me ages
35

36
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.090
to fall asleep.
36

37
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.050
Other things that really help is drinking some warm milk,
37

38
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.080
having a little snack before I go to sleep.
38

39
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.790
But the importance of sleep is like, it's just a con.
39

40
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.650
There's nothing that beats it really.
40

41
00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:20.970
There's no supplement that I've ever taken or any sort of medication or anything else basically that
41

42
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.160
lives up to what sleep can do for you.
42

43
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.410
So don't try to be hardcore,
43

44
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.050
try to get enough sleep and try to keep a regular rhythm so that the next day you're actually fresh.
44

45
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.400
And the thing that your brain learns, it actually keeps rather than just you know... you might have to
45

46
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.460
cram stuff but you probably won't be able to hold onto that knowledge or skill unless you have really
46

47
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.910
good sleep.
47

48
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:48.270
So try that out and keep going keep going keep going keep going and you're going to do great.
