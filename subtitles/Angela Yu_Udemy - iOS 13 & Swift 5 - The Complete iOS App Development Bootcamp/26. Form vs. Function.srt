00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:08,540
Now Question 2 is a mind doing it because it's good or because it's clever?
1

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,640
And to illustrate this I'm going to use an anti-pattern from the NBC News app.
2

3
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,390
Now I'm going to highlight their menu system.
3

4
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:24,160
Now the designer decided that it would be a good idea to make their menu in the shape of their logo.
4

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:32,230
So for those you guys who are unfamiliar, the NBC logo is essentially a peacock with a rainbow of feathers
5

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,570
that looks pretty much like the top half of this menu system.
6

7
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:42,790
And they thought, "Wouldn't it be cool if we can make our menus look like the logo?"
7

8
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:49,140
Now this is a classic example of doing it because it's clever rather than because it's good.
8

9
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,050
Why is that?
9

10
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:57,160
Well number 1, humans are really bad at reading at 90 degree angles when you've got your menu items
10

11
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,560
that are at 90 degrees.
11

12
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,600
And remember that when you turn this app to landscape it'll turn with the phone.
12

13
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,590
So it will be endless frustration for the users.
13

14
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,240
Plus if you think about it, what do you do if you have more than 12 items in your menu?
14

15
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,940
Well you kind of screwed because there's nowhere else to put it.
15

16
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:22,300
So this design is form above function and whenever you're making the design choice between form versus
16

17
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,590
function, always go for function.
17

18
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,240
So this is a clear anti-pattern.
18

19
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:32,440
If we compare this against USA Today's app, even though they've implemented a pretty boring what's called
19

20
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,410
Hamburger menu where the menu just slides out from the left
20

21
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:43,240
when you tap on the menu item, it's pretty boring and it has its own disadvantages namely that what's
21

22
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,870
out of sight is out of mind.
22

23
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:51,820
So people might not know what's within the menu system. But at least you can have more than 12 menu items
23

24
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,040
and at least the text is the right way up.
24

25
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:00,940
So these are really important considerations and sometimes when you're designing things it can be really
25

26
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:07,420
easy to get lost in your own thoughts and in your own ego. You might think "Oh I've just come up with
26

27
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,890
such a great idea.
27

28
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,330
This is so brilliant.
28

29
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,670
I am such a genius."
29

30
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,140
And you go along with it to
30

31
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,730
you know, to detrimental effects. So always get a second opinion.
