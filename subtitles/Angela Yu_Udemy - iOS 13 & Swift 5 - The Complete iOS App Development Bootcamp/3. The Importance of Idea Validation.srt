00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:06,920
So the first thing that I'm going to tackle is idea validation i.e. the research phase of starting
1

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,900
your app or starting your startup.
2

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:14,400
And this is something that a lot of people want to skip over but it is so important
3

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:19,670
and I can't stress enough how important it is. When most people launch an app
4

5
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,940
the thing that they imagine will happen is that overnight it'll be a huge sensation,
5

6
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:28,490
you'll see it on tech crunch to end up here and they'll be headlined like "Your app is a huge hit and
6

7
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,120
you're the next month Zuckerberg."
7

8
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,300
And this is because the media that we consume is hugely biased.
8

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:39,860
We like to see news stories on overnight sensations like the Pokemon go appp or we see people having very very
9

10
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,460
public failures.
10

11
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:47,960
And the truth is that in 99 percent of all the companies of all of the apps that get started will get
11

12
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,530
built,
12

13
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:56,310
the saddest thing is not failing publicly but in fact it's no one having ever noticed it existing.
13

14
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,880
And that's what happens most of the time.
14

15
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:05,240
So in order to ensure that your idea or your product has the highest chance of success, the most important
15

16
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:10,970
thing is to do some form of idea validation or market or product validation.
16

17
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:15,350
And if you're somebody like me you'll probably have an idea every five minutes.
17

18
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:20,240
You know Indeed if I'm brushing my teeth or if I'm walking down the street I will have an app idea or a
18

19
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,570
business idea just pop up out of the blue.
19

20
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:27,870
And the question is how do you know which of these ideas are worthwhile?
20

21
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:33,100
How do you know which one that you should pursue and which one is going to be a success?
21

22
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,230
So that's what idea of validation is all about. It's about getting feedback on your ideas seeing if it's
22

23
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:45,200
worth putting in the time putting in the energy putting in the money in order to make it successful.
23

24
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:51,600
Now one of your most important resources is not money but it's actually time.
24

25
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:58,490
This is the one nonrenewable resource that we as all humans have and that also means that if you spend
25

26
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:06,200
a year working on an idea that eventually tanks and doesn't go anywhere, that's prevented you from working
26

27
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,480
on your 10 other ideas one of which could have been a success.
27

28
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:17,150
So it's important to save yourself time as well as money in order to maximize your chances of success.
28

29
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:22,050
Now the other problem is that how do you know if your idea is actually a good one?
29

30
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:28,550
And I love the sketch from Silicon Valley because it just describes so many people that if you've been
30

31
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:33,490
in the tech industry for a while you will come across. Terrible ideas from great people.
31

32
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:39,260
Usually when I'm riding on the back of an Uber. - "Ever been lost in the parking lot before? What my app would do
32

33
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,460
is use existing AVL technology right?
33

34
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:46,520
So you would just type in the VIN number and if your car doesn't have AVL capabilities you would just type
34

35
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,350
in like what section of the parking lot you were in like P3 or ground 7.
35

36
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,160
- So you just you just write down what section of the parking lot you're in ?
36

37
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,670
I mean what are you doing after that? - So you can remember where you parked."
37

38
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,740
- Right.
38

39
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,570
What don't you just write it down on a piece of paper?
39

40
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,870
- Well yeah but this is for your phone.
40

41
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:03,550
- OK.
41

42
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,440
So it's just like a notepad?
42

43
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,850
- Exactly! See? You get it.
43

44
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:15,770
- I  get it.
44

45
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:16,770
OK.
45

46
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:22,040
So aside from being one of my absolute favorite shows, but it also illustrates a really valid point.
46

47
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:27,180
There's a lot of people spending a lot of hours in their life on an idea that's probably not going to
47

48
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:27,870
work.
48

49
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:33,390
And the reason why I say it's probably not going to work not because I have any you know advanced insight
49

50
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:39,450
or that I can predict the future, but it's because they haven't ever validated their idea on a buying
50

51
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,000
customer or on a future user.
51

52
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:47,130
So essentially, you know, when we think about startup founders we think you know there are huge risk takers,
52

53
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,740
they've quit their job,
53

54
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,990
they've given up everything, remortgaged their house in order to do this thing.
54

55
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:57,120
But actually you know if you listen to somebody like Richard Branson actually you'll notice that the
55

56
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,840
thing that differentiates successful founders versus unsuccessful founders is that they want to limit
56

57
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,640
their risk exposure.
57

58
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:11,550
For example, when Richard Branson started Virgin Atlantic you know he had a deal which allowed him to
58

59
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,540
hand back the plane if it didn't work
59

60
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,520
after a year.
60

61
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:21,240
So unlike what the media portrays, startup founders are not these huge risk takers because nobody can
61

62
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:27,140
predict the future. No matter how great your idea is if the time is not right or if certain conditions
62

63
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,950
aren't met it just won't work.
63

64
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:32,960
Why is it that the Palm Pilot didn't take off in the same way that the iPhone did?
64

65
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:37,290
Because the time wasn't right. And there's things that you can't predict as a human.
65

66
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,520
So you must must validate. This is the progression that I see a lot of potential founders having in their head
66

67
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,970
and it's the idea of creating a prototype, then use that to raise funding,
67

68
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,800
then you build a great team and then you put it out to the market and then you have overwhelming success.
68

69
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,660
Now unfortunately, this rarely works. And I'm not saying that it never works
69

70
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:05,220
I'm sure there are examples but this has a lower chance of success than an alternative pathway. Which
70

71
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,730
is where you validate the idea first in the market,
71

72
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:13,620
see if there are people who are willing to download it or use it depending on what it is that you're
72

73
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:19,880
building and then create the prototype and then demonstrate that you've got traction, that you've got growth
73

74
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:24,610
you've got more and more users or they're spending more and more time in your product.
74

75
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,140
And then you take that evidence and then you go and raise funding.
75

76
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,570
This has a much higher chance of success than the previous one.
76

77
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,240
So I think I've stressed the importance of idea of validation enough.
77

78
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:42,920
So let's look at some of the ways in which you can validate your idea for little or no cost.
