Okay. So the next thing I want to talk about is blogging and this is remarkably underutilized and yet really
1

2
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:09,300
quite successful.
2

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,490
Now we were talking about blogging nowadays the predominant way that people go about doing this is using
3

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,230
medium.com. Medium
4

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:24,720
if you haven't used it, is just this beautiful minimalistic way of creating content and consuming content
5

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,360
that is the written word.
6

7
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:33,300
So one of the ways that you see founders leverage medium for their launch is by creating a blog that
7

8
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,030
essentially follows the journey of how their app got created.
8

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,390
So from the very beginning of idea conception, what are they doing, what are the problems that they come
9

10
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:43,860
across,
10

11
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,310
how are they selling them.
11

12
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:51,110
And as humans we're kind of suckers for storytelling. We really really like a good story.
12

13
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:57,510
We want to know you know what challenges are the hero facing, how are they fighting it, how are they getting
13

14
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,830
over it and every step of their journey.
14

15
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,060
So there's a few good examples for you to check out
15

16
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:12,450
and the first of which is a Mac app called Desk and the guy who created it essentially documents a timeline
16

17
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:20,070
of how he went about creating this thing. And and even in the very beginning, you know 11 years before
17

18
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,020
creation, he started blogging about the idea.
18

19
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,500
I know a lot of us are suddenly going to tense up and say you know "Oh my gosh. You know my great idea if I just
19

20
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,240
release it out there into the internets, what's going to happen? Somebody is going to steal it and then
20

21
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,550
it will be lost."
21

22
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:42,630
So my answer for those people is that you vastly underestimate how much people procrastinate.
22

23
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:49,440
There are so many people that I've met over the years either through running London App Brewery or working
23

24
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:57,720
in tech that have had amazing fantastic ideas and yet they lack that internal little hand that pushes
24

25
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:05,220
them beyond the idea and getting them to actually work on it and pour their blood, sweat and tears into
25

26
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,510
this project.
26

27
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,380
So I really wouldn't worry about people stealing your idea.
27

28
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:15,980
And I can bet that if you go around telling every single person you meet your grand idea, one in a
28

29
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:20,180
hundred of those people will be tempted to steal it but then they go home
29

30
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,750
and then there's Game of Thrones and then there's ice cream and then they'll forget about it.
30

31
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:30,300
And also if your idea is really truly that great, then you can bet that at least five people right now
31

32
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,440
on earth are working on it.
32

33
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,800
So don't worry about it. Instead
33

34
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,670
be transparent. Blog about it.
34

35
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,650
Tell people what you're doing and how it's going.
35

36
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:44,550
And one of the great benefits of that is that you a) build up a following.
36

37
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,800
And this is a slightly different following to those people that you have on your email list because
37

38
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:55,800
you ask them to take action once only and they might have declared that they're interested in downloading
38

39
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,530
your app.
39

40
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,670
But when you have a group of people who are following you along your journey of creation, those people
40

41
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:08,470
really care and that is the difference between a fan and a customer.
41

42
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:14,650
So there's a really great blog by the guy who created Looseleaf.
42

43
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,790
And again all the links are in the text below
43

44
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,400
if you want to have a look at them.
44

45
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,290
But basically what he did was he documented his journey for creating this app and every step of the
45

46
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:30,690
way he face problems or issues and documented some of his solutions.
46

47
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:36,540
Now some of those solutions are technical regarding how he coded certain things and other ones are more
47

48
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,180
related to the product or getting it out there.
48

49
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:46,230
And at the end of the day, he had a whole bunch of followers who were really really vested in the success
49

50
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,140
of Looseleaf.
50

51
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,400
Like people who cared about it, myself included.
51

52
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:56,670
The emotion is very different because you really want that guy to succeed, you really want the app to
52

53
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:01,590
succeed and you care so much that you're willing to shout about it, you're willing to tell your friends
53

54
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,560
about it even though it doesn't benefit you at all and you're probably paying for it.
54

55
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,660
That is the difference between a true fan and just a customer.
55

56
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:17,400
So I highly urge you to start writing about your journey of creating your product and gather your fans
56

57
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,720
around you who will support you, who will help you spread the word,
57

58
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,060
who will care about the success of your product.
58

59
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:31,320
So have a look at some of the examples in the text below and see how you can start emulating it.
59

60
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:36,320
And I would highly recommend just starting out with Medium. It's really low effort. You
60

61
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:43,080
sign up and you get your own beautiful blog. Writing in it is as simple as writing in Word and adding
61

62
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,210
pictures is pretty much just drag and drop.
62

63
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:52,050
Forget about all those high effort ways of you know buying a domain, setting up hosting, getting a WordPress
63

64
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,560
theme installed on it,
64

65
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:58,000
fiddling around with the settings, changing the layouts blah blah blah.
65

66
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:04,080
You don't need to do any of that. Just get a Medium account and start posting. The content is what matters.
