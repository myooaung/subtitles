Hey.
1

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:02,490
Well done.
2

3
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:07,530
Thumbs up for yet another module that you've just gotten out of the way.
3

4
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:16,270
I want to talk to you a little bit about, again, how we learn because it's the thing that completely fascinates
4

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:25,850
me, how human brains are able to process like the inputs and make the connections in your brain.
5

6
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:35,770
Now, one of the sort of topics of research I've been reading a lot about is this idea of mixing different
6

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,160
areas of knowledge.
7

8
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:47,110
So, for example, in programming, let's say in one of the modules you were learning about conditional statements:
8

9
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:55,620
if and else. And another part, you were learning about loops, like for loops, while loops.
9

10
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:04,600
Now, if you just learn all of those things in, you know, like a capsule, right? Where you just learn one thing and
10

11
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:12,820
you only use that one thing, then the connections that you're making your brain are not as strong as
11

12
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:21,880
if you had been able to mix up these concepts and somehow use them together.
12

13
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:29,530
So let me give you an example. Let's say that you've got one module where you learned a particular topic,
13

14
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,760
another module where you learned different topic.
14

15
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:40,440
If you can come up with a program or some bit of code that mixes two things from those two modules together,
15

16
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,030
even it's not particularly grand,
16

17
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:46,010
it's not like some sort of huge piece of software
17

18
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:52,180
you're making, just like a small bit of code, like five or ten lines of code. But it uses two different parts
18

19
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,420
of knowledge from different parts of the course,
19

20
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,930
then you're already starting to solidify your knowledge, right?
20

21
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:08,140
So see if you can use these ways of mixing up like something that you learned in Module Three with something
21

22
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:16,180
that you learned in ModuleFive, and try to cobble those things together and see if you can use them within
22

23
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,310
the same context.
23

24
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,620
So try that out and let me know how you get on.
