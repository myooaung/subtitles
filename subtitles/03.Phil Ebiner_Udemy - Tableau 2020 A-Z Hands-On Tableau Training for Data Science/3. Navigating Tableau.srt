00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:05,570
Hello this is Carol.

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:10,840
And welcome back to the course and tableaux in today's editorial we will learn how to navigate Tableau

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,280
and we'll get to play around two.

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:19,070
So here you can see where we left off last time we had just connected to our office supplies that CSP

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:19,920
dinosaurs.

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,390
So let's move on to the tableau workspace.

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,150
Here you can see at the bottom a typical sheet one.

8
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,470
Let's look on that.

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:34,250
And right away we're presented with the tableau working area and it may seem a bit overwhelming at first

10
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:40,550
but that's exactly why in the previous section we had this quick agile run through where we very rapidly

11
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,730
created a map and it was quite intuitive wasn't it.

12
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:50,270
So that's exactly what we'll talk about today how easy it is to navigate this workspace in front of

13
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,020
us.

14
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:59,360
So the two main areas here are the data connection on the left or the Data tab on the left and the working

15
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,440
area on the right.

16
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:04,820
So this is where you will be creating things masterpieces.

17
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:08,130
So let's talk about the Data tab on the left first.

18
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:14,240
The data is always broken down into two sections dimensions and measures.

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,460
And there's a very distinct difference between them and it's important to understand.

20
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:27,620
So dimensions and measures are roles different to different roles that any data element can take.

21
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:34,620
And normally what tableau does is enmeshed in two measures it puts any kind of miracle values and into

22
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,300
dimensions.

23
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:39,470
It puts all the categorical and kind of qualitative Don.

24
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:46,130
So that's the default setting for Tableau and you're easily able to drag them around.

25
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:51,470
So if you're not happy with something being a measure you want you can put in two dimensions like like

26
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,250
that for instance.

27
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,980
As easy as that but we will do that right now.

28
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,100
So I just put controls that there to undo an action.

29
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:04,940
That's the standard Windows key to cancel something.

30
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:12,460
So the other way to think about dimensions and measures is dimensions are independent variables and

31
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,200
measures are dependent variables.

32
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,090
So for instance you have here we have unit units.

33
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,740
So how many units of a certain item were sold.

34
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,420
And here we have region.

35
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:26,500
So we can find out how many units in each region were sold.

36
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,780
So region will be the independent variable and units will be the dependent variable because will be

37
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:39,370
grouped by region and based on that definition which is the correct definition things might be you might

38
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:44,800
you might require to move things around from dimensions into measures and measures dimensions but we

39
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,670
won't focus on that right now because tableau usually guesses it quite correctly.

40
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:49,740
OK.

41
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:57,010
So what do we have here as well at the top we've got the normal ribbon for Windows so file basic you

42
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:04,460
can save your file open and you file data you can collect connect to new data sources here are worksheets.

43
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,030
So this is considered a worksheet.

44
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,970
What we're going to be creating now is going to be a worksheet.

45
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:15,150
And we will get to work with these elements a bit more in the future dashboards.

46
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,880
We are not talking about dashboards right now it will come further down in this course.

47
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:25,620
A dashboard is a combination of worksheets story a story can be a combination of worksheets and dashboards

48
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:32,890
and we will get to weave stories as well that's a relatively new feature for tableau analysis.

49
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:39,640
It just basically specifies how you want to do your analysis on the current sheet that you're working

50
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:39,890
with.

51
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,240
We will be working off this tab a little bit in the future map.

52
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,260
We'll work with this when we get to maps and basically formats.

53
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:52,540
There are other ways to access formatting and we'll be doing that in the course server.

54
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:57,390
We won't be looking at server right now and window help.

55
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,800
These are just auxiliary functions.

56
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:07,400
So then what are we going to look at now is basically we won't talk about this right away because we

57
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,730
will get to know this ribbon as we progress the course.

58
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,690
But right now I'd like to focus on the main work area where we will be creating a worksheet.

59
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:22,630
So here the main elements are columns and rows.

60
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:31,490
So most of your worksheets will be created by deciding what goes into columns what goes into rows and

61
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:38,330
then what goes into these other elements like what decides color what the size of your shapes what decides

62
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:44,360
what text is attached to shapes the level of detail we will talk about aggregation more for the course

63
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,050
and any tool tips that you want to apply.

64
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:56,320
So the easiest way to explore is probably to explore by doing so let's drag a few things onto this worksheet.

65
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,020
I would assume let's start perhaps with region.

66
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,220
So just drag it into the middle here.

67
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:09,150
And so we've put one dimension in and let's put another dimension let's say units and right away you

68
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:16,110
can see that by dragging those two in tableau has decided to put region automatically into rows and

69
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,300
your units into some them.

70
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:25,410
So it's aggregate them by region and it's put them into label.

71
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:32,370
And so here you can see that now you can tell right away how many units were sold sold in each region.

72
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,650
So now we can we can just drag and drop here.

73
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:39,540
So if we're not happy with having units here we can put them into columns and right away we have a bar

74
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,280
chart.

75
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,270
And now we can expand this a bit and then reduces a bit.

76
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:50,070
Now we can see by region we can also see how many units have been sold.

77
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:56,840
And you can also see that there is a tool to popping up every time you hover over or one of the bars.

78
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:01,220
Now there's a very handy tool in tableau which is called show me here.

79
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,180
So I encourage you to play around with it.

80
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:08,490
I don't normally use it in my work because I already know what I want.

81
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:13,800
Most of the time but it gives you kind of suggestions and quick shortcuts to different things.

82
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,610
So let's look at a pie chart for instance here.

83
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:22,760
Now we can see a pie chart instead of our market and now if we want to increase the size of its more

84
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,550
usually these pie charts so poor so we'll drag it like that.

85
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:32,630
And if we're still not happy if the sizes but annoy here size Just click that and you'll see how it

86
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,170
grows.

87
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,390
Well that's a bit too much.

88
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,780
So what does this show us.

89
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:43,610
It shows us what region by color has what proportion of the total sales in units.

90
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:48,170
Once again we're just playing around now where there's no intention of what.

91
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,680
For what we're doing we're just exploring tableau.

92
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:54,650
So here you can see Central East and West.

93
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,770
And yeah it's it's a pretty cool pie chart but let's see what else we have.

94
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:01,040
So we can do a bubble chart right away.

95
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,680
Tableau puts everything in the right positions for us.

96
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,100
As you can see there's nothing in columns and nothing in rows.

97
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,240
Everything has been put in here.

98
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,600
Tableau has selected circles for us from this dropdown that's created this bubble chart.

99
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,300
So what else.

100
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:18,710
And then we can look at a tree chart tree map.

101
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,850
That's what is called treatment.

102
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:20,760
So here.

103
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:28,140
So it's like a bubble chart but it's a bit different because it's got boxes instead of instead of circles.

104
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:36,750
And here once again the relative size of the box the area of the box is directly correlated to the number

105
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,710
of units sold in that region.

106
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:46,800
You can just keep clicking around and you'll see different versions of the dashboard that or the worksheet

107
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:51,200
that tableau is suggesting for you and maybe you might be happy with one of them.

108
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:56,750
But we won't rely on that and we will create our own version in the next story.

109
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:05,040
So before we finish up I just want to show you that in this show me box some of the things are great

110
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:12,750
out and that's because you need certain elements of data to create these for instance to create an area

111
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:20,740
chart you need at least one data so zero or more dimensions one or more measures and at least one day.

112
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,750
So we don't have a date in our worksheet right now.

113
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,180
Tableau concrete an area chart for us so if you want to add a day to just drag a date in here and now

114
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:35,430
it's highlighted and now we can create a area chart.

115
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,430
But once again we'll get to area charts line charts and all these other things for a done the course

116
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,770
today we're just exploring tableau.

117
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,390
So I look forward to seeing the next material.

118
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,190
And until then happy analyzing.
