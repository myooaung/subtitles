Hello and welcome back to the course on tableau.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,580
And today is going to be a very quick tutorial.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,660
We're just going to create one more charge for our segmentation dashboard.

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,760
And this chart will be a tree map.

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:19,860
This tree map will be working with the job classification variable in our data.

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,020
So let's go ahead and create a new tab.

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,530
We will call this tab job classification.

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,920
And now we will start creating our tree map.

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:35,280
So let's take job classification drag it into our workspace and let's take a number of records and drag

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,510
it until workspace.

11
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,340
Now if we use the Show Me functionality we can select tree map from here.

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,090
And once we do that you can see a tree map has appeared.

13
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,560
It is funny how it's called a tree map.

14
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,680
I know it's it's actually boxes.

15
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,930
There's no trees here but nevertheless it's a tree map.

16
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:01,740
So what we want to do now is get rid of this color that's been determined by the total number of records

17
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,120
in each box.

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,700
And instead of that rule to jobless classification hold control and drag it into color.

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,370
So that's our tree map let's just make it look good.

20
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:18,440
Now to start off with if we're right click somewhere here and we'll click format change this to bore

21
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,400
or 12 and bold.

22
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,990
And now I also would like to change the colors.

23
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,870
Let's go into colors and change them up a bit.

24
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,680
So blue color can stay blue.

25
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:36,800
Other let's make our green and white collar.

26
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:37,680
Let's make it gray.

27
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,280
We can't really make it white because our background is white.

28
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,960
But let's make it gray.

29
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,690
So there is our tree map and now we'll just save ours worksheet.

30
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,450
And that's pretty much it.

31
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,030
That's how you create a tree map there.

32
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,720
Pretty easy to create.

33
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:58,830
What else you could do you could drag this into labels as well if you wanted to but we're not going

34
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,350
to do that at this stage.

35
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,920
So we're done with all of our worksheets which is great.

36
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,620
In the next tutorial we will finally start creating our super powerful dashboard.

37
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,690
I'll look forward to seeing you then.

38
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,550
And until next time happy analyzing.
