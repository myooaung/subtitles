00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.240
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tableau.

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.930
In the previous tutorial we did all of the groundwork in connecting to our data sources.

3
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.900
And today we get to do the fun part.

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.680
We get to create the facilitation.

5
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.590
So what will we be talking about today.

6
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.510
Well first of all of course we'll be talking about blending and more advanced blending so you will see

7
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.420
a real life example of how to apply blending and get results.

8
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.130
And also you will learn how to do a dual axis chart too.

9
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.700
Well we'll show you how to create a dual axis charts today which is quite a valuable skill to have in

10
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.890
terms of your tableau dash boarding and creating cool visuals.

11
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.960
So let's get straight to it here.

12
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.430
As you recall we have two datasets more data sources list of orders plus order breakdown which will

13
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:58.530
tell us the dates when certain items were sold or when orders were made and how those orders are broken

14
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.110
down into two different items.

15
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.350
And what's the sales on those items.

16
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:09.900
And also we have the sales targets data set which gives us the targets for our sales for the different

17
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.940
departments for the separate months.

18
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:18.540
So as you recall the level of granularity for these two data sources is different sales targets are

19
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:27.960
at the level of detail of a category and list of orders plus order a breakdown are actually at a much

20
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.820
more granular level they are at the level of items which constitute orders.

21
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.300
So let's go ahead and start creating our visual to start off with we're going to want to visualize by

22
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.410
a month.

23
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.210
So we're going to drag the order data into columns and we're going to convert this into month.

24
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.090
So we're already used to that we know what's going on here.

25
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.280
Next we're going to look for sales so we've got the sales here and the measures and we're going to put

26
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.070
sales on child rolls.

27
00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.780
And right now that gives us automatically airline chart but we're going to change that to a bar chart

28
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.760
because that is a bit more representative in our case a better representation.

29
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.870
So there we go.

30
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:13.980
It might be a bit in this particular instance about me a bit too cluttered soldiers make it the reduce

31
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.850
the size to give some room between the buyers.

32
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:17.210
Okay.

33
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.430
So that's our sales for that for every single month.

34
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.900
The total sales for all of the departments.

35
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:33.690
So what else we can do now is we can take the category and drag the category into let's say we're going

36
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.440
to drag it into color which will give us these bars like the bars and our colored into three colors

37
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.440
because of the different categories.

38
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.040
But we want to visualize the categories separately so we're going to take categories again and we're

39
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.060
going to drag them into rows.

40
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.320
And this gives us categories separately here.

41
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.310
Now this is a bit too big to fit numbers position so we'll reduce the size and there you go.

42
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.860
So there you have how the categories or the different departments furniture office supplies and technology

43
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.600
have been performing since the start of 2011 all the way up to 2015.

44
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.590
So what we want to do now is we want to add in the sales targets for these departments and see how they

45
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.520
have or have not been meeting those sales targets.

46
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.110
So whereas our data located well it's locked in our second data source cell so let's work on that here

47
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.620
right away.

48
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:33.570
You can see that familiar orange line on the left meaning that this is a potential secondary data source

49
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:40.560
to our visualization where you have a primary data source and is marked here for blue a little checkmark

50
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:48.780
and right away tableau has already recognized that category is a potential field that it can join these

51
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.540
two data sets on because once again the name of the field is the same in both data sets we have a category

52
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.720
here and we have category here.

53
00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:03.900
And the reason why this link is already orange not grey is because as you recall category is already

54
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.370
part of our visualization.

55
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.510
So if category you weren't an overzealous nation and this link would be great.

56
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.860
So we can have a look at that if we just woops if we just take category out momentarily you can see

57
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:20.390
that the link is great because tableau recognizes that this field is not a part of the resource nation.

58
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.450
So there might not be a need to join on this field.

59
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.150
So we're going to put category back by pressing controls at.

60
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.720
Okay.

61
00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:37.530
So how do we get our dates into this or sorry not dates how do we get our targets into this realization.

62
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:44.010
Well first things first we know that our joint has to be performed not only on category but also on

63
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:51.840
month of ordered date and that is because as you recall sometimes we have to join in many fields and

64
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.800
in this particular case the sales targets are set at the month level so they're set for categories or

65
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.560
for the different departments but they're set at the month level.

66
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.770
So let's go back to the data source and have a look here.

67
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:09.520
You can see that for every single month for the category of furniture there's a separate sales target

68
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.770
for every single month.

69
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:19.150
So therefore when we are joining two or blending two our existing data we have to blend not just rolled

70
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:26.410
up category level but also we have to include the month of order date granularity if we just blend right

71
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:32.720
now with only category as our field that tableau will be blending on.

72
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:39.190
What will happen is tableau will as you remember tableau sends separate queries to each dataset.

73
00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:44.940
It aggregates to the required level of granularity and then it brings the data back and blends it.

74
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.020
So in this case what would happen is tableau would go back.

75
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.450
It would take all of these roles for furniture.

76
00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:57.340
It would roll them up so it would take the some of the target it would disregard month and would bring

77
00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:03.130
back the some of the target for furniture and it would blended to every single row here.

78
00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.610
So that's not what we want we can have a look at that.

79
00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:13.300
So if we take target and we drag it into in here you will see and let's just make it so we if we open

80
00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:18.880
up the target control panel we'll just take out the category from color and we'll just drag it into

81
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.270
detail so that it doesn't affect the color.

82
00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:28.510
Here you can see that the target is always the same 620 1000 which is unreal it's not the right target

83
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:29.920
here it's also the same.

84
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.570
And here is also the same.

85
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.250
So it's not changing month to month.

86
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:39.280
And that is because we're not aggregating at us a month of ordered data is being aggregated it's not

87
00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.850
being considered as a level of granularity for our chart.

88
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.580
So let's go ahead and fix that.

89
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:53.320
As you recall we can control the blend or the holder blend is being created through this control box

90
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.960
here.

91
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:58.110
So we're going to go to Data Editor relationships.

92
00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:02.080
And here you can see we've got the automatic field that has been selected.

93
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.750
So now we're going to change it to custom we'll keep category but also will add in a new one here we

94
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:16.040
want to use order date but we want to use month of order date and join on also month of order date.

95
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:21.580
That's good but also month is not just enough because as you remember these are categorical variables

96
00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:27.190
we need to also take the one above month which is year so we have to make sure that the year is also

97
00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:33.130
included others or mix up different months from different years so we'll take a year of order data on

98
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:37.750
this side and here will also take a year of order date and if we click Okay.

99
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:44.550
Now as you can see there is a link and now the category or the targets have been adjusted.

100
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:49.720
And as you can see they're reflecting what is the reality and we can easily check that.

101
00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:56.620
So let's say January 2011 sales target for furniture was five thousand or ten thousand dollars.

102
00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:01.660
If we go to the data source sales target for furniture in January 2011 was ten thousand dollars and

103
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:02.920
then is gradually increasing.

104
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.180
So that's great.

105
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:11.440
And now let's just quickly change this from a bar chart to an area chart because it looks better like

106
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:11.830
that.

107
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:17.870
And let's quickly have a look at the different targets that these different departments have set themselves.

108
00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:23.170
So you can see that the furniture department has a very linear growing target.

109
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:29.980
So it's basically got a coefficient that every month the sales should increase by a certain amount then

110
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:36.580
the office supplies department has quarterly targets so every three months the target is different the

111
00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:42.300
monthly target is different so they basically review their targets every quarter and adjust them accordingly.

112
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:48.020
Basically is you're not seasonality or expect expected supplies and things like that.

113
00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:54.640
And finally the technology department reviews their targets annually and sets them sets the same target

114
00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.280
for the whole year so every month will have the same target.

115
00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:02.440
So it's very interesting how the different departments have different targets and different ways of

116
00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:08.050
setting them and you can see this right away through the data even without talking to management and

117
00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:10.740
understanding their takes on it right away.

118
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.180
You already have this information there.

119
00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.240
So that's a very cool part of data discovery.

120
00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:21.910
That is the targets below the actuals.

121
00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:27.640
What we want to do now is we want to combine these charts so we can actually visually compare them very

122
00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:28.870
easily and seamlessly.

123
00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:35.530
So what we're going to do is we're going to create a dual access chart and it is actually much easier

124
00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:36.430
than it sounds.

125
00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:39.610
So it might it might be very hard to do an excel in tableau.

126
00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:42.660
It is extremely simple and I'm going to show you right now how to do it.

127
00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:49.270
So all you have to do is you just right click on your target here and you click dual axis and then one

128
00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:55.120
more thing which a lot of people forget very important second step in a dual axis chart right away you're

129
00:09:55.140 --> 00:10:00.820
right click on this axis on the right here and you click synchronize axis.

130
00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.400
That is very very important because if you don't.

131
00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:06.420
As you can see right now they're aligned.

132
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:09.320
So 40000 of the top 40000 at the top here.

133
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:15.480
But if you don't synchronize you like I press controls and here so this is synchronized.

134
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.850
This is not synchronized.

135
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:22.830
You can see that they have separate accesses and that way you can get really confused and the people

136
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:26.510
reading the chart can get the wrong insights.

137
00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:32.370
So we're going to synchronize access make sure you do that every time and that finalizes the process

138
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:34.760
of creating a dual access chart.

139
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:39.880
Of course you can make adjustments further down the track but this is pretty much what it looks like.

140
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:46.800
And from here you can get insights into each one of the departments so you can see when they're above

141
00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:53.640
the above their target they're meeting the target or exceeding it when they're below they're not.

142
00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:57.190
So here again you can see the same thing.

143
00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:01.830
Right now the gray area chart is in front of the of our bar chart.

144
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:03.360
We want to put it if we want to put it behind.

145
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.900
We have to just take some target here and drag it to the left.

146
00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:09.940
And that will switch places and as you can see it looks much better now.

147
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:15.750
The gray chart is behind and you can visually compare for every department to kind of see how they're

148
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:17.730
performing along the way.

149
00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:22.950
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to make this a bit bigger so the chart looks so we can see the

150
00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:33.210
chart a bit better with bigger bars and increase the size of the bars so go to sales size increase.

151
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:38.080
So as you can see that already looks really good starting to look very good.

152
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:41.640
That's how you create a dual axis chart and tableau.

153
00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.860
Remember about synchronizing the axes.

154
00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.300
It's very important.

155
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.880
And that brings us to the conclusion for today.

156
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:54.510
Next time we will take this chart one step further and we will introduce a calculated field within the

157
00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:58.890
blend which is a whole different whole separate topic in Tableau and it's important to know how to do

158
00:11:58.890 --> 00:11:59.610
