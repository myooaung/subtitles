1
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,450
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tablo.

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:12,050
And in today's tutorial, we will be talking about the differences between DOTD joining and Dota blending

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,810
to get that topic out of the way once and for all.

4
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:20,080
And also, we will look at when it is appropriate to do a Dota blend in Tablo.

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,140
So let's get straight to it for today.

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,410
We will need our data set.

7
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,980
Uh, we need to go to Superdad Hassans dot com slash Tablo.

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,320
If you scroll down here to Section five joining unblinding data, you will need the second dataset,

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,570
which is amazing, Marty.

10
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,250
You know, I won't download it because I already have it.

11
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:40,760
It's basically the same one that we worked with in Section four.

12
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,430
So let's open that up and have a look at it.

13
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:54,200
There it is, so here you can see, um, here you can see that this dataset has three tabs.

14
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,010
Um, we've already talked about it, but we'll just quickly recap.

15
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:05,240
So the list of orders tells us gives us a list of orders that had been conducted for the store, the

16
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:12,260
date when the order was placed, customer name this city, country, region, whether it was a home

17
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:18,540
office that the daughter was placed for or it was a consumer or corporate office.

18
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:25,790
Different types of customers, basically shipping day shipping mode and the state of the country order

19
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:33,080
breakdown gives us a breakdown of each order by the product that was contained within that order.

20
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:41,900
So basically this field or it is not unique in this, um, because sometimes orders have multiple items

21
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,290
within them.

22
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,200
So here you can see an example that this order had both posted markers and heldon folders and then the

23
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,490
discount on the order, the sales, the profit, not not on the order, actually on the product, the

24
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:58,500
discount on the product, the sales on the product, profit on the product, quantity, um, category.

25
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:04,440
So whether it was office supplies, furniture or technology and subcategory.

26
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,360
So what we will be interested in today is actually this field category.

27
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,410
It'll be important for us.

28
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:17,540
Um, and also we've got the sales target tab, which gives us targets for the three different departments,

29
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,310
which are furniture.

30
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:28,180
Office supplies and technology, and it gives us the targets for the different months of the data set.

31
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:34,080
So what the dollar value targets were for each of these departments for a certain month.

32
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,610
So that's our data set.

33
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:44,370
And what we will be looking to do today is we will want to compare, um, how the departments are meeting

34
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,740
or not meeting their targets.

35
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,160
But the caveat here is that that is not the only thing that we want to visualize.

36
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,850
So it is only part of a greater dashboard that we are creating.

37
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:00,640
So remember that dashboard that we created previously with the map and it was showing us different items.

38
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,890
I'll just bring it up actually, just to so we remember what we're talking about.

39
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:11,730
So I'll open up Tableau and remember this dashboard here in Section four that we created, which had

40
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:17,490
the different, uh, maps of the different regions and then how the customers were, which customers

41
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,780
were profitable, which weren't profitable and so on.

42
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,690
So we still want to be able to create all of this information.

43
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:34,050
But at the same time, we want to be able to analyze how the departments are performing, um, how the

44
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,130
different departments are performing.

45
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,420
So let's go ahead and do that.

46
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,170
So I'm going to close this workbook and we'll start a new one.

47
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:46,050
And that's just because I want every section to be independent so you can just pick up from any section

48
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,180
and start working on it.

49
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,090
So we're going to create a new connection.

50
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,730
We're going to create a connection to our Excel file and the Excel file is amazing.

51
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,930
Martlew and here.

52
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:45,050
We've got all three tabs, so we will recreate the join that we created previously.

53
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:53,240
So basically we obviously we want to order breakdown because here it's got the sales and those are the

54
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,710
values of the sales.

55
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:58,640
And we need to compare the sales to the targets.

56
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,930
But the order breakdown tab does not have information on the debt.

57
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,290
It does have the category, which is good but doesn't have the date of the order.

58
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,030
So we need the list of orders file.

59
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:15,170
So we'll take a list of orders will connected to order breakdown that creates an inner join.

60
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,390
And now we have the order date.

61
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:25,670
Then we have the sale that was generated on that item and we have the category under which the item

62
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,720
false, which is perfect.

63
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:32,030
And we still have all this other information that we need for the rest of the dashboard, which we just

64
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:32,480
looked at.

65
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,990
Now, the question is, how do we add sales targets into here?

66
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:41,900
Another thing is that we can't just simply drag it in and create another joint here.

67
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:47,540
Well, it does work, but we're actually doing a very incorrect thing by doing that.

68
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:53,650
And I have created a few slides, a few PowerPoint slides just to explain what exactly was going on.

69
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,390
So let's have a look.

70
00:05:55,730 --> 00:06:01,970
Here we've got two tables that we want to join, so the table A plus B that we've already created through

71
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:07,700
a joint and the table C, which is our sales targets, table A plus B has information on order.

72
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:15,260
Edem has the date, has some more information, has the item within that order, has the category within

73
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:19,980
which the item falls and has the sales that was generated on the item.

74
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,870
Then also, of course there's lots of lots of other columns in there.

75
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,580
And as you can see here, there are other instances where the order ideas and duplicated because it

76
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,960
might consist of many items.

77
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:38,540
So that's how our table looks at the table that we've created table A plus B now we've also got table

78
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:44,480
C, which we want to connect or somehow we want to link these to so that we can compare the sales to

79
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,080
the targets.

80
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,180
But the thing is that the Tables C has a very different level of granularity.

81
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,590
Level of granularity here is not item.

82
00:06:53,600 --> 00:07:00,830
So here the level of granularity is actually at an item level for each individual order, whereas here

83
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,980
the table is much less granular.

84
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:09,780
It's, um, it's got a month, is got category and has got the target.

85
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:18,770
So what that means is that if we do want to connect these two tables, then what will happen is we will

86
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:26,030
have to roll this table up, we'll have to roll it up by date and category in order to match this level

87
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:26,870
of granularity.

88
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:32,480
So basically, we will lose information on order ID and we will lose information on item.

89
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:37,610
We will lose all of the information except for date and category, and then we'll be able to take the

90
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:42,760
sum of sales for that specific month for that specific category and compare it to Target.

91
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,800
And basically that was what it means.

92
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,370
We're losing all of the other information if we're going to roll this table up.

93
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:54,920
And that would have been fine if that is what we were looking for, if that is the only thing that we

94
00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:01,400
wanted to compare the total sales for a certain month for a certain category to their target, that

95
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,180
would have been fine.

96
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:08,750
But we can't do that, um, because we still need to create the rest of the dashboard.

97
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,960
Remember that caveat that we need to be able to create the rest of the dashboard.

98
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,330
So we need the rest of this information.

99
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:19,520
So that way we can just, um, roll up this table and join it to this table.

100
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,790
And moreover, I'm just going to end this.

101
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:29,150
So moreover, in Tablo, if we were to drag sales targets here, it doesn't actually roll the data up

102
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:29,690
for us.

103
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,570
What it does is just performs an inner join.

104
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:38,090
And as you recall, when there are many fields, so it's joining here, you can see it's joining on

105
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,400
category equals category, not even including month.

106
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,660
And when when that happens, it is duplicating lots of rows.

107
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,800
So basically this what just happened here is a whole another mess.

108
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:54,620
And if we wanted to even perform that rolled up joint, we would have to work on this a little bit.

109
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,750
But the good news is we don't have to do that because we can use a blend.

110
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,700
And that's exactly what we're going to do.

111
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:09,310
We're going to see how we can use data blending in order to connect this these two data sources.

112
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,580
So now, right now, we have one data source, which is called List of Orders plus.

113
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:18,110
So I'm just going to rename this list of orders plus order breakdown.

114
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,200
That's good.

115
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:28,490
And now we're going to create another data source, Excel and and the same file, but this time only

116
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,450
the sales targets.

117
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:35,900
And now if we've got our sheet, you'll see we have two data sources, list of orders plus order, breakdown

118
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,640
and sales targets.

119
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,810
So remember, we talked about blending in the previous tutorial.

120
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:46,700
Well, now we know that blending is a very smart joint that can happen on the fly.

121
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,740
And we're going to take advantage of that.

122
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:55,790
We're going to create, um, the visualisation that is required through blending rather than joining.

123
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,430
And we're going to do that in the next tutorial.

124
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:05,240
And today, we're going to finish up on this on the reason why we won't be doing a joint patrol.

125
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,830
We're going to be doing a blend.

126
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:14,000
And just to recap, the reason is that in this particular case, we would have had to aggregate our,

127
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,830
um, this dataset.

128
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:19,310
We would have had to aggregate our data set and we would lose information.

129
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:24,980
So basically the level of granularity of the two data sets is different and therefore we cannot perform

130
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,370
a joint.

131
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:30,920
And so that's one of the reason why you would ever want to do a blend rather than a joint.

132
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:36,140
And there's also a second reason why you would want to do a joint, and that is actually a bit more

133
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:36,830
straightforward.

134
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,780
It's when you are not able to do a joint because the data sources are different.

135
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:47,630
So if, for example, your other data source is not and is not the same Excel file, but is a rather

136
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:54,620
sad CSV file or a tablas server file or a muscular a Microsoft a scale database or something like that,

137
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,100
if the.

138
00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:01,750
Data sources are different, then Tablo won't let you do a joint, you will have to be blending the

139
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,060
data.

140
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:06,060
So just keep that in mind that there's two reasons why you would want to do a blend.

141
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:09,970
One is different level of granularity of the data sets.

142
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:17,260
And number two is, um, the datasets are just basically different types of data sources.

143
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,000
So that's all for today.

144
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,770
I hope you enjoy the Turrill and next time we will create this blend.

145
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:27,250
It'll be quite an exciting and very visual tutorial.

146
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,470
So I'll look forward to seeing you then and until next time.
