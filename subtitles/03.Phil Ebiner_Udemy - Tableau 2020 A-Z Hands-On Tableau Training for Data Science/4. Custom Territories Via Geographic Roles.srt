00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,060
Hello and welcome back to of course and travel.

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,970
Previously we learned how to create custom territories through the group method.

3
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:15,470
Today we'll look at the second method you can use to create custom territories.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,550
Let's have a quick look.

5
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,130
So I want to create a new map.

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,300
And this time is over dragging stage right away.

7
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,620
What I'm going to do is I'm going to apply the second method instantly.

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,480
So I'm going to select a sales region going to right click.

9
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,770
And what are we going to do is language which geographic roll.

10
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,870
Then I'll say I create from and select state here.

11
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:40,940
So as you can see sales region has now automatically jumped into this hierarchy of geographic roles

12
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,190
above state.

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,390
So let's quickly discuss what exactly happened there.

14
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:50,930
So if you go to the data source you'll see that apart from these two new calico fields so this is the

15
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:55,580
group and this is the return on marketing investment that we calculated previously.

16
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:56,900
You'll see that here.

17
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,490
You've got the sales region.

18
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:05,360
So what Tableau is doing when you're telling it to create a geographic role for sales region based on

19
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,720
state what is it's doing is it's looking at the data set and it's realizing that actually in this data

20
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:18,130
set even though sales region is not a recognized geographical role there's a geographical Rule named

21
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:18,810
state.

22
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,650
And every sales region is associated with a state or actually the other way around.

23
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,700
Every state is associated with for sales region.

24
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,000
So tableau can recognize that.

25
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:35,240
And then when you tell it to create a set a geographical role for sales region what it basically does

26
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:41,090
is it aggregates all of the states to the Associated sales region.

27
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,400
So it does that aggregation for you.

28
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:50,750
And then from there it will know that region 2 is a combination of Arizona Texas Washington Texas Kansas

29
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,470
and so on.

30
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,270
And so basically it does that's a hard calculation or hard work for you.

31
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:03,080
And in the end you've got two lovely sales regions which you can use as geographical or customer territories.

32
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,310
And let's have a look at that some back in the sheet now.

33
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:09,740
And what we have to do is I'm going to take sales region and I'm just simply going to drag it onto our

34
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,250
map.

35
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:16,250
And as you can see now if you zoom out you have we have just two dots because those are representing

36
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,470
our two sales regions.

37
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,700
And I can simply now change this to a field map.

38
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:28,370
Let me just hand this a little bit so that these blocks away or let's zoom back in so you can see that's

39
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,610
our field map.

40
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:35,870
And again we can just simply take this called uncontrolled drag it into color and we've achieved exactly

41
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:42,860
the same results so we can take our revenue right click put it in here average revenue average return

42
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,480
on marketing investment.

43
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,520
Our average average marketing spend.

44
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:53,030
If you're right click again and we can also put the sales region into our label.

45
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,510
There we go.

46
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,720
So as simple as that.

47
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,820
Now this second approach it might have seemed much quicker.

48
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:04,130
Just that's just because in the first approach we performed here we had to talk through it and it was

49
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,230
the first time we're talking about custom territories.

50
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,860
Now we already previewed to them and that's why it's so much quicker.

51
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:14,570
In reality I think that the first approach is simpler because you just select the objects on the map

52
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,880
and you put them into a group.

53
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,430
But the second approach is more versatile and it's more proper.

54
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:28,260
So you actually create this geographical roll so you can see in this situation we actually puts cells

55
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:35,720
region we created as a assigned it a geographical roll so in that sense it's more of a solid process

56
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,640
rather than just picking things out on a map.

57
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,750
You're actually assigning the geographical roll and then using it.

58
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:47,570
So both approaches are valid and depending on your circumstances and what exactly you're trying to create

59
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,520
you might choose one or the other.

60
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,510
Just remember about them and remember that this is a very powerful tool.

61
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:58,040
So it doesn't have to be states that you can be working with countries and you can put different countries

62
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:05,720
into geographical regions or you can be working with other existing geographical roles and then assign

63
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:12,950
their aggregations custom geographical roles so that can be a very very powerful feature as you can

64
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:18,200
see right away here we were able to create this resolution very quickly and perform some analytics around

65
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,360
it already.

66
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,000
So there we go.

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,080
Hope you enjoyed today's tutorial how to play around with that and I look forward to seeing you next

68
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,330
time.

69
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,060
Until then happy analyzing.
