00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:04.850
Hello.

2
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.440
Welcome back to your favorite course on tableau.

3
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.940
And today we're finally creating our very first dashboard.

4
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:12.540
Hurray.

5
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:21.450
Congrats on getting this far is going to be super super fun and you will see exactly how to create your

6
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.480
first dashboard.

7
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.750
It's going to be epic.

8
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.070
So let's get straight to it.

9
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.000
Here we've got two tabs we've got two worksheets that we re created.

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.680
We've got the customers scatter plot and we've got the map of Europe.

11
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:42.930
So now how do we put them both together onto one dashboard that when somebody is analyzing he can see

12
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.090
them together.

13
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.970
So to create a dashboard you need to click the second button over here which says new dashboard.

14
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.600
So let's go ahead and do that.

15
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.790
And right away we've got a dashboard one created.

16
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.320
And as you can see it looks a bit different to a worksheet.

17
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.630
It doesn't have dimensions and measures it's rather got the different worksheets that we have in our

18
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.090
tableau workbook and he's got some layout specifications that you can choose like you can add images

19
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.650
you can add web pages text different horizontal vertical layouts.

20
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.710
It's got you can make objects flooring or tiled and got some other width and height parameters so it's

21
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.070
more of a visual kind of representation.

22
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:41.400
We're no longer doing data mining or DA investigation and analysis we are creating a very pretty and

23
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:50.280
powerful tool for somebody to do da investigation using the dashboards that or the worksheets that we've

24
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.670
created.

25
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.330
So let's go ahead and do that now.

26
00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.380
The first thing that we are going to do is we're going to drag our worksheets onto the dashboard.

27
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.970
So let's take the map of Europe and all you do is just just drag it on here.

28
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.770
And right away you can see it's filling up most of the space.

29
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.760
And basically this dashboard is pretty much identical to our map of Europe.

30
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.930
We can roll scroll over different states and we'll show us different information.

31
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.220
Now what we're going to do is we're going to add this caterpillar to this dashboard as well and we're

32
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.090
going to drag it.

33
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.390
And as you can see Tableau is giving you some suggestions of where you want to put it.

34
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.820
So what we're going to do is we're going to put it here underneath our map and there we go.

35
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.410
So tableau has put this dashboard under our map.

36
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.480
Now we obviously don't like these scroll around buttons here because it shouldn't be there.

37
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.340
So what we're going to do is we're going to go to the map and we'll make it a little bit smaller so

38
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:56.130
if you make a map just a bit smaller and you go back to your dashboard you will see that slowly you're

39
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.050
kind of getting rid of those things.

40
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:05.550
So we've still got this vertical one so let's make this smaller and maybe this a bit wider

41
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.490
and maybe one more time.

42
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:21.080
So we've still got both that unlike that then you can just drag it in the dashboard to fix it up to

43
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.030
finally and there we go.

44
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.980
So we've got the map of Europe and the customers can apply both in this dashboard.

45
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.850
So obviously this now we've got to decide on what we want to leave.

46
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:38.550
What we don't want to do the sales kind of size of the bubble.

47
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.200
It doesn't really help us because visually it's very hard to compare this legend to what we actually

48
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.570
see so let's get rid of it.

49
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.120
It's no point in having it.

50
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.600
The profit margin.

51
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.270
Well kind of it's more the red and blue is more to show us kind of positive and negatives we don't really

52
00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:00.520
care about how the different like how they compare that.

53
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.080
This blue is exactly a zero point one nine and this blue is zero point zero nine five.

54
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.350
We won't be able to see that with our eye and same thing here.

55
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.090
It's more of an hysterical thing in this case because we already know that anything below the horizontal

56
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.490
line is actually bad.

57
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:23.280
So in this case the hysterical thing in this case is just so that our eyes are our attention is drawn

58
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.430
towards the red or the blue so we can quickly separate the good versus the bad and versus like the neutral

59
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.770
which are these gray ones.

60
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:36.000
So in reality we don't really need this color legend so let's get rid of it too.

61
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:43.440
Of course we do need a year of ordered date and now what I wanted to show you is how to add this filter

62
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.020
in case it's not there.

63
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.740
So let's let's assume that the filter wasn't there originally.

64
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.390
So yeah.

65
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.070
That's okay.

66
00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:05.260
What happened there was I removed a I removed one of these containers so I'll just put it back.

67
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.020
So yeah that's that's proved another thing that's good too.

68
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:13.320
Good to know you can add these containers so horizontal or vertical and that will help you split up

69
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.690
your dashboard into segments.

70
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:21.260
So in this case I added a vertical container so that now I can put things into the container.

71
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.340
So here we've got two dashboards but we don't have that filter.

72
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.680
How do we add that filtering.

73
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:33.330
Well what we can do is we look at this dropdown for this for the map and here it says quick filters

74
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:41.280
and you can add the filter we had on year of ordered date and same thing.

75
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.950
You could have done it through this way you can go here.

76
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.260
Quick filters and you can just choose a quick filter if you want to add.

77
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.740
So we're just gonna actually close this because it's already created a container for me.

78
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.830
And with this quick filter once again you need to format it.

79
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.220
So just go.

80
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.990
What did we have single value slider.

81
00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.540
And obviously we don't need all so customize show all value take it off.

82
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.680
And then you go so that you have your quick filter and as you can see as as you remember because we

83
00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.800
said for this filter to be applied to all worksheets.

84
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:20.880
So here you go apply two worksheets all using this data source so it's basically the same as what we

85
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.550
said on the map of Europe.

86
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.910
And it's applying it to all the work she's using this data source.

87
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:33.360
So now when you click around you will see that both of these charts or both of these worksheets are

88
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:39.360
being affected by the filter which is good which is consistent which means that we know that in both

89
00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:44.760
cases we're looking at the same year rather than not knowing what year we're looking at in which of

90
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.370
these two worksheets.

91
00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:51.030
So that's how you create your first dashboard.

92
00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:52.860
That's the concept behind it.

93
00:06:52.860 --> 00:07:00.630
So drag and drop kind of style of operating in the next tutorial we will learn how to redo some really

94
00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:01.170
cool stuff.

95
00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:08.520
We will start doing looking at action filters so how to make each of these dashboards clickable so that

96
00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:13.800
they interact with each other some making a dashboard interactive and we'll look at some other cool

97
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.890
stuff as well in the section of the course.

98
00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.310
I'll look forward to seeing you next time.

99
00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.140
And until then happy analyzing.
