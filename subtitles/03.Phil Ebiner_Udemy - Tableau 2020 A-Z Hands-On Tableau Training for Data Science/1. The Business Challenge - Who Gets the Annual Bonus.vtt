Hello this is Kirill,  and welcome back to

2

00:00:07.370  -->  00:00:07.380

3

00:00:07.380  -->  00:00:08.690
the course on Tableau. And

4

00:00:08.690  -->  00:00:08.700

5

00:00:08.700  -->  00:00:10.670
congratulations on completing the first

6

00:00:10.670  -->  00:00:10.680

7

00:00:10.680  -->  00:00:12.410
section of the course and more

8

00:00:12.410  -->  00:00:12.420

9

00:00:12.420  -->  00:00:14.990
importantly on making this step into the

10

00:00:14.990  -->  00:00:15.000

11

00:00:15.000  -->  00:00:17.359
second section. I'm super excited that

12

00:00:17.359  -->  00:00:17.369

13

00:00:17.369  -->  00:00:19.909
you're here and I hope you are as

14

00:00:19.909  -->  00:00:19.919

15

00:00:19.919  -->  00:00:22.159
enthusiastic as I am about the material

16

00:00:22.159  -->  00:00:22.169

17

00:00:22.169  -->  00:00:24.229
that we have ahead of us. In this section,

18

00:00:24.229  -->  00:00:24.239

19

00:00:24.239  -->  00:00:26.659
we have a real business problem a real

20

00:00:26.659  -->  00:00:26.669

21

00:00:26.669  -->  00:00:28.790
challenge ahead of us, and let's have a

22

00:00:28.790  -->  00:00:28.800

23

00:00:28.800  -->  00:00:29.990
look at what it is.

24

00:00:29.990  -->  00:00:30.000

25

00:00:30.000  -->  00:00:32.600
So here's a document that specifies the

26

00:00:32.600  -->  00:00:32.610

27

00:00:32.610  -->  00:00:33.560
challenge.

28

00:00:33.560  -->  00:00:33.570

29

00:00:33.570  -->  00:00:36.290
Let's have a look. It's end of financial

30

00:00:36.290  -->  00:00:36.300

31

00:00:36.300  -->  00:00:38.299
year and that means it's time

32

00:00:38.299  -->  00:00:38.309

33

00:00:38.309  -->  00:00:41.150
for annual bonuses! The store (which we are

34

00:00:41.150  -->  00:00:41.160

35

00:00:41.160  -->  00:00:43.340
looking at) the store operates in three

36

00:00:43.340  -->  00:00:43.350

37

00:00:43.350  -->  00:00:45.349
regions and only the top-performing

38

00:00:45.349  -->  00:00:45.359

39

00:00:45.359  -->  00:00:47.840
employee in each region qualifies for a

40

00:00:47.840  -->  00:00:47.850

41

00:00:47.850  -->  00:00:50.479
bonus. Find out which three employees are

42

00:00:50.479  -->  00:00:50.489

43

00:00:50.489  -->  00:00:53.180
eligible to get a bonus, to get bonuses

44

00:00:53.180  -->  00:00:53.190

45

00:00:53.190  -->  00:00:56.270
for this year. Employees are measured on

46

00:00:56.270  -->  00:00:56.280

47

00:00:56.280  -->  00:00:59.149
the total number of, total value of sales.

48

00:00:59.149  -->  00:00:59.159

49

00:00:59.159  -->  00:01:01.700
And the data as we discussed is

50

00:01:01.700  -->  00:01:01.710

51

00:01:01.710  -->  00:01:06.649
located at this link so here's the

52

00:01:06.649  -->  00:01:06.659

53

00:01:06.659  -->  00:01:08.719
website and you can download the data

54

00:01:08.719  -->  00:01:08.729

55

00:01:08.729  -->  00:01:13.069
here so, just a quick oh word of caution

56

00:01:13.069  -->  00:01:13.079

57

00:01:13.079  -->  00:01:17.030
if you're using can just normal windows

58

00:01:17.030  -->  00:01:17.040

59

00:01:17.040  -->  00:01:20.510
get this first file. If you're using a

60

00:01:20.510  -->  00:01:20.520

61

00:01:20.520  -->  00:01:22.819
Mac get the second file and if for some

62

00:01:22.819  -->  00:01:22.829

63

00:01:22.829  -->  00:01:24.649
reason for whatever reason you will

64

00:01:24.649  -->  00:01:24.659

65

00:01:24.659  -->  00:01:27.950
experience problems with either of these

66

00:01:27.950  -->  00:01:27.960

67

00:01:27.960  -->  00:01:30.740
csv files then just go ahead and

68

00:01:30.740  -->  00:01:30.750

69

00:01:30.750  -->  00:01:33.859
download the third file and proceed as

70

00:01:33.859  -->  00:01:33.869

71

00:01:33.869  -->  00:01:35.330
we did in the previous section within

72

00:01:35.330  -->  00:01:35.340

73

00:01:35.340  -->  00:01:38.120
Excel data source. But do let me know and

74

00:01:38.120  -->  00:01:38.130

75

00:01:38.130  -->  00:01:40.910
I will definitely do everything I can to

76

00:01:40.910  -->  00:01:40.920

77

00:01:40.920  -->  00:01:43.459
help you out to make sure you can you're

78

00:01:43.459  -->  00:01:43.469

79

00:01:43.469  -->  00:01:45.020
able to work with csv files as well

80

00:01:45.020  -->  00:01:45.030

81

00:01:45.030  -->  00:01:48.260
because they are quite common. So, save

82

00:01:48.260  -->  00:01:48.270

83

00:01:48.270  -->  00:01:51.050
link as and I'm going to show to my

84

00:01:51.050  -->  00:01:51.060

85

00:01:51.060  -->  00:01:55.399
Tableau course folder, save. There's the file.

86

00:01:55.399  -->  00:01:55.409

87

00:01:55.409  -->  00:01:58.789
So what is csv file is? It's basically a

88

00:01:58.789  -->  00:01:58.799

89

00:01:58.799  -->  00:02:02.179
text file but it's data separated by

90

00:02:02.179  -->  00:02:02.189

91

00:02:02.189  -->  00:02:03.499
commas and that's why it's called a

92

00:02:03.499  -->  00:02:03.509

93

00:02:03.509  -->  00:02:06.649
comma separated values file that's what

94

00:02:06.649  -->  00:02:06.659

95

00:02:06.659  -->  00:02:07.940
CSV stands for.

96

00:02:07.940  -->  00:02:07.950

97

00:02:07.950  -->  00:02:10.340
So let's open that up and have a look. Ok

98

00:02:10.340  -->  00:02:10.350

99

00:02:10.350  -->  00:02:14.030
so this file contains once again

100

00:02:14.030  -->  00:02:14.040

101

00:02:14.040  -->  00:02:15.559
transactions

102

00:02:15.559  -->  00:02:15.569

103

00:02:15.569  -->  00:02:18.259
and split by region. It's got the

104

00:02:18.259  -->  00:02:18.269

105

00:02:18.269  -->  00:02:20.119
representative name so the person who

106

00:02:20.119  -->  00:02:20.129

107

00:02:20.129  -->  00:02:22.849
conducted that transaction what he sold

108

00:02:22.849  -->  00:02:22.859

109

00:02:22.859  -->  00:02:25.339
so this is a stationary shop and office

110

00:02:25.339  -->  00:02:25.349

111

00:02:25.349  -->  00:02:28.099
supplies shop so they sell pens, binders

112

00:02:28.099  -->  00:02:28.109

113

00:02:28.109  -->  00:02:31.429
desks sometimes and the number of units

114

00:02:31.429  -->  00:02:31.439

115

00:02:31.439  -->  00:02:34.640
that were sold and the unit price. So

116

00:02:34.640  -->  00:02:34.650

117

00:02:34.650  -->  00:02:37.940
this is a much smaller file only 44 rows

118

00:02:37.940  -->  00:02:37.950

119

00:02:37.950  -->  00:02:40.190
including the header. So it is a very basic

120

00:02:40.190  -->  00:02:40.200

121

00:02:40.200  -->  00:02:44.659
sample file and but it's good it's good

122

00:02:44.659  -->  00:02:44.669

123

00:02:44.669  -->  00:02:46.429
to start with this because it will help

124

00:02:46.429  -->  00:02:46.439

125

00:02:46.439  -->  00:02:48.649
us understand exactly how Tableau works.

126

00:02:48.649  -->  00:02:48.659

127

00:02:48.659  -->  00:02:51.500
And moreover if you do have anything

128

00:02:51.500  -->  00:02:51.510

129

00:02:51.510  -->  00:02:53.089
that you're curious about you can always

130

00:02:53.089  -->  00:02:53.099

131

00:02:53.099  -->  00:02:55.099
come back into the file and have a look

132

00:02:55.099  -->  00:02:55.109

133

00:02:55.109  -->  00:02:57.649
for yourself and even just filter out

134

00:02:57.649  -->  00:02:57.659

135

00:02:57.659  -->  00:02:59.750
that information that you're looking at

136

00:02:59.750  -->  00:02:59.760

137

00:02:59.760  -->  00:03:01.789
in Tableau and just compare. It's a very

138

00:03:01.789  -->  00:03:01.799

139

00:03:01.799  -->  00:03:04.550
good very small very good file to start

140

00:03:04.550  -->  00:03:04.560

141

00:03:04.560  -->  00:03:06.800
exploring Tableau with. That's exactly

142

00:03:06.800  -->  00:03:06.810

143

00:03:06.810  -->  00:03:08.360
what we're going to do. So in this

144

00:03:08.360  -->  00:03:08.370

145

00:03:08.370  -->  00:03:09.890
section we've got quite a lot of ahead

146

00:03:09.890  -->  00:03:09.900

147

00:03:09.900  -->  00:03:10.729
of us.

148

00:03:10.729  -->  00:03:10.739

149

00:03:10.739  -->  00:03:12.890
We're going to be looking at awesome

150

00:03:12.890  -->  00:03:12.900

151

00:03:12.900  -->  00:03:15.589
things like creating on calculated

152

00:03:15.589  -->  00:03:15.599

153

00:03:15.599  -->  00:03:18.110
fields, we'll be working with colors, we'll

154

00:03:18.110  -->  00:03:18.120

155

00:03:18.120  -->  00:03:21.199
be adding labels, we'll be formatting our

156

00:03:21.199  -->  00:03:21.209

157

00:03:21.209  -->  00:03:25.399
chart, exporting our worksheets and all

158

00:03:25.399  -->  00:03:25.409

159

00:03:25.409  -->  00:03:26.420
the basics.

160

00:03:26.420  -->  00:03:26.430

161

00:03:26.430  -->  00:03:27.439
We're going to cover them in this

162

00:03:27.439  -->  00:03:27.449

163

00:03:27.449  -->  00:03:29.149
section and that will create a great

164

00:03:29.149  -->  00:03:29.159

165

00:03:29.159  -->  00:03:31.789
foundation for us going forward, so we'll

166

00:03:31.789  -->  00:03:31.799

167

00:03:31.799  -->  00:03:34.099
get started in the next tutorial and I

168

00:03:34.099  -->  00:03:34.109

169

00:03:34.109  -->  00:03:35.360
look forward to you then

170

00:03:35.360  -->  00:03:35.370

171

00:03:35.370  -->  00:03:42.169
until next time happy analyzing.
