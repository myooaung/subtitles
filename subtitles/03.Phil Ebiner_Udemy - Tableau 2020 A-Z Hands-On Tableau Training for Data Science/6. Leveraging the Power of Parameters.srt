00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,480
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tablo.

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:12,150
In the previous tutorial, we finished off with this beautiful distribution of our customers by age,

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:18,740
and today we're going to create an identical distribution, but it will be of our customers by balance.

4
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:24,810
So if you would like to perform an additional exercise and test your skills, then you can pause this

5
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:30,840
tutorial right now and create a distribution for the customers by balance and then play the tutorial

6
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,750
and compare and see how I did it and how you did it and see what the differences were and if you got

7
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,410
the same result.

8
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,740
So now we're going to proceed to creating this distribution.

9
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,390
And the process is exactly the same as we did with this distribution by age.

10
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:46,710
So let's go ahead and do that.

11
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,450
I'm going to create a new tab.

12
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,840
I'm going to call it distribution by balance.

13
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,410
By balance.

14
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:02,520
OK, and now, as last time for us, we're going to create a bean balance, create beans.

15
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,750
We'll make them 10000 units of currency beans.

16
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,970
And now we will take the balance.

17
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,430
Been a variable, drag it into columns.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,640
We will take number of records and tarots.

19
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,400
There's our distribution now.

20
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,040
We will take some number of records, control, hold control and drag it into color.

21
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,660
There it is.

22
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,620
So maybe we can record a bit smaller.

23
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,360
That's good.

24
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,620
Now we will change, we will get rid of this header.

25
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:38,190
We will change our first of all, we will change, of course, rule change, uh, correctible calculation

26
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,680
will change us two percent of total.

27
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:48,570
And here we will also change it to percent or basically we'll just take this one and we'll drag it into

28
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:48,960
color.

29
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,880
Doesn't change the color.

30
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:57,840
But just for consistency, one rule here, what that means is that there is no values in the one hundred

31
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,560
and fifty.

32
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,770
So I'm just going to rotate these labels in the one hundred and fifty thousand.

33
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,220
There's no values and you can filter data and exclude that.

34
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,490
No, but I prefer to keep it.

35
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,480
So I'm just going to press control that and to remove this indicator from here which is right.

36
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,370
Click it and click hide indicator.

37
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:19,410
OK, so that's our chart and now we're going to quickly format it.

38
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,640
So I'll change the axis here.

39
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,140
Total percent of customers

40
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,670
and now we will format.

41
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,730
Here, the whole chart boult.

42
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:42,510
OK, so that's our chart, maybe make some more space so that the, uh, columns or the names of the

43
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,500
columns fit in.

44
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,030
And now what we want to do is we want to learn how to work with parameters.

45
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,350
So at this stage, we haven't touched on parameters yet.

46
00:02:52,350 --> 00:03:00,060
But it is time for us to learn how to leverage the true power of this tool in Tableau and use it to

47
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,550
our advantage in this dashboard.

48
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,250
So well, how can we use parameters here and what are they?

49
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,060
Well, imagine that you want to dynamically adjust this visualisation.

50
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,510
Let's say, for instance, you want to be able to change the size of the bins.

51
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:18,350
Like right now you're not happy with 10000 units of currency per bin and you want to change it.

52
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,820
Well, you need to go to balance beam, right?

53
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,050
Click it, click, edit.

54
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:27,990
And you have to change this to five thousand if you want five thousand or twenty thousand or whatever

55
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,380
you want.

56
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:34,140
And every time doing that can be a bit tedious, and especially in data exploration and data discovery.

57
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,460
You need to be agile.

58
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:40,170
You need to be able to quickly adjust these things because, um, that can help you find anomalies.

59
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,910
So for instance, here, it's a gradual drop off, but when you change it to five thousand orbits,

60
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,760
you can see this spike and it's quite anomalous.

61
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,800
And you might want to understand what exactly is going on there.

62
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:57,480
So whereas you couldn't have known, you wouldn't have seen it from this chart and how quickly you can

63
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,600
adjust the size of the bins determines how many how much insights you can produce.

64
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:08,040
So we will create a parameter which will allow us to adjust these the size of these bins.

65
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:15,180
Very quickly, I'm going to right click and measures and here I will see create a parameter, the parameter

66
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:15,780
we'll call it.

67
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:25,410
Let's call it balance balance groups because we're working off balance and it'll be an integer parameter

68
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:31,830
and we will start off with uh ten thousand and we'll be working for a range.

69
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,260
So the minimum value of the parameter, let's say there's no not much point going below five thousand

70
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,630
dollar buckets or five thousand dollar bins.

71
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,800
The maximum.

72
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,000
Well twenty five thousand.

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,200
Sounds like a lot already.

74
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,900
And the step size can be five thousand as well.

75
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,140
So we've created a parameter.

76
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,870
Now we're right.

77
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:54,010
Click the parameter and we click show parameter control and it appears over here.

78
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,410
So now you can just change the parameter and.

79
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:03,210
Well right now nothing's happening, of course, of the chart and that's because we haven't linked the

80
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:07,170
parameter to our, uh, balance bins.

81
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,700
So let's go ahead and do that.

82
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:14,910
We're going to click edit and here the size of bins, it conveniently prompts you to select a parameter

83
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:15,930
when you click the dropdown.

84
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,120
And we really have a parameters balanced group.

85
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,120
So it's like that click OK.

86
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:27,540
And now if we change the perimeter around, you can see that the size of the bins is changing and therefore

87
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,300
the number of the columns is changing.

88
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:38,640
So you can see here that now I can very quickly dynamically adjust this chart and get to the insights

89
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,600
that I want.

90
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,760
And that is a lot of power.

91
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,400
That's not the only usage of parameters.

92
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:50,970
And now that you know that you have this option to create parameters which you can quickly adjust and

93
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:58,170
use to have more control over your worksheet, you will naturally come up with other ways to use them

94
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,600
as you create more visualizations.

95
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,480
But this is one of the good use cases.

96
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,280
So let's now go to distribution by age and do the same thing.

97
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:12,410
We'll create a parameter here and we will call it age groups.

98
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,140
These parameters, it's going to be an integer.

99
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,100
So a whole number.

100
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:21,120
This time we want a list of values rather than a range we want to list.

101
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,720
Let's say we want the only three types of values one, five and ten click.

102
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,900
OK, and now we have a parameter age groups.

103
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,320
We will, uh, show parameter control here.

104
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:41,340
Also, we want it to be a slider and of course, we want to connect it to our chart.

105
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,610
So let's go right click edit HPN.

106
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:51,600
And instead of this fixed value or for the size of bins, we to create each select age groups once we've

107
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,380
selected that.

108
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:58,950
Um, well here you can see it's a bit, it's extended outside quite a lot, but that doesn't really

109
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,710
matter because in the dashboard that won't be the case.

110
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:10,590
But we can always um if we want to reduce the size of this, uh, this is a worksheet even here if we

111
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:11,100
wanted to.

112
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:15,380
But let's have a look at what happens when we change the size of the bin.

113
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:20,610
So if we click to the right now, the size of the bin is five years and the size of the business ten

114
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:20,850
years.

115
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:25,400
And you can see that the chart is adjusting as we do that.

116
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,930
So that is the power of parameters.

117
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,720
Have a play around with that and.

118
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:37,880
See how they think of other cases where you might be able to use parameters in your work with Tablo,

119
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,750
and I look forward to seeing you next time.

120
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,490
And until then, happy idolising.
