00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.810
Hello and welcome back to the courtroom tableau.

2
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.160
And today we will be looking at the data set for this section of the course.

3
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.990
So let's get straight to it.

4
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.510
We're going to need a browser.

5
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:26.000
And here we're going to go to Super loops data science dot com slash Tableau and now we're going to

6
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.660
scroll down find Section 3.

7
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.620
So we're looking at time series aggregation and filters.

8
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.260
Interesting.

9
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.610
OK.

10
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.350
So long term unemployment statistics.

11
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.440
That's right click save link as.

12
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:44.320
As we usually do into our folder I'm going to bring that folder up tableau course.

13
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:45.170
There it is.

14
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.840
Long term unemployed statistics and let's open up and have a look.

15
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:59.330
And once again if if you are if you don't have Microsoft Excel then feel free to install Open Office.

16
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.340
It's a free piece of software which works on both Windows and Mac and you'll be able to view these files

17
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.070
there.

18
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.530
OK.

19
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.620
So as you can see the format of the file is very different too.

20
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.600
I'm just gonna zoom in a bit to what we saw in the previous section.

21
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:24.690
So here we have a lot of like duplicate records in each or in many of the columns.

22
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.110
So for instance the period here for the period is repeated.

23
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.140
So here we've got January many times and we've got February many times March many times then we've got

24
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.060
the gender.

25
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.230
So for January we've got six as those seven.

26
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.840
One two three four five six seven rows of four men and seven roles for women and then the same thing

27
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:56.390
happens for February 7 and 7 and so on and then for men we have the split into the age group 16 to 19

28
00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:03.230
20 24 and so on and all the way up to 65 years and over and then for each one of these rows we've got

29
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.130
and a number of unemployed people.

30
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.340
So in that age group of that gender in that period of time.

31
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:19.680
So this is a very non-human like way to structure data.

32
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:28.190
It's not something that's like you would expect to see if you are given a list a a an Excel spreadsheet

33
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.210
to just look at.

34
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:36.190
It's not how you taken information very quickly and efficiently.

35
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.050
So what humans are more used to is looks a bit different.

36
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.250
And it wouldn't have all these duplicate records it would look this is kind of a pivoted view.

37
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.090
We as humans we're more used to unpolluted view and I've got an example of that which I'm just going

38
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.730
to bring up now so that we can compare.

39
00:02:52.730 --> 00:03:02.470
So tell me if this looks a bit better so here you can see age so the groups the age groups and then

40
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.710
you've got the year and then you've got men and women.

41
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.870
So if you need to look something up you're going to quickly.

42
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:08.170
OK.

43
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.290
So if I need March 2005 men in the age 40 45.

44
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.580
So March 2005 men age 40 25 they're there.

45
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:27.040
So as easy as that and it's kind of more natural for people to look at this but for machines for computers

46
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:34.900
it's more natural to look at this because they know exactly where to find everything and it's just faster

47
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.750
and it's just more of a machine format.

48
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:44.410
So this data is already structured in this format which is going to be easy to import into tableau so

49
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.430
this is easy.

50
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:51.310
This is going to be it would be much harder to import into tableau but don't worry we are not going

51
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.580
to focus on that right now we will talk about structuring and preparing your data in a separate section

52
00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:58.210
of these courses.

53
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.470
It's a massive topic and we're going to devote a whole section to it.

54
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.450
So we'll do that further down in this course.

55
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.010
But for now let's just work with this dataset that we have here which is our unemployment data.

56
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.530
So we've downloaded that.

57
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.760
Let's close these spreadsheets.

58
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.530
Let's open up tableau.

59
00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.150
There we go.

60
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:21.150
And here you can see our previous two workbooks that we worked on.

61
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.920
So let's connect to our data source.

62
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.860
Let's go to excel.

63
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:31.680
Long term unemployment statistics open up and there we go so it's in Sheet 1.

64
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.230
And there's our preview of our data looks good.

65
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.790
What we're going to do now is we're just going to go toe work book.

66
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.650
So we've actually connected to the data.

67
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:42.880
There it is.

68
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.880
However now I will show you one more thing.

69
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.650
A new a new element to working of data and that is working with extracts.

70
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:58.050
So you see this button here you can actually connect to this data but extract it right away.

71
00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.850
So also you can do that while you're in the world you can.

72
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.040
You can do it from the worksheet and we're going to do that.

73
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:10.540
So move back to your worksheet without you know doing any kind of creating a dashboards just right click

74
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.590
on the data and go to extract data.

75
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:21.730
And so what this does is it creates an extract for Tableau to work from.

76
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:28.270
So basically instead of connecting live to data the data is going to be extracted into a separate file

77
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.010
and then is going to be kept there.

78
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:35.500
So we're going to click extract and here you can choose where to save this file going to save it in

79
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:41.570
the same folder click save and now you can see that the icon has changed.

80
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.140
It's got this little arrow.

81
00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.320
And if you right click it says use extract.

82
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:54.420
Now if we go to the folder which is here you can see that there's a new file that has been created.

83
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.530
Sheet one long term unemployment statistics.

84
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.590
So this is the extract.

85
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.530
So our data from here is now being kept in here.

86
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:10.280
So this is like a copy of the data and you can if you open up you won't see anything basically because

87
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:16.070
it's a tableau table for formats that keeps it in some way.

88
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:22.460
So what happens now is if you change anything in this file in the file that we originally connected

89
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.090
to then nothing will change in your work week.

90
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.560
So if you change the data you will still have the old data in your extract.

91
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:35.700
So it might be a good thing might be a bad thing if you don't want your data to change after you've

92
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.240
connected for the first time.

93
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:38.370
That's a good thing.

94
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:43.110
If you want to keep your data updated to the original data source which doesn't have to be an Excel

95
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:49.620
spreadsheet could be a database it could be a CSP file could be anything and then you can do that as

96
00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:56.220
well so you go to Tableau and right click here you click extract and you refresh and then here it gives

97
00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.570
you a question.

98
00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.490
You say yes and your data is refreshed.

99
00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.590
So why would you use extract.

100
00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:02.680
Well it's quite simple.

101
00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.420
We're still working with small data sets.

102
00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:12.360
But when you start working with big data sets or dynamic data sets that often change using the live

103
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.820
connection might be slow and it might not be reliable it might.

104
00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.740
It might be constantly changing might be hard to work with.

105
00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.690
So that's when you create an extract.

106
00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:26.730
You do your work and then you decide whether you need to return to the live connection or keep working

107
00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:27.630
for extract.

108
00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:33.180
And if you want to return to life connection you can always do that just right click and uncheck use

109
00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:38.340
extract and then right away you can see now we're using the normal connection again and that's how you

110
00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:39.810
work with extracts and tableau.

111
00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:46.020
So for us in this particular example doesn't matter we're just going to keep using the extract because

112
00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.040
our data is not going to be changing.

113
00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:54.000
We don't really mind what we're going to be using going forward in this tutorial and that's all for

114
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:54.430
today.

115
00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:59.550
I'll look forward to seeing you next time when we will be looking at working with time series Until

116
00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:01.200
then happy analyzing.
