00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,250
Hello this is Carol.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,580
And welcome back to the course and tabla.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:15,950
And in today's tutorial we will learn how to export our worksheets as images for other files.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,370
All right.

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:21,010
So we've got this beautiful report that's ready to go.

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:31,230
How do we put it into a document like a PowerPoint or a word document and so on.

7
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,990
So one way is to take a snapshot and I knew a friend of mine.

8
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:42,270
He didn't know how to export and he kept taking snapshots we just take like a print screen of this report

9
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,080
and then you stick it into your file.

10
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,270
Well that's not the proper way to do it.

11
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,430
There's definitely a way to export files directly from tableau.

12
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,930
And today we're going to learn how.

13
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,590
So right away.

14
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,610
This is a worksheet as we discussed.

15
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:05,690
So if you go into worksheet and you go to export your image you can copy the image.

16
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,590
So I'm just gonna close that because there's no way another way of doing it a bit faster.

17
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,200
You don't have to move your mouse all the way out there.

18
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,540
This is one of those tips and tricks.

19
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,960
So if you right click and you go copy you go image you get the same menu.

20
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,710
So there's there's two ways to export.

21
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:31,710
So we all we need right now is the view the title and the college and so we don't need the caption because

22
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,840
we don't actually have a caption We haven't created one for this chart.

23
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,930
We'll talk about captions further in the course there they're pretty easy.

24
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,170
So we'll take caption art and we'll talk about this menu in a second as well.

25
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,720
So we'll just copy.

26
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:56,880
Now let's bring up the document so let's say I want to export this image into a Word document.

27
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,740
So here I've got a Word document prepared.

28
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:02,310
The annual bonus report and I want to put the image in here.

29
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,270
So what you need to do is obviously control B.

30
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,100
Or just right click and paste.

31
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,130
And there you go.

32
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:11,850
So there's your image here.

33
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,630
So that's the image it blends and renewal.

34
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:18,270
But what do we see about this image that is all right away.

35
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:18,990
Not good.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,820
Wrong.

37
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,910
Well we see this name over here.

38
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,590
So what went wrong.

39
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,020
Why.

40
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,750
Where did it come from.

41
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,420
Let's go back to Tableau and find out if I click on Tableau.

42
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,400
You can see that there is no name here but sheet one.

43
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,060
Sounds familiar doesn't it.

44
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,930
That's the name of the tab here.

45
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:40,200
So that we remember when we exported the image.

46
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:48,730
So if we go to right click and then when we go to copy image here it says title and title is actually

47
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,110
the name of the tab.

48
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,680
So you either have to click title or just change the name of the tab.

49
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,030
And so let's do that.

50
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,940
So I'll go to the name of the sheet.

51
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:04,090
I'm going to call it the annual bonus

52
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:13,350
analysis and now I want to see it here as well.

53
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:22,030
So I'll go to worksheet and I'll click show title so here now I can see the annual bonus analysis name.

54
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,900
And that also gives me the power to change and format it.

55
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:31,200
So if I click here and I click format title as you remember our formatting pane pops up in the left

56
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,980
and I can actually do that.

57
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,200
Sorry this doesn't allow you to change the size of the text.

58
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:42,350
So we're going to have to work on this a bit.

59
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:47,200
You need to double click on the title to be able to format the size of the text.

60
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:53,340
In this case it's 12 it's bold so it's it's all right it's the same as the rest that we have here.

61
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,350
So just if you do need to change the format that's how you do it.

62
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,220
So just click that.

63
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:10,020
And now we can right click copy image um view title Cole legend copy.

64
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,450
Now let's go back to our document.

65
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,830
Delete that and paste in our report.

66
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:22,740
OK so here now you can see annual bonus Report analysis at the top.

67
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,730
And that's good.

68
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,800
So that's pretty much ready ready to go.

69
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,220
You add some text for the executives and it's ready to be presented.

70
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,800
The only thing is if you want a bit more space social on this chart to be a bit bigger than you want

71
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,880
region at the bottom.

72
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,090
And that where your chart can expand to the right and that's where we'll try to now.

73
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:46,470
So we'll right click right click copy image and color legend.

74
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,960
So but here we'll put the college in at the bottom.

75
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,350
We'll choose that one.

76
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:53,670
Go back here and paste.

77
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:58,550
And as you can see the college is at the bottom and the chart has a bit more space.

78
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,500
So that's the other way you can do that.

79
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,290
So that's pretty much done.

80
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,170
And so that sums it up for us for today.

81
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,650
I just wanted to tell you that we still haven't saved our workbook.

82
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:19,250
So make sure you do so you go to file save as and obviously you know for this workbook Section 1.

83
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,770
Just make sure you keep it saved because tableau doesn't actually order save your work and you want

84
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:30,560
to keep it for yourself for the future and that is it for this section.

85
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:37,730
I hope you enjoyed it very easy introduction to tableau that was an easy dataset but it did help us

86
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:40,490
get our head around a lot of things.

87
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:49,250
And we talked about navigating tableau creating First calculate field adding colors labels doing formatting.

88
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,390
So all of that together that's our base.

89
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,310
We're going to take that forward in the course.

90
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:59,290
But before you do proceed with the next lecture Do not forget to do the quiz.

91
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,620
It's right under this one.

92
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:06,950
It will help you make sure that you've covered everything that we talked about in the section.

93
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,540
I'll look forward to seeing you in the next section.

94
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,730
And until next time be analyzing.
