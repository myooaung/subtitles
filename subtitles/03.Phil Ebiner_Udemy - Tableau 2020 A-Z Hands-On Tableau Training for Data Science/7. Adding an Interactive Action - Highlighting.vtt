00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.830
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tableau.

2
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.430
In the previous editorial we looked at action filters in dashboards.

3
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.340
And today we will look at how we can apply highlighting to dashboards.

4
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.060
And also we will discuss why highlighting is actually different to filtering.

5
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.380
So let's get straight to it.

6
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.900
Here we've got the dashboard that we're using lost time and still we've got the filter on the action

7
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.070
filter is still applied.

8
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:36.530
So when we click on different states as you can see the scatter plot is adjusting automatically to to

9
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:42.160
just show the customers that reside in that specific state.

10
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.690
So now what we will do is we will go to dashboard actions and we will remove this action that we created.

11
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.370
So we just click remove.

12
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.870
OK.

13
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.900
And now if we select the different states nothing happens to this catapult.

14
00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.810
No the goal today is we want is sort of filtering this scatter plot.

15
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.800
We actually want to see the customers highlighted.

16
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.460
So we want all of the dots to remain but only the relevant dots to stand out so that we know how they

17
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.910
compare to the rest of the customers on this caterpillar.

18
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:22.380
And so the first thing that you might want to do is you go to dashboard actions and you go to add action

19
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:29.340
and you click highlight and here naturally you select map of Europe select and the target sheets are

20
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.490
customers kind of world map of Europe and pretty much the same thing as we did with our filtering.

21
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.580
You click OK you click OK and then you click on a state and nothing happens and you go for another state

22
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.050
nothing happened and so on.

23
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.630
So how come did filtering work but highlighting doesn't work.

24
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.570
What is the difference.

25
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:58.170
And this is an important point which a lot of people kind of don't will disregard.

26
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.950
Basically they don't see the difference and therefore sometimes can fall into this trap assuming that

27
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.950
highlighting works just as filtering but it doesn't filter the worksheet it actually just highlights

28
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.760
the values.

29
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.040
In reality it's not as simple as that.

30
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:22.800
There is one main difference between the two and that is that filtering actually filters your data set

31
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.320
and therefore allows you to reconstruct the scatter plot.

32
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:34.470
So when I have filtering on and I select this state what happens in the background is tableau selects

33
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:42.630
all the rows of the data that are relevant to this state in France which is Il de France.

34
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.560
And it only leaves them and then it removes all the rest of the rows in our data set that have nothing

35
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.060
to do feel de France.

36
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:58.590
And so then the caterpillar is only working with the IL defraud star rose and it is able to create a

37
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.780
scatter plot based on that information.

38
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.660
Now what happens with highlighting is that the data set is actually not filtered so that process is

39
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:13.440
not running in the background you're not deleting any or temporary deleting any rows from the dataset

40
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.250
which you're asking dashboard to do is plot everything.

41
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.750
And at the same time highlight the customers that are relevant or related to IL de France.

42
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.770
And that is where the problem occurs and why is that.

43
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:32.880
Well that is because some of our customers in our dataset are actually from many different regions.

44
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:40.680
So there are customers that are ordering products both in France and in the U.K. and so on.

45
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:49.560
So one customer in this particular dataset is not attached to one particular state or even country.

46
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:57.780
If you look through the data you will find cases when customers are in different states countries and

47
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.100
even cities states and even countries.

48
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.400
So let's have a look at that quickly so here's our data set.

49
00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:11.890
Let's quickly add a filter so data filter and order the data by the customer name.

50
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.490
So here you can see that right away.

51
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:20.510
Aaron for instance has ordered from Italy from the U.K. from Germany from Netherlands from France.

52
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:26.870
And then let's say Adam here has ordered from Italy U.K. France and so on.

53
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.290
So there are multiple customers that have ordered from multiple different regions.

54
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.650
And that is what is confusing our highlighting.

55
00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:43.580
So when we ask the dashboard to highlight everybody who has ordered from France it cannot just highlight

56
00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:51.350
for instance if we go look at Aaron should should tableau highlight Aaron or should tableau not highlight

57
00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.800
Aaron.

58
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.450
He has ordered from France.

59
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.600
But in that case if tableau does highlight Aaron in this in the scatter plot what will happen is that

60
00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.480
we will see his total profits.

61
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.940
So here you can see that we've got profits listed sales and the profit margin.

62
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.940
This is Max literally.

63
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.050
But for Aaron it'll be the same thing.

64
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:16.430
What will happen is we will see the profit the sales and the profit margin for his all of his orders

65
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.380
that he did from all the regions.

66
00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.030
And that is because once again our data is not going to be filtered.

67
00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.030
So the rose not relevant to IL de France I'm not going to be removed from the data.

68
00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.300
There's still going to be in this caterpillar and that is confusing tableau.

69
00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:35.650
So how can we highlight Aaron with his two French orders or maybe.

70
00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.820
Yeah there's two.

71
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.150
So this is Aaron and he's made two orders from France.

72
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.760
But at the same time he has had a lot of orders from other places.

73
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.830
So if we highlight him then we will be giving the user the wrong information we will be telling him

74
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.880
that Aaron's made this many orders altogether.

75
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.290
But in reality only two of them are from France.

76
00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:02.360
So that and that's why tableau chooses not to highlight Aaron at all in order not to mislead the user.

77
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:08.840
So what we can do in this case is we can actually change the granularity or scatter plot in order to

78
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.530
include the state.

79
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:15.230
And that way tableau will be able to easily operate at that level.

80
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.310
So let's go to the customer scatter plot.

81
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:23.660
You can simply go to the worksheet here or you can click this button over here which is go to worksheet

82
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.530
or you can click this button over here which also says go to a worksheet.

83
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:33.650
So once we're at the worksheet for the customer scatter plot what we're going to do is we're going to

84
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:39.490
change the granularity of the data right now if you look at the bottom there's six hundred and 617 marks.

85
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.460
Now what we're going to add is the state.

86
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:49.310
So we'll just drag state into detail and right away you can see there's more marks in fact if we go

87
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:55.760
down here now there is one thousand and sixty seven marks and that is because customers can be duplicated

88
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.960
here if they are present in multiple states.

89
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:07.220
So now where we go back to the dashboard we can see that once again there's more data here but also

90
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.320
when we click.

91
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:15.830
You can see that tableau is easily highlighting the right data points here because it knows that it

92
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:22.880
needs to highlight all of the customers that purchased from this region or that made their orders from

93
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.760
this region.

94
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:30.430
And if they are customers that had orders from multiple regions it will only take those data points

95
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.880
are relevant for those customers for these regions.

96
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.810
And so now Tableau is doing a great job in highlighting.

97
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:43.040
If we go to dashboard and we go to actions highlight and we click edit you will see here that you can

98
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:48.710
actually select the target highlighting and you can select a different field.

99
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:53.520
So in this case we want to know what what is happening is Tableau is highlighting by state.

100
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:59.330
So if we click OK that will basically be the same result as what we saw just now.

101
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:08.120
Probably one more thing is that you can adjust this highlighting so you can specify the rules here so

102
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.170
you can say don't Hello by state by highlight by country.

103
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:16.580
And that way wherever you click in the country it will be highlighting the same customers that once

104
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:22.460
again is misleading because you're kind of the user is thinking that is highlighting the tables highlighting

105
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:29.170
the specific state although the states are all highlighted on this part of the map.

106
00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:32.500
But I would probably stay away from that.

107
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:36.050
Just you do have that level of control in my case.

108
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:38.720
I'm just gonna keep it all fields.

109
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.410
So there you go.

110
00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:43.910
That's how highlighting works and that's how it is different to actions.

111
00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:45.910
I mean two filters in tableau.

112
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:47.340
Action filters and tableau.

113
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:54.500
So be careful of that action filters just to recap action filters work at the data level they filter

114
00:08:54.500 --> 00:09:01.460
out the data and then that data is supplied to the rest of the worksheets in your talent in your tableau

115
00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:06.050
dashboard whereas filters are highlighting they don't.

116
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:12.960
Highlighting does not take rose out of the data and therefore it is still working the whole dataset.

117
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:19.240
And so you have to be careful of the level of granularity of your different worksheets in your dashboard.

118
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:20.220
So there you go.

119
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:24.120
That is how highlighting works in tableau.

120
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.290
I look forward to see you next time.

121
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:27.120
And until then happy analyzing.
