1
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,770
Well this is Carol from super dollar signs dot com.

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,020
And welcome back to the courts and tableau.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,960
So what's up of the times we ask.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:16,050
Well the thing is that I'm super excited about you taking this course.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:22,380
In fact I am so excited that I really really want you to get to the end and get the maximum value out

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,290
of this course and learn how to use Tableau like a pro.

7
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:31,530
And so therefore I've challenged myself to get you enthusiastic about this course in under five minutes.

8
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,430
And that's exactly what we're going to do today.

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,220
And I'll just give you a quick overview.

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:41,670
We're going to look at a massive dataset and I will show you what you can do using the power of Tableau

11
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,150
in a very very short limiter of time.

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,290
And I hope you that'll get you excited.

13
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,090
All right let's get started.

14
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,470
First of all we'll need a browser I'm going to use Chrome.

15
00:00:51,530 --> 00:01:00,620
And at the top just type in this in the address bar you need to go to super data science dot com slash

16
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,590
tableau.

17
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:05,020
And that's where all the data sets for this course are located.

18
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,680
And here you can get the one for today.

19
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,410
It's called the superstore us.

20
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:09,680
So just download that.

21
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:13,820
I'm going to save that into my tableau course folder.

22
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:14,690
That's good.

23
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:19,080
And let's bring up that folder so there is the dataset.

24
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,980
We don't need the browser anymore and we still have three minutes 45 seconds.

25
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,840
Let's open the data set and have a look.

26
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:33,080
So what this dataset represents is a list of transactions for a store for 2015 from the start of the

27
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,610
year until analysis for the first half of 2015.

28
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:42,520
And here you can see every single transaction the store has made for this year.

29
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,440
Aaron's average transaction is represented by a row here.

30
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:53,120
So for instance the row I.D. tells you the number of the transaction the discount unit price shipping

31
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,400
cost customarily a lot a lot of information.

32
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:00,470
And at the end here it's got the profit for this specific transaction.

33
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:04,750
So here for instance it's 4000 miles or minus fifty three dollars.

34
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:10,790
And it's also broken down in by column it says this is all United States and regions state or province

35
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:11,540
city.

36
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,600
And if you look at this dataset it's actually quite massive.

37
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,470
Is got one thousand nine hundred fifty three euros.

38
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:24,830
And the question has been asked is Can you quickly tell us what are the most profitable and the least

39
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:31,730
profitable states according to this data set and also plots a map right now create a map that will show

40
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,620
us very quickly how the states are performing and you have to do that in a very limited time in fact

41
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,970
in under two and a half minutes.

42
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,560
So let's get straight at it.

43
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,690
This is going to close the excel spreadsheet here close this folder and now I'm going to open Tableau

44
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,400
and we'll see how quickly we can do this.

45
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,640
Two minutes left continue.

46
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:49,900
OK.

47
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,530
So just follow my steps.

48
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:58,400
I won't explain every single step but through this course you will learn all of this and even more so

49
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:03,830
now we're going to connect to our data source over here on the left click Excel find your data set double

50
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,510
click on it it's opened up now.

51
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:12,260
Now on the left choose the orders tab and drag it into this white space and right away you can see a

52
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,190
preview of the spreadsheet appear in front of you.

53
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,010
Next click this orange button here which says sheet one.

54
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:21,130
And here you've got to Tableau workspace which right now is empty.

55
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,340
We need to put some stuff in here.

56
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,230
How much time.

57
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,550
One minute forty seconds okay.

58
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,850
Let's do this.

59
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:26,210
All right.

60
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:30,020
So what we're going to do is we're going to find country and we're going to drag it in the middle of

61
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,400
this whitespace here.

62
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,080
Oh look and map here while Tableau is quite smart.

63
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:41,040
Okay so now we're going to look for state or province and we are also going to drag it onto the map.

64
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,750
Oh well look at all these dots appeared in the different states of the US.

65
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,470
Okay.

66
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,540
So what are we going to do now.

67
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:51,140
We're going to take profit because we were asked about profitability and we're going to drag it onto

68
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,080
color.

69
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,600
And next we're going to take profit arrogant dragon also onto label.

70
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,650
Now we're going to click label and we're going to click the font and we're going to change the font

71
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:01,570
size to 12.

72
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,880
And that's it.

73
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,190
How much time do we have.

74
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,400
We have 58 seconds so that was all under four minutes.

75
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,740
And what we can we see here we can see that right away just by looking at this map.

76
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,110
It's so intuitive.

77
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:18,450
We didn't even have to specify any colors or anything.

78
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,240
Right away we can see the least profitable state that will the most losses that were incurred in North

79
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,380
Carolina Carolina.

80
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:29,810
And the most profitable state is California right away.

81
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,550
You can tell those things and also you can even give more insights according to the map.

82
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:40,040
These Southern states are not doing that well in this region except for maybe Georgia and the northern

83
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:46,700
states and over here in the western state of Western states are doing better except for Montana and

84
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,130
all of that was done in under five minutes.

85
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:54,950
Hope you're super pumped super excited we will learn all of this in this course and much much more and

86
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:58,760
you will definitely have fun through the way I look forward to seeing you in the next session.

87
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,920
And until next time happy analyzing.
