00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,960
Hello and welcome back to the course on tableau.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,900
And in today's material we're talking about data blending is a very exciting.

3
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:13,610
And at the same time controversial topic in tableau.

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,410
And that's because data blending is often very underestimated.

5
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:23,410
It is a feature that is not often used but at the same time it is very powerful and should be used more

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:30,400
and moreover at the beginning it might be a bit difficult to distinguish between joining data and blending

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:30,760
data.

8
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:31,440
But don't worry.

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:38,170
Today we will clarify all of that and we'll put everything back in its place so that you can comfortably

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,930
use and take full advantage of these powerful features both joining and blending data.

11
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,280
So to start off if we're going to need a browser.

12
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:56,410
If you go to Super dot signs dot com slash Tableau and then you scroll down to section number five a

13
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:00,660
joining and blending data just download the very first file which is airline comparison.

14
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,510
So we'll just say that there we go.

15
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:09,310
And now just bring this file up airline comparison.

16
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:17,110
And as you can see here we've got two tabs the first tab has revenue for our airline number one and

17
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:23,620
it's split by period financial year 2015 and financial year 2016 and is split by multiple regions.

18
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,270
And the second tab has revenue for airline number two.

19
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,630
It is also split by year and region.

20
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:33,190
As you can see airline number two operates in less regions.

21
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:40,480
And another thing to note is that in the first tab the year is called period and in the second tab the

22
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,610
year is called the year.

23
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,160
So you'll see why that's important in a few minutes.

24
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:51,570
So I'm just going to close that and we're going to open up a new tableau workbook OK.

25
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,970
And now we're going to connect our excel file airline comparison.

26
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,170
There it is.

27
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:01,180
We're going to connect to the first tab here.

28
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,140
So that's done.

29
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:09,110
Now we're going to create another connection and it will be to the same excel file but now we will connect

30
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,520
to the second tab.

31
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,410
Now if we go to our sheet one you will see here two data connections and they represent the two different

32
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,530
tabs in our Excel workbook.

33
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,220
So what we're going to do now is we'll start visualizing airline number one.

34
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:32,150
We want to see how the revenue is split by region for instance.

35
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:37,590
So we'll ignore a year for now we'll just assume the revenue for the two years.

36
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:44,930
And as you can see here it's broken down by region now and we can see how the revenue changes from region

37
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,180
to region.

38
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,430
Now what we want to do is we want to add airline number two to this visualization.

39
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:55,670
So if we go to the second data source right away Here you can see this orange line on the left and you

40
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:04,550
can see this link icon which tells us that tableau is prepared to blend the data for us now.

41
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,980
And so this is where we get to the topic of blending what is a blend.

42
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:14,120
Well remember how previously in one of the tutorials before this we created a joint for our daughter

43
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:21,110
so here in the data source we connected some different sources of data like for instance like that we

44
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:26,320
put in another element of data here and we create an inner join and then.

45
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,030
So we prepared all of the data before we actually worked with it in our workbooks.

46
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,080
Well now we haven't done that but at the same time Tableau allows us to do that on the fly.

47
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:42,800
Why while we're working with our workbooks and that is called data blending and blending is kind of

48
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,830
like a smart joint.

49
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:48,220
So let's have a bit more of a play around with it and see how it works.

50
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:53,420
What are we going to do now is we're going to drag revenue for the second airline also into our columns

51
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,490
and right away.

52
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,760
Now you can see that we have two elements in our business session.

53
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:05,720
We've got the first set of bars and the second set of bars which represents the second airline and also

54
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:11,870
it's important to note that here in our control panel we've got two main elements.

55
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:19,340
So this these controls are for this airline and these controls are for this airline and these bars.

56
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,960
And also you can control all of them through this feature here so let me just show you an example if

57
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,790
I want to change the color for instance I can change the call for everything or if I want to change

58
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:32,480
something for this other bar chart.

59
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,610
So we're just one of them.

60
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,630
For instance I want to make it a line chart and Santa Barbara.

61
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,780
I can't do that and then I can go into the second bar chart.

62
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,960
I can change something else as well I can change the color here if I want and things like that.

63
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:47,340
So we'll just cancel those changes because we don't really need them.

64
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,600
But keep that in mind that you can control these separately if you need to.

65
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:57,140
And if you need to control them together then you just need to click this all feature over here.

66
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,880
So what happened here.

67
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,090
Well tableau knows that it can.

68
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:07,640
It needs to join the two data sets in order to visualize them because as you can see here we're using

69
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:14,810
region from airline number one and revenue from airline number one but revenue this revenue comes from

70
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:21,260
airline number two and that's why it's marked with this little database with a orange I can have on

71
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:29,820
it and so tableau needs to somehow aggregate revenue from airline number two at the level of region

72
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,200
of airline number one.

73
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,490
So how does it do it.

74
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:39,600
Well tableau knows that it needs to blend the data meaning that it needs to join the two data sources

75
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,670
and how does it do it.

76
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,760
It goes through the region variable here and that's shown using this link.

77
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:52,320
So it's basically telling us that tableau has performed a left join from between the datasets airline

78
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,510
number one and airline number two on the field which is called region.

79
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,860
So it's kind of a join on the fly.

80
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,730
So that's that's great.

81
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,970
And the way region was picked up is because the name is the same.

82
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:10,590
So region here is the same as region here and that's how tableau understood that it needs to join on

83
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,440
the regional field.

84
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:18,100
But what we actually want to do is we want to visualize not only by region but also by period.

85
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,680
So by year.

86
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:30,200
So if we go back to airline number one and we take a period here and we drag it into our Rose you'll

87
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:34,230
see here financial year 2015 financial year 2016.

88
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:39,270
So now one more thing we're going to do is for this chart on the left we will take some revenue will

89
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:48,420
hold control and will drag it into labels and we will just format that quickly so that it's not it's

90
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,480
not in the millions.

91
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:56,760
So there's less numbers currency and just want millions.

92
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,390
There we go.

93
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:02,710
And then we will take this revenue and drag it onto the label for this chart.

94
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,030
And now we will formatted here as well.

95
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,160
Currency just in millions.

96
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:16,840
And now for the whole dashboard we will format it and tell it to be 10 and bold.

97
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,500
Okay.

98
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,400
So hopefully you can see that a bit better now.

99
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:26,200
Now what's happened is after we dragged period so I'll just perform that again.

100
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,610
So I'll take a period out and I'll drag period into rows.

101
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:39,200
You can see after a drag period intros the first airlines data was split into two periods.

102
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,420
So here you can see Africa 10 million and have record 8 million.

103
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,960
Asia 20 Asia 16.

104
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,690
So it is working here.

105
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:52,130
But at the same time the second airline it's not been affected by the period variable.

106
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:56,900
It's basically what it did is just duplicated the data for the full data set instead of splitting it

107
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,630
into two separate periods.

108
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,800
Why did that happen.

109
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:07,820
Well because tableau does not know how to connect how to connect to this period variable hub to connect

110
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,840
the second data set to the period variable.

111
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,060
Now that's because we haven't established that connection.

112
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:19,220
So we can fix that very easily if we go to Data added relationships.

113
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,160
Remember how we talked about joining or multiple fields.

114
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,840
Well here we've only joined on region.

115
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,000
You can see that that was picked up automatically.

116
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:29,960
What we're going to do now is we're going to join on multiple fields.

117
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:36,990
And now instead of going just joining a region we're going to join on period and year here.

118
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:41,570
So if we do that click OK you can see right away.

119
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:50,520
This has been adjusted so what that did is now Tableau is joining these two datasets on two fields.

120
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:56,260
And this is exactly what we talked about in that example with joining when you need to join multiple

121
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:02,380
fields if you don't join in multiple fields when it is required then you will duplicate values and you

122
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,220
will over inflate the observations.

123
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:12,410
So in this case what happened is tableau joined on two fields and there was a period a region and year.

124
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:17,680
Now the reason why tableau didn't pick it up originally was because year has a different name.

125
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,610
So what we'll do now is I'll show you how else you could fix that problem.

126
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:27,700
So if we go to edit relationships and we take period out so we'll just put it back to automatic click

127
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:28,370
OK.

128
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:33,340
You see we have that problem where the values are some tier and the value of some tier and some have

129
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,540
been split.

130
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,530
Now what we can do is we can just go to one of these datasets sets.

131
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:39,730
So here we've got period.

132
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:44,840
So how about we go to the second dataset and we will here change the name.

133
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:50,740
So we'll rename it instead of a year we'll color also period.

134
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:56,440
And what you'll see is that tableau automatically right away picks up that this should be a connection.

135
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,450
So now tableau knows that the names are the same.

136
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:05,290
So therefore it is joining the data on those two fields.

137
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:13,510
Well one more thing you should know is that if you take a period out of your viz. right away tableau

138
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:18,850
no longer needs to join on that field it does know that there is a connection here but it won't be joining

139
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:24,780
on that field and that is because it's that field is no longer part of your visualization.

140
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:29,830
So you can manually switch it on if you want or switch it off but it doesn't really affect the resolution

141
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:35,010
in this case because it isn't participating in this visual.

142
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:41,280
And so what that does is that tableau actually creates this join on the fly.

143
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,630
And the way tableau does it is a bit different to the way we were doing it manually.

144
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:55,390
Back here in data sources when we were creating our own joint the way tableau does these blends is it's

145
00:10:55,450 --> 00:11:03,620
actually instead of joining the data at roll level it will first send queries to each of the datasets.

146
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,750
It will aggregate them.

147
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,890
So here you've got airline 1 and airline 2.

148
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:13,770
It will aggregate them to the level that is required at the current level of granularity of the results

149
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,310
station and then it'll only join them.

150
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:23,290
So in our case for instance before joining the data it goes into airline in the into the airline one

151
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:29,290
data set and it looks at the data it aggregates it to the right level so in our case it's the region

152
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:36,250
level and then it goes to the airline to data set it aggregates the data to the region level as well

153
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:40,040
and then it brings back the aggregated values and joins them.

154
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,100
And that is what data blending does.

155
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:49,930
So it is a very very smart left join and you can also see that it is a live joint because here one table

156
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:56,170
is the primary table the blue one and the orange the airline to table is actually the secondary table

157
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,200
which is marked with an orange Mark.

158
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:04,840
And that from there you can see that it's a left join because here you can see all of the regions which

159
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,800
are present in airline in the airline one database.

160
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:14,200
And here you can add their join to the airline to database and therefore these two are blank because

161
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,720
they're not present in airline two.

162
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:17,840
So.

163
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:25,690
And finally joining blending blending is actually done on a per sheet basis.

164
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:32,110
So if I create a new sheet here you can see right away there is no more blue or primary and secondary

165
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:37,360
secondary data source which means you can create a brand new blend and let's have a look an example

166
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:37,730
here.

167
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:44,170
If we start creating the blend with airline two you will see that it will become the primary data source.

168
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:54,640
So if we drag region into rows and now we drag revenue into columns and also revenue into label and

169
00:12:54,640 --> 00:13:01,750
make this a bit smaller what you will see is that when we go to airline one it has become now the secondary

170
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,510
for this sheet it is the secondary data source.

171
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:11,740
And if we take revenue and drag it into columns here what you will notice is that there is no longer

172
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,570
six rows.

173
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:23,470
Actually before we do that we have to fix something up because some revenue is this revenue has been

174
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,830
copied for both of the sheets and that's not correct.

175
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,420
So that can be a mistake.

176
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:33,730
We need to take our revenue from here and drag using control revenue.

177
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,180
The correct revenue.

178
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,960
And so you can see that it's got the database I can.

179
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:44,520
So what you can see here now is the important thing is that there is not six rows but only four.

180
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:52,130
And that is cause there's only four regions present in the airline one data set and it's the left join.

181
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,520
Oh sorry.

182
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:57,340
In the airline two data said because airline 2 is our primary table and this is a left join.

183
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:01,300
So there's only four regions present in the airline two data set.

184
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:07,000
And if you recall when we talked about joints when you do a left join every everything that doesn't

185
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,230
match get discarded.

186
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:16,480
So in this case North and South America got discarded from the final resulting table and that is because

187
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,000
blending is a very smart.

188
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,380
But it is a left join.

189
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,030
So that's pretty much it.

190
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:32,530
That is how blending works in tableau I realize that this has been a rather lengthy tutorial but it

191
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:41,170
is important to understand how blending works and we went through everything that is included in a blend.

192
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:49,480
So we talked about the primary the secondary tables we talked about how to add our own elements to the

193
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,110
joints or in this case period and region.

194
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:57,910
We talked about how the the blend actually works that it first aggregates the data and then it only

195
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:02,550
joins the data in your final result.

196
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:09,700
And we also looked at why the blend is actually a left join and how you should be cautious of that when

197
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,180
you are creating your viz..

198
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:17,200
So that's all for today I hope you enjoyed the tutorial and I look forward to seeing you next time.

199
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,640
Until then happy analyzing.
