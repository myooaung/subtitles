00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,643
Hello.

2
00:00:00,643 --> 00:00:03,857
I'm Michael Krasowski from Pluralsight.

3
00:00:03,857 --> 00:00:09,000
I will be presenting module five, Project Execution,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
in the course Project Management for Software Engineers.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Okay, let's get started.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,375
On your mark, get set, go!

7
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:23,625
Well, not quite yet.

8
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:27,000
So just what is project execution?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,105
Well, you're going to implement your plan as we designed in module three,

10
00:00:31,105 --> 00:00:33,875
and you're going to measure and monitor its progress

11
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:37,375
as we talked about in module four, but before you get going,

12
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:40,000
there's a lot more to it than just that.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Let's first do a little quick recap.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,765
So to recap, we built a project plan.

15
00:00:49,765 --> 00:00:54,000
We first validated the PDD, the Project Definition Document,

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,556
we built our WBS, the work breakdown structure,

17
00:00:57,556 --> 00:01:02,947
we wrote up our acceptance criteria, we applied resources to the WBS,

18
00:01:02,947 --> 00:01:05,316
we developed estimates and schedule.

19
00:01:05,316 --> 00:01:11,545
And it also includes all of the parts of the project control elements,

20
00:01:11,545 --> 00:01:14,818
such as communications and change management,

21
00:01:14,818 --> 00:01:19,667
risk and issue management, configuration and requirements management,

22
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:23,000
and procurement and quality management.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,389
While the project is underway,

24
00:01:24,389 --> 00:01:28,000
we are in the project execution phase and we are following the plan,

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,500
which includes updating the plan and managing the project

26
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,000
through our project control activities.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,545
So now we are executing our project,

28
00:01:37,545 --> 00:01:41,182
but exactly how are you going to do these activities,

29
00:01:41,182 --> 00:01:43,556
and what I mean by how,

30
00:01:43,556 --> 00:01:48,000
what behaviors and interpersonal relationships will you employ?

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Now let's see what I mean.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,800
The emphasis of project execution module is centered around

33
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,941
three very important and critical capabilities that every PM

34
00:02:03,941 --> 00:02:07,176
should demonstrate on the job.

35
00:02:07,176 --> 00:02:13,000
The first is leadership, the second is effective communication,

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and the third is relationship management.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
This project execution module is divided into these major sections.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,111
Your success is tied to how well you execute your project

39
00:02:27,111 --> 00:02:36,000
exemplifying these three elements of project execution. So let's get started with the first, leadership.
