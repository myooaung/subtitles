00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.382
The next element of project control is requirements management.

2
00:00:06.382 --> 00:00:11.632
Requirements management is ensuring that all requirements are identified,

3
00:00:11.632 --> 00:00:13.382
tracked, and managed.

4
00:00:13.382 --> 00:00:20.239
So this is the potion of your project plan that describes what

5
00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:25.382
requirements management means and how you will accomplish it.

6
00:00:25.382 --> 00:00:29.271
Everyone would likely agree that requirements are a moving target,

7
00:00:29.271 --> 00:00:34.715
so we need to be very disciplined on tracking and documenting our requirements.

8
00:00:34.715 --> 00:00:37.982
So typically we collect our requirements up,

9
00:00:37.982 --> 00:00:40.257
certainly before the project begins,

10
00:00:40.257 --> 00:00:43.757
and maybe before the project's even approved the

11
00:00:43.757 --> 00:00:46.953
requirements are updated and changed and worked on.

12
00:00:46.953 --> 00:00:49.811
And they may be documented in a variety of ways.

13
00:00:49.811 --> 00:00:54.382
We might use Microsoft Word or other tools to document the requirements,

14
00:00:54.382 --> 00:00:57.049
workflow packages, PowerPoint, etc.

15
00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:00.382
to get the project going.

16
00:01:00.382 --> 00:01:02.200
Now the project begins.

17
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.382
Now what happens after that project begins?

18
00:01:05.382 --> 00:01:08.596
Typically, everyone's starting to focus on writing the software,

19
00:01:08.596 --> 00:01:10.382
everyone's busy worrying about deadlines,

20
00:01:10.382 --> 00:01:12.525
and everyone's focused on that.

21
00:01:12.525 --> 00:01:14.668
But the world doesn't stop.

22
00:01:14.668 --> 00:01:19.757
Business keeps moving forward, requirements may need to be refined,

23
00:01:19.757 --> 00:01:23.132
changed, updated because of the business,

24
00:01:23.132 --> 00:01:26.182
and typically people aren't documenting those

25
00:01:26.182 --> 00:01:28.982
requirements as they move and change, okay.

26
00:01:28.982 --> 00:01:35.228
So it may be very small like I'm going to move a button over to the left.

27
00:01:35.228 --> 00:01:37.382
Maybe we don't need to document that.

28
00:01:37.382 --> 00:01:39.908
But a requirement could be quite large like maybe we need to

29
00:01:39.908 --> 00:01:41.382
integrate data from two different legacy systems.

30
00:01:41.382 --> 00:01:42.435
What does that mean?

31
00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:46.382
We're going to use Web API; we're going to go right at the SQL database.

32
00:01:46.382 --> 00:01:47.632
What's the interface?

33
00:01:47.632 --> 00:01:48.882
What's the handshake?

34
00:01:48.882 --> 00:01:51.382
We need to document those requirements.

35
00:01:51.382 --> 00:01:55.837
So the issues that can arise if we do not do this certainly is

36
00:01:55.837 --> 00:01:58.382
software engineers may not know what to do.

37
00:01:58.382 --> 00:02:00.668
What are the requirements that you're to implement?

38
00:02:00.668 --> 00:02:02.382
Do they just make things up?

39
00:02:02.382 --> 00:02:04.837
Do they fill in the gaps on their own?

40
00:02:04.837 --> 00:02:07.837
That happens a lot, and I find that is not right,

41
00:02:07.837 --> 00:02:11.493
should always follow the requirements of the business community.

42
00:02:11.493 --> 00:02:13.715
And users also would expect,

43
00:02:13.715 --> 00:02:17.771
well gee I talked about a requirement in a business meeting,

44
00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:20.549
I thought you wrote it down, and it wasn't implemented,

45
00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.882
that's not good either, and that can happen quite often.

46
00:02:24.882 --> 00:02:31.382
Also really important as well is the requirements document as long as it's keep

47
00:02:31.382 --> 00:02:35.049
in line with the requirements and updated during the software development

48
00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.326
process is a great artifact for testing the application.

49
00:02:38.326 --> 00:02:43.382
You can just open up the specification, you can look at the workflow,

50
00:02:43.382 --> 00:02:45.882
authentication, authorization or whatever is documented in there,

51
00:02:45.882 --> 00:02:49.803
you can look at the different screens and go through those,

52
00:02:49.803 --> 00:02:53.593
and it should work as that spec specifies.

53
00:02:53.593 --> 00:02:58.382
So the end game is that your requirements document will

54
00:02:58.382 --> 00:03:01.382
exactly match the system that's implemented.

55
00:03:01.382 --> 00:03:03.382
I strongly recommend that.

56
00:03:03.382 --> 00:03:08.382
I think it's very important as a PM that you ensure that happens.

57
00:03:08.382 --> 00:03:08.698
Also,

58
00:03:08.698 --> 00:03:12.487
you might want to check out one of my other Pluralsight courses

59
00:03:12.487 --> 00:03:14.382
titled Best Practices of Requirements Gathering.

60
00:03:14.382 --> 00:03:21.382
That might help in the process of gathering your requirements.

61
00:03:21.382 --> 00:03:25.382
Here's a suggested requirements management roadmap or process for you to follow.

62
00:03:25.382 --> 00:03:29.239
Now requirements management is really just a subset of

63
00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.382
the entire change control process.

64
00:03:31.382 --> 00:03:35.132
Remember we covered change control process as one of the

65
00:03:35.132 --> 00:03:37.382
key elements earlier of project control.

66
00:03:37.382 --> 00:03:39.750
But I find that requirements management is such an

67
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.382
important element of project control that I've call it out

68
00:03:42.382 --> 00:03:45.715
special and put more detail here.

69
00:03:45.715 --> 00:03:51.271
So, again, the goal of this process is to identify,

70
00:03:51.271 --> 00:03:52.382
track, document,

71
00:03:52.382 --> 00:03:56.690
and manage all requirements that affect your system

72
00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.382
throughout the entire project lifecycle.

73
00:03:59.382 --> 00:04:02.757
So let's walk through a basic requirements management process.

74
00:04:02.757 --> 00:04:04.257
There's the requirements intake,

75
00:04:04.257 --> 00:04:07.882
so this will be your signal entry point of gathering

76
00:04:07.882 --> 00:04:10.382
requirements while the project is under way.

77
00:04:10.382 --> 00:04:15.096
This may be you or a team member responsible for the

78
00:04:15.096 --> 00:04:16.382
requirements management intake.

79
00:04:16.382 --> 00:04:20.432
For each new requirement you want to review it,

80
00:04:20.432 --> 00:04:25.382
analyze it, prioritize it, and determine its status and potential actions.

81
00:04:25.382 --> 00:04:27.668
Now these actions may be to approve it,

82
00:04:27.668 --> 00:04:31.382
let's move forward on it; we might want to put it on hold,

83
00:04:31.382 --> 00:04:35.200
think about it a little longer or maybe get additional approvals; or

84
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.382
just not approve it and we're going to reject it.

85
00:04:38.382 --> 00:04:42.382
Now, if approved, we want to update the specification document.

86
00:04:42.382 --> 00:04:45.382
We want to develop a plan to support this requirement,

87
00:04:45.382 --> 00:04:50.326
such as we may need more resources or budget or schedule and things like that.

88
00:04:50.326 --> 00:04:51.493
If on hold,

89
00:04:51.493 --> 00:04:55.382
we still want to update the specification document that the

90
00:04:55.382 --> 00:04:59.882
requirement was received and is on hold or pending decision,

91
00:04:59.882 --> 00:05:04.382
and we may want to document the reason behind that.

92
00:05:04.382 --> 00:05:06.029
Also, if not approved,

93
00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:10.147
we still want to update the specification document that the

94
00:05:10.147 --> 00:05:14.151
requirement was received and not approved and document the

95
00:05:14.151 --> 00:05:17.382
reason why it was rejected as well.

96
00:05:17.382 --> 00:05:18.525
As you can see,

97
00:05:18.525 --> 00:05:21.382
I recommend not only documenting the requirements you will implement,

98
00:05:21.382 --> 00:05:23.382
but also the ones you will not.

99
00:05:23.382 --> 00:05:26.264
Customers tend to forget or may misunderstand

100
00:05:26.264 --> 00:05:27.911
requirements or system expectations,

101
00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:35.715
and it is your job to ensure that you are clearly managing those expectations.

102
00:05:35.715 --> 00:05:40.382
Okay, now let's see a simple example.

103
00:05:40.382 --> 00:05:44.171
Now maybe this simple process will work for you.

104
00:05:44.171 --> 00:05:48.382
Just a MS/Word or Excel document can do just fine.

105
00:05:48.382 --> 00:05:55.382
Develop a template in Word or Excel that you can reuse on multiple projects,

106
00:05:55.382 --> 00:05:58.632
and quite simply when requirements are added or

107
00:05:58.632 --> 00:05:59.882
changed just document accordingly.

108
00:05:59.882 --> 00:06:01.132
When they are removed,

109
00:06:01.132 --> 00:06:04.837
you want to document that as well and the reason and rationale why,

110
00:06:04.837 --> 00:06:08.109
and if they're on hold you also want to document them and

111
00:06:08.109 --> 00:06:10.715
the reason and rationale why as well.

112
00:06:10.715 --> 00:06:11.493
And again,

113
00:06:11.493 --> 00:06:16.632
the end game is that your requirements document will exactly match your system.

114
00:06:16.632 --> 00:06:20.382
That's what you always want to make sure happens.

115
00:06:20.382 --> 00:06:24.882
Also regularly distribute the document to your stakeholders and your team, etc.

116
00:06:24.882 --> 00:06:35.000
so everyone knows exactly what's in scope and what's out of scope. Okay, now let's check out the last of our project control elements.
