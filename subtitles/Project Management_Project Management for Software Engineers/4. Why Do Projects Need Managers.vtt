00:00:01.621 --> 00:00:05.621
As a software or systems engineer, have you ever had the thought,

2
00:00:05.621 --> 00:00:08.621
so why does this project have a project manager?

3
00:00:08.621 --> 00:00:11.021
Or, do they really add value?

4
00:00:11.021 --> 00:00:16.621
Or another way to word it is, what is the value of project management?

5
00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:21.621
Well, there's a tremendous value, and let's discuss some examples.

6
00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:24.955
It enables focus on the business goals of the project.

7
00:00:24.955 --> 00:00:27.940
Sometimes the knowledge worker is so focused on developing

8
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.803
a new web API or MVC model for example,

9
00:00:30.803 --> 00:00:36.042
they lose sight of the fact that we need to deliver the new product offering,

10
00:00:36.042 --> 00:00:37.937
say in three weeks.

11
00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:43.621
Also a project manager provides a focal point for responsibility and leadership.

12
00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:46.538
Projects typically span multiple departments or organizations,

13
00:00:46.538 --> 00:00:48.621
so who is in charge?

14
00:00:48.621 --> 00:00:51.621
We'll talk about that more later.

15
00:00:51.621 --> 00:00:54.621
PMs maximize the creative and innovative

16
00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:57.621
capabilities of each subject matter expert.

17
00:00:57.621 --> 00:01:00.434
You may have seen situations where the senior architect

18
00:01:00.434 --> 00:01:02.621
happens to be a project manager too.

19
00:01:02.621 --> 00:01:06.411
His or her time is stretched during PM work,

20
00:01:06.411 --> 00:01:10.621
and may be compromising the technical architecture work as well.

21
00:01:10.621 --> 00:01:15.871
PMs provide a platform for key information and visibility to project metrics,

22
00:01:15.871 --> 00:01:18.155
which enable better monitoring, measuring,

23
00:01:18.155 --> 00:01:20.288
and management decision making.

24
00:01:20.288 --> 00:01:24.021
PMs can spotlight the financial implications earlier,

25
00:01:24.021 --> 00:01:28.464
so you can avoid risky or poor project investments.

26
00:01:28.464 --> 00:01:29.411
And lastly,

27
00:01:29.411 --> 00:01:34.148
PMs ensure a project is in line with other projects

28
00:01:34.148 --> 00:01:35.857
in a company's infrastructure.

29
00:01:35.857 --> 00:01:40.386
Project managers need to have some awareness of other projects and

30
00:01:40.386 --> 00:01:45.371
how they are linked or might conflict in order to avoid any issues

31
00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:47.621
or leverage and improve their project.

32
00:01:47.621 --> 00:01:57.621
So clearly you've seen many examples here why projects need project managers.

33
00:01:57.621 --> 00:02:03.621
Is becoming a full-time or part-time project manager the right job for you?

34
00:02:03.621 --> 00:02:07.907
You will need to have strong communication and people skills,

35
00:02:07.907 --> 00:02:09.621
successful projects demand it.

36
00:02:09.621 --> 00:02:10.559
In this course,

37
00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:14.621
we will discuss many tools and techniques to help you in this area.

38
00:02:14.621 --> 00:02:19.621
You will need to have good business acumen and a solid technical foundation.

39
00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:23.621
Knowing the business, the people, and the technology are critical.

40
00:02:23.621 --> 00:02:26.344
You probably already know technology quite well,

41
00:02:26.344 --> 00:02:30.621
so focusing more on your professional growth on the business side,

42
00:02:30.621 --> 00:02:33.921
and the interpersonal side of your job would be very good.

43
00:02:33.921 --> 00:02:34.221
Again,

44
00:02:34.221 --> 00:02:37.010
in this course we will discuss many tools and

45
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.733
techniques to help you in this area.

46
00:02:39.733 --> 00:02:44.327
Also, have a decisive character to confidently and quickly arrive at results,

47
00:02:44.327 --> 00:02:49.621
and be able to do this while not having all the necessary information at hand.

48
00:02:49.621 --> 00:02:53.857
PMs, leaders, and senior management that are especially successful,

49
00:02:53.857 --> 00:02:58.010
tend to be able to make good decisions without

50
00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.955
knowing everything about a situation.

51
00:02:59.955 --> 00:03:00.733
As engineers,

52
00:03:00.733 --> 00:03:05.121
I would like to suggest that we are wired to want to

53
00:03:05.121 --> 00:03:06.621
know everything before we can act.

54
00:03:06.621 --> 00:03:09.621
You may need to change your approach to problem solving as you

55
00:03:09.621 --> 00:03:13.621
evolve your set of skills to project management.

56
00:03:13.621 --> 00:03:19.621
And are you okay with change coming at a pretty fast pace?

57
00:03:19.621 --> 00:03:23.059
Well, you might be, since you are used to technology world,

58
00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:24.621
and that's changing very rapidly.

59
00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:27.937
So you will need the skills, and the personality,

60
00:03:27.937 --> 00:03:32.083
to be able to adapt to changing business requirements and the

61
00:03:32.083 --> 00:03:34.391
challenge of managing customer expectations,

62
00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:37.621
and be okay and comfortable with both.

63
00:03:37.621 --> 00:03:40.445
Lastly, if you have primarily been writing software,

64
00:03:40.445 --> 00:03:43.621
or working as a systems engineer in your career,

65
00:03:43.621 --> 00:03:47.621
you might not be cut out to be proficient at leading or managing projects.

66
00:03:47.621 --> 00:03:59.000
But don't worry about that now, this course will give you the information, the tools, the techniques, and the guidance to help you improve those skills.
