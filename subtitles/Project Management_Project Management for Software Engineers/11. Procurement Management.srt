1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,632
Procurement management is the activity of managing

2
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:08,746
suppliers and vendors supporting the project.

3
00:00:08,746 --> 00:00:13,698
Now it is quite likely that you and your project team may be

4
00:00:13,698 --> 00:00:16,746
unable to do all of the tasks; therefore,

5
00:00:16,746 --> 00:00:18,851
you may need to bring on some help.

6
00:00:18,851 --> 00:00:21,483
So you may need to have other suppliers or vendors,

7
00:00:21,483 --> 00:00:23,009
consultants, contractors, etc.

8
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:28,062
to come on to the project to help,

9
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:33,746
and this section is how to manage that process.

10
00:00:33,746 --> 00:00:39,746
Why do procurement management, or as we also call it vendor management?

11
00:00:39,746 --> 00:00:43,079
It is likely that your project will need products or

12
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,746
services provided by third-party companies,

13
00:00:44,746 --> 00:00:49,746
and therefore your project will need some amount of procurement management.

14
00:00:49,746 --> 00:00:53,746
Now your company may have a procurement or vendor management organization.

15
00:00:53,746 --> 00:00:56,393
You will need to comply with your company's policy,

16
00:00:56,393 --> 00:00:58,746
and every company may be a little different.

17
00:00:58,746 --> 00:01:04,079
I would suggest you have a contact or team member from your

18
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:06,746
company's procurement department for your projects.

19
00:01:06,746 --> 00:01:11,167
Now here are a few examples of what you may need from outside or

20
00:01:11,167 --> 00:01:14,246
third-party companies: Maybe a consulting company to help design

21
00:01:14,246 --> 00:01:15,371
your application architecture,

22
00:01:15,371 --> 00:01:20,079
maybe a hardware company that's going to supply PCs or hardware or services,

23
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,413
maybe a service provider that will enable you to use

24
00:01:23,413 --> 00:01:25,746
cloud-based services and things like that,

25
00:01:25,746 --> 00:01:30,746
possibly even professional services to provide additional developers as well.

26
00:01:30,746 --> 00:01:36,857
So procurement management is something you need to think about and

27
00:01:36,857 --> 00:01:40,746
incorporate into your processes for project management.

28
00:01:40,746 --> 00:01:43,413
Here's an example of a procurement management process

29
00:01:43,413 --> 00:01:45,746
that you can follow for your projects.

30
00:01:45,746 --> 00:01:46,460
First off,

31
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,746
your process needs to describe how the procurement process will be managed.

32
00:01:50,746 --> 00:01:54,635
In other words, how will you work with your vendors?

33
00:01:54,635 --> 00:01:57,746
That needs to be understood and therefore documented.

34
00:01:57,746 --> 00:02:01,799
You'll also want to define the role between the project manager,

35
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,746
yourself possibly, and the team with the vendor.

36
00:02:04,746 --> 00:02:07,559
Maybe your role will be to provide requirements only

37
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:08,809
to the procurement department,

38
00:02:08,809 --> 00:02:11,805
and the procurement organization will handle the contracts and negotiations.

39
00:02:11,805 --> 00:02:13,864
As I mentioned in the previous slide,

40
00:02:13,864 --> 00:02:16,496
you need to find out whether you have a procurement

41
00:02:16,496 --> 00:02:17,996
organization who will handle those things,

42
00:02:17,996 --> 00:02:21,628
or will you as a PM handle those procurement items yourself.

43
00:02:21,628 --> 00:02:22,099
Next,

44
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:26,805
you need to define the actual components of the contract

45
00:02:26,805 --> 00:02:29,393
like terms and conditions for example.

46
00:02:29,393 --> 00:02:29,805
Also,

47
00:02:29,805 --> 00:02:33,922
be sure to incorporate the vendor deliverables into your project

48
00:02:33,922 --> 00:02:39,413
plan and schedule so whatever the vendor is going to provide is

49
00:02:39,413 --> 00:02:41,746
integrated right into your plan.

50
00:02:41,746 --> 00:02:44,413
Clearly define the working relationship between you and your team

51
00:02:44,413 --> 00:02:46,588
and each vendor provided resource or resources,

52
00:02:46,588 --> 00:02:50,378
such as who are the contact points, maybe name,

53
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:54,302
phone number, email, etc., and who will go where,

54
00:02:54,302 --> 00:03:03,746
and who will you go to if there is an issue with the deliverables of the vendor.

55
00:03:03,746 --> 00:03:04,588
That's real important too.

56
00:03:04,588 --> 00:03:05,220
Issues will happen.

57
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,535
You'll want to know who the contact point is so you

58
00:03:07,535 --> 00:03:09,393
can quickly get them resolved.

59
00:03:09,393 --> 00:03:09,805
Next,

60
00:03:09,805 --> 00:03:13,511
you want to define the integration points especially between

61
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:16,009
software as a service and your infrastructure.

62
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:19,167
So the previous items here on the chart were more

63
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:21,079
of the business side of things,

64
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:24,746
but also you're going to be doing some real technical work.

65
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:28,646
So much now is going to the cloud and software as a service.

66
00:03:28,646 --> 00:03:31,669
What are those endpoints or connection points, API's, etc.

67
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:36,746
between your infrastructure and software as a service or the cloud?

68
00:03:36,746 --> 00:03:39,393
So, for example, if you're procuring a cloud-based service,

69
00:03:39,393 --> 00:03:42,121
how will the endpoints of the service integrate into

70
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:43,246
your company's infrastructure?

71
00:03:43,246 --> 00:03:47,746
So that needs to be specifically defined in your contract as well.

72
00:03:47,746 --> 00:03:53,746
Now I'd like to talk about two sample components of the contract

73
00:03:53,746 --> 00:03:58,746
between the vendor and your company in the next slide.

74
00:03:58,746 --> 00:04:01,871
Now how do we ensure that the third party company

75
00:04:01,871 --> 00:04:03,746
will perform to what you expect?

76
00:04:03,746 --> 00:04:04,131
Well,

77
00:04:04,131 --> 00:04:08,746
you may want to consider adding these procurement components to your contracts.

78
00:04:08,746 --> 00:04:12,957
One area would be a service level agreement, or SLAs.

79
00:04:12,957 --> 00:04:18,158
It's part of your service contract where the service is formally defined.

80
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:21,452
It's agreed to by yourself, of course,

81
00:04:21,452 --> 00:04:26,746
or the procurement organization of your company and the service provider,

82
00:04:26,746 --> 00:04:31,246
and as an example will have contractor delivery dates,

83
00:04:31,246 --> 00:04:32,746
milestones, response times.

84
00:04:32,746 --> 00:04:36,864
All those factors should be in there and clearly outlined.

85
00:04:36,864 --> 00:04:39,746
Another component, sometimes we call this KPIs,

86
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:42,190
or key performance indicators,

87
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:50,746
now they represent a set of measures critical for the success of the project,

88
00:04:50,746 --> 00:04:54,564
so you're going to want to think about this and select some KPIs that

89
00:04:54,564 --> 00:04:56,746
would have a significant impact on the project.

90
00:04:56,746 --> 00:05:02,746
This helps guide the third-party vendor to meet your project goals.

91
00:05:02,746 --> 00:05:05,809
For an example, maybe it's zero defects,

92
00:05:05,809 --> 00:05:09,746
maybe it's progress towards milestones and things like that,

93
00:05:09,746 --> 00:05:15,079
so having SLAs and KPIs as part of the overall contract with

94
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:19,460
third-party vendors is very important and critical to ensuring that

95
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:30,000
they deliver what you want and when you want it. Now let's move on to the final project control activity, quality.
