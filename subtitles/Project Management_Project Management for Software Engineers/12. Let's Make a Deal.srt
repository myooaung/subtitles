1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,199
Now let's turn to relationship building.

2
00:00:04,199 --> 00:00:08,231
You will need to use your skills to forge and build

3
00:00:08,231 --> 00:00:11,245
quality relationships to get things done.

4
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:17,598
One area that is challenging is working in gray or fuzzy areas.

5
00:00:17,598 --> 00:00:20,598
IT and IT departments and IT people tend to like to

6
00:00:20,598 --> 00:00:23,598
work on what I call the binary, more black and white.

7
00:00:23,598 --> 00:00:26,740
In earlier in my career, I was very black and white.

8
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:31,153
Now I've come to understand that the world is gray and how best can

9
00:00:31,153 --> 00:00:34,264
we work within and resolve those gray issues.

10
00:00:34,264 --> 00:00:38,507
Unfortunately, many of the people issues that plague projects are well, gray.

11
00:00:38,507 --> 00:00:42,007
So in other words, there is no right or wrong answer,

12
00:00:42,007 --> 00:00:46,598
but there is a need to find a place where everyone is comfortable so

13
00:00:46,598 --> 00:00:49,598
that we can continue to move the project forward.

14
00:00:49,598 --> 00:00:51,820
Also, clear thinking, outcome focused.

15
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,375
Those who can identify and articulate the problem,

16
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:57,982
bring it out in the open,

17
00:00:57,982 --> 00:01:02,598
and get it solved are instrumental in shortening project snags and timelines.

18
00:01:02,598 --> 00:01:06,071
So many times I'm in meetings and discussions and they seem

19
00:01:06,071 --> 00:01:09,539
to center around things that just aren't that pertinent or

20
00:01:09,539 --> 00:01:12,362
relevant for the topic at hand.

21
00:01:12,362 --> 00:01:16,127
Politely and professionally steer the conversation back to

22
00:01:16,127 --> 00:01:22,598
where it needs to be and keep it focused.

23
00:01:22,598 --> 00:01:26,098
My observation is that us, IT people,

24
00:01:26,098 --> 00:01:29,598
are not known as particularly politically astute.

25
00:01:29,598 --> 00:01:32,298
I know I certainly wasn't early in my career.

26
00:01:32,298 --> 00:01:35,598
And some people actually like to be software engineers and be

27
00:01:35,598 --> 00:01:38,709
very technical to avoid all that political mess,

28
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:42,598
but in the PM world, you really can't avoid it.

29
00:01:42,598 --> 00:01:46,234
So I was in that camp for a long time.

30
00:01:46,234 --> 00:01:50,598
Now it's time to change camps as a PM and understand politics.

31
00:01:50,598 --> 00:01:54,598
Projects benefit when it has individuals like you who can forge strong

32
00:01:54,598 --> 00:01:58,870
relationships with different constituencies throughout the company.

33
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:04,598
Relationship building facilitates project cooperation and success.

34
00:02:04,598 --> 00:02:07,421
So in order to better do those things,

35
00:02:07,421 --> 00:02:10,598
you need to know your organization and who's who.

36
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:15,019
So get out that org chart, figure out who are the influencers,

37
00:02:15,019 --> 00:02:16,124
people with budget,

38
00:02:16,124 --> 00:02:22,892
business ideas that you may need to work with to get their help,

39
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:27,598
so you can get the project successfully completed.

40
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:29,198
Let's make a deal.

41
00:02:29,198 --> 00:02:33,598
IT is a matchup of technology and people to produce products

42
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:36,153
and services that run a company's business,

43
00:02:36,153 --> 00:02:37,542
but when people get involved,

44
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:41,825
there are bound to be disagreements and a need to arrive at group consensus.

45
00:02:41,825 --> 00:02:45,507
So we need PMs who can work with people.

46
00:02:45,507 --> 00:02:52,124
We need PMs to find a common ground so projects and goals can be agreed to,

47
00:02:52,124 --> 00:03:03,000
and we need PMs to swallow their egos, leave those at the door. These traits make some of the best PMs out there.
