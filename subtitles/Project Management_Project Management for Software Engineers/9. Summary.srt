1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,668
Okay, let's summarize the key points of this module.

2
00:00:06,668 --> 00:00:07,706
Project management.

3
00:00:07,706 --> 00:00:11,412
That's the planning and organization of a company's or

4
00:00:11,412 --> 00:00:15,595
organization's resources in order to move a specific task,

5
00:00:15,595 --> 00:00:20,928
event, service, or product toward completion.

6
00:00:20,928 --> 00:00:22,706
The project.

7
00:00:22,706 --> 00:00:28,090
A temporary group activity designed to produce a unique product,

8
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:29,706
service, or result.

9
00:00:29,706 --> 00:00:35,588
A project has a defined beginning time and ending time,

10
00:00:35,588 --> 00:00:39,706
with a defined scope and assigned resources.

11
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,916
When is an activity a project?

12
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,864
Now each company or organization will have different

13
00:00:44,864 --> 00:00:48,306
thresholds as to what is a project versus,

14
00:00:48,306 --> 00:00:50,972
say, a normal operational activity.

15
00:00:50,972 --> 00:00:54,172
Some threshold examples were dollars, hours,

16
00:00:54,172 --> 00:00:57,783
time, things like that, and may also be criticality,

17
00:00:57,783 --> 00:00:59,706
or focus to the business.

18
00:00:59,706 --> 00:01:03,470
Typically, companies will have a project request process,

19
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:08,277
and a project review process, which would vet or approve,

20
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:12,849
you know, each of those as candidate projects.

21
00:01:12,849 --> 00:01:15,706
The project manager, that's you.

22
00:01:15,706 --> 00:01:22,706
You are 100% responsible for the processes used to manage the project.

23
00:01:22,706 --> 00:01:25,150
The project triangle dilemma.

24
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:30,650
This is the competition between scope, budget and costs,

25
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:33,706
schedule, and most importantly quality.

26
00:01:33,706 --> 00:01:38,552
You'll spend much of your time in that triangle.

27
00:01:38,552 --> 00:01:40,706
Hard and soft skills.

28
00:01:40,706 --> 00:01:44,758
Hard skills are about a person's skill set and ability to

29
00:01:44,758 --> 00:01:47,706
perform a certain type of task or activity.

30
00:01:47,706 --> 00:01:52,882
And soft skills are more personal attributes that

31
00:01:52,882 --> 00:01:56,765
enhance an individual's interactions, job performance,

32
00:01:56,765 --> 00:01:58,706
and career prospects.

33
00:01:58,706 --> 00:02:03,656
Key attributes, such as ownership, the attitude that this is mine,

34
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:07,706
and I will do the very best I can.

35
00:02:07,706 --> 00:02:13,706
Integrity, the quality of being honest and having strong principles.

36
00:02:13,706 --> 00:02:15,090
Effective communication,

37
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,936
which facilitates information sharing between company employees,

38
00:02:19,936 --> 00:02:22,706
team members, and management.

39
00:02:22,706 --> 00:02:24,706
Being a people person,

40
00:02:24,706 --> 00:02:30,706
a person who enjoys or is particularly good at interacting with others.

41
00:02:30,706 --> 00:02:35,706
Process oriented, in that you place a priority on how things get done.

42
00:02:35,706 --> 00:02:43,706
And the ability to stay focused, and not easily distracted from the objective.

43
00:02:43,706 --> 00:02:44,443
Project teams.

44
00:02:44,443 --> 00:02:48,864
They may work directly for you, they may work for another manager,

45
00:02:48,864 --> 00:02:54,000
but are assigned to you, also, they may be full or part-time,

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,706
so your team will likely be a hybrid of resources.

47
00:02:58,706 --> 00:03:01,372
Successful projects, that's you,

48
00:03:01,372 --> 00:03:06,706
a great project manager and your effective leadership.

49
00:03:06,706 --> 00:03:07,244
Also,

50
00:03:07,244 --> 00:03:11,013
senior management and stakeholder support all having

51
00:03:11,013 --> 00:03:13,706
a common vision and expectations.

52
00:03:13,706 --> 00:03:14,595
And lastly,

53
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:19,928
a project will be successful if it is in line with the

54
00:03:19,928 --> 00:03:21,706
business's goals and objectives.

55
00:03:21,706 --> 00:03:25,412
Okay, let's jump into the next module, Project Planning,

56
00:03:25,412 --> 00:03:33,000
and learn some tools and simple approaches to improve your planning and project skills.
