1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,097
Here are the last four project control elements that we'll

2
00:00:07,097 --> 00:00:10,155
discuss in this module: Risk management,

3
00:00:10,155 --> 00:00:12,700
issue management, procurement management,

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:17,593
procurement meaning vendors or outside companies that you're

5
00:00:17,593 --> 00:00:21,968
going to use to help you get your project done,

6
00:00:21,968 --> 00:00:24,155
and of course quality management.

7
00:00:24,155 --> 00:00:28,155
So the following slides will provide the reasons why we need these activities.

8
00:00:28,155 --> 00:00:33,488
We'll sample roadmaps and process guidance and examples.

9
00:00:33,488 --> 00:00:36,155
Okay, let's get started.

10
00:00:36,155 --> 00:00:40,967
Risk management is the activity of identifying,

11
00:00:40,967 --> 00:00:48,355
monitoring, and responding to risks so we don't euphemistically step in it.

12
00:00:48,355 --> 00:00:53,155
The goal of managing project risk is to identify and prepare for

13
00:00:53,155 --> 00:00:59,655
any potential threat to the project's success of achieving the

14
00:00:59,655 --> 00:01:04,155
project's goals before they occur.

15
00:01:04,155 --> 00:01:08,441
So let's talk about why we should do risk management.

16
00:01:08,441 --> 00:01:10,155
So what's a risk?

17
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:14,726
Risk is something that could happen in the future that we want to be aware of,

18
00:01:14,726 --> 00:01:16,155
but it hasn't happened yet.

19
00:01:16,155 --> 00:01:19,629
If something has happened, we're going to call that an issue.

20
00:01:19,629 --> 00:01:22,155
If something might happen out in the future,

21
00:01:22,155 --> 00:01:24,488
we're going to call it a risk,

22
00:01:24,488 --> 00:01:28,488
and we want to manage those risks of things that could happen,

23
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:30,155
and here are some examples.

24
00:01:30,155 --> 00:01:35,155
Personnel and team changes that might happen in the future,

25
00:01:35,155 --> 00:01:38,933
budget fluctuations, major scope changes that could happen,

26
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:42,433
maybe the business might sell to another company or

27
00:01:42,433 --> 00:01:46,309
we're going to pick up another company, external project dependencies.

28
00:01:46,309 --> 00:01:50,155
Well, if that project fails, that might affect our project.

29
00:01:50,155 --> 00:01:54,155
If that project's milestone dates change, our dates might need to change.

30
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:57,355
It hasn't happened yet, but it could happen.

31
00:01:57,355 --> 00:02:00,155
Organizational changes are quite common in businesses.

32
00:02:00,155 --> 00:02:07,155
How would an organizational change affect your project if it happened?

33
00:02:07,155 --> 00:02:11,345
Maybe some new and unproven technology that might be inserted into

34
00:02:11,345 --> 00:02:15,155
the project in the future that we're not aware of.

35
00:02:15,155 --> 00:02:16,488
Time to market factors.

36
00:02:16,488 --> 00:02:21,155
In other words, we already have our project plan and our schedule in place,

37
00:02:21,155 --> 00:02:27,155
but maybe some other market factors that could happen could affect the project.

38
00:02:27,155 --> 00:02:28,802
Vendor or supplier issues.

39
00:02:28,802 --> 00:02:34,155
Maybe our vendor is being bought out by another company could affect us.

40
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:40,155
And maybe just project manager issues with the project manager him or herself.

41
00:02:40,155 --> 00:02:40,855
So again,

42
00:02:40,855 --> 00:02:46,105
we may want to keep an eye out for these things that could happen that

43
00:02:46,105 --> 00:02:48,734
could significantly affect what we're trying to do.

44
00:02:48,734 --> 00:02:49,050
Okay,

45
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,839
now let's turn to the process of identifying and managing risks and

46
00:02:52,839 --> 00:03:00,155
their dispositions or what we're going to do with them.

47
00:03:00,155 --> 00:03:02,802
Here's how I might suggest you handling the risk

48
00:03:02,802 --> 00:03:05,155
management process for yourself, and it's pretty straightforward.

49
00:03:05,155 --> 00:03:10,208
Simply incorporate into your status meetings and reports a regular agenda item,

50
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,155
which is a risk management agenda item.

51
00:03:13,155 --> 00:03:14,567
And you can say,

52
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:19,155
hey have we had any risks been identified since we met last time?

53
00:03:19,155 --> 00:03:19,572
No?

54
00:03:19,572 --> 00:03:20,822
Okay, move on.

55
00:03:20,822 --> 00:03:21,238
Yes?

56
00:03:21,238 --> 00:03:24,155
Okay, we're going to document that risk.

57
00:03:24,155 --> 00:03:25,955
Maybe we heard about a reorganization.

58
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:29,255
Maybe we heard about a vendor might not want to support

59
00:03:29,255 --> 00:03:31,405
us anymore or something like that.

60
00:03:31,405 --> 00:03:35,155
Again, they haven't happened yet, but they could happen.

61
00:03:35,155 --> 00:03:38,155
And for every one of these that we identify as a yes,

62
00:03:38,155 --> 00:03:39,655
and typically there aren't very many,

63
00:03:39,655 --> 00:03:42,001
risk management will not take very much time,

64
00:03:42,001 --> 00:03:44,155
but should be a regular agenda item.

65
00:03:44,155 --> 00:03:49,555
And here are a few different categories that I'd like to talk

66
00:03:49,555 --> 00:03:53,155
about regarding each particular risk that you ---.

67
00:03:53,155 --> 00:03:56,280
And here are the different categories I'd like you to

68
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,155
consider when you document a risk.

69
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,933
The likelihood: low, medium,

70
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:06,155
or high in terms of is it likely that this risk will actually happen?

71
00:04:06,155 --> 00:04:06,564
Impact.

72
00:04:06,564 --> 00:04:10,655
If it does happen, is it low, medium, or high?

73
00:04:10,655 --> 00:04:15,155
How big of an impact will it be to the project?

74
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:17,155
And a priority as well.

75
00:04:17,155 --> 00:04:21,155
You might want to combine the likelihood and impact values.

76
00:04:21,155 --> 00:04:25,355
If the likelihood is quite high and the impact is quite high,

77
00:04:25,355 --> 00:04:28,155
then the priority might also be quite high.

78
00:04:28,155 --> 00:04:31,869
And you may want to monitor these each day or week as necessary,

79
00:04:31,869 --> 00:04:34,155
and I think probably weekly is just fine.

80
00:04:34,155 --> 00:04:36,787
You're going to have a status meeting with your team.

81
00:04:36,787 --> 00:04:39,155
One of the agenda items will be risk management.

82
00:04:39,155 --> 00:04:40,155
Any risk been identified?

83
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:43,155
It might be as simple as nope, none, then you move on.

84
00:04:43,155 --> 00:04:45,955
And if you do identify a particular risk,

85
00:04:45,955 --> 00:04:50,155
then you'll want to quickly go through okay you've identified a risk,

86
00:04:50,155 --> 00:04:53,155
tell me the likelihood, impact, priority,

87
00:04:53,155 --> 00:04:55,155
and let's monitor it.

88
00:04:55,155 --> 00:04:59,677
Now you may also want to determine what would the action be that

89
00:04:59,677 --> 00:05:03,155
you're going to take given that the risk does occur.

90
00:05:03,155 --> 00:05:08,807
So know let's jump to the next slide and look at the possible

91
00:05:08,807 --> 00:05:13,155
actions you may want to take for each risk identified.

92
00:05:13,155 --> 00:05:16,920
Now that you've identified a potential risk and

93
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,743
you've documented its likelihood, its impact,

94
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:25,519
and its priority, you're going to want to assign a potential risk action to that,

95
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:29,155
and here are some examples I'd like you to consider.

96
00:05:29,155 --> 00:05:31,787
First, given each particular risk, do you avoid the risk?

97
00:05:31,787 --> 00:05:32,576
In other words,

98
00:05:32,576 --> 00:05:37,155
let's just change the project plan so that risk would be eliminated.

99
00:05:37,155 --> 00:05:39,655
Maybe you accept the risk.

100
00:05:39,655 --> 00:05:41,655
No change to plan,

101
00:05:41,655 --> 00:05:46,780
but you're going to inform management that this risk could happen,

102
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:51,155
but you continue on with your project with no change.

103
00:05:51,155 --> 00:05:53,503
And maybe that you want to monitor the risk.

104
00:05:53,503 --> 00:05:56,372
In other words, right now I'm not going to avoid it,

105
00:05:56,372 --> 00:05:59,536
and I'm not going to accept it, but I want to monitor it.

106
00:05:59,536 --> 00:06:01,917
And each week in your staff meeting or your project

107
00:06:01,917 --> 00:06:04,726
planning meetings you'll look at your risks,

108
00:06:04,726 --> 00:06:11,155
and you'll decide do we continue to monitor or do we take a different action?

109
00:06:11,155 --> 00:06:13,822
Another action might be to mitigate that risk,

110
00:06:13,822 --> 00:06:17,155
take some actions to reduce the impact of that risk.

111
00:06:17,155 --> 00:06:19,997
It may not eliminate the risk,

112
00:06:19,997 --> 00:06:26,155
but it might reduce the risk to the project by taking certain actions.

113
00:06:26,155 --> 00:06:29,102
Also, you might want to transfer the risk,

114
00:06:29,102 --> 00:06:33,155
shift the risk to another owner and inform management as well.

115
00:06:33,155 --> 00:06:34,679
And I don't mean shirking your duties certainly,

116
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:38,012
but it may be that you know that there's a risk in the network infrastructure.

117
00:06:38,012 --> 00:06:41,441
You're over here running the software web application,

118
00:06:41,441 --> 00:06:44,280
that's your job, not necessarily the network,

119
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:49,155
but you understand there could be a network issue or some network downtime.

120
00:06:49,155 --> 00:06:53,787
You may want to inform that owner that's responsible for the

121
00:06:53,787 --> 00:06:57,892
network application and make sure they handle that so it's

122
00:06:57,892 --> 00:07:00,102
not part of your risk anymore,

123
00:07:00,102 --> 00:07:04,155
that they've taken that risk on as part of their job.

124
00:07:04,155 --> 00:07:05,441
Okay, so remember,

125
00:07:05,441 --> 00:07:11,869
risk avoidance is much better than reacting to a risk when it happens to you,

126
00:07:11,869 --> 00:07:13,155
so plan ahead.

127
00:07:13,155 --> 00:07:19,155
So now we have a process to identify, monitor, and take action on our risks.

128
00:07:19,155 --> 00:07:32,280
Okay, let's go into the next action.

129
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:37,331
(Working) Now let's see a simple example how we can

130
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:40,155
track our risks in a risk tracking log.

131
00:07:40,155 --> 00:07:43,050
Now they can be tracked in spreadsheet or a web-based system.

132
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:46,309
I like web-based so others can easily see what's going on,

133
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:50,155
but a spreadsheet will do just fine, keep things simple.

134
00:07:50,155 --> 00:07:53,155
So here are some attributes and descriptions I'd like to talk about

135
00:07:53,155 --> 00:07:55,155
regarding what you should track for each risk.

136
00:07:55,155 --> 00:07:59,155
Maybe a risk ID, a unique ID to track that particular risk.

137
00:07:59,155 --> 00:08:01,155
What's the name of the risk?

138
00:08:01,155 --> 00:08:03,488
Could be something like potential network failures.

139
00:08:03,488 --> 00:08:08,842
The probability of the risk between 1 and 100 that it's going to happen.

140
00:08:08,842 --> 00:08:11,655
The source of the risk.

141
00:08:11,655 --> 00:08:17,044
Is it budget, personnel, external factors, business, etc.? And the date log.

142
00:08:17,044 --> 00:08:20,155
In other words, the date the risk was identified in one of your meetings.

143
00:08:20,155 --> 00:08:25,155
Maybe some notes about it, a little more description that might be helpful.

144
00:08:25,155 --> 00:08:26,488
And again, the action.

145
00:08:26,488 --> 00:08:29,822
Are we going to avoid it, accept it, monitor it,

146
00:08:29,822 --> 00:08:32,198
mitigate it or transfer, or maybe even TBD?

147
00:08:32,198 --> 00:08:34,025
So this can be done very easily.

148
00:08:34,025 --> 00:08:37,155
You may only have a half dozen risks to keep track of.

149
00:08:37,155 --> 00:08:50,000
Not a big deal, but again risks can become massive issues on a project, so keep an eye on them, track them, and try to avoid them at all costs.
