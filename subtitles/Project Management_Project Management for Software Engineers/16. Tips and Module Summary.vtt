00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.526
Now I'll cover a few helpful tips, and then we'll wrap up with a summary.

2
00:00:09.526 --> 00:00:14.776
Probably one of the best tips that I can give you is

3
00:00:14.776 --> 00:00:16.526
early detection equals prevention.

4
00:00:16.526 --> 00:00:19.166
Now you may have heard of this kind of cute line,

5
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:22.286
"The sooner you fall behind, the more time you'll have to catch up.

6
00:00:22.286 --> 00:00:24.240
" And that's pretty cute, pretty funny,

7
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.526
and we have that on coffee cups sometimes.

8
00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:30.126
But let's say this again with a slight twist to you it.

9
00:00:30.126 --> 00:00:32.226
"The sooner you know that you're behind,

10
00:00:32.226 --> 00:00:34.926
â€¦ the more time you'll have to catch up.

11
00:00:34.926 --> 00:00:37.926
" And you'll know you're behind by using this variance

12
00:00:37.926 --> 00:00:40.714
analysis we talked about in this section.

13
00:00:40.714 --> 00:00:45.526
So other activities for early detection would be certainly project control

14
00:00:45.526 --> 00:00:51.064
planning all the things you've learned in this module.

15
00:00:51.064 --> 00:00:53.526
Also, effective communication management.

16
00:00:53.526 --> 00:00:56.145
So there was a big piece of communication in one of

17
00:00:56.145 --> 00:00:57.574
the key elements of project control,

18
00:00:57.574 --> 00:01:01.955
and we're going to talk a little bit more about different types

19
00:01:01.955 --> 00:01:04.526
of communication in the following module.

20
00:01:04.526 --> 00:01:06.105
Also, project monitoring, of course.

21
00:01:06.105 --> 00:01:08.315
We want to look at risks, issues,

22
00:01:08.315 --> 00:01:12.626
and variances at all times and be a very proactive project manager as well.

23
00:01:12.626 --> 00:01:16.226
So several of these items will help you be just a better

24
00:01:16.226 --> 00:01:19.026
project manager and stay on track.

25
00:01:19.026 --> 00:01:24.526
We've talked about a lot of project control activities and elements,

26
00:01:24.526 --> 00:01:27.226
so what should the right level of effort be?

27
00:01:27.226 --> 00:01:30.526
How much time and effort should you put into project control?

28
00:01:30.526 --> 00:01:35.526
Let's check that out.

29
00:01:35.526 --> 00:01:39.376
The right level of effort may be hard to figure out,

30
00:01:39.376 --> 00:01:42.176
but in other words how much time, effort,

31
00:01:42.176 --> 00:01:45.326
planning, and process do you put into project control?

32
00:01:45.326 --> 00:01:49.526
Each organization, and maybe even each project, will be a little different.

33
00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:53.240
So there's really no need for a lot of a lot of project

34
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.526
control overhead if the project say is small.

35
00:01:55.526 --> 00:01:58.842
Determine what large and small is to your organization,

36
00:01:58.842 --> 00:02:02.526
and apply the right level of tools and processes accordingly.

37
00:02:02.526 --> 00:02:02.859
Also,

38
00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:06.193
the level of expertise of the people involved in the

39
00:02:06.193 --> 00:02:08.526
project may be of interest as well.

40
00:02:08.526 --> 00:02:12.055
So if people have familiarity with the business and the organization and

41
00:02:12.055 --> 00:02:14.193
with potential solutions and their technical implications,

42
00:02:14.193 --> 00:02:17.526
you may not need as much overhead with project control.

43
00:02:17.526 --> 00:02:19.026
On the other hand,

44
00:02:19.026 --> 00:02:23.526
people with less experience may need more formal processes to guide them.

45
00:02:23.526 --> 00:02:23.938
Risks,

46
00:02:23.938 --> 00:02:28.467
the level of risks the company can tolerate versus the amount

47
00:02:28.467 --> 00:02:30.526
of project management practices applied.

48
00:02:30.526 --> 00:02:33.052
So here's a rule of thumb regarding that.

49
00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:37.350
The greater the risk to the business, typically relating to money of course,

50
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.055
the greater the need and the amount of project

51
00:02:41.055 --> 00:02:43.526
management best practices you should apply.

52
00:02:43.526 --> 00:02:43.993
Next,

53
00:02:43.993 --> 00:02:49.126
what's the organization's ability to mitigate risks that may occur from

54
00:02:49.126 --> 00:02:51.812
insufficient application of project management practices?

55
00:02:51.812 --> 00:02:55.240
An organization that has flexibility in adding resources,

56
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.901
removing or adding scope,

57
00:02:56.901 --> 00:03:01.401
or pushing dates back might require a smaller amount of project management

58
00:03:01.401 --> 00:03:05.026
practices than an organization that has little flexibility.

59
00:03:05.026 --> 00:03:05.526
Also,

60
00:03:05.526 --> 00:03:10.026
the level of trust between you the project manager

61
00:03:10.026 --> 00:03:12.089
and the team and the stakeholders.

62
00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:13.651
This is an interesting one.

63
00:03:13.651 --> 00:03:17.526
Trust allows stakeholders to be more accommodating and make tradeoffs.

64
00:03:17.526 --> 00:03:20.526
Trust sometimes encourages bolder project plans,

65
00:03:20.526 --> 00:03:25.383
and that's really good if a company wants to get out ahead of the curve and

66
00:03:25.383 --> 00:03:27.526
really make a difference with projects in their company.

67
00:03:27.526 --> 00:03:31.408
And the greater the trust, the better and smoother the project,

68
00:03:31.408 --> 00:03:33.526
and, therefore, the greater the outcome.

69
00:03:33.526 --> 00:03:38.526
Now let's cover a few more tips.

70
00:03:38.526 --> 00:03:41.326
Here are a few more tips.

71
00:03:41.326 --> 00:03:45.526
Allocate enough time to perform your project control duties.

72
00:03:45.526 --> 00:03:47.571
You'll be very busy and have lots to do,

73
00:03:47.571 --> 00:03:51.026
but if you don't devote the right level of effort you're going to have trouble

74
00:03:51.026 --> 00:03:53.526
managing your project and finding out just where you are.

75
00:03:53.526 --> 00:03:58.526
Are you ahead of schedule, behind schedule, ahead of budget, or behind budget?

76
00:03:58.526 --> 00:04:01.859
So be sure you allocate enough time to make sure you do

77
00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:03.526
an adequate job of project control.

78
00:04:03.526 --> 00:04:07.651
Next, if you don't track your progress, you are to me,

79
00:04:07.651 --> 00:04:09.526
by definition, out of control.

80
00:04:09.526 --> 00:04:12.526
You can't manage or monitor a project without tracking progress.

81
00:04:12.526 --> 00:04:16.651
There are lots of easy and hard ways to do this.

82
00:04:16.651 --> 00:04:19.597
There's web-based tracking systems, spreadsheets, you name it.

83
00:04:19.597 --> 00:04:23.526
Use them, track your time, track your budget at all times.

84
00:04:23.526 --> 00:04:26.158
There's going to be changes that happen in your project.

85
00:04:26.158 --> 00:04:28.776
Embrace those changes head on, and then work with them,

86
00:04:28.776 --> 00:04:30.276
deal with them, and manage them.

87
00:04:30.276 --> 00:04:32.776
That's why it's so important to have a change control

88
00:04:32.776 --> 00:04:34.876
process like we talked about earlier,

89
00:04:34.876 --> 00:04:39.826
which includes how to add things to the list and how

90
00:04:39.826 --> 00:04:42.526
they can be approved and prioritized.

91
00:04:42.526 --> 00:04:45.964
And if you don't know what's expected, any outcome will do,

92
00:04:45.964 --> 00:04:47.526
so know your completion criteria.

93
00:04:47.526 --> 00:04:51.526
That is your expected outcome, your milestones,

94
00:04:51.526 --> 00:04:54.955
your feature sets, your release elements,

95
00:04:54.955 --> 00:04:55.526
etc.

96
00:04:55.526 --> 00:04:58.526
Also, begin with initial baselines of your schedule,

97
00:04:58.526 --> 00:05:02.789
budget, scope, and other variance elements that you might come up with.

98
00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:07.526
This is a key part of your job, and you need to lay these out.

99
00:05:07.526 --> 00:05:08.911
Determine, measure,

100
00:05:08.911 --> 00:05:14.449
and broadcast or communicate progress accurately and consistently,

101
00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:19.383
so you'll definitely need a reporting plan.

102
00:05:19.383 --> 00:05:26.526
Avoid all unplanned work outside of your change control process.

103
00:05:26.526 --> 00:05:26.804
What?

104
00:05:26.804 --> 00:05:28.748
You don't have a change control process?

105
00:05:28.748 --> 00:05:31.526
Then all your work is unplanned and out of control.

106
00:05:31.526 --> 00:05:33.669
Institute a change control process.

107
00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:37.526
There should be all work come through that process.

108
00:05:37.526 --> 00:05:39.089
It'll be prioritized, worked on,

109
00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:42.526
maybe put in the parking lot to be worked on later.

110
00:05:42.526 --> 00:05:45.193
That is planned work that you don't do.

111
00:05:45.193 --> 00:05:46.526
You see the difference?

112
00:05:46.526 --> 00:05:50.210
True unplanned work is out there in the ether somewhere,

113
00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.955
but the change control process will manage all work intake,

114
00:05:53.955 --> 00:05:54.812
very important.

115
00:05:54.812 --> 00:05:59.526
And lastly watch out for what I call virtual work groups.

116
00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:03.631
When your project team is not physically in the same or close location,

117
00:06:03.631 --> 00:06:07.997
sometimes it can be more difficult to get information and manage your project.

118
00:06:07.997 --> 00:06:11.173
And many work groups today are in fact virtual,

119
00:06:11.173 --> 00:06:14.684
remote computing and people all over the world working on projects.

120
00:06:14.684 --> 00:06:16.263
In of itself that's great,

121
00:06:16.263 --> 00:06:21.026
but make sure you have the right processes and tools in place to

122
00:06:21.026 --> 00:06:24.526
have a firm grip and management on the project.

123
00:06:24.526 --> 00:06:30.526
Okay, now let's summarize this module.

124
00:06:30.526 --> 00:06:35.684
In this module you have learned that you need to determine your approach and

125
00:06:35.684 --> 00:06:39.776
processes for the eight project control activities prior to beginning your

126
00:06:39.776 --> 00:06:43.526
project and in fact are added to your project plan.

127
00:06:43.526 --> 00:06:46.339
Then when your project begins you will then follow

128
00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:48.526
each of the processes you laid out.

129
00:06:48.526 --> 00:06:50.435
Okay, let's summarize.

130
00:06:50.435 --> 00:06:52.981
Communication and change management.

131
00:06:52.981 --> 00:06:55.526
Communication, aka reporting management,

132
00:06:55.526 --> 00:06:58.052
we discussed what you will say, the content,

133
00:06:58.052 --> 00:07:01.526
and to whom you'll say it too, such as your stakeholders.

134
00:07:01.526 --> 00:07:07.526
Effective communication is critical to the project's success, so get good at it.

135
00:07:07.526 --> 00:07:12.926
Change is a part of business life, so be flexible and agile,

136
00:07:12.926 --> 00:07:16.526
and have a solid process for managing change.

137
00:07:16.526 --> 00:07:20.026
Configuration management is controlling the versions and

138
00:07:20.026 --> 00:07:22.526
content of the project deliverables,

139
00:07:22.526 --> 00:07:27.141
and requirements management is ensuring that all requirements are identified,

140
00:07:27.141 --> 00:07:28.526
tracked, and managed.

141
00:07:28.526 --> 00:07:30.326
Both of these are tightly coupled.

142
00:07:30.326 --> 00:07:31.826
Since you will add requirements,

143
00:07:31.826 --> 00:07:35.326
you will need to plan what version they will be part

144
00:07:35.326 --> 00:07:38.126
of and when they will be delivered.

145
00:07:38.126 --> 00:07:38.926
Risks, remember,

146
00:07:38.926 --> 00:07:45.390
are those things that might happen to the project that you want to be aware of,

147
00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:47.435
keep an eye on, tag,

148
00:07:47.435 --> 00:07:51.526
and track where issues are known items that are currently

149
00:07:51.526 --> 00:07:56.026
impacting your project such as software defects that you'll

150
00:07:56.026 --> 00:07:58.526
need to track and disposition.

151
00:07:58.526 --> 00:08:03.526
Procurement management is the activity of working with outside third-party

152
00:08:03.526 --> 00:08:07.988
vendors either directly or through your procurement organization.

153
00:08:07.988 --> 00:08:13.526
In this actually we emphasize the importance of ---.

154
00:08:13.526 --> 00:08:17.901
In this section we emphasized the importance of service level

155
00:08:17.901 --> 00:08:22.000
agreements and key performance indicators as well to help manage

156
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.842
the performance of your suppliers.

157
00:08:23.842 --> 00:08:27.526
Now quality management, I think this is an easy one.

158
00:08:27.526 --> 00:08:31.901
Just plan and execute the other seven project control activities,

159
00:08:31.901 --> 00:08:34.526
and you will have great quality.

160
00:08:34.526 --> 00:08:38.193
But also we did discuss some simple techniques that your team

161
00:08:38.193 --> 00:08:40.526
can use such as checklists and templates,

162
00:08:40.526 --> 00:08:44.295
which allow you to implement consistently and,

163
00:08:44.295 --> 00:08:47.526
therefore, quality in common team activities.

164
00:08:47.526 --> 00:08:48.304
Variance analysis.

165
00:08:48.304 --> 00:08:54.526
This is an approach to help you determine if your project is on track or not.

166
00:08:54.526 --> 00:08:54.787
Remember,

167
00:08:54.787 --> 00:08:59.483
you will be constantly asked if you are on track and if not by how much and why,

168
00:08:59.483 --> 00:09:04.026
so you'll want to be able to quickly pull out some

169
00:09:04.026 --> 00:09:06.526
charts and impress your stakeholders.

170
00:09:06.526 --> 00:09:10.000
Lastly we talked about some tips, the right level of effort.

171
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.526
In other words, don't undermanage or over manage.

172
00:09:12.526 --> 00:09:16.526
Of course I know this is easier said than done, but you get the idea.

173
00:09:16.526 --> 00:09:18.105
Always strive for early detection,

174
00:09:18.105 --> 00:09:22.210
which means you will need the right controls or variances in place so

175
00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:26.315
you can quickly see the health of your project.

176
00:09:26.315 --> 00:09:26.789
