1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,220
Now we are at the second part of building your plan,

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,931
and this is the implementation element, but before we get started,

3
00:00:08,931 --> 00:00:14,854
let's just put it back in context on the next slide.

4
00:00:14,854 --> 00:00:19,854
Now we just covered the first part of building your plan, the core element.

5
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:26,854
We validated the PDD, we built the WBS, and we itemized the acceptance criteria.

6
00:00:26,854 --> 00:00:32,749
Now the second part we're going to cover now is to apply resources to the WBS,

7
00:00:32,749 --> 00:00:35,949
develop an estimate, and develop a schedule,

8
00:00:35,949 --> 00:00:41,711
and these last three I call more of the implementation elements,

9
00:00:41,711 --> 00:00:44,854
so let's get started on those.

10
00:00:44,854 --> 00:00:45,688
In step four,

11
00:00:45,688 --> 00:00:49,854
we're going to determine the resources that we need and apply them to the WBS.

12
00:00:49,854 --> 00:00:52,737
Now resources are typically people and tools,

13
00:00:52,737 --> 00:00:54,795
but could include other items,

14
00:00:54,795 --> 00:00:58,938
mostly they're people who will be assigned the what task,

15
00:00:58,938 --> 00:01:01,854
how many hours they'll be assigned, etc.

16
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:05,672
So what you'll want to do for each entry in the WBS,

17
00:01:05,672 --> 00:01:08,536
you want to identify you will work that task,

18
00:01:08,536 --> 00:01:12,938
Michael, Mary, Paul, and when they are needed,

19
00:01:12,938 --> 00:01:15,854
maybe the date they're needed.

20
00:01:15,854 --> 00:01:19,560
In addition, you may need some other resource details.

21
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,854
For example, the role they'll play like programmer,

22
00:01:22,854 --> 00:01:25,854
developer, web designer, database modeler,

23
00:01:25,854 --> 00:01:31,854
required skills, maybe C# or jQuery, maybe some training needs,

24
00:01:31,854 --> 00:01:35,283
they may also need some training on AngularJS and things like that,

25
00:01:35,283 --> 00:01:38,521
and they may also need a certain skill or experience level,

26
00:01:38,521 --> 00:01:41,188
well we need to do some architecture work,

27
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:44,410
we may need a very experienced developer or software engineer,

28
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,354
and maybe other areas, a QA analyst,

29
00:01:46,354 --> 00:01:48,854
maybe they need to understand the domain they'll be

30
00:01:48,854 --> 00:01:56,854
testing in and things like that, so let's see some examples of this.

31
00:01:56,854 --> 00:01:59,678
Here is our example from the previous section,

32
00:01:59,678 --> 00:02:02,854
so this is our WBS that we built up.

33
00:02:02,854 --> 00:02:05,223
I'd like to call your attention to the right,

34
00:02:05,223 --> 00:02:07,854
we've added two additional columns, the who and the when,

35
00:02:07,854 --> 00:02:12,089
and in this case for the who, I just used people's initials,

36
00:02:12,089 --> 00:02:13,854
MK, PS, things like that.

37
00:02:13,854 --> 00:02:18,384
And another little example here is JK/MK because they'll be two

38
00:02:18,384 --> 00:02:20,854
people working this particular task together,

39
00:02:20,854 --> 00:02:22,604
and if I don't know yet,

40
00:02:22,604 --> 00:02:26,396
I'll just put TBD and I'll come back and fill that in later,

41
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:30,854
and over on the right, I put the dates when they'll be needed for the project.

42
00:02:30,854 --> 00:02:34,904
Now on this example, I kept it simple, but you could add additional columns,

43
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:39,454
you could add the role they're going to play if you weren't sure,

44
00:02:39,454 --> 00:02:41,965
you could add some required skills they need,

45
00:02:41,965 --> 00:02:44,188
you could add another column for training needs,

46
00:02:44,188 --> 00:02:46,170
even another column for skill and experience,

47
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,328
and maybe even another column as a little note field,

48
00:02:49,328 --> 00:02:54,965
so you can add those different elements as you see fit to add more robustness

49
00:02:54,965 --> 00:02:59,854
to your plan to help you get successful in your project.

50
00:02:59,854 --> 00:03:02,036
So now that we have the resources assigned,

51
00:03:02,036 --> 00:03:11,000
and when we would like them to start the task, let's move on and start making estimates for each of our tasks.
