00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.167
In this section, we'll see how to define a project,

2
00:00:05.167 --> 00:00:08.940
and in particular, what I call the project definition document,

3
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.204
the what, what is this project going to do?

4
00:00:13.204 --> 00:00:16.046
Also, don't leave home without it,

5
00:00:16.046 --> 00:00:22.376
never start a project without a project definition document.

6
00:00:22.376 --> 00:00:26.467
Okay, now let's see why.

7
00:00:26.467 --> 00:00:30.317
Here are some good reasons why we should define a project.

8
00:00:30.317 --> 00:00:32.417
Before you develop a project plan,

9
00:00:32.417 --> 00:00:37.730
you need to know a little about just what the project is,

10
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.467
and what the expected outcome of the project will deliver.

11
00:00:42.467 --> 00:00:48.842
In fact, the project definition can and should be used as a go or no go guidance,

12
00:00:48.842 --> 00:00:53.022
and what I mean by go is, the project seems reasonable,

13
00:00:53.022 --> 00:00:56.911
let's proceed with the next step, or a no go,

14
00:00:56.911 --> 00:01:00.181
does not seem reasonable, does not seem worthwhile,

15
00:01:00.181 --> 00:01:04.467
and maybe I won't get a return in my investment.

16
00:01:04.467 --> 00:01:08.967
The project definition process can be repeated and refined

17
00:01:08.967 --> 00:01:14.667
to yield more information and a deeper understanding of just

18
00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:18.333
what the project would entail.

19
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:23.467
So what if management says just start?

20
00:01:23.467 --> 00:01:29.467
Well sometimes management is in a hurry, as we all know and experienced.

21
00:01:29.467 --> 00:01:32.290
And just starting can be okay,

22
00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.467
but I recommend that you have a project definition document certainly,

23
00:01:37.467 --> 00:01:42.467
and you might want to take a couple of passes to refine it before you start.

24
00:01:42.467 --> 00:01:46.467
Again, that will be a negotiating process with your management.

25
00:01:46.467 --> 00:01:47.842
And lastly,

26
00:01:47.842 --> 00:01:54.029
we're going to put all this material we've collected

27
00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:57.467
in the project definition document.

28
00:01:57.467 --> 00:02:00.895
Here are the items in general that we want to put into

29
00:02:00.895 --> 00:02:04.830
the project definition document, and you may have heard the term a lot of,

30
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.103
who, what, and why, and those are some of the key areas,

31
00:02:08.103 --> 00:02:10.730
such as who, you know, who are the users,

32
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.572
the customers, who's going to benefit from this system,

33
00:02:13.572 --> 00:02:17.267
and who will have the greatest impact upon this for this system?

34
00:02:17.267 --> 00:02:21.467
And the what of course, what is it that we're going to go do?

35
00:02:21.467 --> 00:02:23.993
What are the goals or objectives, are we going to save money,

36
00:02:23.993 --> 00:02:25.467
are we going to improve customer service,

37
00:02:25.467 --> 00:02:27.361
and things like that.

38
00:02:27.361 --> 00:02:34.467
And the why, what's the purpose of the project, why are we doing this project?

39
00:02:34.467 --> 00:02:39.133
Also, we get into a little more detail, we're going to talk about value,

40
00:02:39.133 --> 00:02:42.313
what's the business value maybe on revenue,

41
00:02:42.313 --> 00:02:46.621
or reducing costs, ROI, Return On Investment,

42
00:02:46.621 --> 00:02:48.467
and the scope.

43
00:02:48.467 --> 00:02:53.522
How big is this, what does it cover, does it cover just manufacturing,

44
00:02:53.522 --> 00:02:56.050
does it cover the entire organization,

45
00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:02.467
does it cover your vendors and the supply chain for example.

46
00:03:02.467 --> 00:03:04.752
And also, what we call the success criteria.

47
00:03:04.752 --> 00:03:06.467
How do you know you're done,

48
00:03:06.467 --> 00:03:09.800
how do you know that it actually met your customer's expectations,

49
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.800
and everyone is happy or not,

50
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.181
those should be part of the definition of the project as well.

51
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:20.467
And so, as a project manager, it is your job,

52
00:03:20.467 --> 00:03:21.752
an important job,

53
00:03:21.752 --> 00:03:28.038
to write your project definition document that would include all these elements.

54
00:03:28.038 --> 00:03:31.467
Also, you should develop a template,

55
00:03:31.467 --> 00:03:35.404
and incrementally improve that template with each new project.

56
00:03:35.404 --> 00:03:39.467
Okay, there are two other Pluralsight courses of mine,

57
00:03:39.467 --> 00:03:41.967
Best Practices of Requirements Gathering,

58
00:03:41.967 --> 00:03:44.967
and Best Practices of Project Estimation,

59
00:03:44.967 --> 00:03:49.617
and in there, I outline just what a project definition document is,

60
00:03:49.617 --> 00:03:54.708
but it is important to outline it here again for you for you first timers,

61
00:03:54.708 --> 00:04:05.000
so the next several slides we'll go over that. Okay, now let's look at a simple project definition creation process.
