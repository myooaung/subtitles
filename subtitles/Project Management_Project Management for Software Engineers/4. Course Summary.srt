1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,078
Now let's recap the key points of fundamentals.

2
00:00:06,078 --> 00:00:07,597
Project management.

3
00:00:07,597 --> 00:00:10,774
That's the planning and organization of a company's or

4
00:00:10,774 --> 00:00:14,420
organization's resources in order to move a specific task,

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:19,355
event, service, or product toward completion.

6
00:00:19,355 --> 00:00:21,000
The project.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,916
It's a temporary group activity designed to produce a unique product,

8
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:30,347
service, or result, and group activity again means teams.

9
00:00:30,347 --> 00:00:35,597
Next, you know what makes an activity a project.

10
00:00:35,597 --> 00:00:39,486
Now each company or organization will have different thresholds or

11
00:00:39,486 --> 00:00:43,703
definitions as to what is a project versus a simple activity,

12
00:00:43,703 --> 00:00:47,018
and some threshold examples would be dollars or hours,

13
00:00:47,018 --> 00:00:50,764
or simply if something is really critical to the business.

14
00:00:50,764 --> 00:00:55,042
And usually there's a project review process that helps set those

15
00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:58,186
thresholds and vets those projects for approval.

16
00:00:58,186 --> 00:01:00,833
Next, hard and soft skills.

17
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:05,597
Remember hard skills are about a person's skillset and

18
00:01:05,597 --> 00:01:08,421
ability to perform a certain task or activity,

19
00:01:08,421 --> 00:01:11,597
such as knowing how to use PowerPoint, for example,

20
00:01:11,597 --> 00:01:14,660
but you also need some soft skills,

21
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:18,597
which are personal attributes that enhance an individual's interactions,

22
00:01:18,597 --> 00:01:20,597
job performance, and career prospects.

23
00:01:20,597 --> 00:01:24,197
Next, we covered some key attributes of a PM,

24
00:01:24,197 --> 00:01:29,143
and one of the main ones I'd like to stress here is ownership.

25
00:01:29,143 --> 00:01:33,506
It's the attitude that this project is mine and I will do

26
00:01:33,506 --> 00:01:37,597
the very best I can do in that project.

27
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:40,597
Also another key attribute is integrity.

28
00:01:40,597 --> 00:01:45,597
That's the quality of being honest and having strong principles.

29
00:01:45,597 --> 00:01:47,931
Also lastly, effective communicator,

30
00:01:47,931 --> 00:01:52,597
and this facilitates information sharing between company employees,

31
00:01:52,597 --> 00:01:55,597
team members, management, vendors, etc.

32
00:01:55,597 --> 00:01:57,397
Next, project teams.

33
00:01:57,397 --> 00:02:03,097
Remember it's all about teamwork and remember your team members may work

34
00:02:03,097 --> 00:02:06,097
directly for you or they may work for another manager,

35
00:02:06,097 --> 00:02:07,597
but are assigned to you.

36
00:02:07,597 --> 00:02:12,520
This can and will challenge your leadership skills.

37
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,597
Desired outcome, a successful project,

38
00:02:15,597 --> 00:02:19,797
and that's keeping your projects focused and in line

39
00:02:19,797 --> 00:02:22,597
with the business goals and objectives.

40
00:02:22,597 --> 00:02:26,597
Now let's review the next module.

41
00:02:26,597 --> 00:02:30,097
Here's a recap of the planning module.

42
00:02:30,097 --> 00:02:35,597
Remember beginning any project with a project definition document is critical.

43
00:02:35,597 --> 00:02:38,674
We outlined an approach of creating a project

44
00:02:38,674 --> 00:02:40,597
definition document with key elements.

45
00:02:40,597 --> 00:02:46,597
Also a project definition provides clear and expected project characteristics,

46
00:02:46,597 --> 00:02:49,597
and most importantly, project outcomes.

47
00:02:49,597 --> 00:02:50,931
The WBS.

48
00:02:50,931 --> 00:02:58,264
We discussed that project planning is the process for determining tasks,

49
00:02:58,264 --> 00:03:03,153
resources, estimates, and schedules, and begins with creating the WBS,

50
00:03:03,153 --> 00:03:04,931
the Work Breakdown Structure,

51
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:09,883
which is a hierarchical list of tasks decomposed into phases,

52
00:03:09,883 --> 00:03:12,169
deliverables, or work packages.

53
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:15,597
Next, we itemized the acceptance criteria.

54
00:03:15,597 --> 00:03:19,883
This portion of the plan is typically written in simple

55
00:03:19,883 --> 00:03:21,597
business and user-oriented language,

56
00:03:21,597 --> 00:03:26,860
such as the system's ecommerce module will be completed on

57
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,545
March 1st to support credit card processing,

58
00:03:30,545 --> 00:03:31,597
for example.

59
00:03:31,597 --> 00:03:35,097
Next, determine and assign resources, which are usually people,

60
00:03:35,097 --> 00:03:36,264
to each task,

61
00:03:36,264 --> 00:03:41,290
and also we identified for each resource any additional training or

62
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:45,597
skills that are needed to complete this task.

63
00:03:45,597 --> 00:03:50,127
Then also for each task we estimated the hours that it

64
00:03:50,127 --> 00:03:52,597
would take to perform that task.

65
00:03:52,597 --> 00:03:52,966
Scheduling.

66
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,439
For schedule resource loading,

67
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:58,492
we take each task and we determine the start and end

68
00:03:58,492 --> 00:04:03,454
dates and with the start date being on or after the date

69
00:04:03,454 --> 00:04:05,597
that the resource is available.

70
00:04:05,597 --> 00:04:08,755
We also looked at the resource load chart and how

71
00:04:08,755 --> 00:04:11,597
important that was visually seen how they allocated hours

72
00:04:11,597 --> 00:04:14,047
per resource will lay out over time.

73
00:04:14,047 --> 00:04:18,597
And lastly, even though our plan is looking really good at this point,

74
00:04:18,597 --> 00:04:20,997
its focus is the work itself.

75
00:04:20,997 --> 00:04:26,597
There are other elements that must be included in the plan to support the

76
00:04:26,597 --> 00:04:31,169
process of actually managing and controlling the project,

77
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:34,597
such as reporting and requirements management,

78
00:04:34,597 --> 00:04:37,492
and as we talked recently,

79
00:04:37,492 --> 00:04:43,282
it needs to also include the transition plan to be

80
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:45,597
implemented during project closure.

81
00:04:45,597 --> 00:04:46,597
In project control,

82
00:04:46,597 --> 00:04:51,264
you learn that you need to determine your approach and processes for the eight

83
00:04:51,264 --> 00:04:54,660
project control activities prior to beginning your project,

84
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,597
and in fact are added to your project plan.

85
00:04:58,597 --> 00:05:00,785
Then when your project begins,

86
00:05:00,785 --> 00:05:05,597
you will then follow each of the processes you laid out.

87
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:06,597
Reporting management.

88
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:09,597
Sometimes we call it communication management.

89
00:05:09,597 --> 00:05:12,397
We discussed what you will say, the content,

90
00:05:12,397 --> 00:05:16,597
and to whom you will say it to, such as the stakeholders.

91
00:05:16,597 --> 00:05:22,597
Effective communication is critical to your success, so get good at it.

92
00:05:22,597 --> 00:05:23,554
Change control.

93
00:05:23,554 --> 00:05:27,380
Change is a part of the business life,

94
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:33,597
so be flexible and agile and have a solid process for managing change.

95
00:05:33,597 --> 00:05:34,674
Configuration management.

96
00:05:34,674 --> 00:05:40,597
That is controlling the versions and content of the project deliverables.

97
00:05:40,597 --> 00:05:41,764
Requirements management.

98
00:05:41,764 --> 00:05:47,597
This is ensuring all requirements are identified, tracked, and managed.

99
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:51,597
These are tightly coupled since as you add requirements you need to plan what

100
00:05:51,597 --> 00:05:55,950
version it will be part of and when they will be delivered.

101
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,833
Risk and issue management.

102
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:02,264
Remember risks are those things that might happen to the

103
00:06:02,264 --> 00:06:06,264
project that you want to be aware of, keep an eye on,

104
00:06:06,264 --> 00:06:07,597
and tag, and track.

105
00:06:07,597 --> 00:06:13,071
Issues, on the other hand, are known items that are impacting your project,

106
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:17,703
such as software defects that you need to track and disposition.

107
00:06:17,703 --> 00:06:18,545
Quality management.

108
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:22,334
I'd like to say, hey that's the easy one,

109
00:06:22,334 --> 00:06:25,870
just plan and execute the project control activities,

110
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:28,597
and you will have great quality.

111
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:32,722
We also discussed some simple techniques that your team can use,

112
00:06:32,722 --> 00:06:38,797
such as checklists and templates, which will allow you to implement consistently,

113
00:06:38,797 --> 00:06:43,597
and therefore, with quality in common team activities.

114
00:06:43,597 --> 00:06:44,861
Lastly, variance analysis.

115
00:06:44,861 --> 00:06:51,597
This is an approach to help you determine if your project is on track or not.

116
00:06:51,597 --> 00:06:55,264
Remember, you will constantly be asked if you are on track,

117
00:06:55,264 --> 00:06:57,931
and if not, by how much and why,

118
00:06:57,931 --> 00:07:03,891
and variance analysis will help you answer and address those questions,

119
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:08,597
as well as keep your project on track.

120
00:07:08,597 --> 00:07:10,282
In the Execution module,

121
00:07:10,282 --> 00:07:15,334
we stressed that you must find ways to engage people and stir

122
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:17,997
their commitment to the project's goals.

123
00:07:17,997 --> 00:07:23,597
As a leader, a project's success will be all about growing others.

124
00:07:23,597 --> 00:07:28,597
One of the key and most important attributes of the leader is trust.

125
00:07:28,597 --> 00:07:33,312
If they trust you, they will follow you on all levels.

126
00:07:33,312 --> 00:07:37,597
The next major emphasis in this module was effective communication.

127
00:07:37,597 --> 00:07:41,808
Remember it's all about getting the right information to the

128
00:07:41,808 --> 00:07:46,910
right people at the right time and using the right method to

129
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,222
communicate that information.

130
00:07:48,222 --> 00:07:55,042
We talked about some other great communication tips that I call my five Cs.

131
00:07:55,042 --> 00:08:00,542
In all your communications, you need to be clear,

132
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:03,597
concise, courteous, consistent, and compelling.

133
00:08:03,597 --> 00:08:07,303
Before you send any note, email, document,

134
00:08:07,303 --> 00:08:12,597
or presentation, please run it up against the five Cs.

135
00:08:12,597 --> 00:08:14,883
Lastly was relationship management.

136
00:08:14,883 --> 00:08:20,597
This includes delivering great customer service and our five Ps,

137
00:08:20,597 --> 00:08:24,290
provider of great service, promptness, politeness,

138
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,136
professionalism, and personalization,

139
00:08:26,136 --> 00:08:31,891
and that's using the customer's name in a very positive and effective

140
00:08:31,891 --> 00:08:35,597
way and producing a good connection with each other.

141
00:08:35,597 --> 00:08:38,864
Remember managing customer expectations is indeed challenging,

142
00:08:38,864 --> 00:08:42,597
so do your best to get the win-win.

143
00:08:42,597 --> 00:08:46,407
In other words, it's not your way or my way,

144
00:08:46,407 --> 00:08:55,000
it's a better way, so work towards all parties feeling good about the decisions being made.
