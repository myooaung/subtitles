1
00:00:01,171 --> 00:00:01,608
Leadership.

2
00:00:01,608 --> 00:00:06,421
While your success as a project manager is certainly based on

3
00:00:06,421 --> 00:00:11,088
the fundamentals of project management, your leadership capabilities may,

4
00:00:11,088 --> 00:00:15,171
in fact, make or break your success.

5
00:00:15,171 --> 00:00:17,457
Think for a moment.

6
00:00:17,457 --> 00:00:19,171
Ask yourself this.

7
00:00:19,171 --> 00:00:23,171
Why should anyone be led by you?

8
00:00:23,171 --> 00:00:28,671
So you must find ways to engage people and stir their

9
00:00:28,671 --> 00:00:31,171
commitment to the project's goals.

10
00:00:31,171 --> 00:00:38,171
Okay, now let's see what I mean by leadership.

11
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:42,971
This class is titled Project Management for Software Engineers.

12
00:00:42,971 --> 00:00:47,671
It does not say project leadership, but certainly could.

13
00:00:47,671 --> 00:00:51,171
So here's a simple definition of leadership.

14
00:00:51,171 --> 00:00:56,060
It's the action of leading a group of people or an

15
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,171
organization to a common set of goals.

16
00:00:59,171 --> 00:01:00,855
Now a little deeper,

17
00:01:00,855 --> 00:01:06,329
leadership is the ability to guide others into a direction or decision that

18
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:09,671
leaves them still feeling empowered and accomplished.

19
00:01:09,671 --> 00:01:15,171
That is a very tall order and a very challenging task,

20
00:01:15,171 --> 00:01:17,171
but very rewarding when you accomplish it.

21
00:01:17,171 --> 00:01:30,000
Yes, you still need to be able to create plans and have good project control, but more essentially, you will also need great leadership.
