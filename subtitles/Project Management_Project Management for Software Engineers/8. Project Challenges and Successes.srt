1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,310
Challenges and pitfalls, and how to avoid them.

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:06,965
In our final section,

3
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:16,034
we'll explore why projects are challenging and how to avoid their pitfalls.

4
00:00:16,034 --> 00:00:18,319
Why are projects challenging?

5
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:24,034
Yes, that's you over there to enter the project maze.

6
00:00:24,034 --> 00:00:27,184
So why can projects be so daunting and challenging?

7
00:00:27,184 --> 00:00:31,409
Well, a lot of times projects have just never been done before,

8
00:00:31,409 --> 00:00:37,034
so they have to figure out, well how are we going to get this done?

9
00:00:37,034 --> 00:00:40,891
A lot of times, there's various needs and expectations.

10
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:44,100
There's so many people involved, different viewpoints,

11
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,967
and different expectations, it's hard to manage and integrate those together,

12
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:51,034
very challenging.

13
00:00:51,034 --> 00:00:54,096
Communication challenges, how you talk to people,

14
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:58,034
how people talk to you, how you convey messages,

15
00:00:58,034 --> 00:01:01,234
and requirements documents, and status reports,

16
00:01:01,234 --> 00:01:01,767
metrics,

17
00:01:01,767 --> 00:01:06,534
all those things can be quite challenging to prepare

18
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:09,534
and to deliver to your audience.

19
00:01:09,534 --> 00:01:14,034
Also the project triangle dilemma we talked about before,

20
00:01:14,034 --> 00:01:17,145
which is balancing the scope, cost, and schedule.

21
00:01:17,145 --> 00:01:24,248
Those are very challenging things to do in all projects I have ever been on.

22
00:01:24,248 --> 00:01:30,034
And there's a few more on the next slide.

23
00:01:30,034 --> 00:01:33,634
Why projects are challenging, part two.

24
00:01:33,634 --> 00:01:36,034
Creative and innovative focus.

25
00:01:36,034 --> 00:01:40,034
Many times, since projects are done for the first time,

26
00:01:40,034 --> 00:01:44,462
and they may be highly creative or new or innovative focus,

27
00:01:44,462 --> 00:01:50,034
those make it more challenging than just your normal operational type of work.

28
00:01:50,034 --> 00:01:54,269
Also, organizational hurdles, what I call now and later.

29
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:59,880
You're working within an organization, it may be very structured and stiff,

30
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,034
and may not be that supportive of your project.

31
00:02:04,034 --> 00:02:06,834
And also what I mean by and later,

32
00:02:06,834 --> 00:02:09,634
is many times projects will drive organizational change,

33
00:02:09,634 --> 00:02:14,184
there may be new departments created to support the result of a project,

34
00:02:14,184 --> 00:02:18,034
or there may be departments that are dissolved because of that.

35
00:02:18,034 --> 00:02:19,159
And trust me,

36
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:23,284
the people in those departments that are being dissolved may not

37
00:02:23,284 --> 00:02:27,034
want to work with you on a project very closely.

38
00:02:27,034 --> 00:02:28,306
Stakeholder collaboration.

39
00:02:28,306 --> 00:02:34,034
You typically have multiple stakeholders that have multiple agendas,

40
00:02:34,034 --> 00:02:39,125
and you want to be sure that they collaborate in such a way that

41
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:42,034
supports and fosters the success of your project.

42
00:02:42,034 --> 00:02:45,971
And of course just plain old requirements and estimates.

43
00:02:45,971 --> 00:02:49,391
Requirements are always changing, estimates may be changing,

44
00:02:49,391 --> 00:02:52,605
budgets may be changing, so those are always very,

45
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:54,034
very challenging as well.

46
00:02:54,034 --> 00:02:58,488
But as you can see, on the left, you've made it through the maze,

47
00:02:58,488 --> 00:03:02,488
and I hope it's because of the things you're going to learn,

48
00:03:02,488 --> 00:03:05,034
and have learned in this Pluralsight course.

49
00:03:05,034 --> 00:03:12,319
Okay, so we know things will go wrong, so now let's see how we can fix them,

50
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,034
on the next slide.

51
00:03:14,034 --> 00:03:17,264
Oops, be prepared and plan ahead.

52
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:21,034
Things will go wrong, it is inevitable.

53
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:25,182
So what I'd like to list is a few things that could go wrong,

54
00:03:25,182 --> 00:03:29,034
and how to fix them, so you can be prepared and plan accordingly.

55
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:30,938
So here's a quick checklist.

56
00:03:30,938 --> 00:03:37,034
So on the left, what can go wrong, and how I think you can fix it.

57
00:03:37,034 --> 00:03:38,916
Project misaligned with business.

58
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:45,034
Sometimes you may be given a project that you just see no value,

59
00:03:45,034 --> 00:03:49,622
it's nothing to do with the business, it's not tied to the business,

60
00:03:49,622 --> 00:03:51,034
typically those will fail.

61
00:03:51,034 --> 00:03:54,176
So what you'd like to do, early on, is go back,

62
00:03:54,176 --> 00:03:55,605
validate with the stakeholders first,

63
00:03:55,605 --> 00:03:59,681
just want to make sure this project is in line with the business goals,

64
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:02,034
is everything, you know, going according to plan,

65
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:05,471
is it budgeted right, and we're all on board with it,

66
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:07,034
and we all support it.

67
00:04:07,034 --> 00:04:10,843
If you have that feeling that the project is not

68
00:04:10,843 --> 00:04:13,129
quite aligned with the business, please,

69
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:15,034
check first with the stakeholders.

70
00:04:15,034 --> 00:04:18,349
Next, lack of management, or stakeholder buy-in.

71
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:24,034
Maybe the project is aligned with business, but no one cares anymore.

72
00:04:24,034 --> 00:04:24,534
Unfortunate.

73
00:04:24,534 --> 00:04:27,534
So gain acceptance, and continuously validate.

74
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:28,034
So,

75
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:33,434
you want to make sure you have a good and close

76
00:04:33,434 --> 00:04:36,234
relationship with the stakeholders, get their acceptance,

77
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:41,134
and then continuously status to them and talk to them and make sure that,

78
00:04:41,134 --> 00:04:45,034
hey, are we still on track on what we're doing for the company.

79
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:49,151
Other things that can go wrong certainly are just poor

80
00:04:49,151 --> 00:04:52,034
communications or what I call project confusion.

81
00:04:52,034 --> 00:04:54,134
So, use a project communications plan,

82
00:04:54,134 --> 00:04:57,284
and we're going to dedicate a module on that,

83
00:04:57,284 --> 00:05:01,284
is how is that you communicate and how should you communicate,

84
00:05:01,284 --> 00:05:05,034
what you should say and how you should say it.

85
00:05:05,034 --> 00:05:06,834
No time or support for planning.

86
00:05:06,834 --> 00:05:10,434
I see this a lot, this is typically a senior management issue,

87
00:05:10,434 --> 00:05:13,967
they give you a project, they don't give you any time to plan,

88
00:05:13,967 --> 00:05:15,034
and you start running.

89
00:05:15,034 --> 00:05:19,244
And, I understand that, but as much as you can,

90
00:05:19,244 --> 00:05:23,034
try to educate management on the value of planning.

91
00:05:23,034 --> 00:05:24,938
Next, poor or changing requirements.

92
00:05:24,938 --> 00:05:31,034
Okay guys, let's hurry up and get it done, but we're not sure what we're doing.

93
00:05:31,034 --> 00:05:35,034
So, if you can, perform solid requirements analysis first,

94
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:39,034
so you do know what it is you're doing.

95
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:40,916
Next, poor estimates/changing budgets.

96
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:47,462
Now, budgets will change, I get that, that's a part of a business organization,

97
00:05:47,462 --> 00:05:49,605
and you can accommodate that.

98
00:05:49,605 --> 00:05:53,034
Okay, budget changes, usually it means it's smaller,

99
00:05:53,034 --> 00:05:55,284
maybe you can modify the scope and move forward.

100
00:05:55,284 --> 00:05:58,891
But if you make poor estimates, or poor estimates are given to you,

101
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:01,462
it's likely going to go south.

102
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:07,034
So use a good estimating process, and a change management process as well.

103
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:14,034
Okay, now let's see what makes a successful project.

104
00:06:14,034 --> 00:06:15,909
What makes a successful project?

105
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:20,034
Okay, what I'm about to show is just a partial list.

106
00:06:20,034 --> 00:06:26,891
But here are the key items of what makes a successful project.

107
00:06:26,891 --> 00:06:28,034
First, you.

108
00:06:28,034 --> 00:06:29,034
Yes, you.

109
00:06:29,034 --> 00:06:33,034
A great project manager and your effective leadership.

110
00:06:33,034 --> 00:06:36,111
Certainly, senior management support.

111
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:43,034
Always make sure you have good senior management support.

112
00:06:43,034 --> 00:06:47,534
Stakeholder support, sometimes, they're one in the same,

113
00:06:47,534 --> 00:06:52,034
but typically there's an overlap a little bit.

114
00:06:52,034 --> 00:06:57,284
Common vision and expectations across the business,

115
00:06:57,284 --> 00:07:01,034
senior management, and the stakeholders.

116
00:07:01,034 --> 00:07:07,034
A project that is in line with the business goals and objectives.

117
00:07:07,034 --> 00:07:13,256
A solid project scope and any changes that may have occurred to that scope,

118
00:07:13,256 --> 00:07:18,234
with good change management, that are clearly defined,

119
00:07:18,234 --> 00:07:23,034
and agreed upon, by your stakeholders.

120
00:07:23,034 --> 00:07:30,034
Lastly, the project team is customer focused and results oriented.

121
00:07:30,034 --> 00:07:32,950
And this can be a great checklist for you to use in the future.

122
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,462
If you see any of these that are not quite right,

123
00:07:35,462 --> 00:07:38,891
then jump in, and try to understand why,

124
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:44,034
and see if you can remediate it with your effective communication skills.

125
00:07:44,034 --> 00:07:45,700
Not sure about your communication skills?

126
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:53,000
Well, hang on, we'll tackle those in some of the other modules, but first, let's summarize this module.
