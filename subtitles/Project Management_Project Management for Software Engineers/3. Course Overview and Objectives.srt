1
00:00:01,621 --> 00:00:04,445
This course is comprised of the following modules.

2
00:00:04,445 --> 00:00:07,621
In the Course Overview, the one we're in now,

3
00:00:07,621 --> 00:00:12,531
we will discuss why you are here, who this course is for,

4
00:00:12,531 --> 00:00:16,621
and course objectives, and also what this course is not.

5
00:00:16,621 --> 00:00:19,288
Then we will talk about why industry needs,

6
00:00:19,288 --> 00:00:21,955
and I would like to say, desperately needs,

7
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:25,121
project managers, and people just like you.

8
00:00:25,121 --> 00:00:26,121
Then, Fundamentals.

9
00:00:26,121 --> 00:00:30,621
We will discuss the basic definitions of project management,

10
00:00:30,621 --> 00:00:33,779
such as what a project is, what project management is,

11
00:00:33,779 --> 00:00:35,674
what are a project managers duties,

12
00:00:35,674 --> 00:00:40,050
but also what qualities make the best project manager as well.

13
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,621
Then we'll move on to Planning.

14
00:00:42,621 --> 00:00:44,764
This module will define, discuss,

15
00:00:44,764 --> 00:00:48,621
and provide examples for creating a project definition document,

16
00:00:48,621 --> 00:00:51,937
and I think, your key to a successful project.

17
00:00:51,937 --> 00:00:55,621
You'll also learn the steps in creating a project plan,

18
00:00:55,621 --> 00:00:59,121
which includes the work breakdown structure,

19
00:00:59,121 --> 00:01:02,621
resourcing, estimation, scheduling, and resource loading.

20
00:01:02,621 --> 00:01:03,221
Control.

21
00:01:03,221 --> 00:01:07,421
This module will discuss reporting, change control,

22
00:01:07,421 --> 00:01:09,907
configuration management, requirements management,

23
00:01:09,907 --> 00:01:13,764
risk and issue management, procurement management,

24
00:01:13,764 --> 00:01:17,621
quality management, and lastly, variance analysis.

25
00:01:17,621 --> 00:01:19,006
Next, Execution.

26
00:01:19,006 --> 00:01:23,160
In this module we'll discuss leadership,

27
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,621
effective communication, and relationship management.

28
00:01:26,621 --> 00:01:29,684
Please pay close attention to this module.

29
00:01:29,684 --> 00:01:33,621
These skills will definitely make or break a project.

30
00:01:33,621 --> 00:01:36,092
And lastly, Project Closure and Course Summary.

31
00:01:36,092 --> 00:01:40,985
In the final module, we will discuss the activities of closing a project,

32
00:01:40,985 --> 00:01:44,621
and then we will summarize the entire course.

33
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:51,621
Okay, now let's discuss the course objectives.

34
00:01:51,621 --> 00:01:54,193
Now let's cover the course objectives.

35
00:01:54,193 --> 00:01:57,193
First, we're going to illustrate key fundamentals,

36
00:01:57,193 --> 00:02:00,399
concepts, and tools of project management,

37
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,621
basically, project management 101.

38
00:02:02,621 --> 00:02:06,411
I want to provide a relatively condensed course,

39
00:02:06,411 --> 00:02:11,621
with appropriate depth and content to immediately apply to your job.

40
00:02:11,621 --> 00:02:15,151
I hope this course will also reduce your on-the-job learning

41
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:17,621
curve by sharing some of my experiences,

42
00:02:17,621 --> 00:02:21,674
some of my successful, and some of my not so successful.

43
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:26,929
Yes, failures help you improve your skills and approach for the next project.

44
00:02:26,929 --> 00:02:30,621
We will emphasize the importance of communication skills.

45
00:02:30,621 --> 00:02:31,788
This is huge.

46
00:02:31,788 --> 00:02:35,288
Since many of you come from a technical background,

47
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:37,621
and have tons of technical skills,

48
00:02:37,621 --> 00:02:43,621
this course will help you beef up your communication skills as well.

49
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:47,621
We will provide the guidance and knowledge to help you jumpstart your projects.

50
00:02:47,621 --> 00:02:51,926
The material in this course is succinct and to the point,

51
00:02:51,926 --> 00:02:56,621
so you can easily apply the tools and techniques to your projects.

52
00:02:56,621 --> 00:03:01,386
You will learn the general processes of project management,

53
00:03:01,386 --> 00:03:04,563
such as project planning, control, execution,

54
00:03:04,563 --> 00:03:05,621
and closure.

55
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:08,421
I will highlight the importance of leadership.

56
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:11,621
Leadership and project management are two different things,

57
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:14,445
and both required for successful projects.

58
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:19,621
Lastly, I'll provide the basic knowledge to enhance your career opportunities.

59
00:03:19,621 --> 00:03:23,327
Personally, I started my career as a software engineer,

60
00:03:23,327 --> 00:03:24,563
and evolved, grew,

61
00:03:24,563 --> 00:03:28,871
changed my career path to management and leadership over the years,

62
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:31,871
and I have no regrets, and feel, professionally,

63
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:32,621
more fulfilled.

64
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:39,621
Now let's see what this course is not going to cover.

65
00:03:39,621 --> 00:03:42,798
Now let's talk about what this course is not,

66
00:03:42,798 --> 00:03:45,621
that is, what we will not be covering.

67
00:03:45,621 --> 00:03:50,621
This is not a course to prepare you specifically for a PMP exam.

68
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:55,021
That's a Project Management Professional type of exam,

69
00:03:55,021 --> 00:04:01,621
and is a credential offered by the PMI, the Project Management Institute.

70
00:04:01,621 --> 00:04:07,445
Also, this is not a course on PPM, Project Portfolio Management,

71
00:04:07,445 --> 00:04:11,177
and that's a centralized activity of processes,

72
00:04:11,177 --> 00:04:15,621
methods, and technologies used to manage multiple projects.

73
00:04:15,621 --> 00:04:21,621
And this is not a course on the PMO, the Project Management Office.

74
00:04:21,621 --> 00:04:25,996
That's part of a business that defines and maintains standards

75
00:04:25,996 --> 00:04:28,621
for project management within the organization.

76
00:04:28,621 --> 00:04:32,221
So these are somewhat formal elements of project management,

77
00:04:32,221 --> 00:04:36,621
and there are formal classes you can take and be certified.

78
00:04:36,621 --> 00:04:42,746
This class is more of just plain experience that I've had over multiple years,

79
00:04:42,746 --> 00:04:51,000
multiple projects, multiple customers, very practical, and something you can use and jump on right away.
