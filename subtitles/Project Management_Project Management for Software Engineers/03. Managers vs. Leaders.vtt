00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.402
Now,

2
00:00:02.402 --> 00:00:07.221
I would like to share with you the qualities I have seen

3
00:00:07.221 --> 00:00:09.229
that distinguish managers from leaders.

4
00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:11.015
The difference can seem subtle,

5
00:00:11.015 --> 00:00:14.229
but these examples will help you see the difference.

6
00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:19.492
As an example, before we get started, think about this,

7
00:00:19.492 --> 00:00:24.229
a manager says go, a leader says let's go.

8
00:00:24.229 --> 00:00:31.229
Okay, the first one, working within boundaries versus expanding boundaries.

9
00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:32.129
For example, budget.

10
00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:34.829
A leader would go ask for more get creative.

11
00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.372
A manager may just work within that budget boundary and not think about

12
00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:43.229
asking and moving it forward in a different approach.

13
00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:45.729
Controlling resources versus influencing others.

14
00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:51.229
A leader will need to influence others beyond their direct report.

15
00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:53.104
Remember, as a project manager,

16
00:00:53.104 --> 00:00:55.729
you'll have team members from different organizations

17
00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:58.785
who don't directly work for you, and therefore,

18
00:00:58.785 --> 00:01:04.229
you'll need to use your leadership skills to influence them to a common goal.

19
00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.229
Planning to reach tactical goals versus creating a vision of the future.

20
00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.429
Sure, you'll have tactics you have to meet,

21
00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:17.229
but always with the long term vision of the future in mind.

22
00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.229
Deciding present actions based on the past or precedents versus

23
00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.229
deciding present actions based on the envisioned future.

24
00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.563
Again, the leader is always looking out to the future,

25
00:01:31.563 --> 00:01:34.229
long term, long range strategic.

26
00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:34.667
Next,

27
00:01:34.667 --> 00:01:38.167
waiting for all relevant data before deciding versus

28
00:01:38.167 --> 00:01:41.229
pursuing enough data to decide more quickly,

29
00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.229
and this is where feeling comfortable in gray areas

30
00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.229
is very important as a leader.

31
00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.029
Last,

32
00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:51.829
measuring performance against plans versus assessing

33
00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.229
accomplishment against vision.

34
00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.545
Plans are needed certainly,

35
00:01:56.545 --> 00:02:01.177
but you're always looking at what's accomplished against

36
00:02:01.177 --> 00:02:05.229
a backdrop of the long term vision.

37
00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.229
One of the key and most important attributes of a leader is trust.

38
00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.438
If they trust you they will follow you on all levels.

39
00:02:13.438 --> 00:02:18.896
So here is a quick list of tips on how to build trust with either your customer,

40
00:02:18.896 --> 00:02:22.229
stakeholder, your management, and certainly your team members.

41
00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:25.994
First, have clear and concise and consistent goals.

42
00:02:25.994 --> 00:02:29.759
People want to know what's important and what

43
00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:32.451
activities they should be focused on.

44
00:02:32.451 --> 00:02:34.674
Be open, fair, and listen.

45
00:02:34.674 --> 00:02:38.229
Don't ever show favorites in people or organizations.

46
00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:39.492
Treat everyone equally.

47
00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:40.334
Be decisive.

48
00:02:40.334 --> 00:02:42.019
Don't be wishy washy.

49
00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:48.479
That is why you will need to make quality decisions with little or no data.

50
00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:49.379
Admit mistakes.

51
00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.979
Yep, that's tough, but show you are human,

52
00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:58.502
but also willing to take one for the team.

53
00:02:58.502 --> 00:03:01.775
Support all team members.

54
00:03:01.775 --> 00:03:04.229
Don't exclude anyone.

55
00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:06.229
Take responsibility for team actions.

56
00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:10.229
When the team does great, the team gets the credit.

57
00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:15.582
And when the team doesn't do that well, then you take the responsibility,

58
00:03:15.582 --> 00:03:17.229
no blame to others.

59
00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:19.288
Give credit to team members.

60
00:03:19.288 --> 00:03:24.229
Always thank them and give recognition to team members that deserve it,

61
00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:28.229
either privately, and I even think more effectively,

62
00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:30.229
in front of others.

63
00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:33.729
Be sensitive to the needs of the team members.

64
00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:37.229
Be a good listener and show empathy, real empathy.

65
00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:38.563
Don't fake it.

66
00:03:38.563 --> 00:03:40.785
Respect the opinions of others.

67
00:03:40.785 --> 00:03:45.229
You may not always agree and you don't have to,

68
00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:48.460
but listen and respect their opinions.

69
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.229
Lastly, create a climate that allows empowerment.

70
00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:58.529
Remember, you need to get things done through others.

71
00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:06.229
Remember, the success of the project is all about growing others.

72
00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:08.229
Here is another quote I like about leadership,

73
00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.729
but first,

74
00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:11.509
so now that you have a better understanding of what leadership

75
00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:14.309
is and what it takes to be a good leader,

76
00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:20.598
but the only way to become a good leader is to get in there and give it a try.

77
00:04:20.598 --> 00:04:23.440
So this quote, "Leadership, like swimming,

78
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.755
cannot be learned by reading about it.

79
00:04:26.755 --> 00:04:30.729
" So moving from a software engineering world of

80
00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.792
experiences into the project management and leadership

81
00:04:33.792 --> 00:04:38.079
world is a bit daunting and even scary, but if you try,

82
00:04:38.079 --> 00:04:41.229
you may find greater rewards in your professional development.

83
00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:48.000
Okay, so next are the things I want you to try to practice becoming a better leader.
