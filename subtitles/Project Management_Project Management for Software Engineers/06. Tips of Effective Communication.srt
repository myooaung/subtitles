00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,339
This section contains some helpful tips you could begin

2
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:10,899
using on your projects right away.

3
00:00:10,899 --> 00:00:12,899
Do as you say.

4
00:00:12,899 --> 00:00:15,399
This is all about trust,

5
00:00:15,399 --> 00:00:19,899
which is the bedrock of effective leadership and communication.

6
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:24,399
Your behavior is your single, greatest mode of communication,

7
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:28,899
and it must be congruent with what you say.

8
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:31,299
If your actions don't align with your words,

9
00:00:31,299 --> 00:00:31,899
there's trouble,

10
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:36,399
and it can turn into big trouble if not corrected swiftly and genuinely.

11
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:43,899
Since it's often difficult to see what you say and what you do in yourself,

12
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:48,566
rely on a few trusted colleagues to tell you it straight to

13
00:00:48,566 --> 00:00:50,899
your face and flag any discrepancies.

14
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:52,613
Rule of thumb,

15
00:00:52,613 --> 00:00:58,328
it's better to say nothing or delay your communication until

16
00:00:58,328 --> 00:01:02,899
you're certain that your actions will ring true.

17
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:07,134
When you communicate, try making the complex simple.

18
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:08,193
Your employees,

19
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:13,010
customers are being bombarded 24 by 7 by information

20
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:17,455
making it hard for them to hear you.

21
00:01:17,455 --> 00:01:21,899
Simplicity has never been more powerful or necessary.

22
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:26,399
Effective leaders distill complex thoughts and strategies into simple,

23
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:29,649
memorable terms that colleagues and customers and

24
00:01:29,649 --> 00:01:31,899
stakeholders can grasp and act upon.

25
00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:35,399
If you're having trouble distilling something to its essence,

26
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:39,399
it may be that you don't understand it.

27
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:44,899
Rule of thumb, look out for technical jargon in business speak,

28
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:47,756
which can add complexity.

29
00:01:47,756 --> 00:01:54,899
Say what you mean in as few words as possible.

30
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:57,121
So what is your stride?

31
00:01:57,121 --> 00:02:00,232
If you don't know, let's find it.

32
00:02:00,232 --> 00:02:02,899
Use language that's distinctly your own.

33
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:08,899
People will begin to more easily identify and understand your communications.

34
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:12,010
Let your values comes through in your communication.

35
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,899
Often PMs will opt for the sanitized, kind of corporate,

36
00:02:15,899 --> 00:02:21,252
clean instead of their own because they think the former is more eloquent,

37
00:02:21,252 --> 00:02:22,899
maybe even more appropriate.

38
00:02:22,899 --> 00:02:27,899
This is not to say that correct grammar and use of language aren't important.

39
00:02:27,899 --> 00:02:31,837
Strong leaders know how to string a sentence together.

40
00:02:31,837 --> 00:02:34,899
But don't focus on just the eloquence,

41
00:02:34,899 --> 00:02:38,982
concentrate also on being distinct and real.

42
00:02:38,982 --> 00:02:41,899
People want the real you.

43
00:02:41,899 --> 00:02:44,399
People respect the real you.

44
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:46,899
People follow the real you.

45
00:02:46,899 --> 00:02:50,899
Rule of thumb, don't disguise who you are,

46
00:02:50,899 --> 00:02:57,899
be genuine, and people will respect you for it.

47
00:02:57,899 --> 00:03:00,470
Hopefully people don't have to search you out and

48
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,470
you're in the basement or some cubicle,

49
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,844
so you want to be visible and available to everyone.

50
00:03:05,844 --> 00:03:09,732
Visibility is about letting your key stakeholders get a feel

51
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:12,899
for who you are and what you care about.

52
00:03:12,899 --> 00:03:17,232
You know it's easy to hide behind a computer or send email messages

53
00:03:17,232 --> 00:03:21,499
to others without seeing or interacting with them.

54
00:03:21,499 --> 00:03:23,899
Although e-communications, electronic communications,

55
00:03:23,899 --> 00:03:26,053
serves a valuable purpose,

56
00:03:26,053 --> 00:03:30,899
it is no substitute for face-to-face and voice-to-voice communication,

57
00:03:30,899 --> 00:03:34,899
and I'm going to talk about that more later in a following section.

58
00:03:34,899 --> 00:03:36,162
In today's environment,

59
00:03:36,162 --> 00:03:39,952
people need to feel a personal connection to you

60
00:03:39,952 --> 00:03:42,899
and the work that you believe in,

61
00:03:42,899 --> 00:03:46,717
so do a walk around to make sure you're allocating the time

62
00:03:46,717 --> 00:03:49,899
regularly to be out on the floor or in cubicles,

63
00:03:49,899 --> 00:03:52,699
in the call center, in the computer lab,

64
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,149
or wherever your team or stakeholders reside,

65
00:03:55,149 --> 00:03:59,699
but I will talk more about the walk around later in this module.

66
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:00,749
Rule of thumb,

67
00:04:00,749 --> 00:04:10,899
show your people that you are engaged and care about them and their work.

68
00:04:10,899 --> 00:04:16,438
Listen with your eyes, as well as your ears.

69
00:04:16,438 --> 00:04:18,899
Stop, look, and listen.

70
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:22,788
Good leaders know how to ask good questions and then

71
00:04:22,788 --> 00:04:25,899
listen with both their eyes and their ears.

72
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:28,846
Remember that effective communication is two way.

73
00:04:28,846 --> 00:04:34,774
It's easy to be so focused on getting your message out or persuading others

74
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:40,899
that you don't have time to tune in to what you see and hear.

75
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:43,699
Because you're in a position of authority,

76
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:44,099
typically,

77
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:48,899
the stakes are even higher because you won't always get direct feedback.

78
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:51,808
You need to read between the lines, listen,

79
00:04:51,808 --> 00:04:56,172
and hear what is coming back at you from your team and

80
00:04:56,172 --> 00:04:58,311
your stakeholders and your managers.

81
00:04:58,311 --> 00:05:02,076
So rule of thumb, look for non-verbal cues.

82
00:05:02,076 --> 00:05:04,899
Sometimes in a person's body language,

83
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:07,149
it will tell you everything you need to know,

84
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:08,899
so it's kind of back to face-to-face.

85
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:15,010
It's really hard to get non-verbal cues with emails and telephone,

86
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:15,566
somewhat,

87
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:24,399
but face-to-face you can get quite a bit and it's so important to really get

88
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:29,899
a feel for the reaction to your communication content.

89
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:31,232
Always be enthusiastic.

90
00:05:31,232 --> 00:05:33,455
I know that's pretty tough.

91
00:05:33,455 --> 00:05:40,172
I find it hard even myself to always be enthusiastic, but check out this quote.

92
00:05:40,172 --> 00:05:44,717
"Success is the ability to go from one failure to

93
00:05:44,717 --> 00:05:47,445
another with no loss of enthusiasm.

94
00:05:47,445 --> 00:05:49,677
" Okay, by Winston Churchill.

95
00:05:49,677 --> 00:05:54,566
This guy had one failure after another during World War II,

96
00:05:54,566 --> 00:05:57,982
and without his enthusiasm and drive, the UK,

97
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,899
the British Isles was lost for sure.

98
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:02,741
So let's read this again.

99
00:06:02,741 --> 00:06:07,899
Even with say, three failures, or maybe a better word would be say setbacks,

100
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:11,455
in a row, can I still be successful?

101
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:15,899
I think you can as long as you are enthusiastic.

102
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:21,899
So rule of thumb for enthusiasm, don't be discouraged when things don't go well.

103
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:35,000
Your team will pick up on that and it will affect the productivity of your team. Okay, now let's move on to what I call the five Cs.
