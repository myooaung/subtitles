00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.811
In this section,

2
00:00:02.811 --> 00:00:07.408
we will look at many tools that are used in communication that you may use as a

3
00:00:07.408 --> 00:00:09.843
project manager to help you maximize your communications.

4
00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:13.948
Also, we want to keep in mind the five Cs we learned before.

5
00:00:13.948 --> 00:00:19.948
Okay, let's get started.

6
00:00:19.948 --> 00:00:23.948
Here is an overview of the communication tools that I'll be speaking about.

7
00:00:23.948 --> 00:00:27.221
On the left, they'll be more physical, that is I see you.

8
00:00:27.221 --> 00:00:29.948
You're going to be in the presence of the people

9
00:00:29.948 --> 00:00:31.698
themselves that you're communicating with.

10
00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:36.948
And on the right will be what I call my 1s and 0s communication tools.

11
00:00:36.948 --> 00:00:40.073
On the left then are presentations where you're going to

12
00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:43.734
be physically in the room presenting, meetings where you're physically there,

13
00:00:43.734 --> 00:00:46.948
of course, web conferencing, not physically there per say,

14
00:00:46.948 --> 00:00:50.948
but you still see people, talk to people,

15
00:00:50.948 --> 00:00:52.948
stand ups, and walk-arounds.

16
00:00:52.948 --> 00:00:58.548
On the right, status reports, email, telephone,

17
00:00:58.548 --> 00:01:02.548
somewhat physical, instant messaging, texting,

18
00:01:02.548 --> 00:01:04.948
and social media.

19
00:01:04.948 --> 00:01:08.948
Okay, let's get started.

20
00:01:08.948 --> 00:01:09.212
Presentations.

21
00:01:09.212 --> 00:01:11.317
This is on the physical side, of course,

22
00:01:11.317 --> 00:01:15.212
and maybe even one of the most physical because you're front and center.

23
00:01:15.212 --> 00:01:15.633
Okay,

24
00:01:15.633 --> 00:01:20.264
I'd like you to have the outcome in mind before you

25
00:01:20.264 --> 00:01:21.948
start writing your presentation.

26
00:01:21.948 --> 00:01:26.948
Know exactly what you want to accomplish by giving the presentation.

27
00:01:26.948 --> 00:01:29.282
Open with something surprising or intriguing,

28
00:01:29.282 --> 00:01:33.948
something that will get your audience to sit up and take notice.

29
00:01:33.948 --> 00:01:34.748
Very important.

30
00:01:34.748 --> 00:01:36.348
You want their attention.

31
00:01:36.348 --> 00:01:41.948
Ensure they understand why they are there and what outcome is expected of them.

32
00:01:41.948 --> 00:01:44.176
Remember, you are presenting for a reason.

33
00:01:44.176 --> 00:01:47.358
Keep that in mind and focus the slide's content and

34
00:01:47.358 --> 00:01:48.948
your delivery on the outcome.

35
00:01:48.948 --> 00:01:50.767
Maintain good eye contact.

36
00:01:50.767 --> 00:01:53.948
This creates a connection with your audience.

37
00:01:53.948 --> 00:01:57.282
And do not hand out the presentation in the beginning,

38
00:01:57.282 --> 00:01:58.948
you will lose your audience.

39
00:01:58.948 --> 00:02:01.698
They'll start flipping through it and maybe even go to the

40
00:02:01.698 --> 00:02:03.948
last slide to see what the budget will be.

41
00:02:03.948 --> 00:02:07.079
So you'll have a stack of it on the side and say,

42
00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.948
hey, I'll be handing this out when my presentation is over.

43
00:02:09.948 --> 00:02:12.171
Also, engage with your audience.

44
00:02:12.171 --> 00:02:13.948
You know, encourage questions.

45
00:02:13.948 --> 00:02:15.596
This ensures better understanding.

46
00:02:15.596 --> 00:02:18.890
And maybe pause throughout the presentation to say,

47
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.948
hey, are there any questions?

48
00:02:20.948 --> 00:02:27.948
And lastly of course, follow the five Cs.

49
00:02:27.948 --> 00:02:28.448
Meetings.

50
00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:32.948
I know we all love them, but no agenda?

51
00:02:32.948 --> 00:02:33.948
No meeting.

52
00:02:33.948 --> 00:02:34.948
No exception.

53
00:02:34.948 --> 00:02:38.410
Otherwise you are wasting everyone's time, including your own.

54
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.948
So create an agenda.

55
00:02:39.948 --> 00:02:40.948
And remember,

56
00:02:40.948 --> 00:02:47.948
an agenda is a very powerful tool in guiding the meeting and its outcome.

57
00:02:47.948 --> 00:02:49.872
So, know your expected outcome.

58
00:02:49.872 --> 00:02:52.948
What do you want out of the meeting?

59
00:02:52.948 --> 00:02:56.548
Make sure your agenda reflects exactly what you want.

60
00:02:56.548 --> 00:02:56.948
So,

61
00:02:56.948 --> 00:03:01.398
list items to discuss and ensure in that list of items

62
00:03:01.398 --> 00:03:04.098
that your outcome could be realized.

63
00:03:04.098 --> 00:03:09.948
Determine who needs to be there, how you would like them to contribute,

64
00:03:09.948 --> 00:03:12.948
and don't leave out any key subject matter,

65
00:03:12.948 --> 00:03:15.948
experts, or stakeholders because you'll need their inputs.

66
00:03:15.948 --> 00:03:18.301
Send out the agenda prior to the meeting,

67
00:03:18.301 --> 00:03:20.948
make sure everyone knows what the meeting will cover,

68
00:03:20.948 --> 00:03:23.130
and they'll all see who will be attending,

69
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.676
as well.

70
00:03:23.676 --> 00:03:27.323
You are also the focus of the meeting or even the center of

71
00:03:27.323 --> 00:03:29.573
attention when you're leading the meeting.

72
00:03:29.573 --> 00:03:32.948
No matter how interesting you think your agenda is,

73
00:03:32.948 --> 00:03:35.054
they will be watching you,

74
00:03:35.054 --> 00:03:38.843
so maintain good eye contact and this creates a

75
00:03:38.843 --> 00:03:40.948
connection again with your attendees.

76
00:03:40.948 --> 00:03:42.596
Document actions and outcomes.

77
00:03:42.596 --> 00:03:45.478
So while the meeting is being conducted,

78
00:03:45.478 --> 00:03:48.872
capture the meeting notes and maybe afterwards you want to

79
00:03:48.872 --> 00:03:50.948
clean up those notes before you send them out.

80
00:03:50.948 --> 00:03:52.039
If you need to,

81
00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:55.039
bring a person with you to capture the notes in case

82
00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:56.948
you are very busy in the meeting.

83
00:03:56.948 --> 00:04:00.948
Stay on track, that is stay on the agenda, and manage any wasted chitchat.

84
00:04:00.948 --> 00:04:05.948
I call it chitchat, just idle talk that can be very distractive in the meeting.

85
00:04:05.948 --> 00:04:07.221
Okay, the meeting notes.

86
00:04:07.221 --> 00:04:11.358
You want to know who attended and who did not since this will

87
00:04:11.358 --> 00:04:14.767
also be part of your email of the notes,

88
00:04:14.767 --> 00:04:17.948
whatever agreements were made you capture those.

89
00:04:17.948 --> 00:04:22.312
You capture all the actions that were agreed to in terms of who will do the

90
00:04:22.312 --> 00:04:25.102
action and when the expected action will be complete.

91
00:04:25.102 --> 00:04:28.948
And lastly, hey, when's the next meeting date and time.

92
00:04:28.948 --> 00:04:34.948
Also, don't forget the five Cs.

93
00:04:34.948 --> 00:04:35.685
Web conferencing.

94
00:04:35.685 --> 00:04:40.106
We've all done it and it's great, but it's still a meeting,

95
00:04:40.106 --> 00:04:45.025
so follow the meeting guidelines that I set forth on the previous slide.

96
00:04:45.025 --> 00:04:46.948
Saves travel cost and time.

97
00:04:46.948 --> 00:04:47.323
Certainly,

98
00:04:47.323 --> 00:04:51.823
web conferencing saves businesses time and money and within a few minutes,

99
00:04:51.823 --> 00:04:55.301
meeting attendees can log in to a meeting without wasting time

100
00:04:55.301 --> 00:04:57.948
at the airport or spending money on a ticket.

101
00:04:57.948 --> 00:05:00.837
I save lots of time myself by not having to sit in traffic,

102
00:05:00.837 --> 00:05:01.948
even for a local client.

103
00:05:01.948 --> 00:05:03.348
Increases work efficiency.

104
00:05:03.348 --> 00:05:06.615
Scheduling meetings typically takes more time than

105
00:05:06.615 --> 00:05:08.948
simply inviting or mandating attendees.

106
00:05:08.948 --> 00:05:12.106
If you're the host, which you'll likely be as a project manager,

107
00:05:12.106 --> 00:05:13.948
you'll have to book a conference room.

108
00:05:13.948 --> 00:05:17.548
It seems like now days, there are fewer and fewer conference rooms,

109
00:05:17.548 --> 00:05:22.282
so maybe a web conference is perfect and it's a little easier to do.

110
00:05:22.282 --> 00:05:22.671
Flexible.

111
00:05:22.671 --> 00:05:26.171
Sometimes it can be difficult to hold impromptu meetings

112
00:05:26.171 --> 00:05:30.448
when people you need to meet are not local.

113
00:05:30.448 --> 00:05:33.948
Web conferencing provides, of course, that flexibility.

114
00:05:33.948 --> 00:05:35.948
Reduces, but doesn't eliminate geographic barriers,

115
00:05:35.948 --> 00:05:39.823
since anyone with an internet connection and a computer can attend,

116
00:05:39.823 --> 00:05:40.698
it's perfect.

117
00:05:40.698 --> 00:05:43.761
Web conferencing opens up possibilities for communication

118
00:05:43.761 --> 00:05:45.948
with employees and customers worldwide.

119
00:05:45.948 --> 00:05:50.039
We've all used it and we all know that.

120
00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:50.948
Increases engagement.

121
00:05:50.948 --> 00:05:52.377
With the audio and visual components,

122
00:05:52.377 --> 00:05:54.996
it's very much like a regular meeting and I'm sure most

123
00:05:54.996 --> 00:05:57.596
of you use this format all the time.

124
00:05:57.596 --> 00:06:00.066
Now, every company might be different.

125
00:06:00.066 --> 00:06:03.872
Some companies have an approved web conferencing tool, others don't.

126
00:06:03.872 --> 00:06:06.948
Many are out there that are free you can use.

127
00:06:06.948 --> 00:06:09.221
But remember it's a meeting,

128
00:06:09.221 --> 00:06:16.948
so have an agenda and run it like a meeting and always follow the five Cs check.

129
00:06:16.948 --> 00:06:20.698
Now, I think sometimes web conferencing can have a downside.

130
00:06:20.698 --> 00:06:25.282
You don't have real eye contact, you can't observe the body language,

131
00:06:25.282 --> 00:06:28.782
and maybe those other sidebar talks and other little

132
00:06:28.782 --> 00:06:31.115
face-to-faces you have won't be there.

133
00:06:31.115 --> 00:06:36.948
So what I'd like to suggest to you is what kind of meeting is this?

134
00:06:36.948 --> 00:06:40.296
If you need a customer buy-in, if this is a critical,

135
00:06:40.296 --> 00:06:44.548
critical meeting, try as hard as you can to have it as a face-to-face.

136
00:06:44.548 --> 00:06:48.448
If it's kind of a more of a status meeting or let's go

137
00:06:48.448 --> 00:06:52.419
over some requirements real quick, web conferencing can probably work just fine,

138
00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:55.948
but don't overuse web conferencing when you need that eye-to-eye

139
00:06:55.948 --> 00:07:03.948
contact or real critical decision to be made.

140
00:07:03.948 --> 00:07:08.348
Even if you don't use an agile methodology or scrum,

141
00:07:08.348 --> 00:07:14.948
stand ups is a great tool and easy to learn and apply for your team.

142
00:07:14.948 --> 00:07:15.806
What is it?

143
00:07:15.806 --> 00:07:18.948
It's just a quick discussion with your small team or group.

144
00:07:18.948 --> 00:07:20.698
Okay, quick means 5 to 10 minutes.

145
00:07:20.698 --> 00:07:23.198
It shouldn't be any longer, otherwise, it's a real meeting,

146
00:07:23.198 --> 00:07:25.948
and they want you to have an agenda, etc.

147
00:07:25.948 --> 00:07:27.948
And stand up means just that.

148
00:07:27.948 --> 00:07:30.948
No sitting, unless you have some sort of handicap,

149
00:07:30.948 --> 00:07:34.504
certainly, and they can be planned or spontaneous.

150
00:07:34.504 --> 00:07:38.948
I do both based on the nature of the issue.

151
00:07:38.948 --> 00:07:41.282
Stand ups have a lot of benefits.

152
00:07:41.282 --> 00:07:44.282
You can get real time feedback on project activities,

153
00:07:44.282 --> 00:07:48.198
and again, you can see the eye contact and body language,

154
00:07:48.198 --> 00:07:51.948
and you're close, you're just standing next to each other.

155
00:07:51.948 --> 00:07:52.872
I like that.

156
00:07:52.872 --> 00:07:55.948
We want to do early avoidance of issues or problems.

157
00:07:55.948 --> 00:08:00.948
Remember, early detection of issues is one of your methods for success.

158
00:08:00.948 --> 00:08:06.403
And you get a really good pulse and feel for the team in a very

159
00:08:06.403 --> 00:08:09.573
somewhat informal atmosphere and I like that as well,

160
00:08:09.573 --> 00:08:12.386
and I think your team would appreciate that too.

161
00:08:12.386 --> 00:08:13.948
So here's how it works.

162
00:08:13.948 --> 00:08:18.948
So basically go quickly around the room or around the area you're standing in.

163
00:08:18.948 --> 00:08:21.082
You might ask, what have you done yesterday?

164
00:08:21.082 --> 00:08:22.948
Oh, I've worked on this or that.

165
00:08:22.948 --> 00:08:24.698
What are you planning to do today?

166
00:08:24.698 --> 00:08:26.948
Oh, I'm planning on working on this or that.

167
00:08:26.948 --> 00:08:29.448
Do you have any problems preventing you from

168
00:08:29.448 --> 00:08:31.948
accomplishing your goal or goals for the day?

169
00:08:31.948 --> 00:08:37.091
Okay, this sedative communication dialogue truly creates synergy,

170
00:08:37.091 --> 00:08:40.948
teamwork, and what I call, magic.

171
00:08:40.948 --> 00:08:43.419
In that, you can determine issues early,

172
00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:46.948
avoid bugs, create better teamwork, and show that you care.

173
00:08:46.948 --> 00:08:50.633
Remember, that is a trait of leadership.

174
00:08:50.633 --> 00:08:51.159
Frequency.

175
00:08:51.159 --> 00:08:56.948
You know as needed, but maybe once or twice a week.

176
00:08:56.948 --> 00:08:57.615
It depends.

177
00:08:57.615 --> 00:09:00.615
If you think things are drifting or are critical,

178
00:09:00.615 --> 00:09:03.948
then daily, maybe even twice a day in certain cases.

179
00:09:03.948 --> 00:09:05.198
Don't be shy.

180
00:09:05.198 --> 00:09:06.448
Don't overdo it.

181
00:09:06.448 --> 00:09:08.948
Find the right balance for yourself.

182
00:09:08.948 --> 00:09:10.853
And also, the five Cs.

183
00:09:10.853 --> 00:09:15.044
They may not all apply here because this is a little

184
00:09:15.044 --> 00:09:19.806
more of an informal arrangement, but many of them might.

185
00:09:19.806 --> 00:09:23.806
But think about it and consider it.

186
00:09:23.806 --> 00:09:28.948
Now that we've been standing, let's start walking around.

187
00:09:28.948 --> 00:09:31.948
Walk-arounds create opportunities for impromptu communication.

188
00:09:31.948 --> 00:09:36.837
You and a team will benefit from literally walking around.

189
00:09:36.837 --> 00:09:39.060
These are casual drop-in visits,

190
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:43.948
maybe just three minutes on the way to lunch or break.

191
00:09:43.948 --> 00:09:47.948
Basically, you want to see if you can catch someone in their office.

192
00:09:47.948 --> 00:09:51.282
And if you can, you want to visit or talk to them,

193
00:09:51.282 --> 00:09:52.948
possibly each team member every day.

194
00:09:52.948 --> 00:09:57.948
I try to hit each of my team members every day for just a minute or two.

195
00:09:57.948 --> 00:10:03.948
Possibly, my customers maybe once a week I like to do a casual drop-in.

196
00:10:03.948 --> 00:10:06.032
Stakeholders, maybe twice a month.

197
00:10:06.032 --> 00:10:08.948
You come up with your own timeframe.

198
00:10:08.948 --> 00:10:13.948
And with your own personal manager, I would say certainly, each day.

199
00:10:13.948 --> 00:10:16.091
Now if you're not in the same geographic area,

200
00:10:16.091 --> 00:10:18.948
of course, you might want to use the phone and just hey,

201
00:10:18.948 --> 00:10:19.738
how's it going?

202
00:10:19.738 --> 00:10:20.264
What's up?

203
00:10:20.264 --> 00:10:23.159
Don't use the phone necessarily for a meeting or a conference,

204
00:10:23.159 --> 00:10:26.748
you're just going to use it as a casual drop-in.

205
00:10:26.748 --> 00:10:31.948
Now in this form of communication, the five Cs may not completely apply,

206
00:10:31.948 --> 00:10:36.212
but of course, you always need to be courteous.

207
00:10:36.212 --> 00:10:40.948
Now the walk-around is spontaneous ad hoc and flexible to

208
00:10:40.948 --> 00:10:47.948
create a new communication platform, but be careful to not be disruptive.

209
00:10:47.948 --> 00:10:50.748
The higher you are though up in the org chart,

210
00:10:50.748 --> 00:10:54.948
if you will, the more flat they will feel when you poke your head in.

211
00:10:54.948 --> 00:10:57.615
But again, be careful, you can be disruptive.

212
00:10:57.615 --> 00:11:00.282
If they're busy and their head's down, cranking,

213
00:11:00.282 --> 00:11:05.403
pass that, maybe in the next hour or two you can drop in and say hello.

214
00:11:05.403 --> 00:11:06.358
Your project team,

215
00:11:06.358 --> 00:11:09.713
people you work with will greatly appreciate the casual drop-in,

216
00:11:09.713 --> 00:11:13.948
how are you doing, what's going on, what are you working on.

217
00:11:13.948 --> 00:11:17.948
People appreciate that interaction.

218
00:11:17.948 --> 00:11:22.000
It shows that you care. It shows that you are a leader.
