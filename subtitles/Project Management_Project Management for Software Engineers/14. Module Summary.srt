1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,643
Well, we've made it across the finish line.

2
00:00:04,643 --> 00:00:06,955
We have executed and finished our project.

3
00:00:06,955 --> 00:00:12,500
Let's do a summary wrap up.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,228
Let's now summarize the project execution module.

5
00:00:16,228 --> 00:00:19,423
We discussed three key areas, leadership,

6
00:00:19,423 --> 00:00:21,555
effective communication, and relationship management.

7
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:25,555
You must find ways to engage people and stir their

8
00:00:25,555 --> 00:00:27,479
commitment to the project's goals.

9
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:28,622
As a leader,

10
00:00:28,622 --> 00:00:33,955
a project's success will be all about growing others and one of the key

11
00:00:33,955 --> 00:00:37,105
and most important attributes of a leader is trust.

12
00:00:37,105 --> 00:00:40,955
If they trust you, they will follow you on all levels.

13
00:00:40,955 --> 00:00:44,434
So why would anyone want to be led by you?

14
00:00:44,434 --> 00:00:45,477
Will they follow?

15
00:00:45,477 --> 00:00:48,955
Well here are three key behaviors of a good leader.

16
00:00:48,955 --> 00:00:52,955
One, real leaders empathize fiercely with the people they lead.

17
00:00:52,955 --> 00:00:56,955
They also care intensely about the work their employees do.

18
00:00:56,955 --> 00:00:57,289
Two,

19
00:00:57,289 --> 00:01:00,289
another quality of good leaders is that they capitalize

20
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:01,955
on what's unique about themselves,

21
00:01:01,955 --> 00:01:05,768
so what makes sense to you about what makes you a leader.

22
00:01:05,768 --> 00:01:07,955
So what makes you a special leader?

23
00:01:07,955 --> 00:01:08,830
Your expertise?

24
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,143
Your honesty, integrity?

25
00:01:10,143 --> 00:01:11,893
Next and number three,

26
00:01:11,893 --> 00:01:16,109
people do not commit to project managers who merely live

27
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,801
up to the obligations of their jobs.

28
00:01:18,801 --> 00:01:19,955
They want more.

29
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:24,455
They want someone who cares passionately about the people and the work,

30
00:01:24,455 --> 00:01:25,955
just like they do.

31
00:01:25,955 --> 00:01:30,233
Effective communication is all about getting the right information to the

32
00:01:30,233 --> 00:01:34,838
right people at the right time and using the right method.

33
00:01:34,838 --> 00:01:39,073
Other great communication tips are do as you say,

34
00:01:39,073 --> 00:01:42,376
make the complex simple, find your stride,

35
00:01:42,376 --> 00:01:46,166
be available and visible, be a good listener,

36
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:49,955
and always be enthusiastic even in tough times.

37
00:01:49,955 --> 00:01:51,355
The five Cs.

38
00:01:51,355 --> 00:01:56,955
Be clear, that is be transparent and able to be easily comprehended.

39
00:01:56,955 --> 00:01:57,717
Be concise.

40
00:01:57,717 --> 00:02:02,289
Use as few words as possible to get the necessary information or

41
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,955
compressed information in order to be brief.

42
00:02:04,955 --> 00:02:06,340
And be courteous.

43
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,955
Be polite in a way that shows consideration for others.

44
00:02:10,955 --> 00:02:11,797
Be consistent.

45
00:02:11,797 --> 00:02:16,429
Be able to maintain a particular standard or repeat a particular

46
00:02:16,429 --> 00:02:18,955
activity or artifact with minimal variation.

47
00:02:18,955 --> 00:02:20,511
And lastly, be compelling.

48
00:02:20,511 --> 00:02:25,566
We want your readers or listeners to your messages be attracted to your

49
00:02:25,566 --> 00:02:28,263
message and encourage strong interest and attention.

50
00:02:28,263 --> 00:02:30,955
Then we talked about the five Ps.

51
00:02:30,955 --> 00:02:35,109
These are the characteristics of a project manager for

52
00:02:35,109 --> 00:02:36,955
delivering great customer service.

53
00:02:36,955 --> 00:02:38,571
First is provider.

54
00:02:38,571 --> 00:02:43,955
You will provide the needs and desires of your customer.

55
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,779
You are focused on their needs.

56
00:02:46,779 --> 00:02:47,249
Promptness.

57
00:02:47,249 --> 00:02:51,955
Promises for delivery of your services must be on time.

58
00:02:51,955 --> 00:02:52,393
Politeness.

59
00:02:52,393 --> 00:02:56,330
Politeness and good manners not only with your customers,

60
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,955
but every one you deal with.

61
00:02:58,955 --> 00:03:02,330
This builds your quality and character.

62
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:06,830
Professionalism shows the customer they're cared for and

63
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:10,426
this builds trust in you and your team.

64
00:03:10,426 --> 00:03:10,838
Personalization.

65
00:03:10,838 --> 00:03:14,132
Using the customer's name is very effective in

66
00:03:14,132 --> 00:03:17,955
producing a connection with each other.

67
00:03:17,955 --> 00:03:20,955
Lastly, managing customer expectations.

68
00:03:20,955 --> 00:03:23,355
Yep, and it is very challenging.

69
00:03:23,355 --> 00:03:26,555
And you may be sailing into uncharted waters,

70
00:03:26,555 --> 00:03:30,592
such as gray areas where there is no right or wrong answer,

71
00:03:30,592 --> 00:03:34,137
but there is a need to find a place that everyone is comfortable

72
00:03:34,137 --> 00:03:37,455
with so things can continue to move forward.

73
00:03:37,455 --> 00:03:38,955
Also, political smarts.

74
00:03:38,955 --> 00:03:41,955
Know your organization and who's who.

75
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:46,129
Get out that org chart and figure out who are the influencers that you may need

76
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:50,155
to work with to help you get your project done successfully.

77
00:03:50,155 --> 00:03:52,355
Last, get to win-win.

78
00:03:52,355 --> 00:03:58,955
Remember, it's not your way or my way, it's a better way,

79
00:03:58,955 --> 00:04:03,955
so work towards all parties where they feel good about the decisions being made.

80
00:04:03,955 --> 00:04:05,955
Okay, that wraps up this module.

81
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:08,289
In the next module and final module,

82
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:16,000
we will discuss project closure and do a course summary. See you in the next module.
