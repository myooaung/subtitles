00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.763
Variance Elements.

2
00:00:02.763 --> 00:00:06.960
Now there is no limit on what variance elements can be.

3
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.960
It is up to you to pick those elements that would be the most

4
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.293
meaningful to you and of course your stakeholders as well,

5
00:00:14.293 --> 00:00:15.627
so choose wisely.

6
00:00:15.627 --> 00:00:20.960
Common one is certainly money or budget; that should always be one.

7
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.233
Time, schedule; that's always very important.

8
00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:26.960
Maybe mean time to repair.

9
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.531
You're measuring how long it takes your team to fix a bug.

10
00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:34.960
Average bugs per week might be something you measure.

11
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.666
Number of employees per quarter maybe that you're measuring and

12
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:42.960
monitoring as part of the overall project.

13
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.960
You want to come up with what your variance elements should be for your project.

14
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.293
Now,

15
00:00:47.293 --> 00:00:50.293
you don't want a thousand variance elements because you'll

16
00:00:50.293 --> 00:00:52.960
spend all day just keeping track of those,

17
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.960
and one element won't be enough, so maybe about a half a dozen or so.

18
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.806
But again, it's flexible,

19
00:00:58.806 --> 00:01:02.960
and it's what's meaningful to you and your stakeholders.

20
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.195
Now the only way to know you're on track is to,

21
00:01:06.195 --> 00:01:07.960
of course, first start baseline values.

22
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.960
In other words, what should the actual value be for your variance element?

23
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.674
So what does the value say for money?

24
00:01:14.674 --> 00:01:15.960
The budget is a million dollars.

25
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.729
That's a baseline value.

26
00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:24.960
Okay, so let's define those on the next slide.

27
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.027
Baseline Values.

28
00:01:26.027 --> 00:01:31.893
So giving baseline values to your variance elements is very important

29
00:01:31.893 --> 00:01:36.136
because that's your starting point for your project.

30
00:01:36.136 --> 00:01:37.195
So again,

31
00:01:37.195 --> 00:01:43.031
it's your original planned value or target prior to launching your project.

32
00:01:43.031 --> 00:01:45.174
That's what a baseline value is.

33
00:01:45.174 --> 00:01:46.960
Okay, so here's an example.

34
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.221
I have a task, it's planned to take 100 hours and be completed by June 2nd,

35
00:01:53.221 --> 00:01:59.276
so my planned value is 100 hours, and my planned target is June 2nd.

36
00:01:59.276 --> 00:02:04.013
So I might translate that into the following baseline values,

37
00:02:04.013 --> 00:02:09.773
hours 100, dollars $8, 000 because maybe the rate is $80 per hour,

38
00:02:09.773 --> 00:02:11.960
and a baseline end date.

39
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.693
So those are my starting baseline elements,

40
00:02:15.693 --> 00:02:19.960
and as the project progresses I track actual.

41
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.460
Where are my actual hours, maybe there at 20,

42
00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.960
where are my actual dollars, and where's my date?

43
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.817
And then I look at the difference or the variance,

44
00:02:31.817 --> 00:02:55.000
and that's how I look at variances and report against that. Okay, we're going to talk about this in much more detail on the following slides.
