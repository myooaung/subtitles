1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,100
Issue Management.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,948
That's the activity of a identifying, tracking,

3
00:00:06,948 --> 00:00:11,346
and resolving issues that could affect the project.

4
00:00:11,346 --> 00:00:12,937
There will always be issues,

5
00:00:12,937 --> 00:00:17,391
and you will need to manage and track each and every one of them,

6
00:00:17,391 --> 00:00:23,346
and let's see how we'll do that.

7
00:00:23,346 --> 00:00:25,346
Why do issue management you ask?

8
00:00:25,346 --> 00:00:28,679
It is not if things will go wrong, but when,

9
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:34,146
so you must stay on top of any and all items that could be potential

10
00:00:34,146 --> 00:00:37,346
issues or just plain problems for your project.

11
00:00:37,346 --> 00:00:39,241
So what are issues?

12
00:00:39,241 --> 00:00:44,925
Issues are events that have occurred that will adversely impact your project,

13
00:00:44,925 --> 00:00:46,346
any issue whatsoever.

14
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:50,096
That means that all these must be resolved or they

15
00:00:50,096 --> 00:00:52,346
will in fact impact your project.

16
00:00:52,346 --> 00:01:00,346
Remember from before risks are potential issues that you're keeping a track on.

17
00:01:00,346 --> 00:01:04,624
Remember risks are potential issues that you're keeping an eye on,

18
00:01:04,624 --> 00:01:07,346
and they wouldn't fall under issue management.

19
00:01:07,346 --> 00:01:07,624
Okay,

20
00:01:07,624 --> 00:01:10,402
the most common issue you're going to manage certainly in

21
00:01:10,402 --> 00:01:12,346
software development is going to be bugs.

22
00:01:12,346 --> 00:01:14,446
These are defects of any issue.

23
00:01:14,446 --> 00:01:18,296
The system blows up, the button is in the wrong place,

24
00:01:18,296 --> 00:01:20,396
the data's not handled right, whatever,

25
00:01:20,396 --> 00:01:24,946
so these are the most common types of issues you're going to manage,

26
00:01:24,946 --> 00:01:26,346
and they're the bugs.

27
00:01:26,346 --> 00:01:26,909
Okay,

28
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:35,346
now let's look at an example of an issue management process that you can use.

29
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:41,346
As with all of our project control elements, we always have a process, okay.

30
00:01:41,346 --> 00:01:46,402
In the case of issue management, we always want to identify the issue,

31
00:01:46,402 --> 00:01:49,203
record and document the issue, track the issue.

32
00:01:49,203 --> 00:01:49,775
And again,

33
00:01:49,775 --> 00:01:52,917
we can track it in a spreadsheet or a bug tracking

34
00:01:52,917 --> 00:01:55,619
system or an issue tracking system, web-based,

35
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,801
cloud-based, whatever works for you.

36
00:01:58,801 --> 00:02:01,346
Always do regular reviews.

37
00:02:01,346 --> 00:02:05,052
This could be in your normal project planning meeting.

38
00:02:05,052 --> 00:02:08,346
We want to have them resolved or reassigned.

39
00:02:08,346 --> 00:02:10,654
For example, is this issue complete?

40
00:02:10,654 --> 00:02:11,423
It's resolved.

41
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,346
It might not be complete.

42
00:02:13,346 --> 00:02:17,346
Maybe the Q/A process found it still failing; therefore,

43
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:21,346
it gets reassigned back to the software engineering team.

44
00:02:21,346 --> 00:02:24,013
And we always want to communicate the issues,

45
00:02:24,013 --> 00:02:27,346
and they may be communicated in a variety of ways.

46
00:02:27,346 --> 00:02:30,158
We want to communicate them to the software engineering

47
00:02:30,158 --> 00:02:32,346
team so they know what to resolve.

48
00:02:32,346 --> 00:02:35,346
We want to communicate to management, but maybe not the details.

49
00:02:35,346 --> 00:02:35,982
For example,

50
00:02:35,982 --> 00:02:39,482
we may want to communicate we have 28 open items or

51
00:02:39,482 --> 00:02:45,146
we've solved 13 items last week, we have 4 items open this week,

52
00:02:45,146 --> 00:02:49,346
high-level issue management statuses to management.

53
00:02:49,346 --> 00:02:57,346
Okay, but also we may have to communicate back to the requirement.

54
00:02:57,346 --> 00:02:59,568
So not only will we communicate to management,

55
00:02:59,568 --> 00:03:02,746
we may also need to communicate back to the requirements management

56
00:03:02,746 --> 00:03:08,346
part of one of our key activities because the issues and how they get

57
00:03:08,346 --> 00:03:10,346
resolved may affect the requirements.

58
00:03:10,346 --> 00:03:10,846
Also,

59
00:03:10,846 --> 00:03:15,346
the issues and how they get resolved might affect

60
00:03:15,346 --> 00:03:17,346
configuration management as well.

61
00:03:17,346 --> 00:03:19,796
And lastly, based on the particular issue,

62
00:03:19,796 --> 00:03:22,596
it might enlighten us to a potential risk,

63
00:03:22,596 --> 00:03:30,457
and we want to start tracking that risk in our risk management process as well.

64
00:03:30,457 --> 00:03:35,346
Okay, now let's look at a simple example.

65
00:03:35,346 --> 00:03:37,346
Here's a sample issue tracking log.

66
00:03:37,346 --> 00:03:41,346
Issues can easily be tracked in a spreadsheet or a web-based system.

67
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:45,624
I like web-based so others can easily see what's going on,

68
00:03:45,624 --> 00:03:48,346
but a spreadsheet will do just fine.

69
00:03:48,346 --> 00:03:52,471
Usually have a unique issue ID so we can track and

70
00:03:52,471 --> 00:03:54,346
easily identify the particular issue.

71
00:03:54,346 --> 00:03:59,346
We give it a name, maybe even a short phrase, maybe even a description.

72
00:03:59,346 --> 00:04:00,170
The type.

73
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,640
Maybe it's software, hardware, people, management,

74
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,346
or if it's software maybe there's three or four

75
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,925
different modules in your system,

76
00:04:07,925 --> 00:04:11,399
and maybe you give it a type for each particular module,

77
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:16,079
some way to categorize and easily identify a collection of issues.

78
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,879
Priority is always important, low, medium,

79
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:23,346
high, and of course hot, got to get it done right away.

80
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,528
The date that is was logged,

81
00:04:25,528 --> 00:04:29,269
maybe some notes about some additional information or maybe a

82
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,346
screen shot or references and things like that.

83
00:04:32,346 --> 00:04:34,679
And a status, open, assigned, closed.

84
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:38,568
Open, it's not worked on yet; assigned, it's in progress,

85
00:04:38,568 --> 00:04:41,013
it's being worked; and closed, it's resolved.

86
00:04:41,013 --> 00:04:44,679
Of course you can add many other attributes that would be

87
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:46,203
important to your particular project.

88
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:50,203
As long as you have an issue tracking system and an issue tracking log,

89
00:04:50,203 --> 00:04:54,528
keep an eye on your issues, you'll be doing just fine,

90
00:04:54,528 --> 00:05:01,346
and it'll be very helpful of course for the success of your project as well.

91
00:05:01,346 --> 00:05:02,596
Okay, if you want,

92
00:05:02,596 --> 00:05:06,346
you can probably track issues and risks in the same logging system.

93
00:05:06,346 --> 00:05:08,872
That might be easier to do, consolidate both.

94
00:05:08,872 --> 00:05:13,124
But again, the kinds of things that reflect in tracking are slightly different,

95
00:05:13,124 --> 00:05:17,402
but to save on having multiple systems or multiple logs you

96
00:05:17,402 --> 00:05:24,000
might be able to integrate the two together, and that'd be just fine as well.
