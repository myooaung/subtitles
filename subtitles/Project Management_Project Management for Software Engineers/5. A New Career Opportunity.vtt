00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.063
Today, you may be at the crossroad of a new career opportunity.

2
00:00:07.063 --> 00:00:10.830
So, augment your technical skills with project management skills.

3
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.948
It is much harder to outsource project managers than it

4
00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:17.195
is to outsource software engineers, so,

5
00:00:17.195 --> 00:00:20.195
more job security because you are closer to the business,

6
00:00:20.195 --> 00:00:24.095
you are closer to the leaders of the company or organization.

7
00:00:24.095 --> 00:00:29.095
You will have greater visibility by others within the company,

8
00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:29.595
therefore,

9
00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:35.595
you can have a better opportunity to demonstrate that you have more value.

10
00:00:35.595 --> 00:00:41.595
Also, allows you to be part of strategic initiatives of the company.

11
00:00:41.595 --> 00:00:46.595
Allows you to have a greater impact on the future of the organization.

12
00:00:46.595 --> 00:00:49.490
Not only can this course help you with growing your skills

13
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:54.262
so that you can have a broader career, you may also find it more rewarding.

14
00:00:54.262 --> 00:00:56.167
Case in point is myself.

15
00:00:56.167 --> 00:01:01.929
I find the project management side of my professional growth very,

16
00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:06.595
very rewarding and enjoyable.

17
00:01:06.595 --> 00:01:09.262
More and more businesses are adopting project management

18
00:01:09.262 --> 00:01:11.595
as a normal practice of doing business,

19
00:01:11.595 --> 00:01:16.595
and therefore the business world needs people like you more than ever.

20
00:01:16.595 --> 00:01:20.595
Project managers are near the top of the most sought after jobs.

21
00:01:20.595 --> 00:01:25.408
Here's a list of what is driving the demand for project

22
00:01:25.408 --> 00:01:27.595
managers: outsourcing and vendor management.

23
00:01:27.595 --> 00:01:28.543
That's a biggie.

24
00:01:28.543 --> 00:01:30.437
So much is being outsourced today,

25
00:01:30.437 --> 00:01:33.595
and with the avid of services offered on the cloud,

26
00:01:33.595 --> 00:01:38.595
it is driving the need for business people to determine project parameters.

27
00:01:38.595 --> 00:01:38.948
Complexity.

28
00:01:38.948 --> 00:01:40.360
The greater the complexity,

29
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.242
the greater need for people to pull things together to manage

30
00:01:44.242 --> 00:01:48.024
and orchestrate the project activities.

31
00:01:48.024 --> 00:01:50.595
Cross functional integration.

32
00:01:50.595 --> 00:01:54.364
Projects that cross functional and responsibility lines,

33
00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:57.595
say like IT, manufacturing, and marketing,

34
00:01:57.595 --> 00:02:00.478
will take someone to bridge those areas.

35
00:02:00.478 --> 00:02:00.889
People.

36
00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:04.595
I think people are the most challenging aspect you'll

37
00:02:04.595 --> 00:02:06.050
encounter with project management.

38
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.595
Assess your skills for a moment here.

39
00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:10.595
Are you a people person?

40
00:02:10.595 --> 00:02:14.195
If not, some of the following modules and sections,

41
00:02:14.195 --> 00:02:16.595
will help you improve those skills.

42
00:02:16.595 --> 00:02:17.262
Organizational structure.

43
00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:21.262
If you have three organizations that have a stake in a project,

44
00:02:21.262 --> 00:02:22.595
who will lead it?

45
00:02:22.595 --> 00:02:23.465
Many times,

46
00:02:23.465 --> 00:02:29.552
it just makes sense to have a project manager to cut across the boundaries,

47
00:02:29.552 --> 00:02:32.595
and not be consumed by operational issues.

48
00:02:32.595 --> 00:02:33.329
Risk management.

49
00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:37.000
So much of a manager's job is really risk management.

50
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.471
Many times, projects have too many people rowing the boat,

51
00:02:40.471 --> 00:02:41.513
if you will,

52
00:02:41.513 --> 00:02:45.186
and not enough time and energy looking for the rocks and

53
00:02:45.186 --> 00:02:47.413
shoals so that the boat won't crash.

54
00:02:47.413 --> 00:02:51.536
A big job, as you will see, is the PM, project manager,

55
00:02:51.536 --> 00:02:53.889
performing issue in risk management.

56
00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:58.595
Now, we are at the end of the course overview.

57
00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:05.000
In the next module we will cover the fundamentals of project management, I will see you there.
