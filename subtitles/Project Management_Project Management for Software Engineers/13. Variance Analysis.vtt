Variance analysis and earned value.

2
00:00:04.164 --> 00:00:09.368
A key element of project control is measuring and reporting project performance,

3
00:00:09.368 --> 00:00:14.257
so this section will cover some basic ways to measure your

4
00:00:14.257 --> 00:00:16.924
project's performance without too much work.

5
00:00:16.924 --> 00:00:19.748
Please recall that in the communication or reporting

6
00:00:19.748 --> 00:00:22.924
management section of this module you were deciding what

7
00:00:22.924 --> 00:00:26.591
to report to your stakeholders.

8
00:00:26.591 --> 00:00:33.924
Variance reporting is a key part of your reporting portfolio.

9
00:00:33.924 --> 00:00:37.924
So why should you worry about project variances?

10
00:00:37.924 --> 00:00:43.924
Because you want to know at the earliest possible time to be

11
00:00:43.924 --> 00:00:46.924
able to detect any performance variances.

12
00:00:46.924 --> 00:00:52.924
You must always be able to know, is my project on track?

13
00:00:52.924 --> 00:00:56.353
So, what's a variance?

14
00:00:56.353 --> 00:00:58.924
Let's find out.

15
00:00:58.924 --> 00:01:00.799
Let's define variance.

16
00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:07.674
A variance is the difference between the baseline or planned element

17
00:01:07.674 --> 00:01:12.353
value and the actual element value that occurred.

18
00:01:12.353 --> 00:01:16.924
Okay, let's look at a very simple example.

19
00:01:16.924 --> 00:01:23.983
You planned to spend $100, that's a baseline or planned element value,

20
00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:30.424
but you actually spent $150, that's the actually element value that occurred,

21
00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:35.924
so your variance, meaning the difference between the two is $50.

22
00:01:35.924 --> 00:01:40.724
So the analysis of this variance is that you are over budget,

23
00:01:40.724 --> 00:01:44.556
and potentially your project could be at risk in terms

24
00:01:44.556 --> 00:01:46.450
of maybe spending too much money.

25
00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:54.000
Now let's see some examples of other variance elements you might want to use in your projects.
