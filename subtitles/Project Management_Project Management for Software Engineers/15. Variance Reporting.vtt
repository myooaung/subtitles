00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.667
Now we've talked about variances and variance elements and baseline values,

2
00:00:05.667 --> 00:00:10.260
which are all important, but they're all leading up to earned value,

3
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.928
and this is a technique for measuring project performance

4
00:00:13.928 --> 00:00:15.774
and progress in an objective manner.

5
00:00:15.774 --> 00:00:17.928
So let me ask you a question.

6
00:00:17.928 --> 00:00:19.612
Think for a moment.

7
00:00:19.612 --> 00:00:25.928
If you have used 50% of the budget, are you halfway done with your project?

8
00:00:25.928 --> 00:00:29.785
Well you likely just don't know unless you're also

9
00:00:29.785 --> 00:00:31.928
tracking what has been completed.

10
00:00:31.928 --> 00:00:35.693
Okay, so you've spent half of the money.

11
00:00:35.693 --> 00:00:39.928
Are you functionally complete with half of the work?

12
00:00:39.928 --> 00:00:43.634
That's another deeper variance that's real critical.

13
00:00:43.634 --> 00:00:49.810
You might be on track at a macro level schedule-wise and feel pretty

14
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.163
comfortable that you're halfway through the project budget,

15
00:00:52.163 --> 00:00:55.595
but what if you've only produced 10% of the work itself?

16
00:00:55.595 --> 00:00:56.928
You'd really be behind.

17
00:00:56.928 --> 00:00:58.928
Let's see a real simple example,

18
00:00:58.928 --> 00:01:04.928
and this is one of the core elements I'd like you to use

19
00:01:04.928 --> 00:01:08.928
when you manage and track your projects.

20
00:01:08.928 --> 00:01:14.178
In this example we are looking at the variance of budget versus actuals and at

21
00:01:14.178 --> 00:01:19.717
the same time looking at earned value or just simply what functionality did I

22
00:01:19.717 --> 00:01:23.928
get done for the amount of budget that I spent.

23
00:01:23.928 --> 00:01:28.928
Okay, here's our familiar WBS structure that we've seen before in this class.

24
00:01:28.928 --> 00:01:33.928
The first column is the WBS #, and we have the Item Description.

25
00:01:33.928 --> 00:01:35.678
That's the task we're going to do.

26
00:01:35.678 --> 00:01:36.928
We have the Estimated Hours.

27
00:01:36.928 --> 00:01:39.595
So again, hours is a variance element,

28
00:01:39.595 --> 00:01:43.785
and the baseline are these hours because this is what I

29
00:01:43.785 --> 00:01:47.667
think I will need to get the job done, 8,

30
00:01:47.667 --> 00:01:50.015
40, 32, so that's our baseline.

31
00:01:50.015 --> 00:01:53.928
Now I've introduced a new column here, Weighted Plan Value.

32
00:01:53.928 --> 00:01:58.064
In other words, for each task, how much if I complete that task,

33
00:01:58.064 --> 00:02:02.214
how much will I functionally be done from an overall project standpoint?

34
00:02:02.214 --> 00:02:08.214
So for task 100 I think it's work 2% if I finish that task,

35
00:02:08.214 --> 00:02:12.178
12% for the next task, 10, 18, 36, etc.

36
00:02:12.178 --> 00:02:15.328
They all must add up to 100.

37
00:02:15.328 --> 00:02:18.928
That means I'm completely done with this project.

38
00:02:18.928 --> 00:02:20.340
So that's how much they're worth.

39
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.928
It may not relate at all to the number of hours.

40
00:02:22.928 --> 00:02:25.928
It's going to relate to the amount of functionality

41
00:02:25.928 --> 00:02:27.928
I can deliver to the customer.

42
00:02:27.928 --> 00:02:33.928
Now the next column is how complete am I of this task, percent complete?

43
00:02:33.928 --> 00:02:37.978
Task 100 I'm 100% complete, task 101 I'm 75%,

44
00:02:37.978 --> 00:02:42.928
the next 50%, and I've made no progress on the rest,

45
00:02:42.928 --> 00:02:46.612
so that's where I am at this point in time.

46
00:02:46.612 --> 00:02:49.928
The next column is Planned Value Complete, PV Complete.

47
00:02:49.928 --> 00:02:52.875
That's just multiplying the weighted planned value,

48
00:02:52.875 --> 00:02:55.823
say 2%, times percent complete for 100%,

49
00:02:55.823 --> 00:02:57.928
so you multiply these out.

50
00:02:57.928 --> 00:03:03.655
And you can see at the bottom of the column I'm 16% done with

51
00:03:03.655 --> 00:03:06.110
the project from a functional standpoint,

52
00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.928
all right.

53
00:03:06.928 --> 00:03:10.086
The next column is Actual Hours.

54
00:03:10.086 --> 00:03:16.928
And again, hours is a variance element, and that's the actual hours used.

55
00:03:16.928 --> 00:03:19.728
So for task 100 I've used 12 hours,

56
00:03:19.728 --> 00:03:23.928
the next task 36 hours for a total of 48 hours used.

57
00:03:23.928 --> 00:03:30.803
All right, so up at the top then, from a budget standpoint, I've consumed 14.

58
00:03:30.803 --> 00:03:34.928
5% of the budget or 48 divided by 330.

59
00:03:34.928 --> 00:03:38.261
Three hundred and thirty is my baseline total estimated hours,

60
00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:40.928
and my actual hours so far are 48.

61
00:03:40.928 --> 00:03:41.880
Pretty simple to compute.

62
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.976
But if that was the only variance I was looking at I wouldn't

63
00:03:44.976 --> 00:03:48.454
be able to really tell well how far along am I really

64
00:03:48.454 --> 00:03:51.612
materially with this project or how much functionality have I

65
00:03:51.612 --> 00:03:53.128
actually completed and delivered,

66
00:03:53.128 --> 00:03:58.728
so the next piece I want to look at is the percent functionally complete,

67
00:03:58.728 --> 00:03:59.928
which is 16%.

68
00:03:59.928 --> 00:04:03.778
And I computed that by taking the weighted plan values and

69
00:04:03.778 --> 00:04:08.499
multiplying them by how much complete am I to equal the PV

70
00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:10.595
completion value of 16%.

71
00:04:10.595 --> 00:04:15.833
So if I'm 16% done functionally and only used 14.

72
00:04:15.833 --> 00:04:21.201
5% of the budget, I would say that's pretty good, I think I'm right on track.

73
00:04:21.201 --> 00:04:23.110
If it was flipped the other way,

74
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.058
it might mean that I might be a little bit behind.

75
00:04:27.058 --> 00:04:30.189
Also, in terms of the % Cmplt column,

76
00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:33.678
I get that by speaking with the software engineers

77
00:04:33.678 --> 00:04:38.553
and to say hey for task number one, install and configure Visual Studio,

78
00:04:38.553 --> 00:04:42.058
TFS, and SQL Server, how are you doing on that?

79
00:04:42.058 --> 00:04:45.537
Oh, I've actually used 12 hours instead of the 8,

80
00:04:45.537 --> 00:04:47.928
but I'm 100% done, it's all complete.

81
00:04:47.928 --> 00:04:48.261
Great!

82
00:04:48.261 --> 00:04:50.261
So I put the 100% there.

83
00:04:50.261 --> 00:04:54.761
So you do this with looking at your time tracking systems and talking to

84
00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:57.539
your software engineers to find out how complete they are,

85
00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:58.928
filling in this simple spreadsheet,

86
00:04:58.928 --> 00:05:02.928
and you could really look at earned value at all times and be able to tell

87
00:05:02.928 --> 00:05:07.071
your customer and your stakeholders just right where you are.

88
00:05:07.071 --> 00:05:14.928
Now let's look at a different example where we can look at this over time.

89
00:05:14.928 --> 00:05:20.928
In this example, we're going to look at budget versus actuals over time.

90
00:05:20.928 --> 00:05:26.612
Okay, there's our estimate by month, and those are our baseline values,

91
00:05:26.612 --> 00:05:29.928
100 for January, 200 for February, etc.

92
00:05:29.928 --> 00:05:32.869
Those are my baseline values of hours that I think

93
00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:34.928
I'm going to consume on my project.

94
00:05:34.928 --> 00:05:36.770
The next row are actuals.

95
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.928
I actually am accumulating those hours to see how many hours I have spent.

96
00:05:41.928 --> 00:05:45.693
In January 80, and in February 170, etc.

97
00:05:45.693 --> 00:05:49.928
So as an example in February I'm under budget.

98
00:05:49.928 --> 00:05:53.661
The blue line is above the orange line.

99
00:05:53.661 --> 00:05:55.061
So that's great!

100
00:05:55.061 --> 00:05:56.928
I'm tracking very good.

101
00:05:56.928 --> 00:06:02.928
But notice in March I'm a little bit over budget; the orange line is above.

102
00:06:02.928 --> 00:06:06.678
So it's very easy to visually see where you are,

103
00:06:06.678 --> 00:06:08.928
but I'm still trending pretty good.

104
00:06:08.928 --> 00:06:12.928
And lastly, when I finish the project I'm actually under budget.

105
00:06:12.928 --> 00:06:15.499
So in June I finished, and I'm under budget.

106
00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:19.372
Now you could even take this a step further and overlay earned value,

107
00:06:19.372 --> 00:06:22.039
what functionality that has been completed,

108
00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:27.928
and you have a pretty good picture about your project on one simple slide,

109
00:06:27.928 --> 00:06:31.595
so that's what I would suggest maybe for a way to

110
00:06:31.595 --> 00:06:33.595
look at your project over time,

111
00:06:33.595 --> 00:06:42.000
budget versus actuals and earned value at the same time. Okay, now let's check out some tips on project control.
