00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.933
No matter how good you are as project manager in getting things done,

2
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:10.301
if you can't communicate with your customers and team,

3
00:00:10.301 --> 00:00:13.210
you will have a much harder time succeeding.

4
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:20.523
This section emphasizes the importance of clear and concise

5
00:00:20.523 --> 00:00:26.210
communication content and methods of effective communication.

6
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.980
The last section was on leadership,

7
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.210
and good leaders are definitely good communicators.

8
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.595
It's no secret that good leaders are also good communicators.

9
00:00:37.595 --> 00:00:39.210
We know that.

10
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.410
Effective communication is as much about authenticity as

11
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.210
the words you will speak and write.

12
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.421
So what I mean by authenticity,

13
00:00:47.421 --> 00:00:50.737
that's the quality and trusted actions that you'll take

14
00:00:50.737 --> 00:00:54.544
that'll match up to the words you say and write,

15
00:00:54.544 --> 00:00:59.210
and I know you've heard it before, it's walk like you talk.

16
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.655
Also, communicate in a clear, credible, authentic way.

17
00:01:03.655 --> 00:01:06.433
How can you organize, inspire,

18
00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:12.034
or guide others if you don't communicate in a clear and credible way.

19
00:01:12.034 --> 00:01:13.093
You just can't.

20
00:01:13.093 --> 00:01:16.353
So the following sections will cover effective communication,

21
00:01:16.353 --> 00:01:23.210
what to say, when to say it, and how to say it.

22
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.749
Effective communication, it's communicating to the right people,

23
00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:34.210
getting them the right information, at the right time,

24
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.210
using the right method, and it really is that simple,

25
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.210
but it's a little bit like a puzzle as well.

26
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.460
So, who are the right people?

27
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.210
They're going to be your stakeholders, your team, your management.

28
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.105
And what is the right information?

29
00:01:52.105 --> 00:01:52.421
Again,

30
00:01:52.421 --> 00:01:56.756
by using your project control plan and its outcomes from the previous modules,

31
00:01:56.756 --> 00:02:02.210
you'll use those to provide and gather the right information.

32
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.895
How do you deliver that information at the right time?

33
00:02:05.895 --> 00:02:09.619
By understanding the needs of the receivers of the information,

34
00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.710
you will ask them, would you like a status report?

35
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.210
Would you like a chart maybe that shows time and budget?

36
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.210
They will tell you.

37
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:20.710
And what is the right timing?

38
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:21.210
Weekly, daily?

39
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.842
So you ask your customers.

40
00:02:23.842 --> 00:02:29.631
And lastly, using the right method, that will be phone calls,

41
00:02:29.631 --> 00:02:31.210
emails, meetings, etc.

42
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:36.835
You need to know which one to use and when to be the most effective,

43
00:02:36.835 --> 00:02:40.210
and we're going to detail of all of this.

44
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.155
What makes a great PM?

45
00:02:42.155 --> 00:02:45.266
What makes you stand out from a crowd?

46
00:02:45.266 --> 00:02:47.210
Well, let me tell you.

47
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:48.377
It's effective communications.

48
00:02:48.377 --> 00:02:52.266
A big part of your job is communicating with others,

49
00:02:52.266 --> 00:02:59.099
and you're going to need to understand that and get used to that as a PM.

50
00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.210
Project managers need to be great communicators.

51
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.710
It's going to be one of your most important skills.

52
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.410
For me,

53
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.321
it's just hard to imagine the successful PM who is not also a good communicator.

54
00:03:12.321 --> 00:03:14.099
As a software engineer,

55
00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.925
you may not have considered how important communicating with others is,

56
00:03:18.925 --> 00:03:24.496
and as software engineers, we may not have had much of that need,

57
00:03:24.496 --> 00:03:26.210
but now we do.

58
00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.210
There are some critical outcomes that relate to good communications.

59
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.477
One, of course, is managing customer expectations.

60
00:03:32.477 --> 00:03:33.410
The customer,

61
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.684
stakeholder should never be wondering about how the project is

62
00:03:37.684 --> 00:03:40.631
going because you're going to be telling them,

63
00:03:40.631 --> 00:03:43.210
on time and with the right content.

64
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.446
Also another critical outcome is managing the project team,

65
00:03:47.446 --> 00:03:48.387
your team,

66
00:03:48.387 --> 00:03:53.782
since your team should not be wondering either on what to do

67
00:03:53.782 --> 00:03:58.496
next or direct report managers shouldn't be in the dark about

68
00:03:58.496 --> 00:04:00.210
your project's progress either.

69
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.210
And lastly, effective communication may just ensure your success.

70
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.960
So communication may be something as simple as walking around

71
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.210
and talking with members or stakeholders,

72
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.387
and may also mean sitting in lots of meetings.

73
00:04:13.387 --> 00:04:16.210
Communications may also include talking on the telephone,

74
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:19.944
writing emails, instant messages, preparing for meetings,

75
00:04:19.944 --> 00:04:24.210
creating and delivering briefings, and generating status report.

76
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:33.000
Now let's look at some key tips of successful communicators. So sit tight and let's get started.
