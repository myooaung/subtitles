Hello.

2
00:00:00.563 --> 00:00:03.375
I'm Michael Krasowski from Pluralsight.

3
00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:06.750
I will be presenting module six,

4
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.667
Project Closure and Course Summary in the course,

5
00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:15.000
Project Management for Software Engineers.

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Now let's see what closing a project is all about.

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.158
The goal of project closure is to bring closure to your project for

8
00:00:27.158 --> 00:00:35.000
all parties involved and certainly to make sure that the last

9
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
impression everyone has of the project, your team, and of course of you is positive.
