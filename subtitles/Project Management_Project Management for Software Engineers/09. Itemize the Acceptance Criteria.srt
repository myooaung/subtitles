1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,156
The next step, step three, is coming up with your acceptance criteria.

2
00:00:07,156 --> 00:00:10,356
Now of course, you have your complete WBS,

3
00:00:10,356 --> 00:00:15,156
and that is the 100% list of tasks for the entire project,

4
00:00:15,156 --> 00:00:17,606
but that really isn't your acceptance criteria,

5
00:00:17,606 --> 00:00:20,756
you want that to be written in business terms,

6
00:00:20,756 --> 00:00:24,822
and a lot of times in the WBS things get lost and

7
00:00:24,822 --> 00:00:26,822
there's too much detail in that,

8
00:00:26,822 --> 00:00:31,156
so we want to layout a nice acceptance criteria in the

9
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:36,156
terms or words of the stakeholders, a little more business-oriented.

10
00:00:36,156 --> 00:00:37,870
Now, they call also be phased,

11
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:41,013
maybe you have some milestones that come up in one month,

12
00:00:41,013 --> 00:00:43,584
and then some the following month, or the following week,

13
00:00:43,584 --> 00:00:47,537
or whatever, and a lot of times again it will be a list of major milestones,

14
00:00:47,537 --> 00:00:51,727
so you might look at your WBS and look at a

15
00:00:51,727 --> 00:00:54,775
collection or a cluster of tasks and go,

16
00:00:54,775 --> 00:00:58,584
well, of these together implement a subsystem,

17
00:00:58,584 --> 00:01:07,156
or all these together might be a set of 20 reports or something like that.

18
00:01:07,156 --> 00:01:16,156
Okay, now let's see some examples of some acceptance criteria on the next slide.

19
00:01:16,156 --> 00:01:16,556
Typically,

20
00:01:16,556 --> 00:01:20,956
I recommend that acceptance criteria be in more business-oriented terms and

21
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:24,366
not very detailed task-oriented like our WBS may show.

22
00:01:24,366 --> 00:01:27,314
For example, let's say you're using use cases,

23
00:01:27,314 --> 00:01:32,218
all use cases must be demonstrable, that might be an acceptance criteria,

24
00:01:32,218 --> 00:01:36,156
the system is not complete until that is true.

25
00:01:36,156 --> 00:01:40,822
Another one might be, this feature set must be in production by May 1,

26
00:01:40,822 --> 00:01:42,156
that's an acceptance criteria.

27
00:01:42,156 --> 00:01:49,156
Maybe the feature set are 20 screens, or an API, or something like that.

28
00:01:49,156 --> 00:01:50,711
Another example would be,

29
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:54,600
are the users all trained and productive by September 15,

30
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,803
so that's another form of an acceptance criteria.

31
00:01:57,803 --> 00:02:03,156
Here's an example where a student can register and pay for a class.

32
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:09,156
Boy, if that feature set is complete and done, I accept that part of the system.

33
00:02:09,156 --> 00:02:14,156
Another example, an employee can register, log in, and select medical plans.

34
00:02:14,156 --> 00:02:16,822
Okay, if we can do those three things,

35
00:02:16,822 --> 00:02:19,156
that's a great acceptance criteria and again,

36
00:02:19,156 --> 00:02:21,721
an acceptance criteria can be laid out in phases,

37
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:24,330
so some of these could be done in phase one,

38
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,337
and then maybe a different set of criteria for phase two,

39
00:02:28,337 --> 00:02:32,156
or phase three at different particular dates.

40
00:02:32,156 --> 00:02:32,727
You know,

41
00:02:32,727 --> 00:02:36,441
a tip I have is the system must perform all of the use

42
00:02:36,441 --> 00:02:38,156
cases and comply with the specification,

43
00:02:38,156 --> 00:02:40,701
so that was like my first acceptance criteria.

44
00:02:40,701 --> 00:02:45,156
If I have a set of specs, my criteria would be as a user,

45
00:02:45,156 --> 00:02:49,519
a consumer, or a stakeholder, it must do everything that I ask for in the spec,

46
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,337
but you, again,

47
00:02:50,337 --> 00:03:01,000
you may want to lay that out in milestones over time to make it more palatable and easier to implement as well.
