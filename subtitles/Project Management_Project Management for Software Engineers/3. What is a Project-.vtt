00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.846
Definition: what's a project?

2
00:00:02.846 --> 00:00:13.519
This section will define just what a project is, or what a project should be.

3
00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.852
Now here is a simple definition for project.

4
00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:25.519
A temporary group activity designed to produce a unique product,

5
00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:27.519
service or result.

6
00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:31.211
Now notice some keywords here, temporary.

7
00:00:31.211 --> 00:00:35.519
This implies a start and an end.

8
00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:41.401
Group, this implies more than one person, usually a team.

9
00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:49.376
And, unique, a project is something special, and not normal for the business.

10
00:00:49.376 --> 00:00:54.519
Okay, let's go into a little more detail.

11
00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:59.519
So here, we're going to go into a little more detail of, what's a project?

12
00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:05.569
A project has a defined beginning time, a defined ending time,

13
00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:12.852
a defined scope, in other words, what is we're going to go do,

14
00:01:12.852 --> 00:01:17.519
and has defined resources assigned to that project.

15
00:01:17.519 --> 00:01:23.091
So a project is unique, in that it is not a routine operation,

16
00:01:23.091 --> 00:01:28.401
but a specific set of activities designed to accomplish a singular goal.

17
00:01:28.401 --> 00:01:32.166
And what I mean by routine operation is,

18
00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:36.464
those activities involved in the day-to-day functions of the business.

19
00:01:36.464 --> 00:01:39.186
So, it is not a routine operation,

20
00:01:39.186 --> 00:01:42.630
it is not something that's a day-to-day operation,

21
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.075
but in fact is a unique, special activity,

22
00:01:47.075 --> 00:01:52.241
a la project, that has a specific beginning time,

23
00:01:52.241 --> 00:01:56.575
ending time, defined scope, assigned resources.

24
00:01:56.575 --> 00:02:04.519
Now, let's look at some project examples on the following slide.

25
00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:06.673
Here are some examples.

26
00:02:06.673 --> 00:02:11.519
The development of software for an improved business process.

27
00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.144
That's an example of a project.

28
00:02:14.144 --> 00:02:18.957
For example, maybe it's something like eliminate using spreadsheet extract files,

29
00:02:18.957 --> 00:02:22.019
and replaced with a real time API.

30
00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:22.894
Another example,

31
00:02:22.894 --> 00:02:27.075
the migration of a company's computing infrastructure to the cloud.

32
00:02:27.075 --> 00:02:32.519
And the project would be to migrate from an old internal system to a

33
00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.319
cloud-based issue tracking system for example.

34
00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:41.169
Another example, adding a new mobile component to your existing web application,

35
00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:46.119
such as to enhance the sales order web-based system

36
00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:50.519
with a mobile order status module, for example.

37
00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.644
Lastly, projects, to be successful,

38
00:02:53.644 --> 00:02:58.644
must be formally managed to deliver the on-time,

39
00:02:58.644 --> 00:03:00.519
and on-budget results.

40
00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.993
Now think of your own environment, what projects are you on?

41
00:03:03.993 --> 00:03:06.519
Remember they have a start date, end date,

42
00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.610
assigned resources, and scope, or a list of tasks,

43
00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:11.519
to accomplish.

44
00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:23.000
Now let's draw a further comparison between projects and operations on the next slide.
