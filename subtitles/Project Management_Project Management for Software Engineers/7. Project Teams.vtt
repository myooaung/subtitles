00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.845
Project teams, and what I really mean here is project teamwork.

2
00:00:07.845 --> 00:00:10.888
None of us is as smart as all of us.

3
00:00:10.888 --> 00:00:13.627
You will typically be leading a team of people,

4
00:00:13.627 --> 00:00:19.108
and it's so important to have those leadership skills to lead your teams.

5
00:00:19.108 --> 00:00:24.445
Now let's discuss and define project teams in the next slides,

6
00:00:24.445 --> 00:00:32.845
and how you should select the people for those teams and assemble those teams.

7
00:00:32.845 --> 00:00:34.727
What's a project team?

8
00:00:34.727 --> 00:00:40.845
It's a group of people working for or with you on a project.

9
00:00:40.845 --> 00:00:44.178
So when recruiting and building an effective team,

10
00:00:44.178 --> 00:00:45.845
please consider the following.

11
00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:48.512
The hard and soft skills of each person,

12
00:00:48.512 --> 00:00:51.845
and we've talked about those hard and soft skills before,

13
00:00:51.845 --> 00:00:56.845
we can use those as a checklist to help select the people we want for the team.

14
00:00:56.845 --> 00:01:00.845
The attributes of each person, we've discussed those, such as integrity.

15
00:01:00.845 --> 00:01:04.727
You may want to look at those attributes and see who

16
00:01:04.727 --> 00:01:06.845
might make a good team member.

17
00:01:06.845 --> 00:01:10.345
Also the critical roles and chemistry between people,

18
00:01:10.345 --> 00:01:13.845
to make sure the team will work together.

19
00:01:13.845 --> 00:01:19.845
This is also really important, one bad apple can ruin an entire team.

20
00:01:19.845 --> 00:01:26.595
So a project team often includes people who usually don't work together,

21
00:01:26.595 --> 00:01:28.845
maybe from different organizations.

22
00:01:28.845 --> 00:01:30.559
May cross multiple geographies.

23
00:01:30.559 --> 00:01:34.845
Especially in the corporate world, when you assemble a team,

24
00:01:34.845 --> 00:01:37.492
typically there are people from a variety of organizations,

25
00:01:37.492 --> 00:01:41.595
may be physically in different parts of the country or the world,

26
00:01:41.595 --> 00:01:46.845
and who may not normally work together, except for this particular project.

27
00:01:46.845 --> 00:01:52.845
So it may take some skills of yours to help assemble that right team.

28
00:01:52.845 --> 00:01:59.845
Okay, let's go to the next slide.

29
00:01:59.845 --> 00:02:04.845
Project team resources, or how your team may be staffed.

30
00:02:04.845 --> 00:02:10.845
As a project manager, you may have resources that report to you.

31
00:02:10.845 --> 00:02:15.657
Now some may formally work for you, you're their organizational boss,

32
00:02:15.657 --> 00:02:20.845
you do their performance reviews, and you provide even monetary incentives.

33
00:02:20.845 --> 00:02:27.845
Those team members may really work for you, in other words, hard for you.

34
00:02:27.845 --> 00:02:31.161
Those are the ones that work directly for you.

35
00:02:31.161 --> 00:02:34.845
There may also be people that work for another manager,

36
00:02:34.845 --> 00:02:38.734
but are just assigned to you for this particular project.

37
00:02:38.734 --> 00:02:41.845
And in that assignment, they may work full-time,

38
00:02:41.845 --> 00:02:44.295
or maybe even just part-time for you.

39
00:02:44.295 --> 00:02:48.495
So be prepared that your team will likely be a hybrid of

40
00:02:48.495 --> 00:02:52.845
resources that some may work for you, some may work,

41
00:02:52.845 --> 00:02:56.845
if you will, with you on the particular project.

42
00:02:56.845 --> 00:02:59.178
Now this is very important to understand,

43
00:02:59.178 --> 00:03:01.845
since you'll be applying resources, hours of effort,

44
00:03:01.845 --> 00:03:03.845
for each task on your plan.

45
00:03:03.845 --> 00:03:06.433
You will need to know that amount of time or hours

46
00:03:06.433 --> 00:03:07.845
that each team member can contribute.

47
00:03:07.845 --> 00:03:11.345
Maybe a member can only contribute 32 hours a week,

48
00:03:11.345 --> 00:03:14.495
and you need to understand their capabilities to know

49
00:03:14.495 --> 00:03:18.178
how much they can actually produce, and contribute to the project.

50
00:03:18.178 --> 00:03:20.845
Now if they don't directly work for you,

51
00:03:20.845 --> 00:03:25.055
I can guarantee, their time commitments may vary.

52
00:03:25.055 --> 00:03:29.266
Now let's talk about a phenomenon I call,

53
00:03:29.266 --> 00:03:33.786
people work for the people they work for.

54
00:03:33.786 --> 00:03:36.139
Didn't quite get that?

55
00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:40.845
Let's talk to that on the next slide.

56
00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:43.306
Who reports to whom?

57
00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:48.845
Each person works for the person they work for.

58
00:03:48.845 --> 00:03:53.055
Yes, that sounds simple, even silly, but it is not.

59
00:03:53.055 --> 00:03:58.988
That will always be where their allegiance is placed, so be aware of it.

60
00:03:58.988 --> 00:04:03.273
If they don't directly work for you, as their supervisor,

61
00:04:03.273 --> 00:04:07.012
then just be aware of where their loyalties lie,

62
00:04:07.012 --> 00:04:12.845
and how much time you may be able to secure from them on a project.

63
00:04:12.845 --> 00:04:19.845
So those loyalty drivers typically are performance evaluations and money.

64
00:04:19.845 --> 00:04:23.610
So if possible, always ask for dedicated resources,

65
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.845
or at least, a dedicated minimum amount of time.

66
00:04:27.845 --> 00:04:31.559
For example, I'm going to get Joe on this project from another department,

67
00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:34.999
can I secure 20 hours a week and be guaranteed that?

68
00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:38.845
Always push for those guarantees with that other person's manager.

69
00:04:38.845 --> 00:04:43.845
Don't just assume they're going to help you for a certain amount of time.

70
00:04:43.845 --> 00:04:46.178
Lastly, it's like herding kittens sometimes,

71
00:04:46.178 --> 00:04:48.900
you may have heard of that phrase,

72
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.845
and trying to collect up these people who really don't work for you

73
00:04:53.845 --> 00:04:56.845
and have allegiances elsewhere may be a challenge.

74
00:04:56.845 --> 00:05:00.445
Sometimes you need to bring it up with the team member's manager,

75
00:05:00.445 --> 00:05:04.345
maybe you have to bring these issues up possibly with a stakeholder,

76
00:05:04.345 --> 00:05:08.845
or a steering committee, to make sure that those resources are aligned,

77
00:05:08.845 --> 00:05:11.970
because your project will not be successful if you don't

78
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.845
have those resources that you're expecting,

79
00:05:13.845 --> 00:05:16.792
and that you've allocated on your project.

80
00:05:16.792 --> 00:05:21.845
Okay, so what kind of person do you want on your team?

81
00:05:21.845 --> 00:05:27.845
Let's find out on the next slide.

82
00:05:27.845 --> 00:05:29.012
Team member characteristics.

83
00:05:29.012 --> 00:05:34.845
I'm going to give you a list of characteristics for thumbs down, and thumbs up.

84
00:05:34.845 --> 00:05:39.845
Thumbs down, these are the people I probably would not want on my project.

85
00:05:39.845 --> 00:05:43.345
And then the characteristics for thumbs up will those

86
00:05:43.345 --> 00:05:46.845
characteristics I do want in people on my projects.

87
00:05:46.845 --> 00:05:47.220
Okay,

88
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:52.845
here are the thumbs down ones to be aware of when you're assembling your team.

89
00:05:52.845 --> 00:05:57.845
Sometimes people always like to break the rules, I don't like that.

90
00:05:57.845 --> 00:06:00.072
Some people aren't always a team player.

91
00:06:00.072 --> 00:06:04.845
Now here we are on a team, and they're off on their own, not good.

92
00:06:04.845 --> 00:06:06.727
Prefers tech over people.

93
00:06:06.727 --> 00:06:11.904
Yes, we do need technical people, but if the particular activity,

94
00:06:11.904 --> 00:06:16.845
or role, or task that I'm having them do is more soft skill related,

95
00:06:16.845 --> 00:06:19.845
then I need them to perform in that role,

96
00:06:19.845 --> 00:06:23.118
not kind of drill down in the technical side,

97
00:06:23.118 --> 00:06:27.845
and lose sight of the actual task that we're trying to get done.

98
00:06:27.845 --> 00:06:28.792
Not schedule driven.

99
00:06:28.792 --> 00:06:31.319
A lot of people are not schedule driven,

100
00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:32.582
that's a real challenge,

101
00:06:32.582 --> 00:06:36.537
I need people that always keep an eye on dates and

102
00:06:36.537 --> 00:06:38.845
milestones and try to meet those.

103
00:06:38.845 --> 00:06:41.198
Some people do not like to write or document things.

104
00:06:41.198 --> 00:06:42.845
This is a really biggie for me.

105
00:06:42.845 --> 00:06:45.345
As a project manager you need to do a lot of writing,

106
00:06:45.345 --> 00:06:48.720
and a lot of communicating, and you need to be able to write clearly,

107
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.657
so different types of people and different types of

108
00:06:52.657 --> 00:06:55.198
stakeholders can understand what you're saying,

109
00:06:55.198 --> 00:06:56.962
know what your team's saying.

110
00:06:56.962 --> 00:07:00.845
Some people avoid ownership, some people do not want to lead,

111
00:07:00.845 --> 00:07:04.003
they just want to follow, and as a project leader,

112
00:07:04.003 --> 00:07:07.345
a project manager, you're going to have project team members,

113
00:07:07.345 --> 00:07:13.845
and all of those should be little project leaders in their own right.

114
00:07:13.845 --> 00:07:15.687
Self interests versus company interests.

115
00:07:15.687 --> 00:07:21.137
I'm really into people who are trying to get the job done for the company,

116
00:07:21.137 --> 00:07:23.178
and not make a name for themselves.

117
00:07:23.178 --> 00:07:27.845
Okay, that's just a short list, I'm sure you can come up with a lot more.

118
00:07:27.845 --> 00:07:31.178
Now on the thumbs up side, here are some characteristics that I really love,

119
00:07:31.178 --> 00:07:34.424
and these are the people I hire, or want to join my team.

120
00:07:34.424 --> 00:07:34.950
Positive attitude.

121
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:36.792
That's critical, we're going to need it,

122
00:07:36.792 --> 00:07:40.345
because we're going to have some tough times ahead.

123
00:07:40.345 --> 00:07:46.845
Highly motivated, always getting in there and trying to get the job done.

124
00:07:46.845 --> 00:07:51.055
A moderate aptitude, in other words, I need smart people,

125
00:07:51.055 --> 00:07:53.582
they don't need to be Einsteins,

126
00:07:53.582 --> 00:07:57.512
but I need to have some bright people on the team,

127
00:07:57.512 --> 00:07:57.845
certainly.

128
00:07:57.845 --> 00:08:02.845
People oriented, we've talked about people orientation, very, very important.

129
00:08:02.845 --> 00:08:04.080
Attention to detail.

130
00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:09.845
It's the little details that might come back and bite you on a project.

131
00:08:09.845 --> 00:08:10.545
Process oriented.

132
00:08:10.545 --> 00:08:15.095
We really need to rely on the processes that we're going to lay

133
00:08:15.095 --> 00:08:18.610
down in this course to really get the job done.

134
00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:22.845
And, last on the list here is, of course, a good communicator.

135
00:08:22.845 --> 00:08:27.106
So, you as a leader of course are required to be a good communicator,

136
00:08:27.106 --> 00:08:31.610
but I would also like to have my team members be good at communicating,

137
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:34.080
at least amongst themselves as team members,

138
00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:38.567
and also with their particular customers or users that they're responsible for.

139
00:08:38.567 --> 00:08:49.000
Now let's turn our attention to the challenges of a project manager, and how to avoid pitfalls on your projects.
