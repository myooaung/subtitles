00:00:00.617 --> 00:00:02.294
Communication Management.

2
00:00:02.294 --> 00:00:09.000
That's communicating project information to your stakeholders primarily,

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
but may also include customers, users, team members.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.351
Communication is a very critical and important element of

5
00:00:15.351 --> 00:00:16.755
your project management activities.

6
00:00:16.755 --> 00:00:20.266
And there may be varying types of reports for different

7
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:23.641
stakeholders and varying types of methods of reports and of

8
00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:25.320
reporting for each different stakeholder,

9
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.714
so you will need to design and plan for how you will do this as a project

10
00:00:32.714 --> 00:00:37.000
manager and then include that in your project plan.

11
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.455
So why do you think you should do reporting?

12
00:00:39.455 --> 00:00:43.000
Think about that for a minute, but let me give you some ideas.

13
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
You need consistent and regular reporting to inform everyone what's going on.

14
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.333
You've heard the saying before no news is good news.

15
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:55.000
In project management no news is bad news.

16
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.667
If your customers or your stakeholders have not heard from you,

17
00:00:58.667 --> 00:01:00.000
they assume bad things.

18
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.211
Next, it shows that your team knows what they're doing.

19
00:01:04.211 --> 00:01:08.800
When they see regular and good status reports or performance reports,

20
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.400
this is great PR.

21
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.800
It'll give the impression, hopefully true,

22
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.647
that you're making great progress, or, if not,

23
00:01:16.647 --> 00:01:23.000
you're honestly reporting what's happening so it can be improved and corrected.

24
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.158
It also allows others to review progress and provide inputs.

25
00:01:26.158 --> 00:01:30.000
Someone may read a status report and go oh, what is milestone five?

26
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.250
Can we change that slightly?

27
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.000
Can we move it in one week?

28
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.600
It makes everyone more comfortable with what's going on.

29
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.364
Of course document who's responsible and accountable for everything,

30
00:01:40.364 --> 00:01:41.727
tasks, issues, risks.

31
00:01:41.727 --> 00:01:44.000
People need to see this.

32
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.667
And lastly, and maybe even most importantly,

33
00:01:48.667 --> 00:01:55.143
helps manage everyone's expectations and answers these questions which are very,

34
00:01:55.143 --> 00:02:00.476
very important: Are we on budget, do we think we will meet the schedule,

35
00:02:00.476 --> 00:02:03.500
and are we meeting the customer's expectations?

36
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:10.000
So we do reporting to ensure that we meet the customer's expectations and

37
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.263
answer the questions at least of budget and schedule.

38
00:02:14.263 --> 00:02:19.000
Those always seem to be by far the most important.

39
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
So here's an approach on how to build your communication road map.

40
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
First, determine what information you need to provide for each stakeholder.

41
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.667
These are your performance requirements,

42
00:02:29.667 --> 00:02:33.000
and they are driven by the project's critical success factors.

43
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.600
In general,

44
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.500
you will provide the same information to make your life a little easier,

45
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.500
but you might have some differences to emphasis what the

46
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.000
stakeholder is really looking for.

47
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.389
Next,

48
00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:47.500
determine the form and content of that information

49
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.464
such as will it be status reports, maybe dashboard portals,

50
00:02:51.464 --> 00:02:53.786
stakeholder presentations say in PowerPoint,

51
00:02:53.786 --> 00:02:57.500
maybe you want to show budgets versus actuals,

52
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:04.000
variance reports, milestones, so figure out what that content is.

53
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.158
Next, determine the source of the data for that information.

54
00:03:07.158 --> 00:03:11.263
Where is this data going to come from that you're going to report?

55
00:03:11.263 --> 00:03:14.421
Might it come from a time tracking system which is

56
00:03:14.421 --> 00:03:17.200
tracking the hours and dollars, maybe financial systems,

57
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.000
maybe even vendor reports because you have

58
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
agreements for contracts with vendors.

59
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.421
You may need information from them in order to incorporate it with your reports,

60
00:03:26.421 --> 00:03:31.000
and you may have project management tools helping you as well.

61
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Next determine how you're going to monitor and measure that information.

62
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.333
What are the tools and processes that we'll use to

63
00:03:39.333 --> 00:03:41.000
monitor and measure that information.

64
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.778
For example,

65
00:03:41.778 --> 00:03:46.444
maybe the time tracking system tracks hours versus estimated hours so you

66
00:03:46.444 --> 00:03:50.118
can easy see how you are tracking the budgeted hours.

67
00:03:50.118 --> 00:03:54.000
Maybe you summarize this information to be used on your communications.

68
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.895
But each of these areas you want to find out where

69
00:03:56.895 --> 00:03:59.000
the information is coming from, what's the source,

70
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.895
what's the form of that information,

71
00:04:00.895 --> 00:04:04.368
and based on that source how do you measure and monitor

72
00:04:04.368 --> 00:04:08.000
the information from that source.

73
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.941
Next, determine who you will need to provide it to,

74
00:04:10.941 --> 00:04:13.000
where that information is going to go.

75
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Come up with your distribution list,

76
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
typically an email list of all the people that will need to be kept informed.

77
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
You might categorize your list, stakeholders, vendors, your team members.

78
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.278
You will do this categorization because you may need to send

79
00:04:29.278 --> 00:04:32.000
different information to each of these categories.

80
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.529
Again,

81
00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:37.294
in a simple case maybe identical information to all

82
00:04:37.294 --> 00:04:39.412
categories to all stakeholders,

83
00:04:39.412 --> 00:04:43.182
but typically each stakeholder likes to see data slightly

84
00:04:43.182 --> 00:04:45.000
differently that meets their needs.

85
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Meet with them, find out what their needs are, conform to their needs.

86
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.500
Determine how often you will provide this information.

87
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.500
Weekly is quite typical.

88
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.088
You don't want to send too much information,

89
00:04:58.088 --> 00:05:01.000
say daily, or people will just not read it.

90
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.529
So maybe status reports are weekly, maybe stakeholder reviews are quarterly,

91
00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:09.923
maybe if it's a critical item you might send that out

92
00:05:09.923 --> 00:05:13.000
immediately as a project alert message, for example.

93
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.882
And of course you can send information out any time you

94
00:05:16.882 --> 00:05:19.000
think it is relevant and important.

95
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.778
So this road map is basically your plan on how you're going to

96
00:05:24.778 --> 00:05:27.000
approach the reporting and communication.

97
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.500
You write all of this down about your plan,

98
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.000
and you put it into the overall plan itself.

99
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
This example you see in front of you would be part of the overall project plan.

100
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
It will be the communication or reporting portion of your plan.

101
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.154
It outlines what you'll do as it relates to

102
00:05:48.154 --> 00:05:50.000
communicating your project information.

103
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
For example, Weekly Status.

104
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.929
This report is distributed weekly via email to the entire team,

105
00:05:56.929 --> 00:05:58.000
customers, and stakeholders.

106
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.500
It provides a high-level description of the activities

107
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.000
over the last week and the upcoming week.

108
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
It also includes any critical issues.

109
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
So again, this reporting plan has three elements,

110
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.895
weekly status, stakeholder review, and the project WBS,

111
00:06:12.895 --> 00:06:17.455
and it has a description of what will happen with each of those three,

112
00:06:17.455 --> 00:06:22.000
and those would be included in your overall project plan.

113
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.684
And when your project plan is approved by your stakeholders,

114
00:06:25.684 --> 00:06:29.000
they will understand how you'll be communicating with them.

115
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.778
Next example, stakeholder review.

116
00:06:30.778 --> 00:06:37.000
The review may be held monthly and is targeted just to the stakeholder audience.

117
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.529
It is usually in PowerPoint format, easy to read and understand,

118
00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:45.591
and given as an in-person presentation that is not via email.

119
00:06:45.591 --> 00:06:49.727
And the last of the three in the example is the project WBS,

120
00:06:49.727 --> 00:06:51.000
work break down structure.

121
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.813
This is a detailed project work break down structure showing tasks,

122
00:06:55.813 --> 00:06:58.545
actual hours, estimated hours, dates, milestones,

123
00:06:58.545 --> 00:06:59.091
etc.

124
00:06:59.091 --> 00:07:04.000
in an Excel format and is available on request.

125
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.667
So again,

126
00:07:04.667 --> 00:07:08.000
here are the three different types of reports or communication

127
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.368
elements as part of your overall project,

128
00:07:10.368 --> 00:07:13.684
and these are how you're going to implement those.

129
00:07:13.684 --> 00:07:18.000
They go into your plan, they get approved as part of your plan,

130
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.500
and as you're building the actual software or the actual

131
00:07:20.500 --> 00:08:12.000
website as part of your plan you're also implementing the communication part of your plan as well.
