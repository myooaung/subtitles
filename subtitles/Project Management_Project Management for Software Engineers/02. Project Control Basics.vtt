00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.800
This section is on project control basics,

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.657
or what I like to call project control 101,

3
00:00:08.657 --> 00:00:13.492
and you will need your gauges so you can control your projects

4
00:00:13.492 --> 00:00:15.800
by measuring and monitoring your activities.

5
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.800
I mean think about your car dashboard for a moment.

6
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.000
You have a speedometer,

7
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.371
you have something that tells you how much gas you have left in the tank,

8
00:00:24.371 --> 00:00:27.229
and these are your gauges to help you measure and

9
00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:29.133
monitor the performance of your car.

10
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:31.133
And a project is no different.

11
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:35.982
We're going to use different tools and techniques to help you

12
00:00:35.982 --> 00:00:41.800
measure and monitor the progress of your projects.

13
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.356
Are we are budget?

14
00:00:43.356 --> 00:00:46.467
Do you think we will meet the schedule?

15
00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:48.800
Are we meeting the customer's expectations?

16
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.035
You may be constantly asked about the budget,

17
00:00:53.035 --> 00:00:56.212
about the schedule, and being surprised,

18
00:00:56.212 --> 00:00:56.741
astonished,

19
00:00:56.741 --> 00:01:03.800
maybe even overwhelmed by how the customer's expectations will keep changing.

20
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.930
You will be asked these questions all the time,

21
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.800
and I mean all the time, daily and maybe even hourly at critical times.

22
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.000
Primarily you'll be asked by people like project sponsors,

23
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.800
stakeholders, managers, customers, and maybe even team members.

24
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.300
And how do you answer?

25
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.300
Yes, yes, and yes.

26
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.800
Hopefully you can.

27
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.800
In order to truly answer these and other questions you'll need project controls.

28
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.533
That's what this module is all about.

29
00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:38.800
Now let's see just how to do that.

30
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.271
But first a couple of definitions.

31
00:01:41.271 --> 00:01:42.094
Project control,

32
00:01:42.094 --> 00:01:45.800
and that's the tools and processes employed to monitor

33
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.379
and measure the progress of a project.

34
00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:53.050
This module will discuss the tools and the processes in order to manage

35
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.550
the progress and success of your projects so we can in fact answer those

36
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.729
questions that we saw in the previous slide.

37
00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:06.800
Okay, now let's see who just those project sponsors really are.

38
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.467
Project Sponsors.

39
00:02:07.467 --> 00:02:10.800
Now these are the people that have a vested interest

40
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.800
in the success of the project.

41
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.244
Okay,

42
00:02:13.244 --> 00:02:19.022
sometimes we use the term stakeholders to be equivalent with the term sponsors,

43
00:02:19.022 --> 00:02:24.300
and they may be business leads say over marketing or manufacturing,

44
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.300
engineering; finance,

45
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.550
they're very keen on how the project is going from a

46
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.300
cost standpoint; executive management,

47
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.800
they're usually driving the reason why you're doing

48
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.918
the project in the first place,

49
00:02:37.918 --> 00:02:41.447
maybe they're trying to meet certain customer goals; customers and

50
00:02:41.447 --> 00:02:44.133
users very important as well; and IT management,

51
00:02:44.133 --> 00:02:47.133
those that are actually going to implement the project,

52
00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:48.578
deploy it, support it.

53
00:02:48.578 --> 00:02:53.244
So the better you can monitor and measure the progress of your

54
00:02:53.244 --> 00:02:56.050
projects the happier these sponsors will be.

55
00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:03.000
And if they're happy, trust me, you'll be happy. Okay let's move on.
