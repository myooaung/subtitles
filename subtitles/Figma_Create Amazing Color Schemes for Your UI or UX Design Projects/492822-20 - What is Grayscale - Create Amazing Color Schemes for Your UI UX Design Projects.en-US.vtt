00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.945
Once Grayscale,

00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:10.890
Grayscale is simply made of
different shades of grey,

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.155
many artists and designers

00:00:13.155 --> 00:00:16.005
start their design
using a gray scale.

00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:17.040
What why?

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.900
The reason is, when you work

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.000
with just different
shades of gray,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.215
you can focus on other
important things like spacing,

00:00:25.215 --> 00:00:28.050
sizes, visual hierarchy,

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.735
the weight of your
elements, and more.

00:00:30.735 --> 00:00:32.700
You can just concentrate on

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.055
how your elements like buttons,

00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:37.935
text, sliders, or cars,

00:00:37.935 --> 00:00:39.315
should be laid out.

00:00:39.315 --> 00:00:41.740
When you use the
grayscale color mode,

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.805
you can easily notice
whether you have

00:00:43.805 --> 00:00:46.715
enough contrast between
your elements are not.

00:00:46.715 --> 00:00:50.840
E.g. this interface has a
great visual hierarchy.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.915
As you can see, the most
important information

00:00:53.915 --> 00:00:56.690
is darker than the least
important information.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.795
Now I want you to focus
on the priority column.

00:00:59.795 --> 00:01:02.720
Can you see that the higher
the priority level is,

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.580
the darker the color gets?

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.275
Let's analyze it further.

00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:09.050
Here we have three
priority levels,

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.645
high, medium, and low.

00:01:11.645 --> 00:01:14.060
Now let's switch to
the grayscale mode.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.595
As you can see, the
highest priority

00:01:16.595 --> 00:01:18.335
has the darkest shade here.

00:01:18.335 --> 00:01:20.930
And this is why we
don't usually use

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.885
yellow for the delete
button in an interface.

00:01:23.885 --> 00:01:25.970
Now, take a look at this card.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.850
The colors are harmonious
and you're ready

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.940
to add the car to your
design except you aren't.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.760
Let's switch to the grayscale
color mode for a second.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.155
Can you see the problem?

00:01:36.155 --> 00:01:37.730
As you can see, we don't have

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.455
a good visual hierarchy here,

00:01:39.455 --> 00:01:41.825
making our redesign
less accessible.

00:01:41.825 --> 00:01:43.340
How can we fix that?

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.325
Well, I would use a
lighter color for

00:01:46.325 --> 00:01:49.820
the description and the
cancel button. Because, why?

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.200
Because of the importance of

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.560
visual hierarchy are
most important elements,

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.570
which are the title and

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.975
the Confirm button should
get the most attention.

00:01:59.975 --> 00:02:02.510
Therefore, they
cancel button and

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.040
the description should have

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.350
a lighter tints of our colors.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.050
Now let's compare it
with the grayscale mode.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.840
Obviously, it looks much
better now in terms of

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.870
both accessibility
and visual hierarchy.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.510
If you want to have an
efficient design process,

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.000
make sure to start
with gray scale and

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.430
then apply colors
to your design.
