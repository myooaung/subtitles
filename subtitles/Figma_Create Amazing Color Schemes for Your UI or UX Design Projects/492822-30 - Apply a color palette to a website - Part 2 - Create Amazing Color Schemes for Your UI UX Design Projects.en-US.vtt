00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.275
Now that our color
palette is ready,

00:00:07.275 --> 00:00:10.125
we need to define the
ratio of our colors

00:00:10.125 --> 00:00:13.170
because we're going to
use the 603010 rule.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.425
So let me go ahead and
remove these texts.

00:00:16.425 --> 00:00:18.075
So what colors are gonna be

00:00:18.075 --> 00:00:20.804
our primary colors
in terms of ratio,

00:00:20.804 --> 00:00:24.195
this blue is definitely
gonna be our primary color.

00:00:24.195 --> 00:00:28.410
These two colors are also going
to be our primary colors,

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.105
okay, in terms of ratio.

00:00:30.105 --> 00:00:33.000
So the first three
colors are going to be

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.105
applied to 60 per
cent of our design.

00:00:36.105 --> 00:00:39.700
And these three colors
are our secondary colors

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.804
and are gonna be applied to
30 per cent of our design.

00:00:43.804 --> 00:00:45.440
And last but not least,

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.265
the screen is going to
act as our accent color,

00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:52.730
and it covers ten per cent of
our design. Alright, Cool.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.070
Usually we need to
create color styles

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.365
before applying colors
to our project.

00:00:57.365 --> 00:01:00.815
However, since it's not
necessary for this tutorial,

00:01:00.815 --> 00:01:03.140
I'm going to skip
that step and we will

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.870
start applying our
colors to our elements.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.885
So without further ado,
let's get started.

00:01:08.885 --> 00:01:11.434
Alright, first, let's
start with the background.

00:01:11.434 --> 00:01:15.260
For the background, we can use
one of these three colors.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.200
Okay? I think this
light neutral color is

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.365
going to be a good option
for our backgrounds color.

00:01:21.365 --> 00:01:24.410
Okay, so I'm gonna
go ahead and copy

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.990
its hex color code
and let me select

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.350
my art board and paste
it for the background.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.515
And also I need to apply
to other sections as well.

00:01:33.515 --> 00:01:35.465
So for the navigation bar,

00:01:35.465 --> 00:01:37.400
I'm going to apply it here and

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.025
also for these clients section,

00:01:40.025 --> 00:01:41.525
let me paste it.

00:01:41.525 --> 00:01:44.825
I'm going to scroll
down our right.

00:01:44.825 --> 00:01:47.675
As you can see for the
testimonial section,

00:01:47.675 --> 00:01:49.984
we need to use a
dark background.

00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:50.690
Why?

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.090
Because here we
have a dark shade,

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.700
which color can be
used for this section.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.890
I think one of our
secondary colors

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.180
would be a good option.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.520
So I'm gonna go with
this middle blue.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.860
Let me copy its color code and

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.365
I'm going to apply it to
this background, okay?

00:02:06.365 --> 00:02:08.150
Alright, cool. As you can see,

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.650
we have a good contrast between

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.870
the cards and our background.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:12.320
Cool.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.895
And what about here?

00:02:13.895 --> 00:02:15.365
As you can see here,

00:02:15.365 --> 00:02:17.720
we also need to
use a dark color.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.350
For this section, I'm going
to use our primary color.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.425
Okay, so let me copy
the hex color code

00:02:24.425 --> 00:02:28.955
and I'm going to apply
to it just like that.

00:02:28.955 --> 00:02:31.715
And there we go, our right,

00:02:31.715 --> 00:02:34.820
our backgrounds colors have
been applied successfully.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.954
Now it's time to move
on to other sections.

00:02:37.954 --> 00:02:39.680
So let's start from the top.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.155
For these links,
I'm going to use

00:02:42.155 --> 00:02:45.035
my secondary color,
okay, this one.

00:02:45.035 --> 00:02:47.795
So I'm going to copy
the hex color code.

00:02:47.795 --> 00:02:51.305
And let me select
all these links.

00:02:51.305 --> 00:02:54.125
And also this error icon.

00:02:54.125 --> 00:02:58.085
And I'm going to apply it
to all these texts layers.

00:02:58.085 --> 00:02:59.810
They look great. But what about

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.245
the hero section content
for these two text layers?

00:03:03.245 --> 00:03:05.180
I think the primary color

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.995
would be good because
we are going to create

00:03:06.995 --> 00:03:08.540
a high contrast ratio

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.795
between our background
and our foreground.

00:03:11.795 --> 00:03:15.425
So I'm gonna go with
this primary color.

00:03:15.425 --> 00:03:17.690
Let me copy it and select

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.825
these two text layers and
I'm going to paste it.

00:03:20.825 --> 00:03:21.335
Cool.

00:03:21.335 --> 00:03:23.480
The last thing we need
to modify here is

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.075
the CTA or call
to action button.

00:03:26.075 --> 00:03:27.830
And as you know, for CTAs,

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.245
we usually use an
accent color because

00:03:30.245 --> 00:03:32.990
it needs to draw the
user's attention to it.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.940
I'm going to copy
the hex color code

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.530
of our acts and color,

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.405
and let me paste it here.

00:03:38.405 --> 00:03:42.080
And for the text, I'm going
to use white for now.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.794
Okay? I'm not sure
about contrast ratio,

00:03:44.794 --> 00:03:47.045
but for now we don't
need to worry about it,

00:03:47.045 --> 00:03:49.880
because later on, we will
validate our colors in

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.570
terms of contrast ratio
and color accessibility.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:54.860
Alright, since we need to be

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.124
consistent throughout
our project,

00:03:57.124 --> 00:04:01.190
I'm going to use the same
color for these texts as well.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.080
So let me copy it.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.090
And I'm going to paste it for

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.480
these two text
layers here as well.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.920
And also we are going to apply

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.710
the same color to all
these texts layers.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:17.335
So I'm going to select all
of them and paste the color.

00:04:17.335 --> 00:04:19.060
Now let's see which
colors should be

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.505
used for our cards here.

00:04:21.505 --> 00:04:23.980
So the cards are gonna be white,

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.000
as you can see here we
have white cards and here

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.325
we also have two white cards

00:04:30.325 --> 00:04:32.080
and they look clean and amazing.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.650
But the things we need to
modify our these icons,

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.550
the texts layers, and also
these Explore button.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.245
For these icons.

00:04:41.245 --> 00:04:44.770
As you can see, we have
three different shades.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.040
Therefore, we need to use
three different colors.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.555
Okay, so I'm going to use

00:04:49.555 --> 00:04:53.215
our secondary and accent
colors for these icons.

00:04:53.215 --> 00:04:55.210
Let me go ahead and copy

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.155
the color code of
these secondary color.

00:04:58.155 --> 00:05:00.800
Now instead of
changing the color of

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.205
these icons one by one
on the right side,

00:05:04.205 --> 00:05:06.080
under the selection colors,

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.960
you can see that we have
three different shades.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.610
And I'm going to
select the first

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.055
one and paste the color code.

00:05:13.055 --> 00:05:15.680
There we go. We apply
the first color.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.000
Now it's time to apply

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.640
the second color,
which is this one.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.200
So I'm gonna go ahead and copy

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.110
the color code of my
other secondary color.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.060
I'm going to select
the feature list and

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.130
the next shade is
gonna be this one.

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.525
So let me paste it.

00:05:29.525 --> 00:05:32.135
There we go. They
look amazing already.

00:05:32.135 --> 00:05:34.820
And for the last color,
I'm going to use.

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:35.990
The axon colors.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.635
So let me copy the color
code, select the cards,

00:05:39.635 --> 00:05:41.225
and I'm going to click on see

00:05:41.225 --> 00:05:43.685
all five colors. There we go.

00:05:43.685 --> 00:05:44.930
I'm going to paste it.

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.595
They look awesome, don't they?

00:05:46.595 --> 00:05:48.200
And as you can see, the color of

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.850
our Explore button has been

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.080
changed as well because

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.600
the same shade has been
used for that before.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.025
So we don't need to modify it.

00:05:55.025 --> 00:05:56.825
Okay. For the text,

00:05:56.825 --> 00:05:58.790
I'm going to go ahead and copy

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.730
the primary color
and paste it here.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:02.120
Cool.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.345
Can you see how beautiful
and clean this section is?

00:06:05.345 --> 00:06:06.860
The reason is that we used

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.575
a color harmony to come up
with this color palette.

00:06:09.575 --> 00:06:12.680
And also we use the 603010 rule.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.100
Now it's time to modify our
explorer All button here.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.240
Okay? This button, I'm going
to use our accent color,

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.425
which is this green.

00:06:21.425 --> 00:06:24.515
And for the text and
this arrow icon,

00:06:24.515 --> 00:06:26.615
I'm going to use white for now.

00:06:26.615 --> 00:06:27.905
What about here?

00:06:27.905 --> 00:06:29.240
The cars are okay,

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.900
but we need to modify the
color of these texts, okay,

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.405
so I'm going to select
them and let me apply

00:06:35.405 --> 00:06:38.105
our primary color
to all these texts.

00:06:38.105 --> 00:06:40.100
For these texts,
I'm going to use

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.770
the neutral color that
we created before.

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.160
So let me go ahead and
copy its color code.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.570
And now I'm going to apply

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.300
the same colors to
all these content.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.730
So let me fast forward
this process in

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.490
order to save your time
are right, It's done.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.760
Now let me modify the color
of these large tidal, okay,

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.105
I think our light neutral
color would be great for that.

00:07:02.105 --> 00:07:03.530
So let me choose that.

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.435
And what about these
quotation mark?

00:07:05.435 --> 00:07:07.160
Well, obviously we need to use

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.410
our secondary color
for it. Okay.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.480
But the light blue
one, this one,

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.970
I'm going to copy
the hex color code

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:15.680
and let me paste it here.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.510
It's too bright, so I'm going to

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.450
decrease the opacity to 20%.

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:21.950
Now it looks much better.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:23.600
This section is done as well.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.300
Now we can move forward
to another section.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.750
Here, as you can see, we
have three different circles

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.960
behind these photos and
they are light teens.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.460
Okay, so we should decrease

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.995
the opacity of our
colors here as well.

00:07:36.995 --> 00:07:38.210
For the first one,

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:41.030
I'm going to use our
primary color for it.

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.615
And let me decrease the
opacity to 20 per cent.

00:07:44.615 --> 00:07:46.100
For the second one,

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.160
I'm going to use our
blue secondary color

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.720
and I'm going to decrease

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.225
the opacity to 20
per cent as well.

00:07:53.225 --> 00:07:54.725
And for the last one,

00:07:54.725 --> 00:07:57.035
I'm going to use
our accent color,

00:07:57.035 --> 00:08:01.100
and also decrease the
opacity to 20 per cent.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:04.640
Since these titles,
car, office, and house,

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.055
correspond with these photos,

00:08:07.055 --> 00:08:08.975
I'm going to modify the color of

00:08:08.975 --> 00:08:11.985
these bullet points right
before these titles.

00:08:11.985 --> 00:08:14.210
Okay, so the first one is going

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:16.520
to have our primary color,

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.025
but we don't need to
decrease the opacity here.

00:08:19.025 --> 00:08:23.045
The second one is going to
have our secondary color.

00:08:23.045 --> 00:08:25.355
And the last one
is going to have

00:08:25.355 --> 00:08:27.470
our accent color or write

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:29.615
this section looks
great as well.

00:08:29.615 --> 00:08:30.710
I hope you like it.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.825
Now let's move on to
the next section.

00:08:32.825 --> 00:08:35.090
This is called the CTA section.

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:37.055
Okay, so here we need to modify

00:08:37.055 --> 00:08:39.260
the text color
only for the text,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.720
I'm going to use our
neutral color that we

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.780
used for our background,
just like that.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:46.160
And last but not least,

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.040
we need to apply colors
to our footer as well.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.345
So for these texts and these
categories, at the top,

00:08:53.345 --> 00:08:56.315
I'm going to use our
dole neutral color,

00:08:56.315 --> 00:08:57.725
which is this one.

00:08:57.725 --> 00:08:59.135
So let me choose that.

00:08:59.135 --> 00:09:00.560
Alright, cool. As you can see,

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.450
it's been applied
to all these texts

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.685
layers for these CTA button,

00:09:04.685 --> 00:09:07.265
I'm going to use the
accent color, this one.

00:09:07.265 --> 00:09:08.615
And also for the text,

00:09:08.615 --> 00:09:10.175
I'm going to use white.

00:09:10.175 --> 00:09:11.854
And for these links,

00:09:11.854 --> 00:09:15.155
I'm going to use our
primary color, okay?

00:09:15.155 --> 00:09:16.145
This one.

00:09:16.145 --> 00:09:17.855
What about this divider,

00:09:17.855 --> 00:09:21.725
this disclaimer, and also
the social media icons.

00:09:21.725 --> 00:09:24.590
I think if we use our
LDL neutral color,

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:25.655
it would be great.

00:09:25.655 --> 00:09:27.740
The one that we
used for this text.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.590
So I'm going to copy
it and paste it for

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:35.420
all these elements and also
for these icons are right,

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.310
as you can see
before got to change

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.695
the color of the word draft.

00:09:39.695 --> 00:09:41.630
I'm going to use
our secondary color

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:43.790
for it. Alright, cool.

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:45.410
Our landing page is ready.

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:48.485
We successfully created a
color palette and applied

00:09:48.485 --> 00:09:50.570
all those colors to our design

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:53.540
according to the 603010 rule.

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.075
Okay, so let's
preview it are rife.

00:09:56.075 --> 00:09:58.115
Our heuristic chain looks good.

00:09:58.115 --> 00:10:00.665
The navigation bar looks clean.

00:10:00.665 --> 00:10:04.474
We have the CTA bar
using the accent color.

00:10:04.474 --> 00:10:07.175
Our cards here are white.

00:10:07.175 --> 00:10:09.515
These cars looks great as well.

00:10:09.515 --> 00:10:11.600
We have used the
analogous color scheme

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.550
for these icons are right,

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.160
the testimonial section
looks clean as well.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.160
For this section, we use
the primary color and

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.730
some tints of our secondary
and x and colors.

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:25.640
For this section, we used
our primary color as

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.860
our background and
a neutral color

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.750
for our foreground content.

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:30.950
And last but not least,

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:32.179
we used our primary,

00:10:32.179 --> 00:10:35.360
secondary and accent
colors for the footer.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.055
So everything looks cool.

00:10:37.055 --> 00:10:39.860
However, now we need to
check our colors and see

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.905
whether they passed the
contrast ratio test or not.

00:10:42.905 --> 00:10:44.495
So I'm going to
start from the top

00:10:44.495 --> 00:10:46.250
and then we want
to other sections.

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:48.200
So first of all, let
me select one of

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.820
these links, e.g. about.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.045
Then I'm going to
right-click on that.

00:10:53.045 --> 00:10:55.925
And I'm going to run
the contrast plugin.

00:10:55.925 --> 00:10:57.680
As you can see these
color palettes,

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:02.045
the contrast ratio test
for WA and AAA levels.

00:11:02.045 --> 00:11:03.380
And it's fantastic.

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:04.940
But what about these texts?

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:08.450
It also passed all the
tests and it's great.

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:10.010
Now I'm going to select these,

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:11.375
get us started text.

00:11:11.375 --> 00:11:13.160
Oops, as you can see,

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.965
although it looks very
good on our interface,

00:11:15.965 --> 00:11:18.380
it failed the
contrast ratio test.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.075
So we need to fix that.

00:11:20.075 --> 00:11:21.545
We have two options.

00:11:21.545 --> 00:11:24.125
We can either modify
our accent color,

00:11:24.125 --> 00:11:26.315
which is not a good
idea in my opinion,

00:11:26.315 --> 00:11:28.730
or we could modify
our texts color.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.140
So instead of white,

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:32.270
I'm going to go ahead and choose

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:34.595
our primary color
for these texts.

00:11:34.595 --> 00:11:38.225
And now as you can see it
pass the contrast ratio test.

00:11:38.225 --> 00:11:40.910
Can you see how important
it is to validate

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:43.580
your colors in terms
of contrast ratio.

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:46.730
Let me go ahead and
modify all other buttons,

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:51.245
like here, and also here.

00:11:51.245 --> 00:11:53.900
Okay, cool. But what about here?

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:55.265
If I select this text,

00:11:55.265 --> 00:11:58.280
you can see that it passed
the contrast ratio test.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.155
What about this Explore button?

00:12:00.155 --> 00:12:02.960
It also pass the
contrast ratio test.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:06.725
And here, as you can see it
past the contrast ratio test,

00:12:06.725 --> 00:12:09.635
we already checked these
color against our background.

00:12:09.635 --> 00:12:11.510
So we know that it passed

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:15.155
the contrast ratio test
for these texts as well.

00:12:15.155 --> 00:12:16.310
But what about here?

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:17.510
Let me select it,

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:18.905
right, as you can see,

00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:21.080
it pass the AAA level for

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:25.265
normal text and AA and AAA
levels for large text.

00:12:25.265 --> 00:12:26.825
So it's not a problem.

00:12:26.825 --> 00:12:28.520
Here. We already checked

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.485
that color against
our background.

00:12:30.485 --> 00:12:32.300
And basically that's all.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:36.455
Now that we validated our
colors based on contrast ratio,

00:12:36.455 --> 00:12:38.645
it's time to validate our colors

00:12:38.645 --> 00:12:41.045
based on the colorblindness
deficiencies.

00:12:41.045 --> 00:12:43.535
Okay, so I'm going to
select my art board.

00:12:43.535 --> 00:12:45.695
It's not grayscale mode anymore.

00:12:45.695 --> 00:12:49.325
And then I'm going to run a
plugin called color filters.

00:12:49.325 --> 00:12:50.975
If I click on gray scale,

00:12:50.975 --> 00:12:54.260
we can see that we've got
a grayscale mode again,

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.810
and we have different
shades of gray.

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:59.765
So the visual hierarchy
looks very good.

00:12:59.765 --> 00:13:01.730
We have good contrast ratio

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:04.415
here for our content
and our Watson's.

00:13:04.415 --> 00:13:06.395
Everything looks great.

00:13:06.395 --> 00:13:08.975
Now let's take another
color deficiency.

00:13:08.975 --> 00:13:12.305
I'm going to undo the process
Command Z or Control Z.

00:13:12.305 --> 00:13:17.000
And let me run that plugin
once again and choose e.g.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.800
red lines are right,

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.660
we have good shades as well.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:22.970
So everything looks
clean to people

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:26.030
suffering from these
color vision deficiency.

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:27.815
And last but not least,

00:13:27.815 --> 00:13:31.775
Let's check it for another
color deficiency, e.g.

00:13:31.775 --> 00:13:33.275
blue cone, monochrome Massey.

00:13:33.275 --> 00:13:36.710
And clearly we have
great shades so

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:41.030
people won't face any problem
while using this website.

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:43.190
Alright, let's preview
our landing page

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:44.495
for the last time.

00:13:44.495 --> 00:13:48.185
Can you see how clean
these landing pages colors

00:13:48.185 --> 00:13:51.740
are harmonious and also
accessible to everyone.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.125
Alright guys, that's
all for this video.

00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:58.140
I hope you enjoyed it and
I'll see you in the next one.
