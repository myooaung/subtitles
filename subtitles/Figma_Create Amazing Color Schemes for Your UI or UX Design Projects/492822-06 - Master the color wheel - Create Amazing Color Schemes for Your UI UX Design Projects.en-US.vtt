00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.190
Have you ever wondered
how some UI designers

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.775
create the perfect color
palettes for their projects.

00:00:11.775 --> 00:00:13.140
They don't just use their

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.330
artistic skills for this matter.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.960
They use science and it's
called color theory.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.369
To learn this science,

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.155
you should understand what

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:25.050
a color wheel is and
how you can use it.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.700
This is a color wheel.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.275
And just like what you
learned in school,

00:00:29.275 --> 00:00:30.995
It's made of primary,

00:00:30.995 --> 00:00:33.455
secondary, and tertiary colors.

00:00:33.455 --> 00:00:37.460
The primary colors are
red, blue, and yellow.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.665
If we mix these colors together,

00:00:39.665 --> 00:00:42.095
they make the
secondary colors and

00:00:42.095 --> 00:00:44.945
your green, orange, and purple.

00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:49.220
Finally, when we mix the
secondary and primary colors,

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.410
they make the tertiary colors

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.930
yellow, orange, red, orange,

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.390
red, violet, blue violet,

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.790
blue green, and yellow green.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.590
These make up the color wheel

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.155
invented by Sir Isaac Newton,

00:01:03.155 --> 00:01:06.575
and it simplifies how we can
work with different colors.

00:01:06.575 --> 00:01:08.660
The color wheel can
be divided into

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.730
two main groups
based on the color,

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.715
temperature, cool,
and warm colors.

00:01:13.715 --> 00:01:16.340
But how can we use the
color wheel to come up

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.250
with amazing color
palettes for our projects.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.370
Well, we can use some
basic formulas known as

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.050
color harmonies to pick

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.005
different colors from the
color wheel harmoniously.

00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:31.109
We will talk about color
harmonies in future videos.
