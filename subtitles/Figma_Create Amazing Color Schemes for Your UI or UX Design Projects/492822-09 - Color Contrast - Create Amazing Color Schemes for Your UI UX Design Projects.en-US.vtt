00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.260
Color contrast is
the difference in

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.155
light between the
foreground and background.

00:00:10.155 --> 00:00:11.415
Does it sound weird?

00:00:11.415 --> 00:00:12.944
Let me show you an example.

00:00:12.944 --> 00:00:14.745
Here is a sharp background,

00:00:14.745 --> 00:00:16.650
and if we add an element with

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.840
a saturated color on top of it,

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.210
we will get this
terrible piece of art.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.890
And I wish I could
pretend that I have

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.690
never seen such an awful design.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.015
Fortunately, we could fix that.

00:00:27.015 --> 00:00:29.594
You could often get a
better contrast ratio

00:00:29.594 --> 00:00:31.695
just by modifying the tones,

00:00:31.695 --> 00:00:34.485
teens, or saturation
of your colors.

00:00:34.485 --> 00:00:37.290
A contrast ratio is just
the value assigned to

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.535
the difference in light

00:00:38.535 --> 00:00:40.724
between foreground
and background.

00:00:40.724 --> 00:00:42.250
The higher the ratio,

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.500
the easier it gets to read
the content on the screen.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.330
Here are a few tips
that could take

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.225
your design quality
from good to great.

00:00:50.225 --> 00:00:52.640
Tip number one, never use pure

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.430
black and pure white
and vice-versa.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.330
It causes digital eyes train
and Hertz user's eyes.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.880
Instead, you can use a very dark

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.850
gray on a very light
gray and vice-versa.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.745
Tip number two, don't
use a bright color.

00:01:07.745 --> 00:01:08.960
On a bright color.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.510
It doesn't let your
elements stand out.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.265
Instead, you can use

00:01:13.265 --> 00:01:16.925
a bright color on a dark
shade tip number three,

00:01:16.925 --> 00:01:18.560
always check your colors on

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.170
both light and dark backgrounds.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.840
Sometimes you may need
to adjust them to get

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.675
a good contrast ratio
on dark backgrounds.

00:01:26.675 --> 00:01:29.525
And last but not least,
tip number four,

00:01:29.525 --> 00:01:31.280
always validate your colors

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.170
by checking the contrast ratio.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.430
Believe me, there are

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.115
beautiful looking user
interface designs on

00:01:37.115 --> 00:01:39.140
Dribbble and be hands that

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.195
failed the contrast ratio test.

00:01:41.195 --> 00:01:42.560
You will learn how to check

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.990
the contrast ratio
later in this course.
