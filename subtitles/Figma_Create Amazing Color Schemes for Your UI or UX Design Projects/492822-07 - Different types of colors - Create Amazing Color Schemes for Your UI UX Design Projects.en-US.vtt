00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.365
As I mentioned in
the previous video,

00:00:07.365 --> 00:00:09.539
we have two groups of colors,

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:11.669
cool and warm colors.

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:14.040
But how should we know
which group is more

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.785
suitable for our
UI design project?

00:00:16.785 --> 00:00:20.235
Each group of colors has
some characteristics

00:00:20.235 --> 00:00:23.970
that help us decide whether
it's a good choice or not.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.555
E.g. cool colors
represent water,

00:00:27.555 --> 00:00:32.520
snow, sky, and they are called
soothing and refreshed.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.645
On the other hand,

00:00:33.645 --> 00:00:39.350
warm colors represent heat,
sunlight, and friendliness.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.765
They are energetic, exciting,

00:00:41.765 --> 00:00:43.400
and cozy in general,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.965
depending on the brand
characteristics,

00:00:45.965 --> 00:00:48.395
we can decide which color group

00:00:48.395 --> 00:00:50.300
is suitable for our project.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.895
For instance, if
their brand offers

00:00:52.895 --> 00:00:55.595
exciting and fun activities,

00:00:55.595 --> 00:00:57.950
you can go with the warm colors.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.165
Conversely, you can use
cool colors if the brand is

00:01:02.165 --> 00:01:07.115
all about trust, safeness,
professionalism, etc.

00:01:07.115 --> 00:01:09.260
So the colors we use should

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.450
reflect the brand's personality.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.550
In addition to these two groups,

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.600
we have another group of
colors called neutral colors,

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.275
white, black, brown, and gray.

00:01:21.275 --> 00:01:24.545
Neutral colors don't
appear in the color wheel.

00:01:24.545 --> 00:01:27.230
We usually use them for
backgrounds because they

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.735
complement and
highlight other colors

00:01:29.735 --> 00:01:31.385
pretty well in our design.

00:01:31.385 --> 00:01:34.445
But using a gray or white
color as the background

00:01:34.445 --> 00:01:37.010
doesn't always look
interesting anesthetic

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.255
to the user xyz,

00:01:38.255 --> 00:01:42.110
then what can we do to make
our design look even better?

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.670
We can add a hue and

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.700
a lethal saturation to
the neutral colors.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.305
Thanks to this technique,

00:01:48.305 --> 00:01:50.090
the neutral colors look more

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.980
interesting to the users lines.
