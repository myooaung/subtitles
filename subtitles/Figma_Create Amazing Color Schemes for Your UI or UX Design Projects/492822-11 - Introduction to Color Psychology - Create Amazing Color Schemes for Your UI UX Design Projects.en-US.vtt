00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.359
Knowing how to pair colors
is crucial for any designer.

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:11.220
However, it's not enough for

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.634
creating a meaningful design.

00:00:13.634 --> 00:00:16.935
Let's look into the meaning
of individual colors.

00:00:16.935 --> 00:00:19.425
Nevertheless, any
color can convey

00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:22.410
a positive or negative
feeling to the users.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.150
So you wanna make sure you use

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.719
the right colors to communicate
with users properly.

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:31.695
Each color can have positive
and negative feelings.

00:00:31.695 --> 00:00:33.480
So it's important to use them in

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.900
the right place to avoid
any misunderstanding.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.250
Read, rev implicates excitement,

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.459
love, power, and energy.

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:47.494
It also could convey danger,
error, and aggression.

00:00:47.494 --> 00:00:49.910
So ensure to clarify
the intense with

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.630
a short description
alongside the color yellow.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.405
Yellow represents creativity,

00:00:56.405 --> 00:00:59.735
happiness, optimism,
and friendliness.

00:00:59.735 --> 00:01:03.725
That's why McDonalds uses
it as its brand color.

00:01:03.725 --> 00:01:04.625
Orange.

00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:08.524
Orange could provide the
users with a sense of warmth.

00:01:08.524 --> 00:01:12.380
It's in winding and show's
success and confidence.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.250
Green.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.140
Green is a dominant color in

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.320
nature that can evoke
powerful emotions.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.340
It represents health,
freshness, and growth.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.020
If you want to design a project

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.014
for an eco-friendly product,

00:01:26.014 --> 00:01:28.685
that's probably the best
color you could use.

00:01:28.685 --> 00:01:29.630
Blue.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.935
Blue signifies trust,
calmness, and peace.

00:01:33.935 --> 00:01:37.775
For some people, it's a sign
of sadness and depression.

00:01:37.775 --> 00:01:39.260
You may have recognized that

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.110
most technology and
corporate websites use

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.565
blue to deliver a sense
of trust and respect.

00:01:46.565 --> 00:01:50.000
Some hospitals also use
blue on their website.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.890
By far, blue is the most
preferred color by all users.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.530
This is why you see many
mobile applications and

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.145
websites out there using blue
as their dominant color.

00:02:01.145 --> 00:02:03.830
Violet. While it is a color that

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.725
symbolizes royalty and wealth.

00:02:06.725 --> 00:02:09.620
Since the wind, the die
was scarce in the past,

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.915
it was reserved for royalty.

00:02:11.915 --> 00:02:15.455
It's also the favorite
color of many female users,

00:02:15.455 --> 00:02:18.605
and it provides a
sense of creativity.

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:22.925
Pink, pink is a color of
compassion and positivity.

00:02:22.925 --> 00:02:27.094
While pink has been used for
feminine products for years,

00:02:27.094 --> 00:02:29.540
it can be gender
neutral as well,

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.910
but makes sure to think
twice when you want to use

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.910
pink for a woodworking
shop website.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.400
Brown. Just like green.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.920
Brown, is associated
with nature,

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.950
even though it can provide
a sense of coziness.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.440
It can also be dull and dirty.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.810
Made sure to check
different brown shades

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.000
before applying them
to your design.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.980
Because a light brown can look

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.055
clean and a dark
one can look dirty.

00:02:55.055 --> 00:02:55.985
Black.

00:02:55.985 --> 00:03:00.620
Black implies elegance,
luxury and sophistication.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.170
Make sure to use it
properly as it might

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.170
provide a sense of sorrow
and sadness as well.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.050
Although it's commonly
used for text,

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.810
you could use it for the
background as long as

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.630
you put vibrant colors
in the foreground.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:15.590
White.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.125
We see white in
almost any design.

00:03:18.125 --> 00:03:19.340
And that's because it

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.565
symbolizes cleanliness
and simplicity.

00:03:22.565 --> 00:03:25.070
If you want to design
a minimalistic webpage

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.555
or a mobile application,

00:03:26.555 --> 00:03:28.880
made sure to use white a lot.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.835
You may be familiar with
the term whitespace.

00:03:31.835 --> 00:03:33.995
And it means leaving some space

00:03:33.995 --> 00:03:37.130
empty that the user
doesn't feel overwhelmed.

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.570
Not to mention it lets

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.075
other colors pop in
your design as well.

00:03:41.075 --> 00:03:42.950
From now on, I want you to

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.960
think about the meaning
of colors you use

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.460
in your projects that you could

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.770
upgrade your design
from good, too awesome.
