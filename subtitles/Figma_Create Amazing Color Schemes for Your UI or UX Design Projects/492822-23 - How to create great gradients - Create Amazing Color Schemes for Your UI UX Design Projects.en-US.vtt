00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.020
Now that you know how to create

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.810
a great color palette
for your projects,

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.720
it's time to talk
about gradients.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.310
What's a gradient?

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.250
A gradient is a
gradual transition

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.890
from one color to another color.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.235
Although using gradients in
your design is optional,

00:00:23.235 --> 00:00:26.640
it adds character and
personality to your design.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.455
That's why most designers

00:00:28.455 --> 00:00:31.320
nowadays use gradients
in their design.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.145
We have basically four
different types of gradients,

00:00:35.145 --> 00:00:39.640
linear, radial,
angular, and diamond.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.820
But the most popular one
is the linear gradient.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.995
Now let me show you
how you can create

00:00:45.995 --> 00:00:48.650
great gradients
for your projects.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.470
First, open up coolers.co.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.990
Now click on the More menu at

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.455
the top and click on the
create a gradient button.

00:00:57.455 --> 00:00:59.494
Here we could create
our gradient.

00:00:59.494 --> 00:01:02.030
As you can see, we have
different colors here.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.010
If I hover my mouse on top of

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.815
these slider and
click somewhere,

00:01:06.815 --> 00:01:09.605
I can add a new color
to this slider.

00:01:09.605 --> 00:01:11.405
If I want to remove a color,

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:14.720
I can click on this remove
button just like that.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.075
Now that we have two
different colors,

00:01:17.075 --> 00:01:21.575
let me tell you how you can
come up with great gradients,

00:01:21.575 --> 00:01:24.080
because obviously not all colors

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.870
look great when we
blend them together,

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.240
let me select my
first color and I'm

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.685
gonna change it to blue,

00:01:31.685 --> 00:01:34.460
okay, e.g. this blue.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.665
Now I'm going to show
you a bad example.

00:01:36.665 --> 00:01:38.870
Let me select the
second color and

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.944
change it to e.g. orange.

00:01:41.944 --> 00:01:43.010
Just like that.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.710
As you can see, this
gradient doesn't look very

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.370
good because we don't have
a smooth transition here,

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.965
although we are using
your color harmony,

00:01:51.965 --> 00:01:53.810
the result is not good.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.750
Remember some color
harmonies are only

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.990
good for solid colors,
not gradients.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.625
But how can we make it better?

00:02:01.625 --> 00:02:03.065
Here is my technique.

00:02:03.065 --> 00:02:05.120
Recommend that you
should use that too,

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.370
because it's so
simple and it's going

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.785
to make your life
much, much easier.

00:02:09.785 --> 00:02:11.960
First, select your first color,

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.210
copy the hex color code,

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.940
and paste it for
the second color.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.420
Okay, so here we have
two identical colors.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.940
Now, using the color picker,

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.780
I'm going to move the
slider to the right and to

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.625
the left in order to pick

00:02:28.625 --> 00:02:31.190
analogous colors,
just like that.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.260
Now can you see how amazing and

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.570
smooth these color
transition is?

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.595
Now let's try another example.

00:02:37.595 --> 00:02:39.740
I'm going to move the hue slider

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.320
to the left side a little bit.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.510
Can you see how beautiful it is?

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.520
You can also modify
the brightness

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.755
of your colors if you wish.

00:02:48.755 --> 00:02:50.270
It's totally up to you.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.460
This technique always works.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.565
So in order to create
great gradients,

00:02:55.565 --> 00:02:57.995
you need to remember
only one rule.

00:02:57.995 --> 00:03:00.695
And that's using the
analogous color harmony.

00:03:00.695 --> 00:03:03.410
If you want to come up
with random gradients,

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.170
you can easily click
on this random button

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.545
and coolers creates
random gradients for you.

00:03:09.545 --> 00:03:10.970
Just like that.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.265
The other thing you can do is

00:03:13.265 --> 00:03:16.130
use monochromatic color harmony.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.220
So just by using one color and

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.085
different shades and
tints of that color,

00:03:22.085 --> 00:03:24.500
you can come up with
great gradients.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.700
Just like that.
