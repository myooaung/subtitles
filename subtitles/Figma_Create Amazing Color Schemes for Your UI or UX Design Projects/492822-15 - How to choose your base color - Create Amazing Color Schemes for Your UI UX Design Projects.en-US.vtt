00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.200
In this video, we're
going to talk about

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.460
the process of picking

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.710
a base color for
your color palettes.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.190
The base color is the dominant
color in your project.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.660
To choose the base color,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.775
check the brand colors first.

00:00:17.775 --> 00:00:19.740
If you want to
design a website or

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.410
a mobile application for KFC,

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.210
what would be the
best base color

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.585
for your color palettes?

00:00:25.585 --> 00:00:27.860
Yes, you're right. Red.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:28.805
Why?

00:00:28.805 --> 00:00:31.640
Because the brands
costumers are familiar with

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.520
the brand's color and can
connect with your design.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.470
Incidentally, if
you need to choose

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.825
the brand's primary
color, first,

00:00:38.825 --> 00:00:40.370
list the characteristics of

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.520
the brand and think about
what color connects

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.605
to the idea behind the brand

00:00:45.605 --> 00:00:48.200
in accordance with
the color psychology,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.055
it's essential to use colors
that communicate with users.

00:00:52.055 --> 00:00:55.280
Let's suppose you want to
choose a primary color for

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.475
a company that offers
organic products.

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:00.860
In that case, green could be

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.730
a good option because it
feels natural and fresh.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.685
When you decide which color
is suitable for the brand,

00:01:07.685 --> 00:01:09.455
you can play with that colors,

00:01:09.455 --> 00:01:14.060
attributes such as saturation,
brightness, and value.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.710
Most of the time you choose

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.290
a color and you say
that it looks cool.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.060
However, when you try to

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.595
combine that color
with other colors,

00:01:22.595 --> 00:01:25.370
it may not look as
good as you expected.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.430
So make sure to check your
primary color against

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.380
other colors to see if

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.675
that's the right choice
for your project.

00:01:32.675 --> 00:01:34.790
We've been talking about
the accessibility of

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.980
colors later in this course.
