00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.625
No matter what kind of UI
design project you work on,

00:00:08.625 --> 00:00:11.520
you will need the following
colors to work with.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.045
One, primary and
secondary colors.

00:00:15.045 --> 00:00:17.340
Primary color is
the dominant color

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.294
that's used most
frequently in your UI.

00:00:20.294 --> 00:00:21.720
Usually, you should use

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.225
the brand's color as
the primary color.

00:00:24.225 --> 00:00:26.535
Consider this image
as an example,

00:00:26.535 --> 00:00:29.910
Qatar Airways uses its
pair Polish brand color

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.800
as their primary color.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.570
Optionally, you can
create a set of

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.765
secondary colors to make your
design more interesting,

00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:40.310
keep in mind that you should
use secondary colors if and

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.225
only if they are required
for your design to pop.

00:00:44.225 --> 00:00:46.190
Suppose you want
to design a menu

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.170
with different
options in order to

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.540
distinguish between
the selected option

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.205
and on selected options,

00:00:52.205 --> 00:00:54.635
you can use a secondary color

00:00:54.635 --> 00:00:58.700
to axe and colors
accent color is used to

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.530
emphasize actions and

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.290
highlight information
such as texts,

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.375
buttons, or call to action,

00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:09.319
slider, links,
progress bar, etc.

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:11.315
Once you pick your
primary color,

00:01:11.315 --> 00:01:13.130
you can use the
color harmonies we

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.395
talked about to create
the acts and color.

00:01:15.395 --> 00:01:17.330
I'll show you how
to create a color

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.940
palette step-by-step
in the next video,

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.265
consider the lift landing page.

00:01:22.265 --> 00:01:26.420
It uses purple as the axon
color and as you can see,

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.450
it has been used for
the call to action and

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.765
leans, three semantic colors.

00:01:32.765 --> 00:01:37.595
They are used for warning
error, success and information.

00:01:37.595 --> 00:01:39.575
Use yellow for warning,

00:01:39.575 --> 00:01:42.950
red for error,
green for success,

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.780
and blue for information.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.800
These colors are suggested
based on the color psychology.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.035
You are free to use
different shades,

00:01:51.035 --> 00:01:53.675
tones, and tints
of these colors.

00:01:53.675 --> 00:01:56.240
Make sure not to use
these semantic colors

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.340
interchangeably because they may

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.620
convey the wrong
message to the user.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.985
Neutral colors.

00:02:01.985 --> 00:02:03.440
White, black,

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.810
or gray schemes is colors are

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.465
mostly used for text
and background.

00:02:08.465 --> 00:02:11.420
They let all other colors
pop in your design,

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.070
almost all color palettes

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.260
require neutral colors to create

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.375
a high color contrast ratio

00:02:17.375 --> 00:02:19.835
between the background
and foreground.

00:02:19.835 --> 00:02:22.400
As you can see,
this website uses

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.385
a light neutral color
for the background.

00:02:25.385 --> 00:02:27.125
And last but not least,

00:02:27.125 --> 00:02:31.325
number five, chars and
data visualization colors,

00:02:31.325 --> 00:02:33.454
just like secondary colors,

00:02:33.454 --> 00:02:35.510
having these colors are also

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.570
optional depending on the
type of your project.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.310
If you need to have charts,

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.845
heat maps, or
Treemap in your UI,

00:02:42.845 --> 00:02:44.780
consider creating a set of

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.365
ten to 20 colors in
a particular order.

00:02:48.365 --> 00:02:50.030
You could create such colors

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.980
using the following guidelines.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.010
You can create a categorical
color scheme made of

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.380
multiple colors that contrast

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.480
to each other in
a certain order.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.310
It's good for line charts,

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.455
bar charts, et cetera.

00:03:03.455 --> 00:03:05.975
Since these are
contrasting colors,

00:03:05.975 --> 00:03:08.120
use this color
scheme when you need

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.370
to present data distinctively.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.230
The other type of
color scheme you

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.555
can create is sequential.

00:03:14.555 --> 00:03:17.330
It's a gradual transition
of colors from

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.165
light to dark and vice versa.

00:03:20.165 --> 00:03:23.045
It's suitable for
Treemap and heatmap.

00:03:23.045 --> 00:03:24.920
The last type of
color scheme you

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.200
can create is diverging.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.050
Diverging colors
are useful when you

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.350
have negative and positive
values to present.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.500
Don't use these colors
for categorical scales.
