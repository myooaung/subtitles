00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.765
When we talk about design,

00:00:06.765 --> 00:00:09.060
no matter if it's UI, UX design,

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.970
graphic design, or
even interior design,

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.225
colors play a wider
role in any of them.

00:00:15.225 --> 00:00:17.430
Undoubtedly, colors are one of

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.775
the most important
aspects of UI UX design.

00:00:20.775 --> 00:00:23.750
Without colors, It's
almost impossible

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.779
to give our design
characters and feelings.

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.165
No matter how good
your composition is,

00:00:29.165 --> 00:00:31.505
if you don't use
colors appropriately,

00:00:31.505 --> 00:00:33.710
I guarantee that your design one

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.215
stand out when you
design a project,

00:00:36.215 --> 00:00:39.500
whether it's a website
or a mobile application,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.290
it's essential to convey
the correct message and

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.710
feelings to the end-user
by choosing proper colors.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.145
But why is culture
important in UI UX design,

00:00:49.145 --> 00:00:53.014
the shorthand series, visual
first impression matters.

00:00:53.014 --> 00:00:55.070
Are you convinced? If not,

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.065
let me elaborate more on that.

00:00:57.065 --> 00:01:00.485
When users launch a mobile
application or a website,

00:01:00.485 --> 00:01:02.900
it takes them about
50 milliseconds to

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.885
decide whether they
want to stay in or not.

00:01:05.885 --> 00:01:08.840
Their decisions depend
on different factors.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.780
And one of these
factors is color usage.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.850
So can you see how
important it is

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.220
to use proper colors
in your design?

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.870
Choosing gray colors looks

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.570
complex at first
glance, but trust me,

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.550
when you learn the
fundamentals of

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.055
colors and the
science behind that,

00:01:25.055 --> 00:01:26.990
I assure you that you can create

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.335
amazing color schemes for
your projects in no time.

00:01:30.335 --> 00:01:31.804
In the following videos,

00:01:31.804 --> 00:01:33.650
you will learn
about the basics of

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.540
colors for UI UX design.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.500
So see you then.
