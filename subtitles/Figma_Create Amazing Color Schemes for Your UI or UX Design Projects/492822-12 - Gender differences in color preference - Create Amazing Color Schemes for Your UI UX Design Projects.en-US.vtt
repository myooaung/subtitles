00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.770
When designing an
app or a website,

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.340
it's essential to know who
your target audiences.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.330
Why?

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.000
Because based on the
users demographics,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.630
you can decide which colors
work best for the project and

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.420
potentially increase
the conversion rate

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.115
over the past years,

00:00:23.115 --> 00:00:25.830
different research
projects have shown that

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.099
men and women prefer
different colors,

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.750
just because we know the colors,

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.700
meaning it doesn't necessarily

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.515
mean that we should
use them all.

00:00:34.515 --> 00:00:37.500
Let's compare the
most preferred colors

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.465
by men and women side-by-side.

00:00:40.465 --> 00:00:42.530
As you can see, blue is

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.160
the most popular color
for both men and women.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.130
Now you understand why
so many websites and

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.130
applications use blue as
their dominant color.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.145
Purple is mostly liked by women,

00:00:55.145 --> 00:00:58.790
while both men and women
like red and green.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.550
Now let's compare the
most disliked colors

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.005
by men and women.

00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:05.960
As you can see,
brown and orange are

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.325
the least favorite colors
for both men and women.

00:01:10.325 --> 00:01:13.100
So next time you want to
create a color palette,

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.680
you could first do a
little bit of research to

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.845
find out who your target
audience really is.

00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:20.630
And based on what you found,

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.730
you could pick your
colors easily.
