00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
Why is it so difficult
to work with colors?

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.339
If you are a UI UX designer,

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.980
you are well aware of
the importance of color.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.780
You know that sometimes creating

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.690
the right color palette
becomes a daunting task.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.360
But why? Because you need
to know how to create

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.055
a great color combination

00:00:17.055 --> 00:00:19.050
and how to apply
it to your design.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.630
If you have no idea how
to do that and you're

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.700
struggling with creating
amazing color schemes.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.320
Don't worry, you are
in the right place.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.790
Hi, I'm Irish.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.640
I had and I am a UI UX designer.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.220
I also teach UI and UX Design at

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.940
the University of Economics
and Human Sciences in Warsaw.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.910
In this course, you
and I are going to

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.895
walk through all the
details about colors.

00:00:43.895 --> 00:00:47.675
We will start with the most
basic fundamentals of color

00:00:47.675 --> 00:00:51.784
and then move on to advanced
topics like color harmonies,

00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:54.245
color psychology,
and so much more.

00:00:54.245 --> 00:00:57.080
If you're one of those
people who think creating

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.280
a gray color palette requires
talent and artistic skills.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.875
It's probably time to
change your mindset

00:01:03.875 --> 00:01:06.695
because color is
all about science.

00:01:06.695 --> 00:01:08.240
Yes, you heard it right?

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.820
When you learn the
science behind colors,

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.260
you can easily come up with

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.320
your own harmonious color
palettes in no time.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.540
In addition to creating
color palettes,

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.090
you will also learn
how to apply colors to

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.980
your design no matter if it's

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.365
a website or an application.

00:01:24.365 --> 00:01:26.930
Moreover, we will talk
about the importance of

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.675
color accessibility
in UI UX design.

00:01:29.675 --> 00:01:31.520
And you will learn how to create

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.055
beautiful and accessible
color palettes

00:01:34.055 --> 00:01:35.780
through simple exercises.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.175
Last but not least,

00:01:37.175 --> 00:01:39.635
I'll share with you
some personal tips

00:01:39.635 --> 00:01:40.910
and tricks for working

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.680
with colors that accelerate

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.810
your design process
dramatically.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.640
This course is
designed to give you

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.710
the theoretical and practical

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.745
skill sets required to choose
and apply colors properly.

00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:54.365
It also helps you become

00:01:54.365 --> 00:01:56.945
a more confident
and better designer

00:01:56.945 --> 00:01:59.525
just by practicing
different techniques.

00:01:59.525 --> 00:02:01.460
So if you are ready
to master color

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.815

color schemes,
