00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.700
Now that you've learned how
the color combinations work,

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.620
Let's see some examples of

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.675
each color harmony to see

00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:15.030
how you can apply
them to your design.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.965
Monochromatic color scheme.

00:00:16.965 --> 00:00:19.005
As you can see, this website

00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:22.485
uses a monochromatic
color scheme. Why?

00:00:22.485 --> 00:00:26.175
Because it only uses
one single color here,

00:00:26.175 --> 00:00:28.110
but are actually we
have many colors here.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.275
Why are you saying that it
uses only one single color?

00:00:31.275 --> 00:00:32.820
At first glance, it may seem

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.530
that there are many colors here.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.105
However, we have one single
color and different shades,

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:42.310
tones, and tints of that color.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.915
The primary color is this blue,

00:00:44.915 --> 00:00:46.610
and they use a dark shade of

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.950
that color for
these large tidal.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.940
And also the links at the top
and for the sign-up button,

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:53.975
as you can see,

00:00:53.975 --> 00:00:55.760
they use the primary color

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.175
and a light tint of that color.

00:00:58.175 --> 00:01:00.710
Okay, So basically
the hue is the same,

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.620
but the value and
saturation are different.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.035
Alright, let's take a
look at another example.

00:01:06.035 --> 00:01:08.030
This website called Orbit

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.835
also uses a monochromatic
color scheme.

00:01:10.835 --> 00:01:12.140
Here they also use

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.650
only one color and they perfectly
apply these colors too.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.205
They're designed to create
a great visual hierarchy.

00:01:19.205 --> 00:01:21.845
Complimentary color
scheme are right.

00:01:21.845 --> 00:01:25.475
Here is a popular website
booking and as you can see,

00:01:25.475 --> 00:01:28.190
it uses a complimentary
color scheme.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.445
Why? Because here we
have blue and orange.

00:01:31.445 --> 00:01:33.485
These two colors are placed

00:01:33.485 --> 00:01:35.855
on the opposite sides
of the color wheel.

00:01:35.855 --> 00:01:39.215
They also use a neutral
color for the background.

00:01:39.215 --> 00:01:41.180
And this is the reason
that the orange and

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.340
the blue colors stand out here.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.990
So it's very important to choose

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.164
your background color wisely,

00:01:47.164 --> 00:01:48.590
there are some other colors,

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.855
such as green or red here,

00:01:50.855 --> 00:01:52.895
but these are semantic colors

00:01:52.895 --> 00:01:54.920
and we will talk
about them later.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.335
Let's take a look at
this mobile application.

00:01:57.335 --> 00:01:59.435
It's also very popular company,

00:01:59.435 --> 00:02:00.515
and as you can see,

00:02:00.515 --> 00:02:03.755
it uses the same combination
here, blue and orange.

00:02:03.755 --> 00:02:05.960
It's a very popular
color combination

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.180
that you can see in
interior design,

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.735
in graphic design
and UI UX design,

00:02:11.735 --> 00:02:14.060
split complimentary
color scheme.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.720
This website uses a split
complementary color scheme.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.360
And as you can see,
it's energetic and fun.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.645
And the reason is these are
high contrast in colors.

00:02:23.645 --> 00:02:26.345
Usually we use them
in illustrations.

00:02:26.345 --> 00:02:28.700
Now let's take a look
at this website.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.285
Here I also used a split
complementary color scheme,

00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:33.560
and as you can see,

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.515
I used it for the patterns
on the right side,

00:02:36.515 --> 00:02:39.020
not for the rest of
elements on the left side.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.895
So it's very important to know

00:02:40.895 --> 00:02:43.970
which colors are suitable
for rich content.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.710
Analogous color scheme.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.725
This website uses an
analogous color scheme.

00:02:48.725 --> 00:02:50.180
And as you can see, the designer

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.700
perfectly apply these colors to

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.785
the illustration and just use

00:02:54.785 --> 00:02:57.605
a white color for the
foreground content.

00:02:57.605 --> 00:03:00.770
Therefore, we have a very
high contrast ratio here.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.085
This website also uses an
analogous color scheme.

00:03:04.085 --> 00:03:05.210
As you can see, they use

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.219
the main color as
the background,

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:10.400
and they use two other
colors that are placed on

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.105
the right and left sides of
the color on the color wheel.

00:03:14.105 --> 00:03:15.590
And they use them for

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.575
the CTA or call to
action as you can see,

00:03:18.575 --> 00:03:20.135
and also for the tidal,

00:03:20.135 --> 00:03:21.995
these are the accent colors

00:03:21.995 --> 00:03:24.395
and they should get
the most attention.

00:03:24.395 --> 00:03:26.150
Triadic color scheme.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.210
This website uses a
triadic color scheme,

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.795
and as you notice, these
colors are exciting and fun.

00:03:32.795 --> 00:03:36.665
This is also another example
of triadic color scheme.

00:03:36.665 --> 00:03:39.095
As you can see here,
the designer used

00:03:39.095 --> 00:03:42.770
some desaturated colors
to let the contents and

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.620
information like these texts

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.799
and these images pop
on those backgrounds.

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.190
And the result is great
to triadic color scheme.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.630
Here is an example of

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.185
tetrads color scheme used
in user interface design,

00:03:57.185 --> 00:03:58.310
as you can see here,

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.385
most of colors are used
for the illustration.

00:04:01.385 --> 00:04:04.730
Illustration here has
many colors like green,

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.650
orange, red, pink,
dark purple, etc.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.330
So it's not actually a good idea

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.160
to use this color scheme for

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.960
the main elements
of your project

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.110
like text, buttons, etc.

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:20.525
So unless you are an
experienced designer

00:04:20.525 --> 00:04:22.100
and know what you're doing,

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.630
I wouldn't suggest using

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.255
these colors scheme
in UI UX design.

00:04:26.255 --> 00:04:28.355
This website is another example

00:04:28.355 --> 00:04:30.305
of a triadic color scheme.

00:04:30.305 --> 00:04:33.680
Here again, we have an
illustration and it's obvious that

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.090
the designer didn't use

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.160
the whole color palette
for the content.
