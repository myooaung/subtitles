00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.870
What's the color scale?

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.915
Do you remember the three
attributes of color?

00:00:09.915 --> 00:00:14.115
Yes, I'm talking about
hue, saturation and value.

00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:17.700
A color scale is a
gradual transition of

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.485
a particular color from
light to dark or vice-versa.

00:00:22.485 --> 00:00:24.240
So what's an attribute of

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.415
color is changing
in a color scale.

00:00:26.415 --> 00:00:28.205
You're right, value.

00:00:28.205 --> 00:00:31.220
Many artists and
designers believe that

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.910
value is the most important
attribute of color.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.610
But why? Because you
don't need color to

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.580
design a beautiful and
accessible project.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.300
All you need is a gray scale
that you could use to create

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.095
a great visual hierarchy
using contrasting colors.

00:00:48.095 --> 00:00:50.510
As a designer, you
should understand

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.000
that if you don't get
the values right,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.730
the rest of your colors
want to look right?

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.080
When it comes to color,

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.860
accessibility values
play an important role.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.130
Let's take a look at the
material design color palettes

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.510
in case you don't know,

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.695
material design is a design
language developed by Google.

00:01:09.695 --> 00:01:11.900
And it gives you a
set of guidelines

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.135
to enhance your design process.

00:01:14.135 --> 00:01:18.215
Here are a few colors scales
created by material design.

00:01:18.215 --> 00:01:22.025
These colors are chosen to
work together harmoniously.

00:01:22.025 --> 00:01:24.170
As you can see, each color

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.100
corresponds with
a number 50-900.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.610
Higher values represent
darker colors,

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.925
and lower values
represent lighter ones.

00:01:34.925 --> 00:01:37.340
Having different
values of a color

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.505
helps us meet the
accessibility standards.

00:01:40.505 --> 00:01:42.590
What do I mean by accessibility?

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.050
Let's take these
purple for instance.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.810
As you can see, the
text color used on

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.010
some variance is white
and on others is black.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.555
It means that you should use

00:01:53.555 --> 00:01:57.215
a light text color on some
colors and on others.

00:01:57.215 --> 00:01:59.330
You should use a dark text color

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.460
in order for the
text to be legible,

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.120
we will explore color accessibility
later in this course.
