00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.645
When we want to use colors,

00:00:06.645 --> 00:00:09.495
there are different color
modes that we can choose from,

00:00:09.495 --> 00:00:14.490
such as CMYK, RGB,
gray scale, etc.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.735
But the most dominant
ones are CMYK and RGB.

00:00:18.735 --> 00:00:20.595
Color modes can impact how

00:00:20.595 --> 00:00:23.010
images are presented
to the users.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.780
Let me break them down for you.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.510
Cmyk stands for cyan,

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.480
magenta, yellow, and black.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.655
It's most frequently
used for color printing.

00:00:33.655 --> 00:00:37.835
Rgb stands for red,
green, and blue.

00:00:37.835 --> 00:00:41.300
It's best for digital work
because these colors are

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.130
the primary colors used in

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.685
computer screens,
mobile screens, etc.

00:00:46.685 --> 00:00:48.620
So if you are a
graphic designer who

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.140
wants to design
artwork for print,

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.015
you should use CMYK.

00:00:53.015 --> 00:00:54.920
And if you are a
UI UX designer who

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.320
wants to design for
digital screens,

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.405
you should use RGB.

00:00:59.405 --> 00:01:03.590
Let me quickly show you
how RGB differs from CMYK.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.150
Take a look at this photo.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.000
The color mode of
this image is RGB.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.900
But look what happens if
I convert it to CMYK.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.145
Did you see that?

00:01:13.145 --> 00:01:15.695
What's the reason
behind this difference?

00:01:15.695 --> 00:01:17.855
Here is the
chromaticity diagram.

00:01:17.855 --> 00:01:19.595
And this is the
range of colors that

00:01:19.595 --> 00:01:22.220
our eyes could process
and recognize.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.750
This is the range of colors
we can achieve in RGB mode.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.610
And this is the range of

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.535
colors we can achieve
in CMYK mode.

00:01:31.535 --> 00:01:34.160
As you can see, the RGB range or

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.850
gametes is much larger
than the CMYK range.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.820
That's why the RGB
mode colors look more

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.090
vibrant than the colors
on the CMYK mode.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.370
I hope now you have a
better understanding

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.945
of different color modes.

00:01:47.945 --> 00:01:50.400
See you in the next video.
