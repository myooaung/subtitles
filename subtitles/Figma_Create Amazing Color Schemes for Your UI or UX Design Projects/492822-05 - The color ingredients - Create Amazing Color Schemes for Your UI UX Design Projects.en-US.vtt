00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.230
We can break down every color

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.600
into three core ingredients.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.615
Hue, saturation, and value.

00:00:12.615 --> 00:00:16.605
Hue is basically the origin
of the color we see like red,

00:00:16.605 --> 00:00:19.949
blue, or purple, or
any other colors.

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.400
The second property of
a color is saturation,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.380
and it's the intensity of a hue.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.090
Take green for instance,

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.840
increase the saturation and
the intensity increases.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.260
And the contrary, if we
decrease that saturation,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.844
intensity decreases,

00:00:35.844 --> 00:00:38.675
the last attribute
of a color is value.

00:00:38.675 --> 00:00:41.105
It's basically the
brightness of a color.

00:00:41.105 --> 00:00:43.550
Now we can break
down the value into

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.135
two different terms,
teamed and shade.

00:00:47.135 --> 00:00:50.180
A tint is a brighter
version of a hue,

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.795
and we can create one if we
mix the heel with white.

00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:57.665
On the other hand, a shade is
a darker version of a hue.

00:00:57.665 --> 00:00:59.015
And as you may guess,

00:00:59.015 --> 00:01:02.015
we can create one by
adding black to our view.

00:01:02.015 --> 00:01:03.830
We can also create a tone of

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.395
our color by adding gray to it.

00:01:06.395 --> 00:01:09.590
In future videos, you
will learn how to create

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.100
different tints and shades of
a color for your projects.
