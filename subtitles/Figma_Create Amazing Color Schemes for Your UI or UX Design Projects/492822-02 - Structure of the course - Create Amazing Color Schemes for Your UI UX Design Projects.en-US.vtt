00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.150
Hey everyone.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.860
In this video,
we're going to talk

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.035
about the structure
of this course.

00:00:10.035 --> 00:00:13.454
This course is divided
into two different parts,

00:00:13.454 --> 00:00:16.455
the theoretical and
a practical parts.

00:00:16.455 --> 00:00:17.925
In the theoretical part,

00:00:17.925 --> 00:00:20.790
you will learn all the
fundamentals of color,

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.845
such as color theory,

00:00:22.845 --> 00:00:25.710
color psychology,
color harmonies,

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.140
and so much more in
the practical parts,

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.520
you will practice how to

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.500
apply the knowledge
you've gained in

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.015
the theoretical part to
real-world projects,

00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:37.610
we will create different
color palettes and apply

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.550
them to a website and
a mobile application.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.910
This way, you will truly
understand the process of

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.465
creating and applying color
palettes to user interfaces.

00:00:47.465 --> 00:00:50.250
So, see you in the next video.
