00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.080
No matter how beautiful and

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.330
why brands your
accent colors are,

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.985
if you don't have a
good background color,

00:00:11.985 --> 00:00:14.085
they don't get enough attention.

00:00:14.085 --> 00:00:17.474
So it's crucial to choose
your background color wisely,

00:00:17.474 --> 00:00:19.335
when it comes to background,

00:00:19.335 --> 00:00:22.560
you are not limited to
use just light colors.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.090
Sometimes we can use

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.279
the primary color
for the background,

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.710
as long as it's not
too wide brand to

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.450
make the users leave
your website or app.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.460
We can also select your
primary color and create

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.250
a very light tint by decreasing

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.265
the saturation and
increasing the brightness.

00:00:40.265 --> 00:00:44.165
As you can see, I use this
technique for this interface.

00:00:44.165 --> 00:00:48.920
For instance, you can set
the saturation value 2-8

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.170
points and set the brightness
value 95-100 points.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.330
Neutral colors are guaranteed

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.160
to work best for backgrounds.
