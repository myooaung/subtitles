00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.860
As designers, we always look for

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.595
inspiration everywhere to
keep up with design trends,

00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:14.385
come up with new
ideas and so on.

00:00:14.385 --> 00:00:17.190
Being inspired is
part of our life.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.545
And it's a very good
thing because it helps us

00:00:19.545 --> 00:00:22.530
open our minds and
try new things.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.125
We can get inspiration
for our design layout

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:27.795
or even for creating
our color palettes.

00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:30.389
Inspirational sources
are everywhere.

00:00:30.389 --> 00:00:32.655
We could get inspired by nature,

00:00:32.655 --> 00:00:34.395
but your flowers, colors,

00:00:34.395 --> 00:00:36.585
or even by a personal item.

00:00:36.585 --> 00:00:38.355
I'm going to ask you a question.

00:00:38.355 --> 00:00:40.875
What color harmony
do we have here?

00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:43.415
You are right, complimentary.

00:00:43.415 --> 00:00:44.780
What about here?

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.135
If your answer is monochromatic?

00:00:47.135 --> 00:00:48.755
You are totally right.

00:00:48.755 --> 00:00:52.010
We have monochromatic color
harmony here as well.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.200
You can also visit some websites

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.035
for inspiration like dribble,

00:00:57.035 --> 00:00:59.495
where you can choose
a color and see how

00:00:59.495 --> 00:01:03.140
other designers use
it in their artworks.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.470
You can check another
website called Color Hunt,

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.700
where you can find

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.685
many different color
palettes for your projects.

00:01:10.685 --> 00:01:13.729
The next website
is called muesli.

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.995
You can go to colors
that muse that

00:01:15.995 --> 00:01:18.860
Lee choose your
desired color palette.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.420
And it will show you how

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.020
your color scheme actually
looks on an interface.
