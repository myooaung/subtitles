00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.420
Now that you learned about

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.865
the color wheel and
color in general,

00:00:08.865 --> 00:00:11.430
it's time to learn how
to use the color wheel

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.130
to create professional-looking
color schemes.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.470
There are some basic
formulas based on

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.390
color harmony that can help

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.700
us choose harmonious
colors easily.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.055
Let's start with the
easiest formula,

00:00:23.055 --> 00:00:25.395
which is called monochromatic.

00:00:25.395 --> 00:00:28.125
It uses only one color or hue.

00:00:28.125 --> 00:00:31.320
Just choose a color on the
color wheel and create

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.830
variations using the
saturation and value.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.695
What I like about
monochromatic color schemes

00:00:37.695 --> 00:00:38.790
is the fact that they are

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.960
guaranteed to work
well together.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.330
Next color formula
is complimentary.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.205
It takes two colors from

00:00:46.205 --> 00:00:48.140
opposite sides of
the color wheel,

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.315
such as blue and orange,

00:00:50.315 --> 00:00:52.415
or yellow and purple.

00:00:52.415 --> 00:00:54.800
It's a great color scheme
when you want to use

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.305
high contrast in
colors in your design,

00:00:57.305 --> 00:00:59.600
a split complementary
color scheme

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.765
takes the colors on either
side of the complement.

00:01:02.765 --> 00:01:05.225
It gives you different
colors to work with

00:01:05.225 --> 00:01:08.090
while keeping the same
level of contrast.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.280
And analogous color scheme takes

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.935
colors that are next to each
other on the color wheel,

00:01:12.935 --> 00:01:14.660
like yellows and greens,

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.250
or blues and purples.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.605
A triadic color scheme uses

00:01:18.605 --> 00:01:21.350
three colors that
are evenly spaced.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.005
They form a triangle
on the color wheel.

00:01:24.005 --> 00:01:27.305
These color combinations
are usually vibrant,

00:01:27.305 --> 00:01:29.420
so make sure to
use them wisely in

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.240
your projects that a
triadic color scheme

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.105
takes two sets of
complimentary colors

00:01:35.105 --> 00:01:38.030
and forms a rectangle
on the color wheel.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.480
These colors work great
when you let one color act

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.140
as the main color and
the others as an accent,

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.285
you can create various teams,

00:01:47.285 --> 00:01:50.360
shades and tones within
each color palette.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.445
If you are a little
bit overwhelmed,

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:55.640
don't worry, when you start
applying these methods,

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.100
you will gain confidence
and you can easily

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.580
recognize whether some
colors work together or not.
