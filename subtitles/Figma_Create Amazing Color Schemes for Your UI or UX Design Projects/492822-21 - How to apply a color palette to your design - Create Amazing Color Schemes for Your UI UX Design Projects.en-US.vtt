00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.950
Now that you've learned
how to choose your colors

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.100
based on color harmonies
and color psychology,

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.295
it's actually time to
apply them to your design.

00:00:14.295 --> 00:00:18.495
But wait, can you apply colors
to your elements randomly?

00:00:18.495 --> 00:00:19.995
Of course you can't,

00:00:19.995 --> 00:00:22.905
unless you want your
design to look like this.

00:00:22.905 --> 00:00:24.700
It's hurtful, isn't it?

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.690
Imagine you're
cooking a portion of

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.615
delicious and beautiful
food for lunch.

00:00:29.615 --> 00:00:32.795
You have all the ingredients
ready at your disposal.

00:00:32.795 --> 00:00:34.625
And you just need
to know how much of

00:00:34.625 --> 00:00:37.850
each ingredient should
be added to your pen.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.895
If you use the ingredients
disproportionately,

00:00:40.895 --> 00:00:44.165
you may end up with a salty
meal or a tasteless me.

00:00:44.165 --> 00:00:45.950
If that's not your intent,

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.540
you need to have a recipe,

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.645
but do we have a recipe for
applying colors as well?

00:00:50.645 --> 00:00:52.565
Fortunately, yes, we do.

00:00:52.565 --> 00:00:54.770
There is a well-known
rule called

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.495
603010 that's taken
from interior design.

00:00:59.495 --> 00:01:01.115
Let's see how it works.

00:01:01.115 --> 00:01:02.495
Based on this rule,

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:04.670
you need to use 60 per cent

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.115
of your dominant
or primary color,

00:01:07.115 --> 00:01:09.770
30% of your secondary color,

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.290
and ten per cent of
your axon color.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.215
First, let's check
this interior design.

00:01:15.215 --> 00:01:17.840
As you can see, the
primary color is

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.735
used for 60 per cent
of the environment.

00:01:20.735 --> 00:01:24.980
The secondary color is used
for 30% of the environment,

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.960
and the axon color is used

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.210
for ten per cent of
the environment.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.070
Now it's time to give it a try.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.240
This an interface designed
in grayscale mode.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.730
Let's start using
only three colors.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.415
Fairs, a primary, a secondary,

00:01:40.415 --> 00:01:41.975
and an accent color.

00:01:41.975 --> 00:01:45.065
I'm going to use the primary
color for our background,

00:01:45.065 --> 00:01:49.430
the secondary color for
the text and these cards,

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.889
and the accent
color for the CTA,

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:53.420
which are these buttons,

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.870
and also for these
bars in the bar chart,

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.585
can you see how balanced
this design is?

00:01:59.585 --> 00:02:02.840
Now we could even rearrange
our color proportions.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.440
Let's replace the primary
color with our secondary color

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.205
and see how it turns out it
still looks good, doesn't it?

00:02:10.205 --> 00:02:11.720
But don't we normally have

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.045
more colors in our
color palette?

00:02:14.045 --> 00:02:17.630
Yes, we do. We can still apply
this rule even if we have

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.730
different shades of
our primary color

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.205
or more secondary
and acts and colors,

00:02:22.205 --> 00:02:24.830
we just need to keep
them in the same ratio.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.095
Let's consider these
color palettes.

00:02:27.095 --> 00:02:28.370
We might want to use

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.680
this light neutral color and

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.785
this blue primary color
mostly in our design,

00:02:33.785 --> 00:02:37.835
then both of them should
take 60% of our ratio.

00:02:37.835 --> 00:02:39.260
These two colors are now

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.255
going to be our
secondary colors.

00:02:41.255 --> 00:02:44.285
So they take 30% of our ratio.

00:02:44.285 --> 00:02:46.025
And last but not least,

00:02:46.025 --> 00:02:48.440
these two acts and colors should

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.809
take ten per cent of our ratio.

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:54.125
Now let's see how we could
apply them to our interface.

00:02:54.125 --> 00:02:56.345
We could start with
our hero section.

00:02:56.345 --> 00:02:59.510
We pick one of the colors
from our primary ratio,

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.600
which takes 60 per cent
of our design in total,

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.675
and we use it as the hero
sections background.

00:03:05.675 --> 00:03:07.730
The other primary color is also

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.415
used as the other part
of our background.

00:03:10.415 --> 00:03:11.795
Now for the content,

00:03:11.795 --> 00:03:14.105
we could use our
secondary colors.

00:03:14.105 --> 00:03:15.800
For the CTA buttons,

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.249
we need to use a color that
draws the user's attention.

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:22.430
So we should use our accent
colors for this purpose.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.505
I'm going to use yellow
for the CTA buttons and

00:03:25.505 --> 00:03:28.580
orange for the slider
button and Indicator.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.675
Remember that you should

00:03:29.675 --> 00:03:31.910
always check your
colors against each

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.335
other to see whether there is

00:03:33.335 --> 00:03:35.900
a good contrast ratio
between them or not.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.620
One accent color may look
amazing on dark backgrounds,

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.450
while the other could be only

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.640
legible on light backgrounds.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.950
This is basically
how you can allocate

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.890
different colors to different
elements of your design.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.200
One of the things you
can do to make sure that

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.750
your color ratio works
well is to create

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.610
a variance for
different parts of

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.710
your design and compare them

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.780
with each other in
terms of contents,

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.940
legibility, and accessibility.
