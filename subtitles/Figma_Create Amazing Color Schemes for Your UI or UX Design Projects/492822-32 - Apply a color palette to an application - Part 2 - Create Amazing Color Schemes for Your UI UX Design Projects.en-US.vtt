00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.520
Now it's time to apply
our colors to our design.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.280
So if you are ready,
let's get started.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.110
First of all, I'm
going to start with

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.260
these sign-in pages
for the background.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.540
First, I'm going to
select this artboard.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.960
And on the right side under
the selection colors,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.220
I'm going to click on see all
nine colors just like that.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.920
So here we have nine
different shades of

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.855
gray and we need to
modify them one by one.

00:00:31.855 --> 00:00:34.159
This one is our background.

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:36.290
For the background, I'm going to

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.720
use our light neutral color.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.630
So let me use the eyedropper and

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.870
choose our light neutral
color just like that.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.270
And if you don't know
which colors are

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.655
corresponded to which elements,

00:00:49.655 --> 00:00:51.770
you can click on
this icon to find

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.145
a particular elements that
these colors are used for.

00:00:55.145 --> 00:00:57.530
So e.g. I'm going
to click on that.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.555
And here you can
see that we have

00:00:59.555 --> 00:01:02.090
a drop shadow using this color.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.280
Alright, now let me go ahead and

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.145
modify the color of our title.

00:01:07.145 --> 00:01:09.155
For the title, as you can see,

00:01:09.155 --> 00:01:11.870
it's too dark, so we
have a dark shade.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.060
Therefore, we need to use

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.745
our dark shade that
we created here.

00:01:16.745 --> 00:01:20.330
So let me modify its
color just like that.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.100
But what about the text fields?

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.245
The text fields are
gonna be white,

00:01:24.245 --> 00:01:26.765
so we're going to leave
them as they are.

00:01:26.765 --> 00:01:28.610
However, the elements here like

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.185
these icons and these texts
layers need to be changed.

00:01:33.185 --> 00:01:34.910
So for these icons,

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.235
I'm going to use
our accent color.

00:01:37.235 --> 00:01:42.305
So let me go ahead and modify
their color just like that.

00:01:42.305 --> 00:01:45.470
Alright, but what about
these two texts layers?

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.865
For these texts layers,

00:01:46.865 --> 00:01:49.265
again, we need a dark shade,

00:01:49.265 --> 00:01:52.055
but instead of using
our primary color,

00:01:52.055 --> 00:01:55.460
I'm going to use our
neutral color, this one.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.195
So let me go ahead and
choose our neutral color.

00:01:59.195 --> 00:02:01.640
Just like that, our rights are

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.860
text fields are almost ready.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.600
However, as you can see,

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.640
we have a stroke around

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.655
them and we need to modify
their color as well.

00:02:10.655 --> 00:02:12.725
For the stroke, we have a color,

00:02:12.725 --> 00:02:14.705
but with 50 per cent opacity.

00:02:14.705 --> 00:02:15.740
So for this color,

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.530
I'm going to use our
neutral color again.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.335
And let me decrease
its opacity to

00:02:21.335 --> 00:02:24.470
50 per cent for
this one as well.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.970
Let me just do the same
process are right, cool.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.235
Now our text fields are ready,

00:02:31.235 --> 00:02:34.460
but there are three more
elements that we need to modify.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.105
Forgot Password link,
the CTA and this link.

00:02:38.105 --> 00:02:39.410
Okay, First of all,

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.510
let me select these
two links and I'm

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.775
going to use our
accent color for them.

00:02:43.775 --> 00:02:45.890
Okay? So I'm going to

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.680
choose our accent
color just like that.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.645
But what about our CTA?

00:02:50.645 --> 00:02:52.805
As you know, for the CTA,

00:02:52.805 --> 00:02:54.815
we also use our accent color,

00:02:54.815 --> 00:02:56.630
so it's gonna be so easy.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.625
Let me choose our accent color.

00:02:58.625 --> 00:03:00.470
However, remember to modify

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.525
the color of our shadow as well,

00:03:02.525 --> 00:03:04.535
because it's not a
good practice to use

00:03:04.535 --> 00:03:07.475
a Black Drop Shadow
for colorful elements.

00:03:07.475 --> 00:03:11.210
So I'm going to choose the
shadow layer and let me choose

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.130
the same color and decrease

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.685
its opacity to 32%
are right guys,

00:03:16.685 --> 00:03:18.845
as you can see, our
first sign-in page

00:03:18.845 --> 00:03:21.110
is ready and it looks
nice and clean.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.535
I hope you like it too.

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:24.410
Now we need to go
ahead and apply

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.905
the same colors to all
these sign-in pages.

00:03:27.905 --> 00:03:29.240
So I'm going to fast forward

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.460
this process to
save you some time.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.310
Our right are assigning
pages are ready.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.295
I applied the same colors
to all those elements

00:03:37.295 --> 00:03:41.075
except this error message
and this warning icon.

00:03:41.075 --> 00:03:43.040
Because we're going
to do that together.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.705
For this error message,

00:03:44.705 --> 00:03:47.615
we need to use a
semantic color. Okay?

00:03:47.615 --> 00:03:52.100
So let me go ahead and
choose these semantic color.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.890
I'm going to copy the
hex color code and

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.620
I'm going to paste
it here, are right,

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.285
it looks good, but later on,

00:03:59.285 --> 00:04:01.310
we need to validate
our colors in

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.680
terms of contrast ratio as well.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.305
But for now, we're going
to leave it as is.

00:04:06.305 --> 00:04:08.150
But what about this icon?

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.159
For these warning icon?

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:12.590
As you can see, we have
two different colors.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.305
We have a light tint
and a dark shade.

00:04:15.305 --> 00:04:17.555
So for this light teens,

00:04:17.555 --> 00:04:22.040
I'm going to use our light
teens that we created here.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.530
I'm going to copy
the hex color code

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.055
and let me paste
it for the circle.

00:04:28.055 --> 00:04:30.260
And for these two elements,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.600
I'm going to use our dark shade,

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.880
this one that we created before.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.375
So let me paste it
here and there it is.

00:04:38.375 --> 00:04:40.160
Can you see how beautiful and

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.035
harmonious these colors are now,

00:04:42.035 --> 00:04:44.630
that's why it's always
a good idea to create

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.370
different shades and
different teams of

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.380
your semantic colors are right,

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.635
so our signing pages are
completed perfectly.

00:04:51.635 --> 00:04:54.185
And now we can move
on to the next page,

00:04:54.185 --> 00:04:55.670
which is our homepage.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.905
Here we have many elements.

00:04:57.905 --> 00:04:59.434
We have a title,

00:04:59.434 --> 00:05:01.430
we have two credit cards,

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.385
we have a dialogue and
some transactions.

00:05:04.385 --> 00:05:06.395
So let me start with the title.

00:05:06.395 --> 00:05:08.345
Which color should
be used for it?

00:05:08.345 --> 00:05:11.960
If you're an series that dark
shade of our primary color,

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.105
you are 100 per cent, right?

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:15.260
We need to use colours

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.690
consistently throughout
our project.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.210
So I'm going to copy
this color and let

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.759
me paste it for these tidal.

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:24.560
But what about for
the background?

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.935
For the background, I'm
going to use the same light,

00:05:27.935 --> 00:05:30.335
neutral color, just like that.

00:05:30.335 --> 00:05:33.665
Now let's apply colors
to our credit cards.

00:05:33.665 --> 00:05:34.985
For the main card,

00:05:34.985 --> 00:05:36.905
I'm going to use
my accent color,

00:05:36.905 --> 00:05:38.750
this one, but make
sure to choose

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.045
the correct layer
in the layers list.

00:05:41.045 --> 00:05:42.785
Since I use the mask,

00:05:42.785 --> 00:05:44.660
it's called the rectangle seven.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.130
I'm going to choose that.

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.165
And let me use our accent
color for it. There we go.

00:05:50.165 --> 00:05:52.580
These texts are gonna
be white and also

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.880
these MasterCard logo
is going to stay white.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.325
But what about these lines?

00:05:58.325 --> 00:05:59.750
For this one, I'm going to use

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.745
the dark shade of
our primary color,

00:06:01.745 --> 00:06:04.445
the one that we
used for our title,

00:06:04.445 --> 00:06:07.835
this one, and this one is gonna
be white. It looks great.

00:06:07.835 --> 00:06:09.155
But what about this card?

00:06:09.155 --> 00:06:12.395
As you can see here, we
have a tint of our color,

00:06:12.395 --> 00:06:14.660
so it's a little bit brighter.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.550
The color we're
gonna use is gonna

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.965
be the same as our accent color.

00:06:18.965 --> 00:06:20.405
However, as you can see,

00:06:20.405 --> 00:06:22.880
it's brighter because I decrease

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.970
the opacity of the
main card here,

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.585
MasterCard to 250
per cent, okay?

00:06:29.585 --> 00:06:32.045
If I increase it to 100%,

00:06:32.045 --> 00:06:33.680
you can see that we don't get

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.570
a good visual hierarchy since

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.910
the main card is
not selected here,

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:42.035
it's better to make it
50% are right, Cool.

00:06:42.035 --> 00:06:44.240
But what about these cards?

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.835
The dialogue itself
is going to be white.

00:06:46.835 --> 00:06:50.465
However, these cards are going
to use our neutral color,

00:06:50.465 --> 00:06:52.640
the one that we used
for our background.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.830
And this color has
already been applied to

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.220
these cards because we use
the selection colors section,

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.975
so we don't need to modify them.

00:06:59.975 --> 00:07:02.480
But what about these
indicator for this one,

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.850
I'm going to use
my primary color,

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.010
which is this one.

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.010
And then I'm going to
decrease its opacity

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:13.325
to 15% are right, cool.

00:07:13.325 --> 00:07:15.845
Now we need to move
on to our elements.

00:07:15.845 --> 00:07:18.590
As you can see, these
squares don't have

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.770
a very dark shade like
these black shade,

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:22.895
as you can see here.

00:07:22.895 --> 00:07:26.165
Therefore, I'm going to use
our accent color for them.

00:07:26.165 --> 00:07:29.765
And if you compare these
elements colors with each other,

00:07:29.765 --> 00:07:31.970
you can see that all of them use

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.865
the same shade except this one.

00:07:34.865 --> 00:07:38.450
So if I just select my
homepage art board,

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.030
I can easily choose this color

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.970
and I can use the accent
color just like that.

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:47.120
And all of those shades have
been changed immediately.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.995
But what about these dates?

00:07:48.995 --> 00:07:50.630
For these dates, we're going to

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.615
use our dole neutral color.

00:07:53.615 --> 00:07:56.390
So I'm going to
select all of them.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:59.000
And let me go ahead and choose

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.540
our dark neutral
color just like that.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.730
Alright, cool. They look great.

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:07.310
Now we need to move
on to our last page,

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:09.425
which is the finances page.

00:08:09.425 --> 00:08:12.110
Right at the top we
have a navigation bar.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:12.785
Okay.

00:08:12.785 --> 00:08:15.425
The Elements of
this navigation bar

00:08:15.425 --> 00:08:17.600
should use the same color.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.205
I'm going to select all of them,

00:08:19.205 --> 00:08:21.980
and I'm going to use the
primary color for them.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.510
This one.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.805
Using the eyedropper.

00:08:25.805 --> 00:08:28.580
I can select my primary color.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.785
And there we go.

00:08:30.785 --> 00:08:33.200
The color has been
applied to all of them.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.700
Here we have a pie chart,

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.305
okay, for these charts,

00:08:36.305 --> 00:08:37.850
we need to use our chart and

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.980
data visualization color scheme.

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.735
Therefore, we are
not limited to use

00:08:41.735 --> 00:08:44.390
our monochromatic
color scheme anymore.

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.660
Alright, let's start
with this large shape.

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.040
I'm going to select that,

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.460
and I'm going to choose
our blue color here.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.465
So let me move these colors
art board over here.

00:08:56.465 --> 00:08:57.965
Let me select this one.

00:08:57.965 --> 00:09:00.110
And using the eyedropper,

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:01.925
I'm going to select this color.

00:09:01.925 --> 00:09:05.960
Fantastic, but these shape
has a drop shadow as well.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.884
So if you choose
this blue layer,

00:09:08.884 --> 00:09:12.575
the one under our main
shape in the layer's list,

00:09:12.575 --> 00:09:16.805
you can modify the color of
our drop shadow as well,

00:09:16.805 --> 00:09:21.515
just like this, and decrease
the opacity to 30%.

00:09:21.515 --> 00:09:23.420
Now, for the next shape,

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:24.995
I'm going to use green.

00:09:24.995 --> 00:09:27.365
Make sure to keep
the order the same.

00:09:27.365 --> 00:09:30.380
E.g. don't use red and place

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.450
it next to our blue
because people

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:35.195
suffering from color
vision deficiencies

00:09:35.195 --> 00:09:37.685
may face difficulties
in that case.

00:09:37.685 --> 00:09:38.855
So for the next shape,

00:09:38.855 --> 00:09:40.565
I'm going to use green.

00:09:40.565 --> 00:09:44.600
And let me modify the drop
shadow color as well.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.760
I'm going to select green and

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.745
decrease the opacity to 30%.

00:09:49.745 --> 00:09:51.170
For the next shape,

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:54.439
I'm going to use
this one, yellow,

00:09:54.439 --> 00:09:57.425
I already modified the
layers name that you can

00:09:57.425 --> 00:10:00.620
easily understand which shape
should use which color.

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:04.505
And now let me modify the
drop shadows color as well,

00:10:04.505 --> 00:10:07.655
and decrease the opacity to 30%.

00:10:07.655 --> 00:10:11.375
And the next shape is going
to use our red color.

00:10:11.375 --> 00:10:13.490
Also, the drop
shadow needs to be

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:16.745
read with a 30% opacity.

00:10:16.745 --> 00:10:18.350
And last but not least,

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:21.170
let me use our last color

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:23.420
and we don't need to
have a drop shadow here.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:25.775
Alright, it looks very
good, doesn't it?

00:10:25.775 --> 00:10:29.255
Now, it's time to apply
colors to these texts layers.

00:10:29.255 --> 00:10:31.865
So here we have two
different shades.

00:10:31.865 --> 00:10:36.995
One is too dark and these two
are a little bit brighter.

00:10:36.995 --> 00:10:39.920
So I'm going to select
this layer and this one,

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.425
and I'm going to use
our neutral color

00:10:42.425 --> 00:10:44.000
for them just like that.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.815
However, for this one,

00:10:45.815 --> 00:10:48.320
we need to use a darker shade.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.000
Therefore, the dark shade of

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.565
our primary color
looks good here.

00:10:52.565 --> 00:10:56.255
Can you see how easy it is to
apply colors to our design

00:10:56.255 --> 00:11:00.320
when we already designed our
project in grayscale mode.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:04.250
Alright, but what about these
data for these circles?

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:06.410
We need to use the same colors

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:08.840
that we used for our chars.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.765
So this one, which
is the biggest one,

00:11:11.765 --> 00:11:13.220
is gonna be blue.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:17.450
So I'm gonna select this
circle and just use this blue.

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:21.575
And this line is going to
use the same blue as well.

00:11:21.575 --> 00:11:22.820
Or the second one,

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:24.740
which is the next expense,

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.510
is going to be low.

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:29.285
Okay, so I'm going
to use this one,

00:11:29.285 --> 00:11:31.520
the same yellow here,

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.950
and the next one is
going to be green.

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:38.045
So I'm going to select these
two shapes at the same time.

00:11:38.045 --> 00:11:40.535
And let me choose
our green color.

00:11:40.535 --> 00:11:44.585
And this one, online
shopping is gonna be red.

00:11:44.585 --> 00:11:47.090
So I'm going to select red.

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:48.890
And last but not least,

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:53.090
the others group need to
use our darkest shade,

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:55.280
which is scholar are right,

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:59.660
but what about these texts
layers for the titles, e.g.

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:02.570
rent, groceries,
restaurants, etc.

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:05.420
I'm going to use our
dark primary color.

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:06.035
Okay.

00:12:06.035 --> 00:12:08.495
The one that we used
for this amount.

00:12:08.495 --> 00:12:10.235
So let me use this one.

00:12:10.235 --> 00:12:13.760
And for these transactions
and these amounts,

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.090
I'm going to use our
doll neutral color.

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:18.980
I'm going to select all of them,

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:22.550
hold down the Shift key and
click on them one-by-one,

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:26.360
and finally, choose
our neutral color.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.355
They look fantastic, Dante.

00:12:28.355 --> 00:12:30.965
And the last one is our CTA,

00:12:30.965 --> 00:12:32.885
the download statement button.

00:12:32.885 --> 00:12:34.340
So for this one,

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:36.770
I'm going to use
our accent color,

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:38.045
which is this one.

00:12:38.045 --> 00:12:40.670
And also for the drop shadow.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:43.024
I'm going to use the same color.

00:12:43.024 --> 00:12:48.935
However, with a 32%
opacity or right, Nice.

00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:50.480
One thing that we forgot to

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.465
change is the background
of this page.

00:12:53.465 --> 00:12:56.480
So let me select the art
board and just modify

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.480
the background color to
our neutral blue color.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.820
Can you see how beautiful
these pages are?

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.305
I hope you like it.

00:13:03.305 --> 00:13:06.275
Now let me go ahead
and preview them

00:13:06.275 --> 00:13:10.295
one-by-one are right here
is our first sign-in page.

00:13:10.295 --> 00:13:12.110
This one is the second

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:14.659
sign-in page with
this error state.

00:13:14.659 --> 00:13:18.785
This one has a warning icon
with our semantic colors.

00:13:18.785 --> 00:13:20.570
And here we used

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:23.000
our monochromatic
color scheme for

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.954
the credit cards and
all the other elements.

00:13:25.954 --> 00:13:27.515
And last but not least,

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:29.435
for the finances screen,

00:13:29.435 --> 00:13:32.105
since we had a
category called chart,

00:13:32.105 --> 00:13:35.840
we used a categorical color
scheme for them. Okay?

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.445
Alright, we're almost done.

00:13:37.445 --> 00:13:40.625
The only thing we need
to do now is validate

00:13:40.625 --> 00:13:44.210
our colors based on
color contrast ratio.

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:47.540
So let me select this
sign-in title, e.g.

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:50.180
and then we're gonna run
a plugin called contrast,

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.949
the one that we used before.

00:13:51.949 --> 00:13:54.695
Just like that, as
you can see it past

00:13:54.695 --> 00:13:58.850
all the contrast ratio
tests for all levels,

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:01.265
the WA and AAA levels.

00:14:01.265 --> 00:14:02.615
What about these texts?

00:14:02.615 --> 00:14:05.450
Alright, it passed
almost all test.

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:09.440
However, it failed for the
AAA level for normal texts,

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.030
but it's totally
fine because it's

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:12.965
already past the double a level.

00:14:12.965 --> 00:14:14.045
What about this one?

00:14:14.045 --> 00:14:15.575
Are semantic color.

00:14:15.575 --> 00:14:19.025
As you can see, it
failed for normal text.

00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:21.890
However, if you take a look
at the contrast ratio,

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:24.515
which is 3.1 to one,

00:14:24.515 --> 00:14:27.379
we can see that it's not
that low and it's acceptable

00:14:27.379 --> 00:14:30.665
to use this color for
this text layer. Why?

00:14:30.665 --> 00:14:32.765
Because for these texts layer,

00:14:32.765 --> 00:14:34.835
we used a semi bold weight.

00:14:34.835 --> 00:14:36.605
If I change it to regular,

00:14:36.605 --> 00:14:38.555
now, it's not acceptable.

00:14:38.555 --> 00:14:41.090
But for semi volt or bold text,

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:43.805
this color is
acceptable as long as

00:14:43.805 --> 00:14:48.545
the contrast ratio is not
less than 3.1 to one.

00:14:48.545 --> 00:14:49.805
What about this one?

00:14:49.805 --> 00:14:54.575
It also pass the required
test and this one, fantastic.

00:14:54.575 --> 00:14:56.480
But what about here
for the title?

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.875
We already checked that.

00:14:57.875 --> 00:15:00.770
Let me select the texts
layers on these cards.

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:03.785
As you can see, it
passed all the tests.

00:15:03.785 --> 00:15:05.780
What about here, the accent

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.555
color against this
neutral color?

00:15:08.555 --> 00:15:10.399
It passed all the tests.

00:15:10.399 --> 00:15:12.785
And also our dole neutral color

00:15:12.785 --> 00:15:15.500
against our light neutral color.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.080
It again, pass all the test.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.190
Alright, and let me check

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:21.695
the contrast of
these texts as well.

00:15:21.695 --> 00:15:24.260
I'm going to run the
plugin once again,

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.495
as you can see, it
passed all the tests.

00:15:26.495 --> 00:15:29.360
We're not going to validate
other colors, e.g.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.470
these ones because we

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:33.020
already checked them,
are right guys.

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:34.715
That's all for this video.

00:15:34.715 --> 00:15:39.300
I hope you enjoyed it and I'll
see you in the next video.
