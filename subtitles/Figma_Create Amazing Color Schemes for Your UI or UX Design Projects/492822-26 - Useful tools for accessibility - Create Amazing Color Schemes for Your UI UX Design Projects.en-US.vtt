00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.109
In this video, I'm
going to introduce

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.820
some useful tools to you for

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.115
accessibility. Are you ready?

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:12.465
Let's get started.

00:00:12.465 --> 00:00:14.715
Number one, Stark.

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:18.390
It's a Figma Sketch
and Adobe XD plugging.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.120
It lets you check your
color contrast ratio

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.105
and simulate different
color vision deficiencies.

00:00:24.105 --> 00:00:27.510
You just need to select an art
board and run the plug-in.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.545
Stark handles the rest
number to contrast,

00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:33.395
it's a Figma plugins
that lets you

00:00:33.395 --> 00:00:35.790
check the contrast
ratio of your colors.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.400
Unlike Stark, which led to check

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.145
the contrast ratio only three
times with the free plan.

00:00:42.145 --> 00:00:45.110
Contrast has no limit
in this regard,

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.840
and it also has a cool
feature that scans

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.679
your entire designed to
find texts contrast issues.

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:54.470
Number three, who can use.com.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.630
It's an amazing website that not

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.940
only checks the color
contrast ratio,

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.360
but also shows how
color combinations can

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.960
affect different people
with visual impairments.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.280
Let's give it a try.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.595
First, we specify our
backgrounds color,

00:01:10.595 --> 00:01:12.920
then we set our text color,

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.875
specify the font
size and weight.

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:18.020
Here we can see the
contrast ratio,

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.175
which is quite high,

00:01:19.175 --> 00:01:21.410
and the grading, which is AAA.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.405
Additionally, we can see how

00:01:23.405 --> 00:01:26.660
different people can process
this color combination.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.790
So we have the regular region,

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.060
the most popular
colorblindness deficiencies

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.205
and some other region problems.

00:01:34.205 --> 00:01:37.025
We also have the situation
of vision events,

00:01:37.025 --> 00:01:38.330
which is quite interesting

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.790
because we can see
how accessible are

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.520
color combination
is by simulating

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.805
the effect of direct
sunlight and night mode

00:01:46.805 --> 00:01:49.620
on a phone or a screen.
