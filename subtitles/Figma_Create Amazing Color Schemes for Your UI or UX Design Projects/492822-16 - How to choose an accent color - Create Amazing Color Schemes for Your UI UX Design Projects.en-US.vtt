00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.965
Axon colors are used for links,

00:00:07.965 --> 00:00:11.400
call to actions,
progress bar, etc.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.190
They are usually
bright and saturated.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.050
You can create an
accent color by

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.690
choosing the base or
primary color and using

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.295
different color harmonies like

00:00:20.295 --> 00:00:23.565
monochromatic, analogous
or complimentary.

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:25.560
If you're still unsure how

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.610
to choose a great accent color,

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.630
let me show you my process.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.750
Choose your primary
color and increase or

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.215
decrease the hue by
30 to 40 points.

00:00:36.215 --> 00:00:38.660
Now increase the brightness by

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.160
five to ten points while
your accent color is ready.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.575
This formula works
with any color.

00:00:45.575 --> 00:00:49.680
Can you see how easy it is to
create an accent color now?
