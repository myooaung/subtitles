00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.690
As I mentioned before,

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.425
semantic colors are used
for status and feedback,

00:00:10.425 --> 00:00:14.700
like warning, error,
success, and information.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.165
Although you should use
yellow, red, green,

00:00:18.165 --> 00:00:20.535
and blue as your
semantic colors,

00:00:20.535 --> 00:00:22.980
you are not limited
to just one color.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.580
The best practice is that you
create different shades and

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.675
tints of these colors to be
able to apply them flexibly.

00:00:30.675 --> 00:00:33.194
Once your four colors are ready,

00:00:33.194 --> 00:00:35.640
you can use monochromatic
color harmony

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.185
to create variants.

00:00:37.185 --> 00:00:39.255
That gives you
enough flexibility

00:00:39.255 --> 00:00:41.770
for applying these
colors to your design.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.225
Let's suppose you want
to design a warning.

00:00:44.225 --> 00:00:46.280
If you use only one color,

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.870
it would look like this.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.480
Now let's take a
step further and add

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.314
a shade of yellow to
our semantic colors.

00:00:53.314 --> 00:00:55.640
Now the result
looks much better.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.770
The same technique
could be applied to

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.900
all other semantic colors.
