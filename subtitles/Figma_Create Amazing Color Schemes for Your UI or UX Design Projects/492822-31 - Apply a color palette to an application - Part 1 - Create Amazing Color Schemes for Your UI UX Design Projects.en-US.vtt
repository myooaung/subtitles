00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.005
Hey everyone, welcome back.

00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:09.045
In this video, we're
going to create

00:00:09.045 --> 00:00:10.890
another color palette and

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.365
apply it to a
mobile application.

00:00:13.365 --> 00:00:14.580
But first things first,

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.495
make sure to download the
mobile app starter project

00:00:18.495 --> 00:00:20.610
from the resources section and

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.799
imported to your
Figma dashboard.

00:00:22.799 --> 00:00:24.780
Okay, you can either
drag and drop

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.940
it into this environment
or you could

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.010
click on the Import button at

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.550
the top right corner and
choose it from your computer.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.625
Alright, let me open it up.

00:00:34.625 --> 00:00:36.290
Alright, this is
the project that

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.985
you already prepared for you.

00:00:37.985 --> 00:00:39.650
And we're going
to create a color

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.600
palette step-by-step
and apply it

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.185
to our design according
to the 60th 30.10 rule.

00:00:45.185 --> 00:00:47.825
So if you're ready,
let's get started.

00:00:47.825 --> 00:00:50.660
As you can see here, I
prepared an art board

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.290
called colors for you
with many swatches, e.g.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.410
we have primary and
neutral semantic charts

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.015
and data visualization,

00:00:59.015 --> 00:01:02.525
and we need to modify the
color of all these swatches.

00:01:02.525 --> 00:01:05.104
But first of all, let me
show you the project.

00:01:05.104 --> 00:01:07.310
So the project we are
going to work on is

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.100
a personal finance
application and it lets

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.385
users to manage their
finances easily.

00:01:13.385 --> 00:01:15.560
So I designed all the pages

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.825
in grayscale color
mode that we could

00:01:17.825 --> 00:01:20.210
easily distinguish
the shades and

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.000
apply our colors to
all these elements.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.140
So as you can see here,

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.660
we have three different
sign-in pages.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.465
Basically, the
design is the same.

00:01:29.465 --> 00:01:32.330
However, this one is
the main sign-in page.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.670
The second one is
the sign-in page,

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.470
but we've got a username and

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.855
a password and also
an error here.

00:01:38.855 --> 00:01:40.160
On the third page,

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
we've got this warning
icon as you can see,

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.740
let me zoom that you could
clearly see that and

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.800
a CTA or call to
action and some links.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.830
On the homepage we
have a large tidal,

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.830
two different credit
cards and a dialogue that

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.175
presents the last three
transactions to the user.

00:01:58.175 --> 00:01:59.615
And last but not least,

00:01:59.615 --> 00:02:01.790
we have the finances page.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.865
On this page we have a
pie chart at the top,

00:02:04.865 --> 00:02:06.350
right below that, we have

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.095
some information
about the expenses.

00:02:09.095 --> 00:02:13.280
And also here we have the data
related to this pie chart.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.230
Alright, so what kind of colors

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.239
do we need for this project?

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.540
First of all, we need to come
up with a primary color.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.835
And also we could have
secondary colors,

00:02:22.835 --> 00:02:25.280
but I don't think it's
necessary this time.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.020
We're not going
to use coolers or

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.320
any other websites to come
up with our color palette.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.090
I'm gonna show you
how you can do

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.815
that by yourself manually,

00:02:33.815 --> 00:02:35.780
since it's a finance app and

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.150
users need to trust this app.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.430
Again, we're going
to use blue as

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.740
the primary color,
but this time,

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.919
instead of using an
analogous color harmony,

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:48.635
I'm going to use a
monochromatic color harmony.

00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:51.965
So are you ready to start
creating our color palette?

00:02:51.965 --> 00:02:54.275
Let's begin. Let
me zoom in here.

00:02:54.275 --> 00:02:56.585
I'm going to select
my first swatch

00:02:56.585 --> 00:02:57.740
and let me head over to

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.510
the field section and click on

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.075
this color to open
the color picker.

00:03:02.075 --> 00:03:04.070
As I mentioned, I'm going to use

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.200
blue as the primary colors.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.210
So I'm going to move the slider

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.430
to the blue section are right,

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.650
I think this blue looks good.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.875
Maybe I could change the hue
to 217, something like this.

00:03:18.875 --> 00:03:21.995
It looks much better now
for the primary color,

00:03:21.995 --> 00:03:25.130
I'm going to make it a
little bit desaturated.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.830
So let me decrease
the saturation from

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.680
94 to around 90 or maybe 89.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.180
Yeah, it looks good.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.730
And also the
brightness is gonna be

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.255
around 70 or maybe 75.

00:03:41.255 --> 00:03:42.635
Yeah, it looks nice.

00:03:42.635 --> 00:03:45.500
Alright guys, are
primary color is ready.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.530
Now it's time to move
on to other colors,

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.440
since we are going to use a
monochromatic color harmony,

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.645
our base color is
going to be the same.

00:03:53.645 --> 00:03:55.985
So I'm going to select
all these swatches,

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:57.920
hold down the Shift
key on your keyboard

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.930
and select all the swatches and

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.580
just change their color to

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.100
our primary color,
just like that.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.420
Now I'm going to select

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.630
the second swatch and let
me create a dark shade

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.625
of our primary color because

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:13.325
we're going to need that
for our texts layers.

00:04:13.325 --> 00:04:14.780
First of all, let me increase

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.080
the intensity or
saturation of my color,

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.620
90-100, just like that.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.450
And also I'm going to decrease

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.870
the brightness to add
black to my base color.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.010
So if I move my color
picker down just like this,

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.200
I can easily add black to it,

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.214
but I think if I set it to

00:04:36.214 --> 00:04:40.910
about 45 or maybe 43,
it would be great.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.845
Yeah, it looks nice. Alright.

00:04:42.845 --> 00:04:45.200
Our second color
is ready as well.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.060
But what about the last color?

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.195
This one is going to be
used as our accent color,

00:04:50.195 --> 00:04:53.225
okay, So it needs to
be vibrant and bright.

00:04:53.225 --> 00:04:55.145
So let me go ahead and modify

00:04:55.145 --> 00:04:57.710
the saturation and brightness.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.245
Since this color
is somehow bright,

00:05:00.245 --> 00:05:03.080
we can easily make it
brighter if we set

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.380
the saturation and
brightness to 100 per cent.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.474
Alright, now we need
three neutral colors.

00:05:10.474 --> 00:05:13.055
So let me select
the swatch and then

00:05:13.055 --> 00:05:16.025
I'm going to create a
tone of our base color.

00:05:16.025 --> 00:05:18.590
If you remember,
to create a tone,

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.005
we need to add gray
to our base color.

00:05:21.005 --> 00:05:24.905
So if I just move my color
picker to the gray area,

00:05:24.905 --> 00:05:26.450
I can create a tone.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:27.635
And as you can see,

00:05:27.635 --> 00:05:29.435
we're getting a dull color,

00:05:29.435 --> 00:05:31.400
and that's exactly what we want.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.110
But let me make it a little bit

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.704
brighter by increasing
the brightness.

00:05:35.704 --> 00:05:40.460
Okay? So right now the
brightness is set to 43.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.005
Let me set it to maybe 49
are right, it looks good.

00:05:45.005 --> 00:05:47.090
So the second neutral color is

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.670
gonna be a tint of
our base color.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.880
So we need to add white
to our base color.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.535
So let me move to
the white section.

00:05:55.535 --> 00:05:57.530
Just like that, I'm going to set

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.860
the saturation to five, okay?

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.070
And the brightness
is gonna be 100%.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.265
And as you can see, we've
got a great neutral color,

00:06:07.265 --> 00:06:10.625
and the last neutral color
is going to be pure white.

00:06:10.625 --> 00:06:11.765
Why do we need that?

00:06:11.765 --> 00:06:15.260
Because we're going to use it
as a foreground color, e.g.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.720
for icons and also for some

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.570
of our texts colors I
will show you later.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.340
Alright, cool.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.175
Our primary and neutral
colors are ready.

00:06:25.175 --> 00:06:26.480
Now we need to move on to

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.880
the next section,
semantic colors.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.070
As you know, having
semantic colors

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.619
in your color
palette is optional.

00:06:33.619 --> 00:06:35.870
However, as I showed you here,

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.570
we have the sign-in pages
and we've got an error

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.555
here and also a warning here.

00:06:41.555 --> 00:06:43.580
So for these two states,

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.725
we need to have semantic colors.

00:06:45.725 --> 00:06:48.905
So let me go ahead and select
the first swatch here.

00:06:48.905 --> 00:06:50.240
And I'm going to go to

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.985
the field section to open
up our color picker.

00:06:52.985 --> 00:06:54.665
Since we need a red color,

00:06:54.665 --> 00:06:57.905
make sure to set the
age or hue to zero,

00:06:57.905 --> 00:07:01.700
because this is how we
could get a pure red color.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.180
But as you can see, it's
too bright and vibrant.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.175
So we're going to fix that.

00:07:07.175 --> 00:07:08.645
Let me select it.

00:07:08.645 --> 00:07:11.765
If I head over to the
color picker section,

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:15.260
I can easily decrease
the intensity by

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.175
lowering the saturation
to maybe 60.

00:07:19.175 --> 00:07:23.615
Let me check, or
maybe 65 are right.

00:07:23.615 --> 00:07:27.005
And also I'm going to
set the brightness to

00:07:27.005 --> 00:07:31.280
95 to make it look a little
bit darker, just like that.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.595
Now I'm going to create
two tins of these color.

00:07:34.595 --> 00:07:35.900
So first of all,

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.000
let me select the second swatch

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.685
and I'm going to use this color,

00:07:40.685 --> 00:07:43.055
then I'm going to
add white to it.

00:07:43.055 --> 00:07:44.030
Cool.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.920
And for the last one,

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.770
I'm going to move
it even further

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:52.055
to get a very light
tint of our color.

00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:56.090
Sometimes if you want to
create a card or an icon,

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:59.045
these things would be very
useful in order to create

00:07:59.045 --> 00:08:00.920
a good contrast ratio between

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.875
your foreground and
background elements.

00:08:03.875 --> 00:08:05.810
Alright, now, let's move on to

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:07.940
the second semantic
color that we need.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:11.030
The first one is required
for the error message,

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:14.810
but the second one is required
for the warning icon.

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:15.515
Okay?

00:08:15.515 --> 00:08:17.705
So for warning, as you know,

00:08:17.705 --> 00:08:19.250
we need to use yellow.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.800
So let me go ahead and
choose a yellow using

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.830
the color picker, right?

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:27.140
I think this is a cool color.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.760
Now, I'm going to select

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:32.090
the second swatch and
get our yellow color.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:35.450
But this time, instead
of having to teens,

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:37.400
I'm going to create one team

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.905
and one shade of our base color.

00:08:39.905 --> 00:08:41.600
To create a shade,

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.000
I'm going to add
black to my color.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.850
If I decrease the
brightness like that,

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:49.684
I could create a great shade.

00:08:49.684 --> 00:08:53.105
However, I think it needs to
be a little bit desaturated.

00:08:53.105 --> 00:08:54.830
So let me decrease

00:08:54.830 --> 00:09:00.920
the saturation to
around 70 or maybe 68.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.005
Yes, it looks good right now,

00:09:03.005 --> 00:09:06.290
you may think that it's not
a good color combination.

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:08.765
However, when we start using it,

00:09:08.765 --> 00:09:12.440
you may see how harmonious
these colors would be.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.185
Alright, And for the
last swatch, again,

00:09:15.185 --> 00:09:17.585
I'm going to choose
our base color,

00:09:17.585 --> 00:09:21.110
and this time I'm going to
create a tint of our color.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:23.300
So let me add white to it.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.970
Just like that, the
saturation is going to be

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:29.255
40 and the brightness
is gonna be 100,

00:09:29.255 --> 00:09:32.855
perfect, our semantic
colors are ready as well.

00:09:32.855 --> 00:09:35.570
But as you can see, we
have one more section to

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:38.885
feel that charts and
data visualization.

00:09:38.885 --> 00:09:40.669
Why do we need these colors?

00:09:40.669 --> 00:09:42.499
Well, because we have charts

00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:44.720
and data here when
you're working on

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.920
a finance mobile application
or a finance web app,

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.840
it's almost inevitable to use

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.120
these kinds of colors
because we need to

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.025
present data in a way that are

00:09:55.025 --> 00:09:57.605
distinguishable and
clear to recognize.

00:09:57.605 --> 00:10:00.800
If you remember, for charts
and data visualization,

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.785
we could use three
different colors schemes,

00:10:03.785 --> 00:10:07.220
categorical, sequential,
and diverged.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:08.780
Usually when we want to present

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:11.180
data without any numeric value,

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.890
like in this chart,

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:15.440
we use categorical color scheme.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.175
Why?

00:10:16.175 --> 00:10:18.965
Because using the category
called color scheme.

00:10:18.965 --> 00:10:21.650
We could come up with
high contrast in

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:23.480
colors that the users could

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.370
distinguish between them easily.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:27.200
Alright, so let's go ahead and

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.240
finish this section as well.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.920
First of all, I'm
going to select

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.930
my first swatch here and let me

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:36.665
go ahead and choose my first
color for the first color,

00:10:36.665 --> 00:10:37.895
I'm going to use blue.

00:10:37.895 --> 00:10:39.230
It could be any blue.

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:41.030
It doesn't necessarily need to

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:43.640
be one of the primary blues.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.340
However, since this
blue looks good,

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:49.310
I'm going to copy the
hex color code and use

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:52.685
it for our charts and data
visualization as well.

00:10:52.685 --> 00:10:54.785
So I'm going to paste it here.

00:10:54.785 --> 00:10:56.930
However, I think I
could modify that

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:59.690
somehow because this
color is so saturated.

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:03.289
So let me decrease the
saturation from 90

00:11:03.289 --> 00:11:07.610
to around AD, or maybe AD2.

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:08.525
It looks good.

00:11:08.525 --> 00:11:10.250
And also I'm going to increase

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:16.355
the brightness 73-78.
Alright, cool.

00:11:16.355 --> 00:11:18.035
But what about the next scholar?

00:11:18.035 --> 00:11:22.220
Keep in mind that the order
of these colors matter a lot.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:22.970
Why?

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:24.470
Because people with color

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:26.660
vision deficiencies
should easily

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:28.910
process these colors when

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:30.905
they are placed
next to each other.

00:11:30.905 --> 00:11:34.355
If it's not understandable
right now, it's totally fine.

00:11:34.355 --> 00:11:36.665
Once our color palette is ready,

00:11:36.665 --> 00:11:38.555
I'm going to show you an example

00:11:38.555 --> 00:11:40.415
that you could get it perfectly.

00:11:40.415 --> 00:11:41.960
But for now, let's go

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.255
ahead and complete
our color palette.

00:11:44.255 --> 00:11:45.530
For the second one,

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:47.825
I'm going to use a green color.

00:11:47.825 --> 00:11:50.930
So let me go to the
green section are right,

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:53.405
I think this green looks good.

00:11:53.405 --> 00:11:57.425
Maybe I could decrease
the hue to 150,

00:11:57.425 --> 00:11:59.390
and now let me decrease
the saturation

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:01.370
and brightness to
make this color

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:05.615
look a little bit darker or
right cool, It looks nice.

00:12:05.615 --> 00:12:07.370
Now let me go ahead and select

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:09.755
my third swatch for this one,

00:12:09.755 --> 00:12:11.135
I'm going to use yellow.

00:12:11.135 --> 00:12:14.165
So let me choose my semantic
color, yellow, this one,

00:12:14.165 --> 00:12:15.980
and just modify the saturation

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:17.719
and brightness for brightness,

00:12:17.719 --> 00:12:20.165
I think 100 is fine.

00:12:20.165 --> 00:12:23.585
Maybe we could modify to 99,

00:12:23.585 --> 00:12:25.205
but for the saturation,

00:12:25.205 --> 00:12:28.355
I'm going to make it
desaturated a lot. Right now.

00:12:28.355 --> 00:12:29.944
It's set to 90,

00:12:29.944 --> 00:12:35.945
but I'm going to make
it 60 or maybe 66.

00:12:35.945 --> 00:12:37.430
Yeah, it looks cool.

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:39.290
So can you see the pattern I'm

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:41.450
using here for the first color?

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:44.975
As you can see, the
brightness was 77,

00:12:44.975 --> 00:12:47.270
which is the value
of our color for

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:51.605
the next one, brightness is 63.

00:12:51.605 --> 00:12:53.600
So we made it darker.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.010
For the next one,

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:57.650
the brightness is 97,

00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:59.644
so we made it lighter.

00:12:59.644 --> 00:13:01.910
So this is why I
said the order of

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:06.710
these colors matter because
if someone with e.g.

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:11.045
monochrome massive lesion
wants to process these colors.

00:13:11.045 --> 00:13:13.460
They can easily
distinguish between them.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.745
Alright, let me select the
next swatch for the next one,

00:13:16.745 --> 00:13:19.670
I'm going to use my
red semantic color

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:21.695
and let me modify
it a little bit.

00:13:21.695 --> 00:13:25.265
Maybe we could just decrease
the saturation too.

00:13:25.265 --> 00:13:29.960
60 or maybe 62,
something like that.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.625
The brightness looks good.

00:13:31.625 --> 00:13:33.140
And last but not least,

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:36.215
for this one, I'm going
to use a dark blue color.

00:13:36.215 --> 00:13:39.874
So let me move the hue
slider to the blue section.

00:13:39.874 --> 00:13:40.865
Are right.

00:13:40.865 --> 00:13:43.430
I think this color looks good.

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:48.425
Maybe I can decrease
the hue to 247.

00:13:48.425 --> 00:13:50.255
And for the saturation,

00:13:50.255 --> 00:13:56.810
I'm going to make it
around 65 or maybe 61.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:59.630
However, it needs
to be too dark.

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:02.060
So let me decrease
the brightness from

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:07.595
74 to around 30 or 35.

00:14:07.595 --> 00:14:12.035
Let me see how it looks
or right, 36% looks good.

00:14:12.035 --> 00:14:13.235
All right, cool.

00:14:13.235 --> 00:14:15.980
Our charts and data
visualization color scheme

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.255
is also ready.

00:14:17.255 --> 00:14:19.430
Now it's time to show you

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:22.700
why the order of
these colors matter.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:26.840
First of all, let me go ahead
and select this art board.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:28.970
And I'm going to
right-click here to run a

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:32.255
plug-in that I already showed
you in previous videos.

00:14:32.255 --> 00:14:34.010
It's called color filters.

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:37.310
And if I go to
colorblind simulations,

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:40.280
I can choose monochrome SE, e.g.

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.440
and right now, you can see that

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.260
the value of these
colors changes

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.840
continuously and we don't have

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.780
to dark shades next
to each other, e.g.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:53.810
we don't have this
color here because it

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:54.980
would be too hard for

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:56.930
the user to distinguish
between them.

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:59.660
That's why the order
of colors matter here.

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:01.415
Let me undo the process.

00:15:01.415 --> 00:15:05.405
Are right, that's all for the
first part of this project.

00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:10.290
I hope you enjoyed it and I
see you in the next part.
