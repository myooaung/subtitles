00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.005
Hey everyone, welcome back to

00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:08.925
another video of this tutorial.

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:11.850
In this video, I'm gonna
show you how you can create

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.740
a color palette in order to

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.395
apply colors to a landing page.

00:00:16.395 --> 00:00:18.630
So if you're not sure how you

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.655
can come up with the primary,

00:00:20.655 --> 00:00:23.100
the secondary and
the axon colors.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.320
Don't worry, I'm going
to walk you through

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.570
all the required steps to

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.510
create a beautiful and
harmonious color palette.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.970
And also, I'll show
you how you can

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.175
apply it to a landing
page for this project.

00:00:36.175 --> 00:00:38.765
I already designed a
landing page in Figma.

00:00:38.765 --> 00:00:40.610
And what I want you to do is

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.700
download the landing
page starter file from

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.410
the resources section and

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.420
imported to your
Figma dashboard.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.030
Okay, So if you're not
familiar with Figma,

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.680
let me tell you that Figma is

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.425
a popular browser-based
application

00:00:54.425 --> 00:00:57.005
that lets you design
user interfaces.

00:00:57.005 --> 00:00:59.990
And we're going to use it
to apply all the things

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.900
you learned so far to
a real-world project.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.645
So to import a landing
page starter file,

00:01:05.645 --> 00:01:08.000
just click on this
Import button at

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.590
the top right corner and

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.450
choose the file
on your computer.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.145
Once it's imported.

00:01:13.145 --> 00:01:15.605
Just double-click on
it to open it up.

00:01:15.605 --> 00:01:16.595
Are right.

00:01:16.595 --> 00:01:17.915
Let me zoom in.

00:01:17.915 --> 00:01:19.430
There we go. So here is

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.595
a concept project that I
designed for this exercise.

00:01:22.595 --> 00:01:26.015
As you can see, I prepared
it in grayscale color mode,

00:01:26.015 --> 00:01:28.355
except for the logo and images.

00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:30.035
Okay, those are colorful.

00:01:30.035 --> 00:01:32.150
So this landing page is for

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.910
an imaginary company
called Draft,

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:35.974
and they provide

00:01:35.974 --> 00:01:39.125
online insurance services
to entrepreneurs.

00:01:39.125 --> 00:01:41.270
So everything is
going to be done on

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.445
their application called Draft.

00:01:43.445 --> 00:01:44.990
Let me preview it that you can

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.940
see the whole landing page.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.940
So at the top we have an
ordinary navigation bar.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.774
And then here is
our hero section.

00:01:52.774 --> 00:01:55.640
On the left side we have
the content, the title,

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.495
the subtitle, and a call
to action, this button.

00:01:59.495 --> 00:02:01.010
And on the right side we have

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.470
some cards and also this mockup.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.270
Now I'm going to scroll down.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.939
Here is the client section.

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.355
And as you can see,
these are colorful

00:02:10.355 --> 00:02:13.055
because we are not going to
modify their colors anyway.

00:02:13.055 --> 00:02:15.230
So I kept them colorful.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.760
Let me scroll down.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.485
This is the feature section.

00:02:18.485 --> 00:02:21.185
As you can see, we have
six different cards and

00:02:21.185 --> 00:02:24.634
each card represents
one feature.

00:02:24.634 --> 00:02:26.990
The content here is not real,

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.135
and I use Lorem
Ipsum texts here.

00:02:29.135 --> 00:02:30.335
You can modify them.

00:02:30.335 --> 00:02:32.450
But for the purpose
of this tutorial,

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.110
it doesn't matter because we're
going to focus on colors.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.440
And at the bottom we have
an explorer All button.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.420
Okay, Let me scroll down

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.000
here we have a
testimonial section.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.445
Once again, the
logos are colorful.

00:02:46.445 --> 00:02:48.470
I'm going to scroll down here.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.230
There is another section
that provides the user with

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.270
the most important
services that they

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.400
can get from this company.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.215
Okay, we have some images

00:02:57.215 --> 00:02:59.585
and the content on
the right side.

00:02:59.585 --> 00:03:01.160
Let me scroll down.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.950
And this section is
the CTA section.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.780
This is where we ask the user

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.775
to install the app
on their phone.

00:03:07.775 --> 00:03:09.110
Let me scroll down.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.655
And last but not least,

00:03:10.655 --> 00:03:12.275
we have the footer.

00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:15.589
So as you can see, we have
some categories, some links,

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:17.570
the contact information, and

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.375
also a short
description of draft.

00:03:20.375 --> 00:03:23.600
And we have a call to
action button here as well.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.235
And at the bottom we have

00:03:25.235 --> 00:03:28.490
a copyright disclaimer and
the social media icons,

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.215
let me tell you what
we're gonna do.

00:03:30.215 --> 00:03:32.915
First of all, we need to
create a color palette,

00:03:32.915 --> 00:03:34.790
and then we need to apply

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.145
that color palette to
this landing page,

00:03:37.145 --> 00:03:39.455
to the elements of
this landing page.

00:03:39.455 --> 00:03:42.200
To do that, I'm going
to use the website

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.080
called coolers that I
already introduced to you.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.824
So let me go ahead and
click on Generate.

00:03:47.824 --> 00:03:51.305
Alright, so what's the
first step you are, right?

00:03:51.305 --> 00:03:54.815
We need a primary
color or a base color.

00:03:54.815 --> 00:03:58.160
But since this brand doesn't
have any primary color,

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.655
we as designers, should come
up with the primary color.

00:04:01.655 --> 00:04:02.150
Okay.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.275
So what do you think?

00:04:03.275 --> 00:04:06.875
Which color is more appropriate
for an insurance company?

00:04:06.875 --> 00:04:08.720
Do you think that we need to use

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.465
cool colors or warm colors?

00:04:11.465 --> 00:04:13.130
Which color harmony should be

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.725
used to create this
color palette?

00:04:15.725 --> 00:04:18.440
These are the typical
questions that you should ask

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.120
yourself whenever you want to

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.744
create a color palette
for your projects.

00:04:22.744 --> 00:04:24.560
Let's take a look
at the content.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.200
First of all, to come up
with the primary color,

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.880
we need to think of the brand.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.725
What's the idea behind it?

00:04:30.725 --> 00:04:32.495
Who is their target audience,

00:04:32.495 --> 00:04:35.195
and what users expect
from the brand.

00:04:35.195 --> 00:04:37.130
So first, let's think

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.650
about the characteristics
of this brand.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.160
So this is an insurance
company and users should

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.330
feel that they are safe and
their assets are secure,

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.590
and also they expect

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.825
professional attitudes
from the brand.

00:04:50.825 --> 00:04:54.665
So since we are talking about
professionalism and trust,

00:04:54.665 --> 00:04:56.885
I think blue is the
best option because

00:04:56.885 --> 00:04:59.600
blue is popular
among men and women,

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.790
so there is no obstacle
in that regard.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.685
And I think we could use
blue for the primary color.

00:05:04.685 --> 00:05:06.620
Alright, cool. Now let's go

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.215
ahead and choose
our primary color.

00:05:09.215 --> 00:05:10.970
But what kind of color harmonies

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.710
should be used
since we don't have

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.050
any illustrations
and I don't want to

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.420
get high contrast in colors.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.155
I think the best option would
be to choose Analogous.

00:05:21.155 --> 00:05:23.525
We could use
monochromatic as well,

00:05:23.525 --> 00:05:25.670
but I don t think
complimentary or

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.550
split complimentary
would be good options.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.560
I'm going to go with analogous,

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.720
so that we can choose
colors that are

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.015
next to each other
on the color wheel.

00:05:35.015 --> 00:05:37.220
I'm going to select
it and let me press

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.370
the space bar on my keyboard
to get a good blue color.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.445
Alright, here we've got
different kinds of blue.

00:05:43.445 --> 00:05:45.590
I'm going to select one
of them and modified

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.020
manually to get
my primary color.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.050
Okay, So I think this
one is a good option.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.540
I'm going to click on this
color code and let me

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.765
change the color model to HSB.

00:05:56.765 --> 00:05:59.330
Let me change the hue
a little bit to see

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.345
whether I can get a
better base color or not.

00:06:02.345 --> 00:06:04.220
Alright, this blue is cool.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.485
However, it's too bright.

00:06:06.485 --> 00:06:09.155
So I'm going to decrease
the brightness from

00:06:09.155 --> 00:06:12.980
a D5 to around 30, okay?

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.525
Alright, maybe 31, and
the saturation is good.

00:06:17.525 --> 00:06:20.615
Maybe I can increase it to 84.

00:06:20.615 --> 00:06:21.950
Perfect, It's cool.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.965
Alright, now that our
primary color is ready,

00:06:24.965 --> 00:06:28.640
let me lock it and I'm going
to drag it to the left side.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.870
Just like that.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.480
Now I'm going to continue
pressing the space bar on

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.705
my keyboard to get
other colors are right.

00:06:35.705 --> 00:06:38.510
I like this light
blue color as well.

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.500
So I'm lucky to,

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.245
and let me press Space-bar.

00:06:42.245 --> 00:06:42.785
Again.

00:06:42.785 --> 00:06:45.140
This middle color
looks nice as well,

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.540
but it's a little
bit desaturated,

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.789
so I'm going to
modify it somehow.

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:53.300
First of all, let me slightly
move the hue slider to

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.220
the right side to see whether I

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.680
can get a better
base color or not.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.190
I think 127 is good.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:05.090
And as you can see, the
saturation is set to 78,

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.000
and I'm going to increase it
to get a saturated color.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.905
Alright, 87 looks good,

00:07:09.905 --> 00:07:12.620
but what about the
brightness? It's too dark.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.735
Let me increase
the brightness to,

00:07:14.735 --> 00:07:18.155
I'm going to set it to maybe 74.

00:07:18.155 --> 00:07:20.450
Perfect. I'm going to lock it

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:23.165
and continue pressing
the space bar.

00:07:23.165 --> 00:07:25.265
Now I'm looking for
an accent color.

00:07:25.265 --> 00:07:28.280
It could be a green
color or a purple color,

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.830
since we are using an
analogous color harmony.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.270
Alright, let's see
whether we can

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.190
use this green color or not.

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:35.840
I think it looks good.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.795
However, it needs to be
modified a little bit.

00:07:38.795 --> 00:07:41.210
So I'm going to click on
the hex color code here.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.030
As you can see, it's too
saturated and it would be

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.720
a problem in terms of color
contrast and accessibility.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.200
So I'm going to make it
desaturated a little bit.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.680
Let me set it to 88, okay,

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.200
and also I am going to
change the base color or

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.125
right, 161 looks good.

00:08:00.125 --> 00:08:03.245
However, it's too dark
to be an accent color.

00:08:03.245 --> 00:08:05.825
I'm going to increase the
brightness a little bit.

00:08:05.825 --> 00:08:09.245
I think 82 looks
good. I like it.

00:08:09.245 --> 00:08:10.910
Let me lock it and I'm going to

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:12.800
press space on my keyboard.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.025
I'm looking forward to
neutral colors, okay?

00:08:16.025 --> 00:08:17.990
Alright, I don't
like these colors,

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:21.935
so what I'm gonna do is copy
the primary color code here.

00:08:21.935 --> 00:08:23.660
I'm gonna go to hex.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:27.170
I'm going to copy it and
let me paste it here.

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:29.225
So we've got the primary color,

00:08:29.225 --> 00:08:30.965
and now using the color picker,

00:08:30.965 --> 00:08:34.895
I can create a tone here to
get my desired neutral color.

00:08:34.895 --> 00:08:37.250
Okay, So let me move
the color picker to

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.700
the left side to add
gray to our base color.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.070
This is how we create a tone,

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:45.455
if you remember, just like that.

00:08:45.455 --> 00:08:50.030
Now let me go to HSB to see
the attributes of my color.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.560
Desaturation is good.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.785
However, I'm going to make
it a little bit desaturated.

00:08:54.785 --> 00:08:58.654
Let me decrease the
saturation amount to 20.

00:08:58.654 --> 00:09:00.605
And also for the brightness,

00:09:00.605 --> 00:09:05.180
I'm going to increase
C2 maybe for the four.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.115
Yeah, it looks good, nice.

00:09:07.115 --> 00:09:08.660
Let me lock it.
Now. I'm going to

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:10.445
add one more neutral color,

00:09:10.445 --> 00:09:11.690
but a light one.

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:14.195
And if I hover
over this section,

00:09:14.195 --> 00:09:16.460
I can click on this
add color icon.

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:19.085
And let me paste that
color code here.

00:09:19.085 --> 00:09:21.260
Okay, Just like that,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.240
now, I'm going to
modify the colors.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.210
So let me go to the
HSB color model.

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:27.995
The hue is gonna be the same,

00:09:27.995 --> 00:09:29.810
but I'm going to
make it desaturated

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:31.745
to create a tint of this color.

00:09:31.745 --> 00:09:35.869
Okay, So let me make it
this saturated like this.

00:09:35.869 --> 00:09:38.675
I think if I decrease it to six,

00:09:38.675 --> 00:09:39.815
it would be great.

00:09:39.815 --> 00:09:42.605
And also I'm going to
increase the brightness

00:09:42.605 --> 00:09:46.235
to 99, are right, cool.

00:09:46.235 --> 00:09:48.125
This is a great neutral color.

00:09:48.125 --> 00:09:50.825
I'm going to lock it and
I need one more color.

00:09:50.825 --> 00:09:51.890
And that's going to be white

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:53.360
because we're going to use that

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.740
for our cards and let
me change it to white.

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.305
Perfect. Alright, cool.

00:10:00.305 --> 00:10:01.985
Our color palette is ready.

00:10:01.985 --> 00:10:03.650
Now it's time to export it.

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:04.880
So I'm going to click on

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.045
Export button and you could
use whatever format you want,

00:10:08.045 --> 00:10:10.235
but I prefer SVG,

00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:11.810
so let me download it.

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:14.090
Now I'm going to go
to Figma and let me

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:16.340
drag and drop the exports
at color palette.

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:17.030
Here.

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:18.050
There we go.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:19.535
I'm going to enlarge it.

00:10:19.535 --> 00:10:20.255
Cool.

00:10:20.255 --> 00:10:21.515
Let me move it here.

00:10:21.515 --> 00:10:23.090
Alright guys, that's all for

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:25.280
the first part of this project.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.630
In the next video,

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:30.485
we will start applying
our colors to our design.

00:10:30.485 --> 00:10:32.520
So see you then.
