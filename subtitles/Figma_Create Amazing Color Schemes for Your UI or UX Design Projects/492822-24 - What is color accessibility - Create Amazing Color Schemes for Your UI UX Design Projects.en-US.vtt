00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.920
When it comes to UI UX design,

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.410
accessibility matters a lot.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.750
After all, designers are there

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.420
to solve problems,
not to make them.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.825
So it's important to design
in a way that everyone,

00:00:18.825 --> 00:00:21.479
regardless of their
physical, auditory,

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:24.420
or visual disabilities
could be able to use

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.960
the product color
accessibility lets people with

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.330
vision impairment
use the product

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.550
we designed just
like everyone else.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.774
Do you remember the example
about semantic colors?

00:00:35.774 --> 00:00:38.310
This is all about
color accessibility.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.230
Here we have three
profile images.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.825
A status indicator at
the top right corner,

00:00:44.825 --> 00:00:47.435
green means the user is online.

00:00:47.435 --> 00:00:50.315
Blue indicates that
the user is offline,

00:00:50.315 --> 00:00:53.000
and purple means that
the user is busy.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.830
But let's see how people with

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.200
monochromatic vision CDS design.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.420
As you can see, the colors are

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.895
difficult to distinguish
from one another.

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:03.680
That's why choosing the right of

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.275
value for each color
matters a lot.

00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:08.480
Now let's modify these colors

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.880
to make this design
more accessible.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.195
Let's use semantic colors
for these indicators.

00:01:14.195 --> 00:01:15.905
Now, it's so much better.

00:01:15.905 --> 00:01:18.260
Can you see why
accessibility is important?

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.180
Now, people suffering from

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.480
monochromatic vision can
not distinguish Hughes.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.450
They can only see
different shades of gray.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.750
This is why I already
mentioned that the value of

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.680
colors is more important than
other attributes of color.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.810
We can create a good
contrast between

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.990
our shades by just changing
the value of a color

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.340
that even people with

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.230
monochromatic vision could

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.525
recognize our
elements hierarchy.

00:01:44.525 --> 00:01:47.210
Of course, there are many
color vision deficiencies,

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.400
but the point I'm
trying to make is that

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.655
not everyone perceives
the colors the way we do.

00:01:52.655 --> 00:01:54.260
Let's consider this design

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.925
and see how different
people with

00:01:55.925 --> 00:01:59.449
color vision deficiencies
can process these colors.

00:01:59.449 --> 00:02:03.215
Monochromatic vision or
complete colorblindness.

00:02:03.215 --> 00:02:04.759
As I mentioned before,

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.730
people with monochromatic
vision can only see

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.435
different gray shades, proton
opium, colorblindness.

00:02:11.435 --> 00:02:14.360
People with these color
vision deficiency perceive

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.420
red colors as darker
colors than normal,

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.450
and usually red
becomes a dark green.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.040
So if you choose red as

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.775
your foreground color and black
as your background color,

00:02:25.775 --> 00:02:28.894
it would be too dark for
them to read the text.

00:02:28.894 --> 00:02:30.605
Blue cone, monochrome messy,

00:02:30.605 --> 00:02:32.345
or VCM for short.

00:02:32.345 --> 00:02:34.670
People with BCM can see

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.070
the red and green
colors properly.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.065
While they can perceive blue,

00:02:39.065 --> 00:02:41.960
there are other color vision
deficiencies as well.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.290
But the important thing
is that we as designers,

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.590
should make sure to choose
our colors in a way

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.570
that improves the functionality

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.100
of the products we design.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.640
So always put the user in
the center of your design.
