00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.550
One of the factors that we
should always check regarding

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.805
color accessibility
is the contrast ratio

00:00:11.805 --> 00:00:15.045
according to Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines,

00:00:15.045 --> 00:00:17.805
or WCAG for short.

00:00:17.805 --> 00:00:21.164
There are two different
levels of contrast ratio.

00:00:21.164 --> 00:00:23.730
Double a for minimum contrast or

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.205
AAA for enhanced contrast,

00:00:26.205 --> 00:00:31.410
the WA level requires a
minimum contrast ratio of 4.5

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.835
to one for normal text and
3-to-1 for large or bold text.

00:00:36.835 --> 00:00:39.695
On the other hand,
the triple a level

00:00:39.695 --> 00:00:42.860
requires a minimum
contrast ratio of

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.010
seven to one for normal text and

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.715
4.5 to one for
large or bold text.

00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:51.770
But wait, how can we actually

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.695
measure the contrast
ratio of our colors?

00:00:54.695 --> 00:00:56.105
Well, we can use

00:00:56.105 --> 00:00:58.610
online contrast checkers
for this matter.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.430
There is a website
called coolers for both

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.015
creating color palettes and
checking the contrast ratio.

00:01:05.015 --> 00:01:07.745
Let's give it a try
and see how it works.

00:01:07.745 --> 00:01:11.315
Go to coolers.co slash
contrast checker.

00:01:11.315 --> 00:01:14.045
Here we should specify
a background color.

00:01:14.045 --> 00:01:15.889
Here, we should specify

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:19.129
the text color we are going
to use on our background.

00:01:19.129 --> 00:01:20.720
As you can see, I've got

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.495
a pretty high number
and it's fantastic.

00:01:23.495 --> 00:01:26.510
It also indicates that
these color combination

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.825
works well for both
small and large text.

00:01:29.825 --> 00:01:32.480
Now let's take another
pair of colors.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.374
Can you see that
it's still readable,

00:01:35.374 --> 00:01:38.150
but it works only
for large text.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.490
So always check the
contrast ratio of

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.070
your colors to see how
accessible they are.
