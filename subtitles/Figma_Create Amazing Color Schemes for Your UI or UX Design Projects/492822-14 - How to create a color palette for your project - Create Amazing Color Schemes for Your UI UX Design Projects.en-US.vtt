00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.630
Now that you have gained

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.419
all the required
knowledge about color,

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:11.640
let's put them into practice and

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.205
create a color
palette step-by-step.

00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:15.480
Are you ready?

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.040
Let's get started.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.365
No matter what
software you're using,

00:00:19.365 --> 00:00:23.340
change the color model
to HSB or use Figma.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.650
So let me show you how it works.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.620
First, I head over to
the field section,

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.400
and from this drop-down
menu, I choose HSB.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.920
As you can see, we have
three different values here,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.800
H for hue, S for saturation,

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.825
and B for brightness.

00:00:41.825 --> 00:00:45.005
So when we want to increase
the intensity of our color,

00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:48.065
we should increase
the saturation here.

00:00:48.065 --> 00:00:50.015
If you want to create a shade,

00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:51.740
we should decrease
the brightness

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.765
to add black to our base color.

00:00:53.765 --> 00:00:56.405
Step one, choose
your base color.

00:00:56.405 --> 00:00:58.940
It's the primary
color of your UI.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.785
You can pick the
brand's color for it.

00:01:00.785 --> 00:01:03.035
If there is any step to

00:01:03.035 --> 00:01:06.124
apply the color to
shape on your Canvas,

00:01:06.124 --> 00:01:08.885
it could be a circle
or a rectangle.

00:01:08.885 --> 00:01:12.170
Step three, duplicate
the shape five

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.515
times to get six
identical shapes.

00:01:15.515 --> 00:01:17.360
These are your swatches.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.550
Step four, choose the swatches

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.710
near the base color and modify

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.860
only the saturation
or brightness to

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.175
get to supportive dark
shades of your color.

00:01:28.175 --> 00:01:29.660
Don't change the hue.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.095
These colors are used
for different sets of

00:01:33.095 --> 00:01:37.385
actionable elements like
buttons or links, e.g.

00:01:37.385 --> 00:01:38.945
when we design a button,

00:01:38.945 --> 00:01:42.230
we want to create all the
states of the button like

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.415
default, active, inactive, etc.

00:01:46.415 --> 00:01:49.070
Step five, now choose to

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.015
neutral colors by adding gray
and white to your color.

00:01:53.015 --> 00:01:54.320
Step six.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.480
Finally, create a dark tone of

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.525
your color by adding
more gray to your color.

00:01:59.525 --> 00:02:01.505
We are done, as you can see,

00:02:01.505 --> 00:02:04.280
just by using one
single base color,

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.950
you can design a
complete interface.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.465
I have a question for you,

00:02:08.465 --> 00:02:10.340
what kind of color
harmony indeed,

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.860
we use to create these
beautiful palette?

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.990
If your answer is monochromatic,

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.775
you are absolutely right.

00:02:16.775 --> 00:02:21.950
We use one color and created
variations by adding tints,

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.950
shades, and tones to
our color palette.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.980
Now let's create an
analogous color scheme.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.130
I'm going to use the color
wheel as my reference.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.935
Let's pick purple
as our base color.

00:02:33.935 --> 00:02:37.250
Now I'm going to move the
hue slider to the left and

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.044
right slightly to choose
three more colors.

00:02:41.044 --> 00:02:43.100
Keep in mind that
in order to create

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.125
variations for
your color scheme,

00:02:45.125 --> 00:02:47.330
you don't need
major hue changes.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.990
You just need to slightly
modify the hue and create

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.860
variations by adjusting
saturation and brightness.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.260
In this case, I'm going
to choose a tint of

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.840
this pink color as
my accent color.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.885
Now that our primary and
accent colors are ready,

00:03:02.885 --> 00:03:04.580
it's time to add to

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.865
neutral colors by adding
gray to our main color.

00:03:07.865 --> 00:03:11.315
Now let's see how this palette
looks in an interface.

00:03:11.315 --> 00:03:13.415
It looks amazing, doesn't it?

00:03:13.415 --> 00:03:15.559
Depending on the
type of project,

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:18.770
you can add semantic colors
to your color palette.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.470
Semantic colors are
used for warning,

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.095
error, success and information.

00:03:24.095 --> 00:03:26.165
As I mentioned in
the previous video,

00:03:26.165 --> 00:03:28.625
you should use
yellow for warning,

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:31.535
read for error,
green for success,

00:03:31.535 --> 00:03:33.710
and blue for showing
information.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:34.820
A quick note here,

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.590
having these colors is a

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.245
must if you want to
design a dashboard.

00:03:39.245 --> 00:03:41.660
Because on dashboards,
we usually

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.480
present important data
and it's essential

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.569
to use semantic colors
to convey the purpose

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.930
and meaning of all data
to the users. Clearly.
