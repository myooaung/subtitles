00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.720
There are plenty of
different tools out there

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.140
enabling you to create your
harmonious color palettes.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.150
In this video, I'm
gonna show you

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.330
some useful color palette
generating websites.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.425
Are you ready?

00:00:17.425 --> 00:00:18.925
Let's get started.

00:00:18.925 --> 00:00:21.190
Number one, coolers.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:22.855
As I already mentioned,

00:00:22.855 --> 00:00:24.820
this is the tool
that I use to find

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.790
harmonious color combinations
for my projects.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.470
You can give it a try to,

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.270
let me show you how it works.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.055
Once you open the website,

00:00:33.055 --> 00:00:36.055
you can click on the
Generate button in the menu.

00:00:36.055 --> 00:00:38.455
And here is the
palette generator.

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:40.930
If you press the spacebar
on your keyboard,

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.794
this whole pallet changes.

00:00:42.794 --> 00:00:45.170
Once you find one
color you like,

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.995
you can like that color by
clicking on the lock icon.

00:00:48.995 --> 00:00:51.155
Now continue pressing
the space bar

00:00:51.155 --> 00:00:53.060
until you find the second color.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.365
It's fun, isn't it?

00:00:54.365 --> 00:00:57.230
I should mention that now
only the best matching

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.365
colors or peak based on
the colors you liked.

00:01:00.365 --> 00:01:02.240
You should keep
doing this process

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.565
until you select all colors.

00:01:04.565 --> 00:01:06.755
Now you can export
your color palette

00:01:06.755 --> 00:01:08.990
and use it in your
design software.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.255
If you have a
specific main color,

00:01:11.255 --> 00:01:14.180
you can just paste the
hex color code here,

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.580
Luckett, and press the spacebar

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.530
to generate your color palette.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.630
Once your color
palette is ready,

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.869
you can use other cool
features of this website.

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.915
For instance, you can
adjust the attributes of

00:01:26.915 --> 00:01:31.085
all colors at once using
the adjust palette option.

00:01:31.085 --> 00:01:33.410
You can also check
the accessibility of

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.290
your color by using the
colorblindness option.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.050
What's, what if you want
to create a color palette

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.140
using a specific color
harmony, don't worry,

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.870
you can do that to
simply head over to

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.820

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.655
Generate method from
these drop menu,

00:01:49.655 --> 00:01:51.740
you can specify
the color harmony

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.125
you want to use to
create color palettes.

00:01:54.125 --> 00:01:57.530
Do you want to see your color
palettes in grayscale mode?

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.020
Just click on the
View illuminance map.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.885
You can also create a
palette from a photo.

00:02:02.885 --> 00:02:04.370
To do that, click on

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.520
the camera button and
upload your image here.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.830
Your color palette is ready.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.915
If you're looking for gradients,

00:02:11.915 --> 00:02:15.680
you can simply hit over to
the Explorer gradient section

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.940
and you can find

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.970
countless gradients for
your projects here.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.820
Alright, let's talk about
the second tool you can

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.879
use to create your
own color palettes.

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.800
My color, that space.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.410
It's another great
website that gives you

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.370
all the colors you need
based on your primary color.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.045
So just choose your color
here and click on Generate.

00:02:38.045 --> 00:02:39.410
As you can see, it shows you

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.300
different color
categories that you can

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.520
choose from based on your need.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.340
The next tool is
called Adobe Color.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.500
It's an advanced tool that lets

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.660
you create color palettes easily

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.940
by choosing different
color harmonies

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.235
and adjusting them
on the color picker.

00:02:55.235 --> 00:02:56.960
Just like this, you can

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.345
also head over to
the Explore section

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:00.680
and browse through

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.040
countless color palettes
taken from photos.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.095
If you go to the trans section,

00:03:06.095 --> 00:03:08.465
you can discover
current color trends

00:03:08.465 --> 00:03:11.029
in different industries
like fashion,

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:14.600
graphic design,
illustration, et cetera.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.985
Under the accessibility
tool stamp,

00:03:16.985 --> 00:03:20.300
you can check the accessibility
of your colors as well.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.895
Do you like using
artificial intelligence

00:03:22.895 --> 00:03:25.715
or AI to create your
color palettes?

00:03:25.715 --> 00:03:28.250
If you do, I have
good news for you.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.915
The next website
we're going to talk

00:03:29.915 --> 00:03:32.120
about is called chroma.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.400
And it uses artificial
intelligence

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.170
to train a neural network

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.700
powered algorithm for

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.460
creating personalized
color palettes.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.350
Well, how does it work?

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.240
First, you should choose

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.605
your favorite colors to train
the generator algorithm.

00:03:48.605 --> 00:03:50.480
Once you pick your colors,

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.985
click on the start
training button

00:03:52.985 --> 00:03:55.130
to start the training process.

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.890
Once it's done, you
will be presented with

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.294
hundreds of different color
pairs and color palettes.

00:04:01.294 --> 00:04:03.810
It's so cool, isn't it?
