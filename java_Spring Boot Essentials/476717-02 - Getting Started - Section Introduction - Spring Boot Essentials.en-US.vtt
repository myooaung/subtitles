00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
In this first section, we're going to jump in and

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.560
get our hands dirty as we see how to create

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.685
a spring bruce application completely from scratch using the spring initializer website.

00:00:08.685 --> 00:00:10.440
This is a one-stop shop to creating

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.745
your Spring Boot applications and comes with tons of technology ready to plug in C.

00:00:14.745 --> 00:00:16.860
Once we have the project generated from there,

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.905
we'll see how to build it with the two men build systems for Java,

00:00:19.905 --> 00:00:21.960
Apache, Maven Gradle, of course.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.539
And then we'll look at how we can run our stars replication.

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.565
Have a quick look at the layered architecture which

00:00:26.565 --> 00:00:28.935
underpins all spin best enterprise development.

00:00:28.935 --> 00:00:31.905
And I'll show you some spring resources you should know about too.

00:00:31.905 --> 00:00:36.100
So this section is all about getting up and running. So let's jump in.
