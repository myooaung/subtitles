00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
Now if I went back to start dot spring to IR,

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.120
and I decided, for example,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.480
Genome What I want to make this into a web application that I could just go

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.305
down here to Spring Web or can even type in web.

00:00:13.305 --> 00:00:15.690
For example, click that.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.880
And then I can see I've added this new dependency here.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.420
So now if I go into explore and look at the pond XML file,

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.120
you'll now see there's a new dependency which has been added,

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.570
which is this one here.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.425
And the only has it been added?

00:00:30.425 --> 00:00:31.775
It's actually if you notice,

00:00:31.775 --> 00:00:34.205
is replaced, the Spring Boot starts at one,

00:00:34.205 --> 00:00:37.850
and that's because Spring Boot starts web also brings in Spring Boot starter,

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.760
so the applications intelligent enough to know that as well.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:48.155
So if we were to also replace the standard Spring Boot starter dependency,

00:00:48.155 --> 00:00:51.140
we've started dependency for web like so.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.930
Then if we click down here, Enable Auto Import.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.945
And we'll see that this dependency graph is then rebuilt.

00:00:56.945 --> 00:00:58.505
As you can see here.

00:00:58.505 --> 00:01:01.670
We no longer have Spring Boot starter as a top-level dependency.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.885
We have Spring Boot Starter web as a top-level one in our production app.

00:01:05.885 --> 00:01:08.855
But that also, you'll see brings in Spring Boot starter.

00:01:08.855 --> 00:01:11.780
And again, whatever's needed is brought in

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.975
transitively as men and builds its dependency graph.

00:01:14.975 --> 00:01:19.955
So he can see Spring Web and spring with MVC,

00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:21.800
which are the two main dependencies.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.480
They're used for web apps.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.855
And we've also got the Spring Boot starter for Tomcat too.

00:01:26.855 --> 00:01:30.380
Because the spring Blap can also run inside an embedded Tomcat container.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.300
In other words, it's inside the jar file itself and it,

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.530
you don't have to then create a WAR file of your Spring Boot project.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.840
It'll just wanted to self-executing JAR file.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.465
We've Tomcat bundled into that jar file itself.

00:01:41.465 --> 00:01:43.175
And as you can see as well now,

00:01:43.175 --> 00:01:47.390
obviously it's changed the jar files that have been brought in, as you can see here,

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.740
we've got Tomcat, we've got web and web NBC and that kinda thing.
