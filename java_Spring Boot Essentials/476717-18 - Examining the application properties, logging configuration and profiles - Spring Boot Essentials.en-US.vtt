00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
We also have application properties as well.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.620
So as an application dot.properties file,

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.390
which will always finding the source main and resources is the standard properties file.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.180
You can see that just name equals value pairs.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.210
But one convention we have in spin will applications is that

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.785
each technology facet that we use registers a specific prefix.

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:22.080
So for example, spring data registers,

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.900
spring dot data sources its prefix timely.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.570
The template engine reserves spring dot time leaf as

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.380
its prefix mis for spring GPA, and so on.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.079
And they underneath, underneath these actual properties,

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:38.840
we've got something slightly different, may appear to look the same,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.480
but it's not really, this is basically where we're configuring,

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.964
logging in the application.

00:00:42.964 --> 00:00:44.270
So we've Spring Boot.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.785
You don't need a separate logging file.

00:00:45.785 --> 00:00:48.905
Instead you can register the categories are loggers,

00:00:48.905 --> 00:00:51.440
does the individual packages or even classes that you want.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.955
Second figure logging on.

00:00:52.955 --> 00:00:55.190
And you just prefix them with logging HDL level.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.540
So login dot level dot,

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:57.815
and then the package name,

00:00:57.815 --> 00:00:59.690
and then the level that you require.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.685
So for example, here, as we said,

00:01:01.685 --> 00:01:03.020
if wanted to go into,

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.905
see more debugging in what's happening in spring and BC spring web,

00:01:06.905 --> 00:01:09.155
we could just enable this line here.

00:01:09.155 --> 00:01:13.370
Now it is also possible through springs profile mechanism that you

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.620
can have a profile specific set of properties. And that's what we're doing here.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.945
So in addition to our application dot properties,

00:01:19.945 --> 00:01:24.715
you can also have application dash and then a profile ID dot properties.

00:01:24.715 --> 00:01:26.290
So if we click on here,

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.129
what this is doing is this is actually overriding certain properties,

00:01:30.129 --> 00:01:34.120
which are the default properties if the MySQL profile is enabled.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.300
So for example, here we can see we've got database equals h two.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.290
If we pass in a MySQL profile when we run the application,

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.580
which we can do by passing in a spring dot profiles to active flag,

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.800
where there is a minus D switch, mortar,

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.290
an environment variable, or by whatever other means.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:57.225
If we have that, then you'll see it changes and overwrites the database to be MySQL.

00:01:57.225 --> 00:02:03.050
And similarly as well, spring dot data source dot URL is that in a MySQL profile?

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.950
Otherwise is not specified if it's running in the default profile.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.265
And that's because Spring Boot sets up an embedded H2,

00:02:10.265 --> 00:02:12.110
so it doesn't need to have this URL suggests an

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.210
in-memory when does a few other things as well?

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.890
Was a.gitignore suffer when you're committing files under version control using gates.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.780
For example, ignore anything under

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.465
the target directory because that's where the built artifacts GO.

00:02:23.465 --> 00:02:28.400
They shouldn't rejecting middle also ignore some MID specific files and folders.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.755
So for example, these its deal with Eclipse,

00:02:30.755 --> 00:02:32.720
the zoo with idea.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.550
And these have a Visual Studio Code.
