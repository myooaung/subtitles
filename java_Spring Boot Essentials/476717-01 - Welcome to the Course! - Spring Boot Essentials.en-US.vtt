00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.475
Hello there and welcome to this course,

00:00:02.475 --> 00:00:06.615
which gets you acquainted with the essentials you need to know about Spring Boot.

00:00:06.615 --> 00:00:09.210
Now I've designed this to be a concise course which will give you

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.490
the foundational knowledge you need to know to be able to

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.010
start developing spring roots applications.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.440
And in particular, instead of this being a code along style,

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.980
of course where the instructor types one thing and then you just return the same.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.590
Instead of this, this course concentrates on building up

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.110
your understanding of how spring boots applications

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.990
work and how they build on top of spring technology to

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.495
provide a super quick and robust platform for application development.

00:00:31.495 --> 00:00:35.240
So what I actively encourage you to do is to use this course alongside reading up

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.005
on the elements of spring itself that you want to incorporate into your applications.

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:42.440
And in this way, you'll get hands-on practice in the areas of interesting.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.515
This is a course on just a Spring Boot and its operation.

00:00:45.515 --> 00:00:48.530
So we're assuming that you're already familiar with spring basics.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:49.790
If there are any areas, though,

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.280
which are unclear, just shoot me a male in the Q and a section.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.485
And as always, I'll be happy to help you.

00:00:54.485 --> 00:00:56.750
We also have another course on spring foundations

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.910
to which you might like to take before this one,

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.205
if you're unsure of spring best development, right?

00:01:01.205 --> 00:01:04.085
I'm super excited to show you all about how Spring Boot works now.

00:01:04.085 --> 00:01:07.170
So without further ado, let's get started.
