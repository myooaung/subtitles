00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.555
And then finally it's going to do a finished refresh,

00:00:03.555 --> 00:00:06.300
which is gonna publish out the events you can

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.665
see in here on lifecycle process to say on refresh,

00:00:10.665 --> 00:00:14.110
and also publish this context refresh event as well.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.775
And at that point then our application continue to step through here.

00:00:20.775 --> 00:00:30.855
Let's just step out, step out, step out again.

00:00:30.855 --> 00:00:33.510
Now we've done the run at that point here.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.865
Now when we look inside the console,

00:00:35.865 --> 00:00:39.860
we can see that now spring with application is started and it's up and

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.715
running on 8080 waiting to service HTTP calls.

00:00:43.715 --> 00:00:49.650
Bled off. F9 does a quick walk through of the main start-up sequence.
