00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
After necessarily just passing applications from an application.properties file

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.295
which is bundled with the application with because it is part of the production sources,

00:00:08.295 --> 00:00:10.800
it means that it's actually going to go down into

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.440
the target classes directory as part of the build process.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.110
And it will be physically embedded inside

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.305
the jar file or the waterfall depending on which packaging type you use.

00:00:19.305 --> 00:00:21.405
So that means that your application properties

00:00:21.405 --> 00:00:23.730
effectively when you have them in dislocation here,

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.420
they're packaged up inside the deployable unit that you're gonna run.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.215
It's nice to be able to override those at times and you can do that as well.

00:00:31.215 --> 00:00:32.850
So you can override, for example,

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.320
if I go into R1 here and look at

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.054
the wrong configuration for our application demo application.

00:00:39.054 --> 00:00:41.975
We could override by passing in a minus D switch.

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:44.645
That's the set a system property that the JVM level,

00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:46.910
and we can just give it the same property key.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.265
So my app door release dash M equals,

00:00:52.265 --> 00:00:55.730
and we'll just call this yellow canary,

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.400
for example, where the bird references come from.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.560
But the mind, if we run now,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.075
we should see that it didn't work.

00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:08.210
And it didn't work because we didn't enclose them in quotes.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.410
So it was trying to it was basically trying to set this as a property.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.605
And then it was assumed that this was the class name it wanted to execute.

00:01:15.605 --> 00:01:19.040
So we just put them in double quotes there, then there will be fine.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.330
So we re-execute now.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.130
And you can see here we have yellow canary.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.280
So even if we reintroduce this property back,

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.100
Golden Eagle and ran,

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.840
it would still say yellow canary.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.780
And that's because the minus d system property is

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.959
overriding the property that's been bundled with the application.
