00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
So that's how I started dependencies work inside spring boots.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.995
And when you bring these dependencies in,

00:00:04.995 --> 00:00:06.810
your bringing in a lot of different technology to

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.540
the table is a really quick way of being able to get the library's note.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.155
Your application depends on inside the app and get up and running with it really quickly.

00:00:13.155 --> 00:00:16.500
So this is one of the main cornerstones of spring Bu applications.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.065
This dependency resolution mechanism was seeing here.

00:00:19.065 --> 00:00:22.260
But the other key parts of app to the key par is the fact that

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.759
one's dependence is abroad in the Spring Boot runtime will look at these dependencies.

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:28.740
And depending on which dependencies are being brought

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.210
in by inspecting which had been brought in.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.950
It will selectively auto configure them and

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.994
also make linkages between different components.

00:00:36.994 --> 00:00:39.380
And this is now getting into the realms of auto configuration,

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.715
which we'll see in the next videos,

00:00:40.715 --> 00:00:43.235
which is a very exciting aspects to spring boom,

00:00:43.235 --> 00:00:45.815
which I'm excited to talk about z or these two features,

00:00:45.815 --> 00:00:48.410
dependency resolution plus auto configuration.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.910
It really is the heart of Spring Boot.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.140
Just good to understand this,

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.415
and I've seen it firsthand.

00:00:52.415 --> 00:00:56.130
You'll be in a good place to understand auto configuration next.
