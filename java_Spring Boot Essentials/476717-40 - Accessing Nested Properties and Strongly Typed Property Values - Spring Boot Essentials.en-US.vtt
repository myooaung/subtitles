00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.290
If you're wanting to access, for example,

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.995
the sprint number, you'd put in my app,

00:00:04.995 --> 00:00:07.095
WE cycle spin number.

00:00:07.095 --> 00:00:08.655
So let's just do that as well.

00:00:08.655 --> 00:00:14.025
To show that we can inject multiple values. Just create a new one.

00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:17.680
String, string.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:27.340
Split number, giving you hat value of my app.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.245
Don't release.

00:00:30.245 --> 00:00:33.020
Cycle dots.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.420
Sprint number.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:47.090
So release name, sprint number, for example.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.460
And then rerun with control are.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.470
And now we can see we've also got knowledge,

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.365
Golden Eagle, we've also got spin number three as well.

00:00:57.365 --> 00:00:59.885
Now when there's been a number, it's actually possible

00:00:59.885 --> 00:01:03.245
to change that to an int and everything would still work too.

00:01:03.245 --> 00:01:07.775
So control are and that also works now.

00:01:07.775 --> 00:01:09.800
But now we've got the actual real type.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.415
And that's because Springs using its property converters to be able to do that,

00:01:13.415 --> 00:01:14.810
which is also a nice feature.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.840
So yeah, that's how you deal with properties in spring boom,

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.725
inject them into your application and can provide default values of right values.

00:01:21.725 --> 00:01:26.490
And a look at how you can do that using properties notation or YAML notation.
