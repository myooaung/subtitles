00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
Now this complete consolidated dependency graph which has been generated,

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.985
leads to if we jump over to the external libraries window,

00:00:08.985 --> 00:00:13.785
all of these libraries here being included in your Spring Boot application.

00:00:13.785 --> 00:00:15.660
So there's a lot of libraries there.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.519
There's probably, I guess,

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:20.150
maybe like 40 ish,

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.060
35-40 libraries, I guess, just by looking at them.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.875
So you can see here we've got a cluster of

00:00:24.875 --> 00:00:29.030
Spring Boot ones and we've got some core Spring framework ones as well,

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.650
which had been brought in transitively.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.270
In other words, the Spring Boot dependencies have

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.610
also brought those Spring framework ones into.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.815
And then we've got some other third party ones as well.

00:00:36.815 --> 00:00:40.760
And because we haven't specified any specific technology facets for now,

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.060
so we haven't brought in spring dates or anything to do

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.600
with messaging or transactions or NoSQL databases,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.935
cashing, anything like that.

00:00:48.935 --> 00:00:52.040
Because of that, we just tend to have kind of like standard dependencies.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.365
So here you can see we've got just things that we've logging.

00:00:54.365 --> 00:00:56.480
We've got some Mockito stuff and Jane is due for

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.790
testing along with the surgery and ham crest,

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.525
that's all sorts through a testing log for J logging again, we've got bite buddy,

00:01:02.525 --> 00:01:06.860
which has to do with bytecode manipulation that's used by Mockito for example.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.965
So the key part being with one started dependency,

00:01:09.965 --> 00:01:12.050
which is just this thing he needs to include.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.480
We brought in the men spin loop framework and also the Spring framework itself.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.960
Alongside JUnit Makita, which you can then use to test with.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.550
So that's how they started dependencies.
