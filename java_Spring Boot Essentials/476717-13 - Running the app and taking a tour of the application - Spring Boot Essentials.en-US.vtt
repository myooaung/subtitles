00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.995
So let's just run this application so we could do Java minus jar.

00:00:04.995 --> 00:00:08.670
And basically when you do package inside the target directory,

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.485
which is where all of the build artifacts go.

00:00:10.485 --> 00:00:14.460
In a Maven project, you'll see this should be a JAR file there,

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.220
which is named after the project's names here we've got

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.040
spring tectonic 2.3.1, bills, snapshot jar.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.590
And so if we run that, it's a self-executing job by the way.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.765
So we can just run it with Java minus jar.

00:00:24.765 --> 00:00:32.735
If we run that. You'll see the pet clinic application starting.

00:00:32.735 --> 00:00:35.855
And here you can see it started successfully.

00:00:35.855 --> 00:00:40.520
So whenever you see Tom caste started on ports, have you seen that message?

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.220
And started then the application name,

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.570
you know that the application started.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:54.485
Okay, so then we can just go then into local host 8080. And here we have it.

00:00:54.485 --> 00:00:59.450
This is actually now the pet clinic application that's running in this window here.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.005
On 2.3.1 release of Spring boot.

00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:05.810
Quick tour of it, we can find vets.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.880
So these are the list of events which we have in this fictional peck clinic.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.280
We can also find donors.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.600
You can click find owners.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.340
And these are all the honest own pets.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.640
So we can click on Eduardo Rodriguez for example.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.380
And this lists the pets and the visits.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.030
Who's got to pets, Joule and rosy.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.730
We can see both dogs, dog and dog.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:31.130
And we could either edit the pet here to change it to a hamster.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.430
For example, update the pet hamster.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.690
You could add a visit.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.330
See general checkup. For example.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.955
Visit.

00:01:46.955 --> 00:01:53.450
He received what was visit? General checkup on the third of July and go back to Han.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.159
So it's a very simple application,

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:56.600
but nevertheless it's meeting of,

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.280
for you to be able to have a look through and

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.960
see how all the different technologies hang together.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.360
Or spring web MVC For example,

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.750
springing ORM spin JDBC or that kind of stuff.
