00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.270
So we can see because we've got

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.195
the Maven wrapper and we'll just be able to build this project.

00:00:09.195 --> 00:00:14.640
So close out this m,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.610
v and w. And we're just going to call Package,

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.740
which is going to create the runnable artifacts,

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.090
which is a standalone java.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.400
So I can see it's downloading penances and needs to be

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.890
able to do the build for the plugins is using.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.745
And then shortly afterwards it will download the dependencies for the project itself.

00:00:35.745 --> 00:00:38.410
And then I'll do the actual build.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.825
So that took a while to do.

00:00:47.825 --> 00:00:50.045
And if we run it again,

00:00:50.045 --> 00:00:53.120
we'd see that it would just do a straight build without downloading

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.580
all the dependencies and initializing all the plugins and everything.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.710
So once you've done it once and Joe Maven,

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.830
local repository cash is primed with the dependencies that it needs and it

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.085
was a libraries that the Spring Boot application is going to use.

00:01:04.085 --> 00:01:06.020
You don't have to do anymore.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.175
Which is in this time, you did a full build in just 19 seconds.

00:01:10.175 --> 00:01:12.150
Second time around.
