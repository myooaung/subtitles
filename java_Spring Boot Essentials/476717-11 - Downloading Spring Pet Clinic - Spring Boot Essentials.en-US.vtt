00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
In this video, we're going to look at the conventions that are

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.670
used in a Spring Boot application and spin boot project.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.965
So to do this, what we're gonna do is we're going to look

00:00:07.965 --> 00:00:10.185
at the pet clinic sample application,

00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:12.900
which is one of the demo applications for Spring Boot.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.775
And we'll just explore that project structure

00:00:14.775 --> 00:00:17.130
and we'll talk through some of the conventions that we see.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.900
So first off, if we go to github.com,

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.930
spring projects and we're looking here.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.335
These are the main spin projects which we have in the spring ecosystem.

00:00:28.335 --> 00:00:34.575
And if you just go down here and find the repository and search for pet clinic.

00:00:34.575 --> 00:00:37.635
And you can see here we've got spring peck clinics, it is. Click on that.

00:00:37.635 --> 00:00:41.785
So this is a demo application which uses best practices for Spring Boot.

00:00:41.785 --> 00:00:43.670
So we're just going to download it.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.575
We could chlorinate with get.

00:00:45.575 --> 00:00:50.120
We can also just as well download the zip machine to Auckland with given instead.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.950
Why not copy and paste them and go into a terminal session.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.350
A little bit bigger.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.049
So go to the desktop.

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:09.480
And we're just gonna do a git clone pasting in that URL.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.840
Now it's floating the repository locally.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.700
It's so We should then be able to go into a directory.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.950
It's made hold spring pet clinic.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.440
And here we can see the project itself.
