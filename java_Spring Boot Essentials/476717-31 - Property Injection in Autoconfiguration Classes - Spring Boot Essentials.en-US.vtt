00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.895
Also there's this enable configuration properties,

00:00:02.895 --> 00:00:04.650
which basically means it's gonna apply

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.180
configuration properties based on this data source properties not class.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.650
And what this is saying is populate these fields here,

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.345
these members here in this picture,

00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:17.549
by looking at all the obligation properties,

00:00:17.549 --> 00:00:19.350
are all the properties available in the application

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.030
and commonly IPS or either from source,

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.300
from application to properties application or YAML or afterall,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.145
the profile processing is being done.

00:00:26.145 --> 00:00:28.885
So that combined, unified set of properties there.

00:00:28.885 --> 00:00:31.520
It'll basically copy properties which start with spin,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.920
not datasource onto this Poggio here.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.345
So for example, we'll expect to see a spring door datasource dot URL and

00:00:38.345 --> 00:00:41.030
a spring dot data source or use an m and

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.465
a spring dot-dot-dot source dot dr or dash, dash name.

00:00:44.465 --> 00:00:48.665
The reason for that is because it converts case to the hyphenated form.

00:00:48.665 --> 00:00:53.090
So each auto configuration will also have its own set of properties.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.280
And in doing that, you can actually then use

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.590
those properties to evaluate some conditions.
