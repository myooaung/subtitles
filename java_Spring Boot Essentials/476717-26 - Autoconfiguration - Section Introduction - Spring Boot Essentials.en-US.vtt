00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.100
Right, once we have understood how

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.965
the actual technologies are pulled into our Spring Boot projects,

00:00:04.965 --> 00:00:07.349
we've just seen that through their started dependencies.

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:08.865
The next logical question is, well,

00:00:08.865 --> 00:00:10.545
how does it just use what it needs?

00:00:10.545 --> 00:00:13.500
And this is what also configuration is all about.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.540
There's more to it than that though, as we'll see.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.850
But the next part of your Spring Boot journey is

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.955
an understanding spring boots also configuration mechanism.

00:00:20.955 --> 00:00:24.700
So let's jump in now and see exactly how this works.
