1
00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.620
The web console will likely be your first point of

2
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.890
interaction with AWS since you'll need to sign up for the

3
00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.870
service and configure your account.

4
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.310
After logging in,

5
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.130
you'll be dumped on to the console main page that has become

6
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.240
cleaner and more organized over the years.

7
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.950
Expanding the All services section gives you an idea of

8
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.030
all the services AWS has to offer.

9
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.300
You may notice some from the previous modules like

10
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.470
Elastic Beanstalk or DynamoDB,

11
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.190
but it's obvious that there are a lot of services that we weren't able to cover.

12
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.020
That's okay.

13
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.070
In my job as a web developer, I really use less than 10 of these services,

14
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.330
and you can see that some are specifically targeted for gaming,

15
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.030
mobile, or IoT.

16
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.260
Don't let this screen overwhelm you.

17
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.080
We're going to break it down now.

18
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.250
The console has organized all the services into

19
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.740
similar groups to build a taxonomy.

20
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.820
In the top left is the compute category.

21
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.970
Including services like EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk,

22
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.880
this category is where you'll find services for running

23
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.610
your application on a virtual machine.

24
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.030
The other services on offer here provides similar functionality.

25
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.260
Below that is the Storage category.

26
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.230
You can see S3 is here,

27
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.440
so I'm sure you can imagine this category is about storing files.

28
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.740
Next is the Database category with RDS, DynamoDB, and DocumentDB on offer.

29
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.530
Then, there's the Networking & Content Delivery category with VPC,

30
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.240
CloudFront, and Route53.

31
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.220
The Developer Tools category has services that relate to code development,

32
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.860
such as a cloud‑based source repository with CodeCommit.

33
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.970
The Management & Governance category contains CloudWatch,

34
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.340
but also other tools for automatically creating resources

35
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.440
with CloudFormation and OpsWorks.

36
00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.270
The last category I'll talk about is the Security,

37
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.460
Identity, & Compliance category,

38
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.360
which has services like IAM for AWS user management and the

39
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.560
Certificate Manager for SSL certificates.

40
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.750
The console menu bar at the top has a few tricks up its sleeve to

41
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.280
navigate AWS quickly. The Services drop‑down menu provides you with a

42
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.640
similar list of services as the All services list.

43
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.250
You can select the star to the left of any of the

44
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.240
services to add it to your favorites menu.

45
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.300
And the Recently visited list shows you the most

46
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.840
recent dashboards that you visited.

47
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.830
The universal search box is available whether the

48
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.250
Services drop‑down is expanded or not.

49
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.250
This search box will show your results for your query from the

50
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.940
available AWS services, features from each service,

51
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.430
AWS resource documentation, and results from the AWS Marketplace. I've

52
00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.540
found that I usually only use it for quick service navigation as the

53
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.940
documentation results are pretty hit or miss.

54
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:04.510
Still,

55
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.920
the universal search bar is the number 1 way that I navigate

56
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.840
the management console on a daily basis.

57
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.910
We've already discussed regions many times in this course. It's important that

58
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.050
you consider which region you're launching your resources into because many

59
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.790
resources are not visible to others across regions.

60
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:25.950
To select your region,

61
00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.680
you'll find a drop‑down in the top‑right corner. Select the region

62
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.060
where you want to launch resources first before creating the

63
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.040
resource and the console. And regions also decide pricing, so make

64
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.520
sure to take that into account.

65
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.680
Billing is an important part of AWS for most of us, so let's take a look at

66
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.090
that section. Clicking on your name in the top‑right corner will open a

67
00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.640
drop‑down with some account administration options. Clicking on My Billing

68
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.680
Dashboard will take you to the billing dashboard, which will show you a

69
00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.270
snapshot of the current month's charges and projected charges. On the right

70
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.730
side of the dashboard, it will show you the services where you're getting

71
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:05.690
charged.

72
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.840
I really love that Amazon has done this. Clicking on your name again

73
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.530
and then My Security Credentials will take you to the IAM service

74
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.720
dashboard where you can manage user credentials,

75
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.840
keys, groups, and roles for yourself and anyone else on this same account.

76
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.320
You can enable multi‑factor authentication here,

77
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.430
which is highly recommended, create access keys for CLI

78
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.640
or SDK access, and other activities.

79
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.120
If you work on a team with multiple members accessing the same AWS account,

80
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.540
the User section is where you'll give your teammates user accounts.

81
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.820
You can then add them to groups to easily assign roles,

82
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.640
giving them permissions to certain services on the account.

83
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.010
We don't have enough time to go through every service in the web console,

84
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.240
but I thought we might at least look at the EC2 dashboard.

85
00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.750
The dashboard first shows you what running resources you have

86
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.710
that are relevant to EC2, such as instances,

87
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.740
Elastic Block Storage volumes, load balancers, and security groups.

88
00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.490
If you look a little further down,

89
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.540
you will see a quick snapshot of region and availability zone health statuses.

90
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.050
This region will match the region you have selected

91
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.640
in the top right of the menu bar.

92
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.100
On the left side of the dashboard are many links to

93
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.490
EC2‑related services, such as instances, AMIs,

94
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.240
security groups, load balancers, and auto scaling groups.

95
00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.490
All of these services and categories specifically relate to EC2, and it's

96
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.400
nice that they're organized in this way. Clicking this Launch Instance button

97
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.900
is a shortcut that will take you through the launch wizard for an EC2

98
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.370
instance. In our clip where we covered EC2,

99
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.240
I showed you most of the rest of the process for this.

100
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.480
Each service dashboard is going to be different, so it's a

101
00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:04.000
good idea to look around the service page for any AWS services that you're interested in.
