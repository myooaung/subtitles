1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,810
Well, we've wrapped up the four core services of AWS.

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:09,740
After this overview, I hope you have a better understanding of AWS as a whole.

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,200
These four services cover a lot of the essential functionality of AWS,

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,770
and I'd be surprised if you were using AWS and not using one of them.

5
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:22,740
Let's go back through the core services to recap what we learned.

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,210
First, we looked at Elastic Cloud Compute,

7
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:29,590
shortened to EC2, which is the computing platform on AWS.

8
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,690
By creating instances and selecting images,

9
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:37,290
you're able to run third‑party applications or your own code on a

10
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,340
scalable and affordable virtual machine in the cloud.

11
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,510
Next, we covered Simple Storage Service,

12
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,870
also called S3, which is Amazon's cloud storage service.

13
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,040
The uses are endless.

14
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,860
And with a very low bucket cost and subsecond responses,

15
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:58,140
it's a great place to store anything from static assets to file uploads.

16
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,580
The third service we covered was the Relational Database Service,

17
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,760
or RDS,

18
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,140
which enables you to select from several Amazon‑managed hosted database types.

19
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,750
The benefits to using a managed solution like this in regards to security,

20
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,940
resiliency, and convenience makes it a no brainer.

21
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:22,010
Finally, we took a look at Route53, Amazon's solution for DNS management.

22
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:27,040
Route53 is how you expose your AWS resources and instances to users,

23
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,760
and it interacts easily with other AWS services.

24
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,680
In the next module, we'll be continuing to look at services available in AWS.

25
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,800
These services aren't core services,

26
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,840
but will augment or be used in conjunction with the core services.

27
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,060
Elastic Beanstalk is an application service that will

28
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,930
take your application written in Java, Python,

29
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:55,840
Node, Ruby, or any other language and get it running on an EC2 instance.

30
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,570
Lambda is a service that allows you to run simple

31
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,040
functions and return the result.

32
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,680
Lambda functions can be invoked from many different sources and

33
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,640
can be written in many different languages.

34
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,110
DynamoDB is a managed database solution offered by Amazon that

35
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:16,610
is a little different than those in RDS. DynamoDB is a managed

36
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,600
NoSQL document database service and, due to being managed by Amazon,

37
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,710
offers many benefits over rolling your own solution.

38
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:27,440
Virtual Private Cloud is a service enabling you to control access

39
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,240
and secure your instances and services in AWS.

40
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,720
It's used by almost every service in AWS,

41
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,740
and it's the best way to ensure that your data and application is safe.

42
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:43,460
CloudFront is a CDN service available from AWS, and it enables you to

43
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,140
edge your files so users can get to them super fast.

44
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,570
It can be used in conjunction with S3 as mentioned previously or

45
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,840
with a web application behind a load balancer.

46
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,580
CloudWatch is a logging and alarm service used with

47
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,440
almost every AWS service available.

48
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,680
You can set up alarms to let you know when instances are down, EC2 CPU is

49
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,390
high, or when S3 charges reach a threshold, for some examples. There's

50
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,200
any number of things you can do with CloudWatch. Once we've covered these

51
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,610
extended services in AWS, we'll have touched on all the services we'll

52
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,340
cover in this course.

53
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,890
AWS has over 165 available services as of right now.

54
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:30,480
So we're really only looking at the tip of the iceberg. Still, we're

55
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,540
covering the most commonly used services, so you'll have a solid

56
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:41,000
understanding of the majority of what AWS has to offer. I'll see you in the next module.
