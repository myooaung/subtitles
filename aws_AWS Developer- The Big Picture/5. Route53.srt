00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:06,880
Route53 is Amazon's service for DNS management, both inside and outside AWS.

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,840
It allows you to easily configure domain names to

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,240
resolve to internal AWS Services.

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,200
You can use domain names that you already own or can

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,160
register new ones through AWS.

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,960
DNS stands for Domain Name System,

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,200
and the purpose is to translate a human‑readable URL into an IP

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,110
address so that two computers can connect.

9
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:33,340
EC2 instances can be configured with public IP addresses,

10
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:38,260
but certain Amazon resources like S3 buckets or load balancers are a little

11
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:42,490
more complicated and don't have static visible IP addresses.

12
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,780
That's where Route53 comes into the picture,

13
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:49,520
allowing you to set up URL resolution to AWS resources directly,

14
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,660
bypassing any need for you to see an IP.

15
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:56,340
Of course, behind the scenes, IP resolution is happening.

16
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,340
But Route53 conveniently abstract this away.

17
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,130
Although Route53 is very straightforward and kind of basic,

18
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:08,320
I include it with the core AWS Services because it's the best way to let

19
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,940
others interact with your application or other AWS Services.

20
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,100
The URL is ubiquitous these days,

21
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:20,940
and Route53 is how you make URLs resolve to AWS Services.

22
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,380
Route53 works by first setting up a hosted zone.

23
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:30,740
A hosted zone is basically a root domain name, like example.com or google.com.

24
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,290
Using a hosted zone,

25
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:39,450
you can use Route53 to set up subdomains like www.example.com or

26
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,640
mail.example.com and configure them to route to AWS resources.

27
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,560
You can create record sets, like A records,

28
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,640
CNAME records, and MX records for those subdomains.

29
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,870
Route53 pricing is fairly straightforward. It costs 50

30
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,240
cents a month for each hosted zone,

31
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,090
then 40 cents per million queries, and any DNS entries that

32
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,530
you add in a hosted zone are basically free.

33
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,330
They don't change the cost. And that's pretty much it

34
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:11,640
for the breakdown of Route53 pricing.

35
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,520
There are a few more features that Route53 provides.

36
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,540
One of the most useful that I've found is the health check service.

37
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,270
This allows you to set up regular checks for a given URL path.

38
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:25,390
Health checks will send you alerts based on different rules.

39
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,180
For instance,

40
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:32,210
if the URL request gets a response of 503 or 404. This is an

41
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:35,510
essential tool if you have a customer‑facing web application.

42
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:43,000
And at $0.50 per month for each alarm, it's not hard to justify the value of something like this.
