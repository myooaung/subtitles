Hi everyone. My name is Ryan Lewis, and welcome to my

2
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.000
course, AWS Developer: The Big Picture.

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I'm a web engineer at Expedia and I use Amazon Web Services every single day.

4
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
AWS is the largest cloud provider in the world,

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.200
responsible for enabling cuttingâ€‘edge companies like Netflix,

6
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.000
Airbnb, and Lyft.

7
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.556
It's a powerful tool to use when developing

8
00:00:29.556 --> 00:00:31.875
applications that need to scale quickly,

9
00:00:31.875 --> 00:00:33.000
like web applications.

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.750
This course will give you a solid overview of AWS and the different

11
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.000
services and capabilities the platform provides.

12
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We'll cover what I like to call the core services of AWS.

13
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.125
These are the most commonly used services and form the

14
00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:52.000
basis for most web applications, such as Elastic Cloud Compute,

15
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.500
a virtual machine provisioning service where you can

16
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.000
run your own custom applications.

17
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We'll also cover extended services, which aren't as common, but highly useful.

18
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
For example, DynamoDB, a fully managed and hosted NoSQL database service.

19
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And we won't just stop at describing services,

20
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.875
we'll also cover the different ways to access AWS, whether it's in your browser,

21
00:01:16.875 --> 00:01:22.000
your application code, or the command line, and we'll look at demos of each.

22
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
By the end of this course,

23
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
you'll have a broad understanding of how AWS works and what you can do with it,

24
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
which will prepare you to decide if AWS is right for your project.

25
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn Amazon Web Services with the AWS Developer: The Big Picture course, at Pluralsight.
