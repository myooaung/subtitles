00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:01,480
Traditionally,

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:05,380
a software application is a collection of compiled lines of code

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,340
delivered and running on a computer in front of you.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,940
This used to be all there was, how it all worked.

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,120
With the introduction of the World Wide Web,

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:13,740
however,

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,060
a new paradigm emerged where software applications would run on a

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,190
different computer miles or continents away.

9
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:26,210
Users of said application would access it with the HTTP protocol

10
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,840
and interact with it through a web browser.

11
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,140
This is what we will call the web application.

12
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,150
Now let's imagine a scenario where our friend Lisa

13
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,070
is starting a new web startup.

14
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,220
She's got some shiny code, a real nice product,

15
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,550
and she's running the entire web application from a server

16
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,140
connected to the internet located in her closet.

17
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,270
As customers flock to Lisa's product,

18
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:53,170
she realizes her server in the closet isn't working out so well.

19
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:58,140
It's getting hot, stinking up her wardrobe, and starting to run slowly.

20
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,140
The overhead of her on‑premises hosting solution is hurting her business.

21
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:07,160
The difficulty in being flexible and scaling up quickly in response to

22
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:12,710
customer demands is costing her sales. Lisa's friend Gary works at a large

23
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,670
enterprise company, and there's very similar complaints.

24
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,960
His small team has to interact with a bureaucratic process to have virtual

25
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,710
machines provisioned every time they want to test out a new feature. Due

26
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,950
to overhead costs of each hardware instance,

27
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:31,040
he's forced to share a physical box with so many other teams that his

28
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,410
workflow is impacted and slows down development time.

29
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,130
But hey,

30
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,490
at least it gets him a lot of time for ping pong, right? Web

31
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,030
applications practically cry out for a different solution to solve

32
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,540
the many woes presented by on‑premises hosting.

33
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,120
Modern business won't wait for physical demands, and speed to

34
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,850
customer becomes a serious edge for competition.

35
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:56,890
The cloud industry began to provide a solution to small and large businesses

36
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:01,650
alike that needed an affordable and flexible way to serve web content to

37
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:05,470
customers. By abstracting away the physical hardware,

38
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:09,750
removing much of the configuration both virtually and geographically,

39
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,340
the cloud is able to get companies up and going quickly.

40
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,300
Most pricing models allow companies to pay for what they

41
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,100
use instead of a physical machine.

42
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,890
And as cloud service providers improved,

43
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:27,040
deploying an application to a new machine became as easy as a single click.

44
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,090
It's no surprise that the cloud grew as fast as it did.

45
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,010
It's especially popular with startups, enabling them to move quickly.

46
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:37,620
But enterprise companies are flocking to the cloud more and more.

47
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,640
Enterprise companies are finding a lot of value in the different

48
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,990
pricing model and the reduced liability when they don't have to

49
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:51,000
manage physical data centers. The cloud has truly solved the web application's biggest conundrum.
