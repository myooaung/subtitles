00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.170
So which collector should we use?

2
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.540
Well, as you can imagine, there's no easy answer to this question.

3
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.690
We've seen that Java offer a mixture of different garbage collectors from the

4
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.490
serial collector all the way through to the new G1 collector.

5
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.940
And it's not a simple job to pick one of these collectors.

6
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:19.400
There are many,

7
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.990
many articles on the web on profiling the application and picking the right

8
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.670
collector depending on that profile. You need to run the application when

9
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.040
you're testing it with as close to production load as possible and then use the

10
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.140
data from that to pick the garbage collector.

11
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.810
Ideally,

12
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.570
you'd run the test using many different garbage collectors and using the

13
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.190
many flags offered by the Java runtime. And finally,

14
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:53.000
just some references. There are some excellent Oracle references that talk about how these garbage collectors work.
