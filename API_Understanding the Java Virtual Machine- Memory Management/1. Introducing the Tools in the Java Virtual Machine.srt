Hi. My name is Kevin Jones,

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:08,250
and this is the Garbage Collection Tools chapter from the Understanding the Java

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,440
Virtual Machine Garbage Collection class from Pluralsight.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,420
In this chapter,

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,220
we take a look at a few of the ways we can monitor

6
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:19,640
garbage collection inside Java.

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,500
We look briefly at some of the management beans that are available, and then

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:34,000
we'll take a look at two of the tools that we can use to monitor GC, one called Jstat and one called VisualVM alongside Visual GC.
