Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:10,180
My name is Kevin Jones, and welcome to my course, Understanding

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,040
the Java Virtual Machine: Memory Management.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,420
I am a developer and owner at Rock Solid Knowledge, a software

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,770
development company based in the United Kingdom.

6
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:26,110
One of the core aspects of the Java virtual machine is memory management,

7
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,940
and it's important to understand how memory management works in Java if you

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,510
want your applications to perform as well as possible.

9
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,390
Java has different garbage collectors, and each behaves

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,630
differently and has different characteristics.

11
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,010
Some of the major topics we'll cover in this course include

12
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,640
understanding how the different garbage collectors work, understanding

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,060
Eden, survivor, and tenured spaces used by the garbage collector, see

14
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,540
the tools that you can use to monitor the garbage collector, and learn

15
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:59,170
how to interact with the garbage collector using reference classes and

16
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,430
the cleaner class.

17
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,750
By the end of this course,

18
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,770
you understand how the different garbage collector works in Java

19
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:09,040
and how to interact with the garbage collector.

20
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,630
Before beginning the course,

21
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:16,110
you should be familiar with the Java language. I hope you'll join me on this

22
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:29,000
journey to understand garbage collection with the Understanding the Java Virtual Machine: Memory Management course at Pluralsight.
