00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,940
[Autogenerated] the cost optimization pillar of the AWS.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:08,740
Well architected framework identifies five design principles.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,740
First, adopt a consumption model.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,140
Pay only for what you consume when you need it.

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,540
Second measure overall efficiency.

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,920
Measure the business output of your system and the

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,340
costs associated with delivering it.

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:28,740
Third, stop spending money on data center operations.

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,280
Let A W S do the heavy lifting of racking,

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,270
stacking and powering IT infrastructure so you can focus on

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,340
your customers and value added projects.

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,900
Fourth, analyze an attribute expenditure.

13
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,970
Identify the usage and cost of systems and what I T costs

14
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,740
are tied to different revenue streams.

15
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,990
Fifth, Use managed services to reduce cost of ownership.

16
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,940
There's several services that you need to just work in

17
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,440
order to get your actual work done.

18
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,840
These services usually involve a lot of undifferentiated heavy lifting.

19
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,700
By utilizing managed services that operate at cloud scale,

20
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,240
you lower your operational burden and get services at a

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,740
lower cost per unit than doing it yourself.

22
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,550
This can especially be true for things like redundant storage,

23
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,140
long term archival and email services.

24
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,870
The well architected framework also identifies four best practice areas for

25
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:30,340
cost optimization in the cloud expenditure awareness.

26
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:36,570
Cost effective resource is matching supply and demand and optimizing over time.

27
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,750
We've already covered several items from these four areas,

28
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,440
so we'll just highlights um, key actions you can take in each area.

29
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:49,440
Setting up your account with AWS organizations and utilizing tagging to

30
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,000
overlay business and organizational information onto billing and usage

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,670
data is extremely helpful to maintain cost awareness and properly

32
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,740
attribute costs for your operations.

33
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,570
Utilizing reports can do give proper visibility to

34
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,520
stakeholders and help them understand the differences

35
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,250
between cloud and on premises operations.

36
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,110
Actively defining the lifecycle for resource is and regular

37
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,630
cleanup ensures you don't have services.

38
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:21,700
Adding to your bill that you're not aware of several of the common

39
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:26,030
mistakes we discussed dealt with cost effective use of resource is

40
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:30,190
remember right size your resource is and understand the different

41
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,260
purchasing options for the services you're using.

42
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:37,830
Always explore managed services before doing it yourself to avoid

43
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,770
the undifferentiated heavy lifting that takes resource is away from

44
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,040
your core business value proposition.

45
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,810
Look for ways to optimize your data transfer through proper geographic selection

46
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,590
and utilizing services like cloudfront and direct Connect.

47
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,080
This could help ease some of the load on your compute resource is and

48
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,880
provide your customers with a better experience.

49
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,850
There are three main strategies you could take when it comes to

50
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:06,300
matching supply and demand first demand based.

51
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,800
This leverages that elasticity of clouds Resource is

52
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,780
where you can programmatically vary.

53
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,540
The amount of resource is dynamically based on demand.

54
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,700
Second, buffer based.

55
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,030
This leverages things like queues or streams to smooth out the demand on

56
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,950
consumers and handle less time sensitive loads with fewer.

57
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,940
Resource is third time based.

58
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,110
When you have a predictable, well defined demand,

59
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,940
you can scale resource is up and down based on time of day,

60
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,340
day of week and other time based parameters.

61
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:45,340
Cost optimization is an ongoing effort to measure, monitor and improve.

62
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,460
You're going to continually established goals and metrics.

63
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,870
Gather insight from available tools,

64
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,300
analyze the data and report and validate according

65
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,840
to your cost optimization goals.

66
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,850
Be sure to keep up on new features that affect your

67
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:03,540
services and how you purchase those services.

68
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,740
For example, new instance types are regularly added to easy to,

69
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:13,740
and savings plans were introduced several years after reserved instances.

70
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,420
Some of these new features can significantly affect

71
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:21,340
cost optimization for your AWS usage.

72
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:25,580
You've seen some common cost mistakes people make in their AWS accounts.

73
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,440
So you know what to avoid.

74
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,610
And you've learned about the tools AWS provides to

75
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,240
make cost optimization easier.

76
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,060
You know some additional cost benefits you can gain

77
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:41,070
from utilizing A W S organizations, and we've covered some key principles.

78
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:46,000
You can apply as you continually look for ways to optimize costs.

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,330
If you're using easy to instances,

80
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:52,840
it is essential that you understand how reserved and spot instances work.

81
00:04:52,840 --> 00:05:02,000
We'll take an in depth look at those in the next module, as well as other AWS services that offer a reserved pricing model.
