[Autogenerated] Hi, This is Craig Golightly,

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:07,440
and welcome to maintaining compliance.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,880
We're going to cover the shared responsibility model to understand what AWS is

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,480
responsible for when it comes to cloud security and compliance and what items

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,240
are your responsibility As a customer using AWS,

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,770
we'll cover AWS artifact, which is a great source.

7
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,500
AWS provides free of charge to give you the information you

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,150
need to meet your compliance guidelines.

9
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:36,800
Finally, we'll cover some tools you can use to limit and control access,

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,770
like password settings and service control policies or s.

11
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:40,990
C.

12
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,040
P s.

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,550
When we talk about shared responsibility, you can think of it like buying a car.

14
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:50,990
When you buy a car, you expect that certain things will work in a certain way.

15
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,500
For example, when you push on the gas pedal,

16
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,010
it'll go faster, and when you push on the brake,

17
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,740
it's going to slow down.

18
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,250
The car manufacturer guarantees that those things are going to

19
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,030
work according to a standard expectation.

20
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:04,880
However,

21
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,970
they have no control over how you're going to drive the

22
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,340
car once you get behind the wheel.

23
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,280
If you break the speed limit because you chose to go too fast,

24
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,130
you will be issued a ticket, not the manufacturer with a W s.

25
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:24,090
You can think of it as security of the cloud versus security.

26
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:30,690
In the cloud security of the cloud are those things that AWS is responsible for,

27
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,630
such as the Physical Data center, including physical security,

28
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:39,540
redundant power cooling and restricting access to authorized personnel.

29
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,190
Only the hardware.

30
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,980
Redundant physical systems to run the infrastructure.

31
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,110
Backup disks.

32
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:48,460
Proper disposal for out of service hard drives and regular

33
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,950
updates and maintenance for the equipment.

34
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,060
The software.

35
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,880
The underlying host operating systems that run virtual services.

36
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,050
Keeping them patched and up to date software systems used

37
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,340
by customers to interact with the cloud.

38
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,560
And networking sufficient redundant internet

39
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,280
connections to handle the traffic switches,

40
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,550
firewalls, routers,

41
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,620
cable and everything else necessary to move data into out of and

42
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,430
within data centers and customer networks,

43
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:20,340
as well as preventing attacks on that network infrastructure.

44
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,180
As an AWS customer,

45
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:27,280
you are responsible for proper configuration of the provided resource is,

46
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,540
for example, if you leave several ports wide open,

47
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,440
then your services could be compromised because of your configuration settings.

48
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,150
You must enforce strong credentials, especially on your route accounts,

49
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:43,960
utilizing things like multi factor authentication and password

50
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,390
policies to prevent compromise through weak credentials.

51
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,020
You also need to keep track of any access keys you issue and

52
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,640
monitor the use and rotation of such keys.

53
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,530
Your application must be secure.

54
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,820
Weakness in your application could expose.

55
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,540
Underlying resource is in your account,

56
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,800
avoiding things like embedding long term credentials in your

57
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,400
account and instead utilizing temporary credentials with STS can

58
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,520
help mitigate risks due to your application.

59
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,270
Finally,

60
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:21,140
what you do with customer data to ensure proper handling is your responsibility.

61
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,130
For example,

62
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:26,120
ensuring encryption both in transit and at rest is

63
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,440
something you have to choose to do.

64
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,170
AWS services offer many options for encrypting data,

65
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,440
but you have to use them in your handling of

66
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,240
customer data for them to be effective.

67
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,510
Here's a graphic that AWS has put together to detail

68
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,260
the shared responsibility model.

69
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:47,250
You can find it at AWS .NET amazon dot com slash compliance

70
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,580
slash shared dash responsibility Dash model.

71
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,900
You confined many different compliance related resource is

72
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,440
under the compliance pages of the AWS website.

73
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,240
Ultimately,

74
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:03,120
it is your compliance requirements that will determine how much or how little of

75
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,730
the AWS infrastructure and its various features you will utilize in your

76
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:11,540
application architecture er to meet those requirements.

77
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,920
Another great tool for compliance is A.

78
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,530
W s artifact.

79
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:20,440
This is a central resource to find compliance related information on demand.

80
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,120
You can Elektronik lee sign agreements you may need for

81
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,230
regulations like HIPPA or download audit reports for

82
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,850
various regulations like PC I and S O.

83
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:29,440
C.

84
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,750
Users will need certain I am permissions to accept agreements.

85
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,540
So be sure to work with representatives from your legal

86
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:42,000
department to understand what you need to demonstrate compliance for your organization.
