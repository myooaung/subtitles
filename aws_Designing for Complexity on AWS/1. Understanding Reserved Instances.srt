[Autogenerated] Hi.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:08,750
This is Craig Golightly and welcome to reserved instances and spots reserved.

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:12,440
Easy to instances can help you in two main ways.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,440
First, price reserved instances.

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,940
Can do have a significant cost savings over on demand instances.

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:25,470
Second capacity reserved instances guarantee you capacity for a certain

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,540
instantiate type in the availability zone you have reserved.

8
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,510
You may have received the insufficient instance capacity

9
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,610
message when launching an instance,

10
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,330
meaning that AWS doesn't have enough on demand capacity

11
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,650
in that particular availability zone.

12
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,150
To service the request with reserved instances,

13
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,200
you're guaranteed to have instances available for the term of the

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,940
agreement When you specify and availability zone.

15
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:57,580
A reserved instance isn't actually an instance, but it's an agreement with AWS.

16
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,920
The first part of the agreement has to do with the instance itself,

17
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,150
specifically instantiate type.

18
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:07,910
For example, M five large the region where the instance will run,

19
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,320
for example, US East one.

20
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,010
The tendency of the instantiate er shared or dedicated,

21
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,190
and the operating system, for example, Linux or windows.

22
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:21,260
The second part of the agreement is a term commitment.

23
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:25,340
How long are you going to commit to use these instantiate You're reserving?

24
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,190
You can specify.

25
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:31,440
One year or three years with a three year commitment getting a larger discount.

26
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,930
The third part of the agreement is the payment option.

27
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,920
You can pay for everything up front and not be billed for

28
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,670
the rest of the term for that instance, partial up front,

29
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,350
where you pay some upfront cost than the rest at an hourly

30
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,350
rate throughout the term or no upfront,

31
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:52,040
where you're just build an hourly rate throughout the term.

32
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,040
Once you have a reserved instance agreement in place,

33
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,530
then the reserved instance rate will apply to instances that match the

34
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,140
criteria of the reserved instances you have purchased.

35
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,100
For example,

36
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,320
suppose you have four M five large Linux instances running on

37
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,590
shared hardware in the US East one region.

38
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,100
Suppose that the on demand price for these instances is 10 cents an hour.

39
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,640
This configuration would cost you 40 cents an hour.

40
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,000
Let's say you purchased two reserved instance contracts that

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,510
apply to M five large Linux instances running on shared

42
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,340
hardware in the US East one region.

43
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,440
Suppose the hourly rate for those works out to be five cents an hour.

44
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,240
In this case,

45
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,200
your bill for an hour would show two instances at the

46
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,210
reserved rate of five cents an hour and two instances at the

47
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:45,140
on demand rate of 10 cents an hour, for a total of 30 cents an hour.

48
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,610
If you terminated two of those instances,

49
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,380
then you would just be charged for two instances at the

50
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:55,030
reserve rate of five cents an hour, for a total of 10 cents an hour.

51
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,500
Note that the reserved instance rate isn't tied to a specific.

52
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:58,880
Easy.

53
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,640
To instance, when we terminated two of the four instances,

54
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,460
then the reserved instance rate was simply applied to the next

55
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,440
running instantiate that matches the contract.

56
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,970
The other thing to be aware of is that you are being charged what amounts

57
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:16,580
to a reduced hourly rate for your reserved instances,

58
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,940
whether or not you are using any instances.

59
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,860
So if you had to reserved instance contracts that

60
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,890
were not running any instances,

61
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:29,600
you would still be charged for the two reserved instance contracts,

62
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,440
or 10 cents an hour.

63
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,450
Traditional reserved instances are designed to offset the cost of workloads

64
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:38,480
that you know are going to be running all of the time.

65
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,040
There are some additional options you can apply to reserved

66
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,340
instances to give you more flexibility.

67
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,370
Scheduled reserved instances allow you to choose a

68
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,980
reservation that Rikers on a daily,

69
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,090
weekly or monthly basis with a start time and duration.

70
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:58,310
You are then charged a discounted rate for instances during that window.

71
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,200
This could be a good option for reports or batch processing that happens on a

72
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,940
regular interval but does not need to run all of the time.

73
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,470
Scheduled reserved instances are only available for certain instance types,

74
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,390
so you want to check out the AWS documentation for the

75
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,840
latest details before setting that up.

76
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,630
Standard reserved instances allow you to modify instant size during the term.

77
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:25,690
For example, from M five large to M five extra large convertible.

78
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,850
Reserved instances allow you to exchange for another

79
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,570
convertible reserved instance,

80
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:35,940
and change things like instantiate yam lee type platform scope or tendency.

81
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,310
If you think you want to get into convertible reserved instances,

82
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,920
be sure to read the AWS documentation for important details.

83
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,640
When using this option,

84
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,830
a regional reserved instance will apply the discount for the

85
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,050
instance in any availability zone of a region where,

86
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,950
as a zonal reserved instance,

87
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:57,940
will only apply to instances running in a specific availability zone.

88
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,240
Note.

89
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,940
that regional reserved instances do not guarantee a capacity reservation.

90
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:11,000
So if your main use case is to ensure capacity, then be sure you are setting up zonal, reserved instances.
