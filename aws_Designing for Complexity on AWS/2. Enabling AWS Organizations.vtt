00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.190
W s organizations allows you to link multiple AWS accounts to

3
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.930
consolidate billing and cost reporting.

4
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.240
You can also share re sources such as reserved instances and other cost

5
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.280
optimization as well as share common I am policies and other access

6
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.510
control and compliance strategies across accounts.

7
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.830
Setting up in A W s organization and adding accounts is easy.

8
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.940
And best of all, it's free.

9
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.340
There's no extra charge to use AWS organizations.

10
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.660
Please note that you need to protect your route accounts,

11
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.960
especially the master account for your organization.

12
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.040
General security practice is like using a secrets manager

13
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.450
generating a strong random password,

14
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.530
at least 20 characters in length and enabling multi

15
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.630
factor authentication or M F.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.640
A will help keep your account safe.

17
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.740
Please view the designing for advanced security within AWS

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.620
course for more details on what steps you should take to fully

19
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.940
locked down your route accounts.

20
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.490
Let's go to the AWS console and log in as the root user of the account.

21
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.940
We want to be the master account of the organization and create an organization.

22
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.040
I've logged into this AWS account as the root user,

23
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.940
select the username,

24
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:31.140
then select my organization this is the AWS organization's page

25
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.470
select Create Organization to enable AWS organizations and make this

26
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.640
current account the Route Master account.

27
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.770
There are two different options when creating an organization.

28
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.800
The one is the full organization package.

29
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.920
Alternatively,

30
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.420
you can create an organization that only consolidates billing to take

31
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.410
advantage of a lot of the features we want to demonstrate.

32
00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.800
We're going to do the full organization once A W S

33
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.760
organizations has initialized.

34
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:10.000
For this account, you'll see an account ID and the email for the root user of the master account.
