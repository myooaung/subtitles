1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,150
[Autogenerated] Now that you've enabled organizations,

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:09,040
you can start adding other AWS accounts as member accounts in your organization,

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,050
you can add an existing account or create a new account.

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,910
When you add an existing account,

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,830
it will send an invitation to the root user of that account who will need to

6
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,630
accept the invitation in order to join the organization.

7
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,180
When you create a new account,

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,150
it is automatically added to your organization by default.

9
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:34,650
Your organization has a root and all accounts start out assigned to the route.

10
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,950
You can use organizational units to structure and group

11
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,930
accounts within your AWS organization.

12
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:48,040
Organizational units can also contain other organizational units.

13
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,640
Let's go add a couple of member accounts to our AWS organization,

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,900
will create a new account and also invite an existing

15
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,110
account to join the organization.

16
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:02,030
Then we'll create some organizational units to see that process and

17
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:06,040
add a member account to an organizational unit.

18
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,780
Let's add a new member account to the organization,

19
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:16,940
select add account and will first create an AWS account in this organization.

20
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:22,870
Enter a name for this AWS account, an email that is globally unique.

21
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:23,860
In other words,

22
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:27,200
it can't already be associate ID with another AWS

23
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,270
account and for the I am role name.

24
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,270
When you create a new member account in your organization,

25
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:39,800
these organization account access role is automatically added by a W S.

26
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:45,140
This allows you full control of the member account from the master account.

27
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,380
Once that's all filled in, go ahead and click create.

28
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:52,150
Then after a minute you'll see the new account that was created.

29
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,140
You might be asking.

30
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,060
So how in the world do I log into that account?

31
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,540
We never set a password.

32
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,320
In order to access the account that you just created,

33
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,570
you need to log out,

34
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:06,340
then log in using the root user email of the account you created

35
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,640
in this case test plus one at sea that go com.

36
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,940
I'll go ahead and log out of my master account,

37
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,930
then log in using the member account.

38
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,480
At this point, we never set a password,

39
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,440
so go ahead and use the forgot password link.

40
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,240
Solve the puzzle, then check your email for the password.

41
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,790
Reset instructions.

42
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:34,240
You should also see a welcome email for that account that you created.

43
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,930
We'll click the password reset link,

44
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,450
then set a password for the root user of this new

45
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:43,640
member account in our AWS organization.

46
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,410
Remember,

47
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:47,710
you should be using a secrets manager with a randomly

48
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:51,640
generated password at least 20 characters long.

49
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,720
Now you can sign in to your account here,

50
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,670
we can see our newly created member account.

51
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,240
That's part of our AWS organization.

52
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,800
We won't do anything else in this account for now,

53
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,080
as this demo was mainly just to see how to create a new

54
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,480
account inside of your organization.

55
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,120
Let's go back to our master account and invite an

56
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,340
existing account to join our organization.

57
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:16,550
Well,

58
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:23,740
log out of the member account and log back into the master account

59
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:28,650
will go to AWS organizations we can CR two accounts.

60
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,540
Let's add another one.

61
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,070
This time we'll select invite account.

62
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:37,340
I've opened a different AWS account already with a different route user,

63
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,140
so we'll invite that one to join our organization.

64
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,250
If you have a new AWS account,

65
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,890
you'll need to verify your email address before you're able to

66
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:50,640
invite other accounts to join your organization.

67
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,230
Once you verified the email address of the master account,

68
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,720
you can try again with the invitation.

69
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,300
I'll enter the email of the root user for the account that

70
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,590
I want to invite to the organization.

71
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:07,640
You can add some notes, then click invite.

72
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,870
The invitation will show up under the invitations tab.

73
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,960
If you're managing multiple invitations,

74
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,760
this helps you see the status of those invitations.

75
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,940
And when they're going to expire,

76
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,050
the root user of the account that you're inviting will get an email like this

77
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:25,800
explaining that they've been invited to join the organization.

78
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,940
They can then log in to their AWS console to view the invitation.

79
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,560
Here is the invitation in the account that you would

80
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,810
like to join your organization.

81
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:39,060
Notice how it lists the master account name and email and the requested

82
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,670
controls that the master account will have over this account.

83
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,620
If you join, I'll go ahead and click.

84
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:50,080
Accept confirmed the action and receive the confirmation

85
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,860
notice that the member account can choose to leave the

86
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,790
organization back in the master account.

87
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,830
If we refreshed the invitations, we can see,

88
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,640
the account has accepted the invitation.

89
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:01,870
Now,

90
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,670
when we go to accounts we can see the account that was

91
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:07,400
created and the account that joined.

92
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,250
Let's create some organizational units and place these

93
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,650
accounts in those organizational units.

94
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,040
Go to organize accounts.

95
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,110
Then select new organizational unit.

96
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:27,080
Let's make a sales global app one then inside of the sales organizational unit.

97
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,370
Let's create a customer One organizational unit to do that,

98
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,440
select the sails unit,

99
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,260
then select new organizational unit Notice This will nest the customer One

100
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,950
organizational unit under the sales organizational unit.

101
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:47,220
If we go back to route we can, see the three accounts Member one,

102
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,990
which is one of our member accounts test to which is the other member account.

103
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:57,040
Then demo, which is the master account denoted by the star.

104
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,510
If I select member one than organizational units we can,

105
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:04,040
see that it is not currently assigned.

106
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:11,740
Select move and I'll go ahead and put this one in global app one.

107
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:19,140
Let's also move test to into the customer One organizational unit.

108
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:23,940
Now, when we select those organizational units we can see the account listed,

109
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:30,440
we select global app one we see the other member account.

110
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:30,610
A.

111
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,990
W s organizations are a great feature to help you avoid the problems

112
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,880
Globomantics experienced when they started using AWS.

113
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,730
They're easy to create and free to use.

114
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:45,830
You now know how to add accounts to an organization both new and

115
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:50,000
existing and you've seen how organizational units can help you

116
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,840
structure the member accounts within your organization,

117
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,800
join me in the next module to learn about using I am users,

118
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,450
groups,

119
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:06,000
policies and roles and see how you can manage user access and permissions in your member accounts.
