00:00:01,220  -->  00:00:02,441
Hello, everyone.
In this lecture,
2

2

00:00:02,441  -->  00:00:04,961
we'll be going over sampling techniques.
3

3

00:00:04,961  -->  00:00:07,797
So this is a little more
of a nebulous topic and
4

4

00:00:07,797  -->  00:00:12,720
it doesn't have to do too much
with direct Python programming.
5

5

00:00:12,720  -->  00:00:16,050
And it's mostly just text and
some equations, so
6

6

00:00:16,050  -->  00:00:21,780
feel free to just check
out the nbviewer link and
7

7

00:00:21,780  -->  00:00:27,505
just learn more about basics,
sampling techniques by reading over this.
8

8

00:00:27,505  -->  00:00:29,750
So I'm just gonna do a quick overview, but
9

9

00:00:29,750  -->  00:00:33,630
I won't be reading everything here since
you can just read that on your own.
10

10

00:00:34,740  -->  00:00:38,276
So sampling theory is the study
of relationships existing between
11

11

00:00:38,276  -->  00:00:41,381
a population and
the samples drawn from that population.
12

12

00:00:41,381  -->  00:00:46,324
So for example, your population can be the
entire United States while the sample may
13

13

00:00:46,324  -->  00:00:51,267
be 1,000 people you pulled for a survey
and we'll make sampling techniques and
14

14

00:00:51,267  -->  00:00:51,971
theories.
15

15

00:00:51,971  -->  00:00:57,655
So important is you wanna
know what the relationship
16

16

00:00:57,655  -->  00:01:04,381
is between the sample you took and
the rest of the population.
17

17

00:01:04,381  -->  00:01:08,941
So, one type of a question you can ask
pertaining to sample theory is whether
18

18

00:01:08,941  -->  00:01:11,801
the observed difference
between two samples.
19

19

00:01:11,801  -->  00:01:14,611
So, if you took two polls or two surveys.
20

20

00:01:14,611  -->  00:01:18,870
If there was a difference
between those two samples,
21

21

00:01:18,870  -->  00:01:22,844
what are the chances that
it's due to variation or
22

22

00:01:22,844  -->  00:01:26,170
if it's significant due to statistics.
23

23

00:01:27,410  -->  00:01:30,464
So these are sometimes known
as tests of significance and
24

24

00:01:30,464  -->  00:01:33,911
we'll talk about about them later
in another Python Notebook.
25

25

00:01:33,911  -->  00:01:37,321
So just a quick overview of the topics for
sampling techniques.
26

26

00:01:37,321  -->  00:01:41,440
There's random samples and numbers.
27

27

00:01:41,440  -->  00:01:45,048
So samples are chosen, so
they're representative of a population and
28

28

00:01:45,048  -->  00:01:47,341
one method of doing this
is random sampling.
29

29

00:01:47,341  -->  00:01:55,990
And you just do this by grabbing
random members of that population.
30

30

00:01:55,990  -->  00:01:58,655
So, it can be as simple
picking names from a hat or
31

31

00:01:58,655  -->  00:02:00,931
using pseudorandom number generators.
32

32

00:02:00,931  -->  00:02:03,806
If you wanna learn more about that and
33

33

00:02:03,806  -->  00:02:09,570
how Python does its own random stuff,
you can look at the documentation.
34

34

00:02:09,570  -->  00:02:11,140
There's a link about it here.
35

35

00:02:13,410  -->  00:02:17,000
You can also do sampling with and
without replacement.
36

36

00:02:17,000  -->  00:02:20,071
So if you're drawing samples without
replacement from a finite source of
37

37

00:02:20,071  -->  00:02:22,160
samples, that's considered
finite sampling.
38

38

00:02:22,160  -->  00:02:25,951
But if your drawing samples from
a finite source with replacement,
39

39

00:02:25,951  -->  00:02:27,821
you can consider that infinite.
40

40

00:02:27,821  -->  00:02:32,850
So an example of that would be
tossing a coin n number of times, but
41

41

00:02:32,850  -->  00:02:37,891
you're basically replacing it,
cuz you keep tossing the coin.
42

42

00:02:37,891  -->  00:02:40,821
So there's infinite number
of possibilities of series.
43

43

00:02:40,821  -->  00:02:43,151
Great.
44

44

00:02:43,151  -->  00:02:46,451
Another one you can do is just
the sampling distribution of means.
45

45

00:02:46,451  -->  00:02:51,089
So if you draw N samples from
a finite population of Np samples,
46

46

00:02:51,089  -->  00:02:54,763
where the Np is the greater
than your sample of N and
47

47

00:02:54,763  -->  00:03:00,381
then you can add specific means and
standard deviations denoted like this.
48

48

00:03:00,381  -->  00:03:02,413
And that just relates the mean and
49

49

00:03:02,413  -->  00:03:07,141
standard deviation taken out of your
sample to the total sample population.
50

50

00:03:07,141  -->  00:03:10,631
So like we said before,
your sample survey and
51

51

00:03:10,631  -->  00:03:15,379
you can relate that now to
the population of the United States.
52

52

00:03:16,780  -->  00:03:19,181
And you can also do sampling
distributions of proportions.
53

53

00:03:19,181  -->  00:03:24,197
So if the population is infinite and the
probability of success is denoted as p and
54

54

00:03:24,197  -->  00:03:27,145
the probability of failure
is q equal to 1- p,
55

55

00:03:27,145  -->  00:03:32,091
just like in a binomial distribution,
you condense the sampling distribution
56

56

00:03:32,091  -->  00:03:36,486
of proportions has mean and
standard deviation that looks like this.
57

57

00:03:40,331  -->  00:03:44,061
And then sampling distribution
of differences and sums.
58

58

00:03:44,061  -->  00:03:47,521
So if you're given two sample
populations N1 and N2,
59

59

00:03:47,521  -->  00:03:51,270
both of which happen to
be normally distributed.
60

60

00:03:51,270  -->  00:03:54,480
You can obtain the mean and standard
deviation of the sampling distribution
61

61

00:03:54,480  -->  00:03:57,400
of differences or
sums between the two statistics.
62

62

00:03:59,310  -->  00:04:01,524
So for differences of statistics,
63

63

00:04:01,524  -->  00:04:06,111
your means will be the differences in
the means of both statistical sets.
64

64

00:04:06,111  -->  00:04:11,109
Well, your standard deviation will be the
square root of the sum of the squares of
65

65

00:04:11,109  -->  00:04:12,961
those standard deviations.
66

66

00:04:12,961  -->  00:04:17,471
If you're looking at the sum, then it's
actually going to be the sum of the means,
67

67

00:04:17,471  -->  00:04:20,381
but standard deviation will
follow the same method.
68

68

00:04:20,381  -->  00:04:23,761
So this is just a very quick,
I know I went through this quickly.
69

69

00:04:23,761  -->  00:04:26,270
But really, just take the time and
read this yourself.
70

70

00:04:27,370  -->  00:04:30,020
This is very, just a heavily statistical
71

71

00:04:32,070  -->  00:04:36,070
analysis of techniques,
especially sample techniques.
72

72

00:04:36,070  -->  00:04:39,590
You can go ahead and find out more
by checking out Wikipedia here,
73

73

00:04:39,590  -->  00:04:41,961
just this link on sampling distributions.
74

74

00:04:41,961  -->  00:04:45,161
Yeah, so go ahead and
take the time to read through that.
75

75

00:04:45,161  -->  00:04:46,461
There's a lot of information here.
76

76

00:04:46,461  -->  00:04:48,113
And then check out the last link,
77

77

00:04:48,113  -->  00:04:51,951
if you have continued interest in
sampling theory and sampling techniques.
78

78

00:04:51,951  -->  00:04:53,940
Thanks.
