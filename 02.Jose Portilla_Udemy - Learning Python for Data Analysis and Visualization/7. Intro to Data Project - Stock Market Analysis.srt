00:00:03,050  -->  00:00:08,050
Hello, everyone, and welcome to this quick
introduction to the second data project.
2

2

00:00:08,050  -->  00:00:13,190
This data project will be going over
stock market analysis techniques.
3

3

00:00:13,190  -->  00:00:16,010
Okay, so as always,
you can just go ahead and
4

4

00:00:16,010  -->  00:00:22,270
go to nbviewer, and go ahead and
type in jmportilla.
5

5

00:00:22,270  -->  00:00:23,640
That's my GitHub account name.
6

6

00:00:23,640  -->  00:00:28,280
And then go to udemy notes, and
7

7

00:00:28,280  -->  00:00:31,670
you'll come to the page where you can
always see the IPython notebooks.
8

8

00:00:33,010  -->  00:00:36,940
And then you can click on right here
data projects stock market analysis,
9

9

00:00:36,940  -->  00:00:38,170
let me go ahead and zoom in a little bit.
10

10

00:00:40,360  -->  00:00:45,330
Here we go.
And then you'll see a completed
11

11

00:00:45,330  -->  00:00:48,495
IPython notebook for
you to go ahead and check out.
12

12

00:00:48,495  -->  00:00:52,710
So, there's a lot of stuff here,
we're going to do a quick run down of it.
13

13

00:00:52,710  -->  00:00:56,280
And then in the rest of the videos we'll
actually go programming step by step.
14

14

00:00:56,280  -->  00:00:58,670
So you can either watch the videos or
go ahead and
15

15

00:00:58,670  -->  00:01:00,789
just read along with the IPython
notebook on your own.
16

16

00:01:02,600  -->  00:01:06,350
So, in this data project we're
gonna be looking at a portfolio
17

17

00:01:06,350  -->  00:01:11,100
of technology stocks, we're gonna be able
to use pandas to get stock information,
18

18

00:01:11,100  -->  00:01:14,510
visualize different aspects of it, and
then we'll even look at different ways of
19

19

00:01:14,510  -->  00:01:17,790
analyzing the risk of the stock,
based on previous performance history.
20

20

00:01:17,790  -->  00:01:22,440
And we'll be using Monte Carlo
techniques to predict stock prices.
21

21

00:01:22,440  -->  00:01:24,870
So it should be a really great,
interesting project.
22

22

00:01:24,870  -->  00:01:26,930
We'll be answering a couple of
key questions along the way.
23

23

00:01:26,930  -->  00:01:28,490
You can check those out later.
24

24

00:01:30,070  -->  00:01:33,630
And so we'll be using Pandas to get some
stock information as you can see here.
25

25

00:01:35,260  -->  00:01:39,840
Then we'll be analyzing the closing
prices, the volume being traded of
26

26

00:01:39,840  -->  00:01:44,480
certain stocks, in this case this is Apple
technology stock or the Apple company.
27

27

00:01:47,050  -->  00:01:49,580
We will also be looking
at moving averages.
28

28

00:01:49,580  -->  00:01:51,290
Next, we will look at
daily return analysis.
29

29

00:01:51,290  -->  00:01:53,760
This is a really interesting
thing we will check out later.
30

30

00:01:54,950  -->  00:01:58,902
Basically, your daily
returns on your stock, so
31

31

00:01:58,902  -->  00:02:02,958
whether you'll lose or
gain on average everyday.
32

32

00:02:04,358  -->  00:02:07,473
And then after that we'll look at a little
bit of correlation between different
33

33

00:02:07,473  -->  00:02:08,318
technology stocks.
34

34

00:02:09,859  -->  00:02:12,015
And then we'll learn
about Correlation again.
35

35

00:02:12,015  -->  00:02:14,855
And then we'll see how to use pair
36

36

00:02:14,855  -->  00:02:17,305
plot with cborn to get some
really nice correlation plots.
37

37

00:02:17,305  -->  00:02:22,295
You can see them here, and
we'll go over all of this
38

38

00:02:22,295  -->  00:02:26,820
in the following videos, and
here's another correlation plot.
39

39

00:02:26,820  -->  00:02:29,800
And then we're gonna do some
risk analysis on some stocks.
40

40

00:02:30,830  -->  00:02:33,440
So we'll plot up difference
here we're comparing risk and
41

41

00:02:33,440  -->  00:02:37,260
expected returns of Google, Microsoft,
Amazon and Apple, different technology
42

42

00:02:37,260  -->  00:02:41,985
stocks, and then we'll use two different
methods to analyze a specific stock.
43

43

00:02:44,795  -->  00:02:47,115
Great, and
then we'll do the Monte Carlo techniques
44

44

00:02:48,525  -->  00:02:50,585
to simulate some future stock prices.
45

45

00:02:50,585  -->  00:02:51,655
You can see them here.
46

46

00:02:51,655  -->  00:02:52,515
This is for Google.
47

47

00:02:54,680  -->  00:02:57,800
And then we'll get a risk
analysis on that stock.
48

48

00:02:59,200  -->  00:03:00,630
Okay, great.
49

49

00:03:00,630  -->  00:03:04,230
So go ahead and you have the option
of either just checking out this
50

50

00:03:04,230  -->  00:03:08,700
IPython notebook on your own or following
along with the next sequence of videos for
51

51

00:03:08,700  -->  00:03:10,180
the Data Project.
52

52

00:03:10,180  -->  00:03:11,780
Okay, thanks a lot.
53

53

00:03:11,780  -->  00:03:12,330
I'll see you there.
