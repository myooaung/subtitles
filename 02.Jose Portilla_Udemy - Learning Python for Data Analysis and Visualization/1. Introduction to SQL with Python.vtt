00:00:02.090  -->  00:00:06.470
Hello everyone, and welcome to
an Introduction to SQL with Python.
2

2

00:00:06.470  -->  00:00:07.754
In this appendix,
3

3

00:00:07.754  -->  00:00:12.340
we're just gonna be going over how
to use SQL in Python with Pandas.
4

4

00:00:12.340  -->  00:00:15.090
So, this is just a first IPython notebook.
5

5

00:00:15.090  -->  00:00:19.086
If you want to get to the viewer
of this IPython notebook,
6

6

00:00:19.086  -->  00:00:21.760
just go to nbviewer.IPython.org.
7

7

00:00:21.760  -->  00:00:26.411
Look up jmportilla, and
if you click Go here,
8

8

00:00:26.411  -->  00:00:30.840
you can click then SQL, or SQL-Appendix.
9

9

00:00:30.840  -->  00:00:34.080
It will take you to
the current notebooks to see.
10

10

00:00:34.080  -->  00:00:36.450
And then right now,
we're on Introduction to SQL with Python.
11

11

00:00:38.240  -->  00:00:41.890
So, in this notebook and video,
I'll just be showing you what you're
12

12

00:00:41.890  -->  00:00:45.510
gonna need to download and
how to use what we download.
13

13

00:00:45.510  -->  00:00:49.107
So, just a quick disclaimer, there's
lots of ways to browse through a SQL,
14

14

00:00:49.107  -->  00:00:51.140
or SQL database.
15

15

00:00:51.140  -->  00:00:56.237
Throughout this appendix, we're only
gonna be focusing on learning about SQL
16

16

00:00:56.237  -->  00:01:01.130
queries using a combination of
Python Pandas, and SQLite and SQL Alchemy.
17

17

00:01:01.130  -->  00:01:04.800
So, this is kind of a specific way to
operate for SQL database and it may or
18

18

00:01:04.800  -->  00:01:07.460
may not fit your other general needs.
19

19

00:01:07.460  -->  00:01:09.170
So, just keep that in mind.
20

20

00:01:09.170  -->  00:01:12.387
And, to fully understand
the content of this appendix,
21

21

00:01:12.387  -->  00:01:15.880
I suggest you complete the course
up to at least Lecture 28.
22

22

00:01:15.880  -->  00:01:20.128
Although, I really recommend completing
up to Lecture 46 to get the most out of
23

23

00:01:20.128  -->  00:01:21.010
this appendix.
24

24

00:01:21.010  -->  00:01:24.279
So, beginning of what you're
gonna need to download,
25

25

00:01:24.279  -->  00:01:26.930
you're gonna need to download SQL Alchemy.
26

26

00:01:26.930  -->  00:01:32.265
So, you can either click the link and
it'll take you to this page,
27

27

00:01:32.265  -->  00:01:36.651
SQL Alchemy and
you can click the download links here,
28

28

00:01:36.651  -->  00:01:39.338
or you can use your command line.
29

29

00:01:39.338  -->  00:01:42.473
So, if you use your Anaconda command line,
30

30

00:01:42.473  -->  00:01:48.510
you can just type conda install sqlalchemy
right here, conda install sqlalchemy.
31

31

00:01:48.510  -->  00:01:52.191
If you're using a different
distribution of Python,
32

32

00:01:52.191  -->  00:01:57.720
you can also install it using pip install
sqlalchemy in your command line as well.
33

33

00:01:57.720  -->  00:02:03.220
After that, you're gonna want
to install the SQLite Browser.
34

34

00:02:03.220  -->  00:02:07.880
So, I also included a link
of 10 other free browsers.
35

35

00:02:07.880  -->  00:02:12.010
I'm going to be using SQLite Browser just
because it's light weight and free to use.
36

36

00:02:12.010  -->  00:02:16.090
So, you can download SQLite Browser
at this link right here.
37

37

00:02:16.090  -->  00:02:17.590
Should take you here.
38

38

00:02:17.590  -->  00:02:20.460
It's the database browser for SQLite.
39

39

00:02:20.460  -->  00:02:21.670
It's free.
It's open source.
40

40

00:02:21.670  -->  00:02:23.600
So, you can check it out.
41

41

00:02:23.600  -->  00:02:29.060
Once you've downloaded it, go ahead and
then download the sakila Database.
42

42

00:02:29.060  -->  00:02:32.170
So, this is just a sample
database we're gonna be
43

43

00:02:32.170  -->  00:02:34.100
messing around with and learning with.
44

44

00:02:34.100  -->  00:02:37.840
You can download the fully constructed
database here at this link.
45

45

00:02:37.840  -->  00:02:40.530
That link will take you
to this Dropbox page.
46

46

00:02:40.530  -->  00:02:41.630
You can just download.
47

47

00:02:41.630  -->  00:02:45.760
The file's about 5.67 megabytes.
48

48

00:02:45.760  -->  00:02:50.320
Once you've done that,
there's other ways to get the database.
49

49

00:02:50.320  -->  00:02:54.130
You can construct the .sql file
yourself by clicking on this link.
50

50

00:02:54.130  -->  00:02:56.400
If you don't know what that means,
don't worry about it.
51

51

00:02:56.400  -->  00:03:00.113
You can just download the fully
constructed database off that Dropbox
52

52

00:03:00.113  -->  00:03:00.760
link.
53

53

00:03:00.760  -->  00:03:02.170
Either way, once you have it,
54

54

00:03:02.170  -->  00:03:05.200
save it to the same directory
as your IPython notebooks.
55

55

00:03:05.200  -->  00:03:07.390
Or remember the complete file path for
later.
56

56

00:03:07.390  -->  00:03:10.040
So, we can tell panda
exactly where to look for it.
57

57

00:03:10.040  -->  00:03:11.030
Great.
58

58

00:03:11.030  -->  00:03:12.840
So, once you've done those three steps,
59

59

00:03:12.840  -->  00:03:17.935
you should have everything you need before
diving into working with Python and SQL.
60

60

00:03:19.420  -->  00:03:22.210
So, there's different ways to check out
61

61

00:03:22.210  -->  00:03:24.540
the database we're going
to be working with.
62

62

00:03:24.540  -->  00:03:27.050
You can open it up using SQLite Browser.
63

63

00:03:27.050  -->  00:03:29.222
So, if I open up
SQLite Browser right now for
64

64

00:03:29.222  -->  00:03:34.470
you guys, it'll look something like this.
65

65

00:03:34.470  -->  00:03:39.087
And I can open the database, and
66

66

00:03:39.087  -->  00:03:44.130
right now, I have it under sakila or
sakila, however you want to say it.
67

67

00:03:44.130  -->  00:03:47.720
And this is what the database looks
like using the SQLite Browser.
68

68

00:03:47.720  -->  00:03:50.035
So, if you browse the data,
69

69

00:03:50.035  -->  00:03:54.670
you can just basically have
a really nice GUI here or GUI.
70

70

00:03:54.670  -->  00:03:57.800
We're looking at the columns and
what the data looks like.
71

71

00:03:57.800  -->  00:04:02.260
You can think of this database as just
a bunch of linked spreadsheet tables.
72

72

00:04:02.260  -->  00:04:08.470
So, in this specific database,
it's basically a rental video database.
73

73

00:04:08.470  -->  00:04:11.840
It's a really common tutorial database for
learning MySQL.
74

74

00:04:11.840  -->  00:04:17.110
So, we'll be using it to learn how
to use SQL with pandas and Python.
75

75

00:04:17.110  -->  00:04:20.380
So, you can see here a list of films,
their titles, their descriptions,
76

76

00:04:20.380  -->  00:04:23.160
their release years,
etc etc, their ratings.
77

77

00:04:23.160  -->  00:04:26.310
And you can go ahead and
browse the database visually using that.
78

78

00:04:27.990  -->  00:04:29.210
So, I'll go ahead and close that now.
79

79

00:04:30.780  -->  00:04:35.360
There's also a nice diagram online
of what the database looks like.
80

80

00:04:35.360  -->  00:04:39.170
I've posted it here in the notebook,
but the diagram is very big, so
81

81

00:04:39.170  -->  00:04:42.200
I suggest you click this diagram link.
82

82

00:04:42.200  -->  00:04:44.633
It'll take you to this page here, and
83

83

00:04:44.633  -->  00:04:48.220
here you can see how all
the tables are linked together.
84

84

00:04:48.220  -->  00:04:50.970
So, you have four main databases.
85

85

00:04:50.970  -->  00:04:55.661
You have the customer data, the inventory
data, and then your business and
86

86

00:04:55.661  -->  00:04:56.400
the views.
87

87

00:04:57.990  -->  00:05:00.710
So, three main databases, sorry.
88

88

00:05:00.710  -->  00:05:02.500
And you can see how each
table is connected.
89

89

00:05:02.500  -->  00:05:05.983
So, you have in your customer data the
cities, the countries, their addresses,
90

90

00:05:05.983  -->  00:05:08.270
and then you have their customer table.
91

91

00:05:08.270  -->  00:05:10.940
And how that is linked to some
business data such as your staff,
92

92

00:05:10.940  -->  00:05:14.140
your store, your payments and
your rentals.
93

93

00:05:14.140  -->  00:05:17.590
And that's all connected to your
inventory, to your film, and
94

94

00:05:17.590  -->  00:05:23.170
that's connected to film category
languages, inventory, actors and text.
95

95

00:05:23.170  -->  00:05:24.610
Category and film text as well.
96

96

00:05:25.950  -->  00:05:27.080
So, go ahead and check that out.
97

97

00:05:27.080  -->  00:05:30.590
If you ever need a big overview of
the database that you're working with.
98

98

00:05:33.920  -->  00:05:37.890
And here it is as well, as an overview.
99

99

00:05:37.890  -->  00:05:42.575
So, Python comes with SQLite3,
which provides a light weight
100

100

00:05:42.575  -->  00:05:46.710
disk-based database that doesn't
require a separate server process.
101

101

00:05:46.710  -->  00:05:49.210
It's useful for
prototyping with SQLite, and
102

102

00:05:49.210  -->  00:05:53.730
then you can port it to a larger
database system like MySQL.
103

103

00:05:53.730  -->  00:05:58.670
So, Python also comes with a nice
module to work with SQL and SQLite.
104

104

00:05:58.670  -->  00:06:00.230
So, the module is called SQLite3.
105

105

00:06:01.420  -->  00:06:05.410
So, you can either just follow along
with the NB Viewer notebook or
106

106

00:06:05.410  -->  00:06:06.500
type this out yourself.
107

107

00:06:06.500  -->  00:06:08.710
I won't be doing any live coding for
108

108

00:06:08.710  -->  00:06:12.340
this appendix because there's a lot of
stuff to write down and that's a markdown.
109

109

00:06:13.370  -->  00:06:17.480
So, for all the notebooks that
we're gonna be using for SQL,
110

110

00:06:17.480  -->  00:06:24.040
there's gonna be two main imports,
import SQLite3 and import pandas as pd.
111

111

00:06:25.300  -->  00:06:27.450
So, to use this SQLite module,
112

112

00:06:27.450  -->  00:06:31.700
you first need to create a connection
object that represents a database.
113

113

00:06:31.700  -->  00:06:36.680
If the database name already exists,
SQLite3 will automatically connect to it.
114

114

00:06:36.680  -->  00:06:41.380
If that name doesn't exist, SQLite will
automatically create that database.
115

115

00:06:41.380  -->  00:06:46.487
So, for experienced users, you can also
supply the name, colon memory colon and
116

116

00:06:46.487  -->  00:06:51.090
that'll create the database completely
in your RAM, or your RAM, yes.
117

117

00:06:51.090  -->  00:06:53.430
So, we can go ahead and make a connection.
118

118

00:06:55.560  -->  00:07:01.119
So to connect to the database,
we go ahead and make an object called con,
119

119

00:07:01.119  -->  00:07:05.860
equals and then to connect,
you say SQLite3.connect, and
120

120

00:07:05.860  -->  00:07:11.421
then either put the entire path name for
your database, or in this case,
121

121

00:07:11.421  -->  00:07:16.344
since my database is in the same
folder as my IPython notebooks,
122

122

00:07:16.344  -->  00:07:19.758
I can just connect to
it using the name .db.
123

123

00:07:19.758  -->  00:07:23.090
And now I'm gonna show you an example
of running a basic SQL query.
124

124

00:07:23.090  -->  00:07:25.829
Don't worry,
if you don't understand this quite yet,
125

125

00:07:25.829  -->  00:07:27.550
we'll go over it in the next video.
126

126

00:07:27.550  -->  00:07:32.710
But to run a basic SQL query,
in case you already are familiar with SQL,
127

127

00:07:32.710  -->  00:07:35.550
you can just set an object as a comment.
128

128

00:07:35.550  -->  00:07:38.880
A large comment using
three quotation marks.
129

129

00:07:38.880  -->  00:07:41.940
Select, in this case,
all from the customer table.
130

130

00:07:42.970  -->  00:07:47.180
And then the way to use pandas to read
that SQL query, is by setting your data
131

131

00:07:47.180  -->  00:07:52.000
frame equal to pd.read_sql, and then you
132

132

00:07:53.380  -->  00:07:58.240
provide it with the SQL query object, and
then you provide the connection object.
133

133

00:07:58.240  -->  00:08:01.390
Which we set up here, con_sqlite3.connect.
134

134

00:08:01.390  -->  00:08:05.920
And then here I'm showing
the resulting data frame.
135

135

00:08:07.180  -->  00:08:07.960
And that's basically,
136

136

00:08:07.960  -->  00:08:11.700
since I selected all from the customer
table, that's the entire customer table.
137

137

00:08:14.420  -->  00:08:16.300
Okay, so, that's it.
138

138

00:08:16.300  -->  00:08:19.995
You just passed the SQL queries
in pandas and Python, great job.
139

139

00:08:19.995  -->  00:08:23.415
So, the subsequent lectures will go
further into how to query with SQL.
140

140

00:08:23.415  -->  00:08:25.855
But if you already know SQL,
that’s basically all you need to know.
141

141

00:08:25.855  -->  00:08:29.215
Let me just do a quick overview
of what we learned here.
142

142

00:08:30.245  -->  00:08:32.760
So, we downloaded SQL Alchemy.
143

143

00:08:32.760  -->  00:08:37.630
You can either go to that link or use
pip install or conda install sqlalchemy.
144

144

00:08:37.630  -->  00:08:40.220
We also downloaded the SQLite browser.
145

145

00:08:40.220  -->  00:08:44.023
There's also 10 other free browsers here
on this link in case you want to check
146

146

00:08:44.023  -->  00:08:44.550
them out.
147

147

00:08:44.550  -->  00:08:46.000
We downloaded the database.
148

148

00:08:46.000  -->  00:08:49.739
You can either construct the database
yourself using the .sql file from this
149

149

00:08:49.739  -->  00:08:52.800
link in case you're
already familiar with SQL.
150

150

00:08:52.800  -->  00:08:55.800
Or, if you just wanna download
the fully constructed database,
151

151

00:08:55.800  -->  00:08:57.300
it's less than six megabytes.
152

152

00:08:57.300  -->  00:08:58.350
You can click this link here.
153

153

00:09:00.440  -->  00:09:03.500
After that, we've got a quick overview
of what that database looks like.
154

154

00:09:03.500  -->  00:09:05.710
It's basically a rental
video store's database.
155

155

00:09:07.570  -->  00:09:11.760
Then we noticed that Python comes
with SQLite3, a nice module.
156

156

00:09:11.760  -->  00:09:16.510
So you always import SQLite3,
import pandas pd.
157

157

00:09:16.510  -->  00:09:18.800
Then, we gotta connect to our database.
158

158

00:09:18.800  -->  00:09:22.420
So, we say con equals sqlite3.connect.
159

159

00:09:22.420  -->  00:09:25.664
And either your entire
path to your database or
160

160

00:09:25.664  -->  00:09:31.010
just the database name if it's in
the same folder as your IPython notebook.
161

161

00:09:31.010  -->  00:09:34.290
And then, we learn how to do
a SQL query using pandas.
162

162

00:09:34.290  -->  00:09:37.250
So, your SQL query is just a comment.
163

163

00:09:37.250  -->  00:09:39.870
In this case,
I have selected everything from customer.
164

164

00:09:39.870  -->  00:09:44.910
Then you can use Pandas to pass that SQL
query using that SQL query object and
165

165

00:09:44.910  -->  00:09:49.800
passing your connection, and
I've set it as the resulting data frame.
166

166

00:09:49.800  -->  00:09:53.920
Okay, so that's a quick
introduction to SQL of Python.
167

167

00:09:53.920  -->  00:09:55.920
Hope you enjoyed it, thanks.
