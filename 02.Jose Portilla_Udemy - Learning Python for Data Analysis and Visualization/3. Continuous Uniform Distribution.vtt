00:00:00.870  -->  00:00:01.970
Hey everybody.
2

2

00:00:01.970  -->  00:00:06.940
In this lecture, we're gonna be going
over continuous uniform distributions.
3

3

00:00:06.940  -->  00:00:08.580
So quick note about this.
4

4

00:00:08.580  -->  00:00:11.190
You should look at the discrete
uniform distributions
5

5

00:00:11.190  -->  00:00:13.650
notebook first before looking at this one.
6

6

00:00:13.650  -->  00:00:14.960
All right.
7

7

00:00:14.960  -->  00:00:18.600
So, when we took a look at
the discrete uniform distributions,
8

8

00:00:18.600  -->  00:00:21.630
the probability of any
outcome was one over n.
9

9

00:00:21.630  -->  00:00:27.120
So like a dice roll, one over six,
since there's six possible outcomes.
10

10

00:00:27.120  -->  00:00:28.940
For a continuous distribution though,
11

11

00:00:28.940  -->  00:00:32.230
your data can't be divided
into discrete components.
12

12

00:00:32.230  -->  00:00:34.900
So for example,
when you're weighing an object,
13

13

00:00:34.900  -->  00:00:38.180
with perfect precision if you
had a scale that could do that,
14

14

00:00:38.180  -->  00:00:43.450
you could take the data on
a value between any two points.
15

15

00:00:43.450  -->  00:00:47.867
So for example, let's say you're
weighing just a random block.
16

16

00:00:47.867  -->  00:00:52.379
Well, it could weigh 5.4 grams, or
17

17

00:00:52.379  -->  00:00:56.625
5.423, or 5.4232 etc.
18

18

00:00:56.625  -->  00:00:58.830
Oops, let me change this here.
19

19

00:01:02.670  -->  00:01:03.365
Okay.
So
20

20

00:01:03.365  -->  00:01:05.440
with infinite precision,
there's technically
21

21

00:01:07.030  -->  00:01:11.640
almost like an infinite amount of
values that weight could take.
22

22

00:01:11.640  -->  00:01:17.210
So that means your n possible
values has a probability for
23

23

00:01:17.210  -->  00:01:20.100
any individual outcome
of one over infinity.
24

24

00:01:20.100  -->  00:01:22.090
This is for a continuous distribution.
25

25

00:01:24.160  -->  00:01:29.310
So technically, that's undefined or
if you take the limit, it'll go to zero.
26

26

00:01:30.750  -->  00:01:34.500
So we can only take probability
measurements on ranges on values,
27

27

00:01:34.500  -->  00:01:35.740
not just on a specific point.
28

28

00:01:37.000  -->  00:01:44.110
So for a continuous uniform distribution,
you can't take the probability
29

29

00:01:44.110  -->  00:01:49.440
measurement on a single point because you
can keep dividing that point infinitely.
30

30

00:01:49.440  -->  00:01:51.240
So you have to take it
on ranges of values.
31

31

00:01:51.240  -->  00:01:55.390
So let's go ahead and
look into a definition here.
32

32

00:01:55.390  -->  00:02:00.040
So a continuous random variable x
of a probability density function
33

33

00:02:00.040  -->  00:02:03.250
is a continuous uniform
random variable when
34

34

00:02:03.250  -->  00:02:07.490
your f of x is equal to
one over a b minus a.
35

35

00:02:07.490  -->  00:02:09.810
So where x is in-between a and b.
36

36

00:02:09.810  -->  00:02:12.770
So those are your lower bound and
upper bound values.
37

37

00:02:13.870  -->  00:02:16.990
So that makes sense because for
a discrete uniform distribution,
38

38

00:02:16.990  -->  00:02:19.150
the f of x was 1 over n.
39

39

00:02:19.150  -->  00:02:22.090
But in this case,
we don't have a specific n possibilities,
40

40

00:02:22.090  -->  00:02:25.340
so we have to use a range,
from the minimum a to the maximum b.
41

41

00:02:26.850  -->  00:02:29.510
So the mean for
a continuous uniform distribution
42

42

00:02:29.510  -->  00:02:32.005
is just the average of the min and
max, a plus b over two.
43

43

00:02:32.005  -->  00:02:38.028
And the variance is defined
as b minus a squared over 12.
44

44

00:02:38.028  -->  00:02:38.661
All right.
45

45

00:02:38.661  -->  00:02:42.485
So let's go ahead and
take a look at an example problem.
46

46

00:02:42.485  -->  00:02:46.930
Go ahead and red over the top
details a little more carefully
47

47

00:02:46.930  -->  00:02:49.340
in case you didn't quite
get everything I just said.
48

48

00:02:52.130  -->  00:02:54.690
So what does an example problem look like?
49

49

00:02:54.690  -->  00:02:57.870
Let's say on average a taxi ride
in New York City takes 22 minutes.
50

50

00:02:59.680  -->  00:03:01.155
You're doing a little experiment,
51

51

00:03:01.155  -->  00:03:05.710
and after taking some time measurements,
you gather that all the taxi rides
52

52

00:03:05.710  -->  00:03:09.060
are uniformly distributed between
19 minutes and 27 minutes.
53

53

00:03:10.910  -->  00:03:15.850
So what's the PDF or probability density
function of a taxi ride, or f of x?
54

54

00:03:17.330  -->  00:03:19.470
We can do this using Python.
55

55

00:03:19.470  -->  00:03:21.730
So let's go ahead and
set our lower bound time.
56

56

00:03:21.730  -->  00:03:24.730
A equals 19, since it was 19 minutes.
57

57

00:03:24.730  -->  00:03:29.360
The upper bound is 27, and then we can
use our probability density function
58

58

00:03:29.360  -->  00:03:33.370
that we covered over here,
one over b minus a.
59

59

00:03:33.370  -->  00:03:36.027
So we'll set f x equal to 1.0.
60

60

00:03:36.027  -->  00:03:40.720
Notice I'm using the .0
because this is Python 2.
61

61

00:03:41.990  -->  00:03:44.590
And I'm gonna divide it by b minus a.
62

62

00:03:44.590  -->  00:03:49.235
So then, the probability
density function results in,
63

63

00:03:49.235  -->  00:03:52.340
if I print that result, 0.125.
64

64

00:03:52.340  -->  00:03:53.461
Great.
65

65

00:03:53.461  -->  00:03:56.800
We can also get the variants.
66

66

00:03:56.800  -->  00:03:59.500
So I just following that
equation I covered over.
67

67

00:03:59.500  -->  00:04:03.500
And the variants of that continuous
uniform distribution is five.
68

68

00:04:03.500  -->  00:04:06.010
So let's ask,
probably a more interesting question.
69

69

00:04:07.070  -->  00:04:12.110
What's the probability that the taxi
ride will take at least 25 minutes?
70

70

00:04:14.170  -->  00:04:18.470
So this is gonna be
the same PDF as f of 27.
71

71

00:04:18.470  -->  00:04:24.910
So the entire space, minus the probability
space of less than 25 minutes.
72

72

00:04:24.910  -->  00:04:29.118
So to show you what I'm
talking about here,
73

73

00:04:29.118  -->  00:04:34.238
we calculate the probability
space of 27 minutes,
74

74

00:04:34.238  -->  00:04:39.243
and then the probability
space of 25 minutes, and
75

75

00:04:39.243  -->  00:04:44.158
then we're gonna get
the range of 27 minus 25.
76

76

00:04:44.158  -->  00:04:49.146
And so now we'll know that the probability
that the taxi ride will last at least
77

77

00:04:49.146  -->  00:04:50.745
25 minutes is 25%.
78

78

00:04:50.745  -->  00:04:53.830
So that's how you would do this manually,
but
79

79

00:04:53.830  -->  00:04:56.490
you can use scipy to
do this automatically.
80

80

00:04:57.850  -->  00:05:03.280
So, if you wanna use SciPy, you can
say from scipy.stats import uniform,
81

81

00:05:03.280  -->  00:05:04.570
and then import NumPy as np.
82

82

00:05:05.810  -->  00:05:07.650
So let's go ahead and
just set another A and B.
83

83

00:05:07.650  -->  00:05:10.980
So we'll set a lower limit at zero,
upper limit at five.
84

84

00:05:12.460  -->  00:05:16.016
And then in order to plot this,
I'm gonna set x equal to,
85

85

00:05:16.016  -->  00:05:20.380
using NumPy linear space.
86

86

00:05:20.380  -->  00:05:23.550
So I'll set x as 100 linearly
spaced points between A and B.
87

87

00:05:25.060  -->  00:05:29.160
And then, I'll use uniform which
is what I just imported from SciPy
88

88

00:05:30.600  -->  00:05:31.980
to create my distribution.
89

89

00:05:31.980  -->  00:05:35.768
So I'll set it as rv equals and
then I'm calling uniform.
90

90

00:05:35.768  -->  00:05:41.170
And the arguments uniform takes is
the starting point, and that's loc,
91

91

00:05:42.380  -->  00:05:46.640
and then its end point which
you can set as scale-B.
92

92

00:05:46.640  -->  00:05:52.420
So if I plot this PDF, I'm just gonna plot
it as x versus the probability density
93

93

00:05:52.420  -->  00:05:58.340
function, so the method called .pdf on
that uniform distribution I just created.
94

94

00:05:58.340  -->  00:06:00.560
So I'm making all these values, and
95

95

00:06:00.560  -->  00:06:05.070
then I'm creating that PDF
on those values using x.
96

96

00:06:05.070  -->  00:06:06.180
That's its argument there.
97

97

00:06:07.450  -->  00:06:10.862
So I plot that out, and
I get a straight line.
98

98

00:06:10.862  -->  00:06:15.407
So the line is at 0.2,
which is exactly what you would expect,
99

99

00:06:15.407  -->  00:06:19.954
because if we follow the equation
that we have all the way up here,
100

100

00:06:19.954  -->  00:06:25.079
one over b minus a, well that was just
the same as one over five minus zero,
101

101

00:06:25.079  -->  00:06:28.328
which is the same as one over five,
or 0.2.
102

102

00:06:28.328  -->  00:06:29.256
Okay, so
103

103

00:06:29.256  -->  00:06:33.910
that's just a really quick overview
on continuous uniform distributions.
104

104

00:06:33.910  -->  00:06:34.949
I know I went over it a little quickly.
105

105

00:06:34.949  -->  00:06:37.963
But really, go ahead and
take your time and
106

106

00:06:37.963  -->  00:06:42.510
look at this notebook yourself
a little more slowly.
107

107

00:06:42.510  -->  00:06:46.820
If you still want more information
on continuous uniform distributions,
108

108

00:06:46.820  -->  00:06:49.095
you can just go ahead and
check out these links here.
109

109

00:06:49.095  -->  00:06:50.605
There's the Wikipedia link.
110

110

00:06:50.605  -->  00:06:54.695
There's the SciPy documentation on
the uniform distribution there.
111

111

00:06:54.695  -->  00:06:58.365
And you can also check out
the explanation on the uniform
112

112

00:06:58.365  -->  00:07:01.285
distribution at MathWorld at Wolfram.
113

113

00:07:01.285  -->  00:07:02.245
Okay.
114

114

00:07:02.245  -->  00:07:02.745
Thanks.
