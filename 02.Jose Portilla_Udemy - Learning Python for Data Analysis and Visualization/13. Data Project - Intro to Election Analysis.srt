00:00:02,138  -->  00:00:05,400
Hi everybody,
welcome to the third data project.
2

2

00:00:05,400  -->  00:00:08,480
This will be the election analysis.
3

3

00:00:08,480  -->  00:00:12,580
So in this data project we're going to be
looking at data from two data sets and
4

4

00:00:12,580  -->  00:00:15,520
they're both concerned with the 2012
election between Mitt Romney and
5

5

00:00:15,520  -->  00:00:16,120
Barack Obama.
6

6

00:00:17,130  -->  00:00:21,630
The first data set's basically an
aggregation of a bunch of political polls
7

7

00:00:21,630  -->  00:00:24,490
and, we'll be answering questions such as,
who is being polled and
8

8

00:00:24,490  -->  00:00:26,700
what was their party affiliation?
9

9

00:00:26,700  -->  00:00:30,750
What were the poll results, and who
were they in favor of, Romney or Obama?
10

10

00:00:30,750  -->  00:00:32,680
And did that change over time?
11

11

00:00:32,680  -->  00:00:35,120
And did any events change
that voters sentiment?
12

12

00:00:37,400  -->  00:00:41,230
And then scrolling down here, so
we'll look at those questions.
13

13

00:00:41,230  -->  00:00:42,450
Answer them.
14

14

00:00:42,450  -->  00:00:45,650
Use cborne to try and
visually answer some of those questions.
15

15

00:00:47,150  -->  00:00:52,110
And after that, you can see here
we analyze how voter sentiment
16

16

00:00:52,110  -->  00:00:56,530
changed over time between Obama,
Romney, and the undecided voters.
17

17

00:00:56,530  -->  00:01:02,408
So we'll look at all that then we will
see if any events played a part and
18

18

00:01:02,408  -->  00:01:04,850
that poll data.
19

19

00:01:04,850  -->  00:01:07,624
Afterwards, we're going to
look at a donation data set.
20

20

00:01:07,624  -->  00:01:11,910
So this data set's going to have
data on people that contributed to
21

21

00:01:11,910  -->  00:01:16,650
the campaigns of different candidates,
not just Barack Obama and Mitt Romney but
22

22

00:01:16,650  -->  00:01:21,360
everyone, all the other Republicans
that ran such as Michele Bachmann or
23

23

00:01:21,360  -->  00:01:24,270
Herman Cain, et cetera.
24

24

00:01:24,270  -->  00:01:27,308
So, we'll look at how much was donated,
the average donations,
25

25

00:01:27,308  -->  00:01:29,983
how the donations differ
between parties or candidates.
26

26

00:01:29,983  -->  00:01:32,421
What were the demographics of the donors?
27

27

00:01:32,421  -->  00:01:34,430
Is there any pattern in
the donation amounts?
28

28

00:01:34,430  -->  00:01:40,360
And we'll be looking at that
visualizing some of the data there.
29

29

00:01:42,030  -->  00:01:46,440
And we'll also be looking at best
practices for displaying data.
30

30

00:01:47,530  -->  00:01:49,280
It'll go into further
detail in that later.
31

31

00:01:51,220  -->  00:01:54,730
And then finally we'll also be
looking at donations by occupation.
32

32

00:01:55,770  -->  00:02:02,190
So the CEOs, as you can scroll
down here and see, CEOs seem to be
33

33

00:02:02,190  -->  00:02:06,710
a little more heavily conservative since
they donated more towards Republicans.
34

34

00:02:08,180  -->  00:02:12,350
And retirees Maybe might surprise
you seems to lean a little more like
35

35

00:02:12,350  -->  00:02:17,860
a Democrat and we'll go over all
that in the following videos.
36

36

00:02:17,860  -->  00:02:19,100
Great, I'll see you there.
