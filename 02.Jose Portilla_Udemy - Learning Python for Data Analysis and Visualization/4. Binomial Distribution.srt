1

00:00:01,330  -->  00:00:02,380
Okay, everybody.
2

2

00:00:02,380  -->  00:00:03,270
In this video,
3

3

00:00:03,270  -->  00:00:06,410
I'm just going to be doing a quick
overview on the binomial distribution.
4

4

00:00:07,590  -->  00:00:09,640
So the binomial distribution,
5

5

00:00:09,640  -->  00:00:14,140
it's a specific type of a discrete
probability distribution.
6

6

00:00:14,140  -->  00:00:16,550
So let's go ahead and
see an example question first and
7

7

00:00:16,550  -->  00:00:18,320
then I'll go over
the binomial distribution.
8

8

00:00:20,330  -->  00:00:24,960
So in this example let's say we have two
players and they're playing basketball.
9

9

00:00:24,960  -->  00:00:27,830
So there's player A and player B.
10

10

00:00:27,830  -->  00:00:31,322
And player A takes an average
of 11 shots per game and
11

11

00:00:31,322  -->  00:00:34,270
has an average success rate of 72%.
12

12

00:00:34,270  -->  00:00:37,185
And then player B takes an average
of 15 shots per game, but
13

13

00:00:37,185  -->  00:00:39,085
has an average success rate of 48%.
14

14

00:00:39,085  -->  00:00:41,538
So we're gonna have two questions here.
15

15

00:00:41,538  -->  00:00:45,979
What's the probability that player
A makes six shots in an average game, and
16

16

00:00:45,979  -->  00:00:51,110
what's the probability that player B
makes six shots in an average game?
17

17

00:00:51,110  -->  00:00:54,980
Now pay attention closely to
what the question's asking.
18

18

00:00:54,980  -->  00:01:02,640
It's asking exactly six shots, so not at
least six shots, but exactly six shots.
19

19

00:01:02,640  -->  00:01:03,810
That's gonna be important later on.
20

20

00:01:05,240  -->  00:01:10,740
Okay, so
how do you classify a binomial experiment?
21

21

00:01:10,740  -->  00:01:12,080
So you're gonna need to
meet some conditions.
22

22

00:01:13,430  -->  00:01:16,330
So in order to classify this
as a binomial experiment,
23

23

00:01:16,330  -->  00:01:21,740
it needs to consist of a sequence
of trials, of n trials that is.
24

24

00:01:21,740  -->  00:01:24,430
And there can only be two
exclusive outcomes for
25

25

00:01:24,430  -->  00:01:27,570
each trial, a success and a failure.
26

26

00:01:27,570  -->  00:01:29,790
So an example of this is a coin flip.
27

27

00:01:29,790  -->  00:01:34,530
You can have heads be a success, and
tails be failure, or vice versa.
28

28

00:01:34,530  -->  00:01:37,170
Or in our case we have
the basketball shot.
29

29

00:01:37,170  -->  00:01:39,490
Either you make it, success,
or you miss, failure.
30

30

00:01:41,850  -->  00:01:43,960
So it just needs to have
two exclusive outcomes.
31

31

00:01:45,680  -->  00:01:49,950
Another condition we need to meet is
that the probability of success is P.
32

32

00:01:51,030  -->  00:01:56,850
Then the probability of failure
needs to be defined as q or 1- p.
33

33

00:01:56,850  -->  00:02:01,050
So you only have two probabilities,
that of success and failure.
34

34

00:02:01,050  -->  00:02:02,960
And if you sum them up, it equals one.
35

35

00:02:02,960  -->  00:02:04,170
The entire probability space.
36

36

00:02:05,320  -->  00:02:09,540
And lastly, we need all the trials
to be independent of each other.
37

37

00:02:09,540  -->  00:02:11,160
So, for example,
38

38

00:02:11,160  -->  00:02:15,620
on coin flips your first coin flip
can't affect your 100th coin flip.
39

39

00:02:15,620  -->  00:02:21,265
All right, so what's the formula for
the binomial distribution?
40

40

00:02:22,685  -->  00:02:26,675
Well, the formula for the PMF, or
the probability mass function.
41

41

00:02:26,675  -->  00:02:31,275
The reason it's a mass function is
cause it's a discrete distribution.
42

42

00:02:31,275  -->  00:02:35,580
Well that turns out to be
the probability the X = k, so
43

43

00:02:35,580  -->  00:02:41,130
that you get k number of successes is
44

44

00:02:41,130  -->  00:02:46,950
equal to the combination of (n,k),
45

45

00:02:46,950  -->  00:02:51,680
times the probability of a success to
the power of k times (1- p) or q, which is
46

46

00:02:53,030  -->  00:02:57,960
just the probability of failure,
to the power of n- k.
47

47

00:02:59,000  -->  00:03:00,770
So n is the number of trials.
48

48

00:03:00,770  -->  00:03:02,260
K is the number of successes.
49

49

00:03:02,260  -->  00:03:03,648
P is the probability of success.
50

50

00:03:03,648  -->  00:03:06,180
And (1- p) is the probability of failure.
51

51

00:03:07,490  -->  00:03:12,850
If you're confused by
this notation of C(n,k),
52

52

00:03:12,850  -->  00:03:15,690
that's just known as
a combination probability.
53

53

00:03:15,690  -->  00:03:16,400
And you can go ahead and
54

54

00:03:16,400  -->  00:03:21,300
check out the combinations notebook if you
want to get an overview of that, right.
55

55

00:03:23,090  -->  00:03:24,560
So if we break this down,
56

56

00:03:24,560  -->  00:03:29,070
this means that we need to get
exactly k successes in n trials.
57

57

00:03:29,070  -->  00:03:32,520
So we want k successes, so that's where
we get the P to the power of k term.
58

58

00:03:33,530  -->  00:03:35,820
And we want n- k failures.
59

59

00:03:35,820  -->  00:03:39,942
So that's where we get the 1- p
to the power of n- k failures.
60

60

00:03:39,942  -->  00:03:45,800
And finally, the combination or
k successes in n trials.
61

61

00:03:46,950  -->  00:03:50,610
These are the different ways of
putting k successes in n trials, or
62

62

00:03:50,610  -->  00:03:51,800
choosing k out of n.
63

63

00:03:53,860  -->  00:03:57,160
So we multiply all these together, and
that gets you the probability of exactly
64

64

00:03:57,160  -->  00:04:00,200
that many successes and
failures in those n trials.
65

65

00:04:02,320  -->  00:04:06,980
So I said before, C(n,k) just
refers to the number of possible
66

66

00:04:06,980  -->  00:04:09,670
combinations of n things,
taken k at a time.
67

67

00:04:10,930  -->  00:04:12,368
It's also equal to n!
68

68

00:04:12,368  -->  00:04:13,720
over k!
69

69

00:04:13,720  -->  00:04:17,220
times (n- k)!
70

70

00:04:17,220  -->  00:04:18,360
That's its definition.
71

71

00:04:18,360  -->  00:04:20,850
So that's what you can input
mathematically to get that number.
72

72

00:04:21,880  -->  00:04:24,640
Great, so let's go ahead and
try out the example problem.
73

73

00:04:26,120  -->  00:04:28,030
We set up player A.
74

74

00:04:28,030  -->  00:04:32,841
Player A had a probability
of success of 0.72, and
75

75

00:04:32,841  -->  00:04:36,302
it took 11 shots per game on average.
76

76

00:04:36,302  -->  00:04:40,442
And we want him to make six shots, so
77

77

00:04:40,442  -->  00:04:45,272
I can import scipy.misc or M-I-C-S,
78

78

00:04:45,272  -->  00:04:49,141
excuse me, M-I-S-C, as sc.
79

79

00:04:49,141  -->  00:04:54,990
And then using that,
I can call combination.
80

80

00:04:54,990  -->  00:04:58,421
So this is just for me to avoid having to
write this factorial every single time.
81

81

00:05:02,239  -->  00:05:06,130
So you can do it by just setting
up your n number of trials.
82

82

00:05:06,130  -->  00:05:10,260
So in this case for
player A, I have it as n_a.
83

83

00:05:10,260  -->  00:05:17,260
And k successes, and now we put it
together to get that probability.
84

84

00:05:17,260  -->  00:05:23,050
So combination A, p_a to
85

85

00:05:23,050  -->  00:05:28,550
the power of k, probability of
a failure to the power of n- k here,
86

86

00:05:28,550  -->  00:05:31,150
sub A because it's just for player A.
87

87

00:05:31,150  -->  00:05:35,468
So what I'm highlighting right
here is just the Python written
88

88

00:05:35,468  -->  00:05:40,034
out version of this right here,
that probability mass function.
89

89

00:05:43,297  -->  00:05:47,287
And then to get the answer in
a percentage form, I'm just gonna say
90

90

00:05:47,287  -->  00:05:52,830
100 times the answer, because it will
just give it to us in a decimal at first.
91

91

00:05:52,830  -->  00:05:55,650
And then I just repeated all the steps for
player B.
92

92

00:05:55,650  -->  00:05:57,820
So again,
you can just open up the notebook and
93

93

00:05:57,820  -->  00:06:00,280
take your time to look through over this.
94

94

00:06:00,280  -->  00:06:04,808
I'm going a little quickly just because
this is mainly just an appendix overview.
95

95

00:06:04,808  -->  00:06:07,187
Yeah.
96

96

00:06:07,187  -->  00:06:09,750
So then I'm going to print the answers.
97

97

00:06:10,960  -->  00:06:14,400
And so we find out that the probability of
player A making six shots in an average
98

98

00:06:14,400  -->  00:06:16,890
game is 11.1%.
99

99

00:06:16,890  -->  00:06:21,920
And the probability of player B making
six shots in an average game is 17%.
100

100

00:06:21,920  -->  00:06:28,180
So we know that even though player
B is technically a worse shooter,
101

101

00:06:28,180  -->  00:06:31,030
because he or she takes more shots,
102

102

00:06:31,030  -->  00:06:34,770
they'll have a higher chance of
making six shots in an average game.
103

103

00:06:36,830  -->  00:06:40,430
But remember, this was the odds of
making exactly six shots in a game.
104

104

00:06:41,780  -->  00:06:44,080
What about a higher amount of shots?
105

105

00:06:44,080  -->  00:06:47,730
Will player A's higher probability
take a stronger effect then?
106

106

00:06:48,870  -->  00:06:52,410
So let's look at what's the probability
of making nine shots a game for
107

107

00:06:52,410  -->  00:06:53,000
either player.
108

108

00:06:55,910  -->  00:06:57,760
So we just did the exact same thing here.
109

109

00:06:57,760  -->  00:06:59,350
Let me fix this typo.
110

110

00:06:59,350  -->  00:07:01,870
Remains the same, all right.
111

111

00:07:03,940  -->  00:07:08,090
And if we look at these odds now, the
probability of player A making nine shots
112

112

00:07:08,090  -->  00:07:13,200
in an average game is 22.4%,
and the same for B is 13.4%.
113

113

00:07:13,200  -->  00:07:20,706
So now we see that players A [SOUND] gives
better odds of making exactly nine shots.
114

114

00:07:20,706  -->  00:07:23,485
So we need to keep in mind that
we are asking the probability of
115

115

00:07:23,485  -->  00:07:25,460
making exactly those amount of shots.
116

116

00:07:25,460  -->  00:07:29,815
So that's a different question than what's
the probability of player A making at
117

117

00:07:29,815  -->  00:07:30,831
least nine shots.
118

118

00:07:33,391  -->  00:07:36,748
So now that we looked at an example and
at the probability distribution,
119

119

00:07:36,748  -->  00:07:37,628
let's go ahead and
120

120

00:07:37,628  -->  00:07:41,220
investigate the mean and standard
deviation of the binomial distribution.
121

121

00:07:43,430  -->  00:07:48,010
So the mean of the binomial distribution
is just equal to n times p.
122

122

00:07:49,250  -->  00:07:53,630
So this intuitively makes sense because
the average number of successes should be
123

123

00:07:53,630  -->  00:07:59,410
the total trials multiplied by your
average success rate, so n x p.
124

124

00:07:59,410  -->  00:08:02,930
And then you can see also that standard
deviation is just equal to the square root
125

125

00:08:02,930  -->  00:08:03,720
of n x q x p.
126

126

00:08:05,430  -->  00:08:08,150
So now we can ask, what's the average
number of shots each player will make
127

127

00:08:08,150  -->  00:08:10,840
in a game, plus or
minus a standard distribution?
128

128

00:08:12,350  -->  00:08:15,002
So again, I just plug into
the formulas here to get the mean and
129

129

00:08:15,002  -->  00:08:16,130
the standard deviation.
130

130

00:08:19,809  -->  00:08:23,860
And player A will make and average
of 8 plus or minus 1 shots per game.
131

131

00:08:23,860  -->  00:08:26,800
Player B will make an average of 7 plus or
minus 2 shots per game.
132

132

00:08:27,955  -->  00:08:35,275
So if you notice here I used a cutoff for
that floating point.
133

133

00:08:35,275  -->  00:08:40,670
So initially using this python script you
would get, for example, 8.2 shots a game.
134

134

00:08:40,670  -->  00:08:43,450
But that doesn't really make sense,
because you can't have
135

135

00:08:43,450  -->  00:08:47,070
half a basketball shot, so
I cut it off when I was printing it.
136

136

00:08:48,140  -->  00:08:49,640
But you can go ahead and
137

137

00:08:49,640  -->  00:08:52,750
input more decimal values if you
wanna get more precise about it.
138

138

00:08:54,290  -->  00:08:56,450
Okay, so let's go ahead and
139

139

00:08:56,450  -->  00:09:01,010
see how to use scipy to automatically
create the binomial distribution.
140

140

00:09:01,010  -->  00:09:05,334
So we can say from scipy.stats
import binom, B-I-N-O-M.
141

141

00:09:05,334  -->  00:09:09,987
And if we wanna get particular stats such
as the mean or variance, or the skew or
142

142

00:09:09,987  -->  00:09:12,806
kurtosis, you can just say,
in this example,
143

143

00:09:12,806  -->  00:09:15,361
I'm just grabbing the mean and variance.
144

144

00:09:15,361  -->  00:09:20,085
And you just go binom.stats
method on it and
145

145

00:09:20,085  -->  00:09:23,410
input your n and your p values.
146

146

00:09:25,430  -->  00:09:28,526
So here I got 7.92 and 1.48.
147

147

00:09:28,526  -->  00:09:33,810
So if you look at that, that actually
matches up for manual methods.
148

148

00:09:34,840  -->  00:09:37,070
So up here, I had 8 plus or minus 1.
149

149

00:09:37,070  -->  00:09:39,250
Remember I was cutting it off.
150

150

00:09:39,250  -->  00:09:43,915
So if I don't round using scipy.stats,
I get 7.92 and 1.48,
151

151

00:09:43,915  -->  00:09:45,950
which was rounded down to one.
152

152

00:09:47,050  -->  00:09:47,680
Great.
153

153

00:09:47,680  -->  00:09:49,780
So now instead of having
to do all this manual work,
154

154

00:09:49,780  -->  00:09:53,985
you can just call scipy.stats binom.
155

155

00:09:53,985  -->  00:09:56,200
And you can get the mean variance and
156

156

00:09:56,200  -->  00:09:59,080
other statistical
properties automatically.
157

157

00:09:59,080  -->  00:10:02,220
You can also get
the probability mass function.
158

158

00:10:03,440  -->  00:10:04,780
So lets go ahead and try another example.
159

159

00:10:06,100  -->  00:10:07,370
Imagine you're flipping a fair coin.
160

160

00:10:07,370  -->  00:10:11,430
You're probability of
getting heads is p = 0.5.
161

161

00:10:11,430  -->  00:10:13,640
So we'll have that be
success in this example.
162

162

00:10:14,750  -->  00:10:17,980
So what's you're probability mass
function, or your PMF, look like for
163

163

00:10:17,980  -->  00:10:18,810
10 coin flips?
164

164

00:10:18,810  -->  00:10:21,340
So I'm gonna import numpy as np.
165

165

00:10:22,450  -->  00:10:26,110
Set up the new example so
I'll say, n equals ten coin flips.
166

166

00:10:26,110  -->  00:10:28,489
Probability of success is 0.5.
167

167

00:10:28,489  -->  00:10:31,960
Then I'm gonna set up n successes.
168

168

00:10:31,960  -->  00:10:33,330
Remember indexing starts at zero.
169

169

00:10:33,330  -->  00:10:36,305
So I'm gonna say x is range(n + 1).
170

170

00:10:36,305  -->  00:10:40,417
And then in order to create
the probability mass function,
171

171

00:10:40,417  -->  00:10:43,213
it's really easy now that we use scipy,
172

172

00:10:43,213  -->  00:10:48,845
I just say binom.pmf to call
a probability mass function method on it.
173

173

00:10:48,845  -->  00:10:52,335
And then it takes the inputs x, n and p.
174

174

00:10:52,335  -->  00:10:53,405
We'll have that equal to Y.
175

175

00:10:54,715  -->  00:10:56,105
So we'll show what Y is equal to.
176

176

00:10:56,105  -->  00:10:58,115
So we have this array here.
177

177

00:10:59,270  -->  00:11:01,210
And let's go ahead and
visualize it by plotting it.
178

178

00:11:03,620  -->  00:11:08,200
So to do that, I'm just gonna
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt.
179

179

00:11:08,200  -->  00:11:11,168
So for this kind of a simple plot
Seaborn is kind of overkill, so
180

180

00:11:11,168  -->  00:11:12,740
I'm just gonna use matplotlib.
181

181

00:11:14,710  -->  00:11:20,919
Then I'm gonna say plt.plot, the x,
the Y, and set just 0 dot points here.
182

182

00:11:20,919  -->  00:11:24,257
Sorry that's not actually a 0,
just an o dot points, excuse me, for
183

183

00:11:24,257  -->  00:11:25,170
little blue dots.
184

184

00:11:27,130  -->  00:11:31,430
And then I just set the title by plt.title
and then the x label and Y label.
185

185

00:11:33,280  -->  00:11:36,520
And that's what the probability
mass function looks like for
186

186

00:11:36,520  -->  00:11:37,530
that particular problem.
187

187

00:11:39,380  -->  00:11:42,113
So go ahead and go back, take your time
to look over this entire notebook.
188

188

00:11:42,113  -->  00:11:44,789
This is just a quick overview
of the binomial distribution.
189

189

00:11:44,789  -->  00:11:50,119
The main conclusion here that you want
to take away are really the probability
190

190

00:11:50,119  -->  00:11:55,750
mass function and the conditions on
what makes a binomial experiment.
191

191

00:11:55,750  -->  00:11:59,980
So remember,
any consists of a sequence of n trials,
192

192

00:11:59,980  -->  00:12:03,080
there can only be two exclusive outcomes,
either success or failure.
193

193

00:12:04,340  -->  00:12:08,390
And those two probabilities,
p and q, need to equal one, and
194

194

00:12:08,390  -->  00:12:11,528
all the trials need to be
independent of each other.
195

195

00:12:11,528  -->  00:12:14,470
And that's the good test to know if
something is a binomial distribution.
196

196

00:12:15,620  -->  00:12:16,880
Great.
197

197

00:12:16,880  -->  00:12:19,950
So if we scroll down here,
there's plenty more resources for
198

198

00:12:19,950  -->  00:12:21,830
you to learn more about
the binomial distribution.
199

199

00:12:22,850  -->  00:12:29,099
Wikipedia's great, StatTrek right here,
and then mathworld.wolfram.com.
200

200

00:12:29,099  -->  00:12:31,890
So go ahead and click any of these
links if you're interested in
201

201

00:12:31,890  -->  00:12:34,510
further learning about
the binomial distribution.
202

202

00:12:34,510  -->  00:12:35,010
All right,
