00:00:02,010  -->  00:00:06,870
Hey everyone, I apologize that the last
lecture ended kind of abruptly.
2

2

00:00:06,870  -->  00:00:08,810
There was,
I think an editing issue with the video.
3

3

00:00:08,810  -->  00:00:12,680
What I was gonna say is
we've done quite a bit, and
4

4

00:00:12,680  -->  00:00:17,420
we've seen a lot of data analysis
through the Titanic intro project, and
5

5

00:00:17,420  -->  00:00:20,290
what I want to do now is hand
over the control to you.
6

6

00:00:20,290  -->  00:00:24,620
So, there's two questions I want you
to answer with your new skill sets and
7

7

00:00:24,620  -->  00:00:27,340
the experience you've seen
through this data project.
8

8

00:00:27,340  -->  00:00:30,340
And what you're gonna
answer is two questions.
9

9

00:00:30,340  -->  00:00:33,518
Did the deck have an effect on
the passengers' survival rate, and
10

10

00:00:33,518  -->  00:00:35,811
does this answer match
up with your intuition.
11

11

00:00:35,811  -->  00:00:41,746
So, does being on A deck make a difference
in your survival rate versus being on E or
12

12

00:00:41,746  -->  00:00:44,852
F deck, so on a higher deck or
a lower deck.
13

13

00:00:44,852  -->  00:00:52,750
And how does being a male
affect that same outcome?
14

14

00:00:52,750  -->  00:00:54,950
So if you were a male on the lower deck or
15

15

00:00:54,950  -->  00:00:57,350
a male on the higher deck,
did it really make a difference or not?
16

16

00:00:57,350  -->  00:01:00,010
And does this answer match
up with your intuition?
17

17

00:01:00,010  -->  00:01:01,831
So that's an interesting
thing to look into.
18

18

00:01:01,831  -->  00:01:04,500
And then the second question
I want you to look at is,
19

19

00:01:04,500  -->  00:01:08,092
did having a family member increased
the odds of surviving the crash.
20

20

00:01:08,092  -->  00:01:12,180
So did having a family enable
you to get onto a life
21

21

00:01:12,180  -->  00:01:16,090
boat because you have
people supporting you.
22

22

00:01:16,090  -->  00:01:19,680
Or is it better that you are alone and
didn't have to worry about your family?
23

23

00:01:19,680  -->  00:01:21,600
So that's a real interesting
question to answer.
24

24

00:01:22,690  -->  00:01:24,800
So go ahead and
answer those two questions.
25

25

00:01:24,800  -->  00:01:29,620
Add a discussion on this lecture if you're
having trouble or just even have more
26

26

00:01:29,620  -->  00:01:34,010
questions that are interesting to answer
and want advice on how to answer those.
27

27

00:01:34,010  -->  00:01:34,800
But overall,
28

28

00:01:34,800  -->  00:01:39,050
we've done a lot of stuff with this
data set, which is pretty awesome.
29

29

00:01:39,050  -->  00:01:43,230
I highly suggest you go check out the
iPython notebook that's attached to this
30

30

00:01:44,570  -->  00:01:48,860
project, that's in the first lecture for
this project's video.
31

31

00:01:50,310  -->  00:01:51,180
Go ahead and check it out.
32

32

00:01:51,180  -->  00:01:54,150
There's a lot more comments,
a lot more information.
33

33

00:01:54,150  -->  00:01:58,350
Things are explained in a little slower
than I did through these few videos and
34

34

00:01:58,350  -->  00:02:00,870
you can go at your own pace.
35

35

00:02:00,870  -->  00:02:03,650
Okay, I hope you enjoy
the Titanic intro project, and
36

36

00:02:03,650  -->  00:02:04,710
I look forward to the next one.
