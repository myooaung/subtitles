00:00:00.730  -->  00:00:01.560
Hey, guys.
2

2

00:00:01.560  -->  00:00:05.960
This is lecture 27 and in this lecture
3

3

00:00:05.960  -->  00:00:10.400
we are gonna be learning how to
work HTML with Python and pandas.
4

4

00:00:11.990  -->  00:00:17.321
So we are going to import the usual,
5

5

00:00:17.321  -->  00:00:23.365
import pandas, SPD and then from pandas
6

6

00:00:23.365  -->  00:00:28.540
import Series, and DataFrames.
7

7

00:00:28.540  -->  00:00:34.160
Something we're going to import in
order to read HTML data is from pandas.
8

8

00:00:36.120  -->  00:00:42.420
We're going to import read_html.
9

9

00:00:42.420  -->  00:00:49.230
So to get HTML data, we're gonna grab
a URL for a list of failed banks.
10

10

00:00:50.280  -->  00:00:54.395
And that URL, I'm gonna copy and
paste it from the IPython Notebook Book,
11

11

00:00:55.415  -->  00:00:58.733
link, and that's the URL right here.
12

12

00:00:58.733  -->  00:01:02.965
An important note,
13

13

00:01:02.965  -->  00:01:08.345
you're gonna need two things
installed in order to do this.
14

14

00:01:08.345  -->  00:01:14.070
You're gonna have to either pip or Conda
installed, depending on your installation.
15

15

00:01:14.070  -->  00:01:18.765
You're gonna need a pip
install beautiful soup.
16

16

00:01:20.430  -->  00:01:24.660
It's a scraping tool to use for
webscraping and
17

17

00:01:24.660  -->  00:01:32.193
then you're also going to
need to install html5lib.
18

18

00:01:32.193  -->  00:01:37.170
So you should already be pretty
familiar in how to these pip installer
19

19

00:01:37.170  -->  00:01:40.580
condons installed based on the pipeline
installation that you chose.
20

20

00:01:40.580  -->  00:01:44.708
So you're going to need to
install both beautiful soup and
21

21

00:01:44.708  -->  00:01:46.920
HTML5 in order to do this lecture.
22

22

00:01:48.662  -->  00:01:53.830
All right, so once you have those guys
installed, you can grab data from HTML and
23

23

00:01:53.830  -->  00:01:57.980
put it to a list of data frame objects.
24

24

00:01:57.980  -->  00:02:03.009
So to show you what I mean, I'm going to
create an object called d-frame list,
25

25

00:02:04.580  -->  00:02:08.673
and then from that, I'm going to use
26

26

00:02:08.673  -->  00:02:14.302
pd.io.html.read_html.
27

27

00:02:14.302  -->  00:02:18.850
I'm gonna read that URL that I just did.
28

28

00:02:18.850  -->  00:02:24.130
This is going to grab data
29

29

00:02:24.130  -->  00:02:28.016
from the HTML and
put it into a list of dataframe objects.
30

30

00:02:28.016  -->  00:02:32.799
So let's let our dframe, our dataframe
31

31

00:02:32.799  -->  00:02:37.450
equal to the first object in that list.
32

32

00:02:39.190  -->  00:02:41.770
And then we're gonna show it as well.
33

33

00:02:44.630  -->  00:02:45.700
Nice.
34

34

00:02:45.700  -->  00:02:50.220
So now the first object in that data
frame list, we just took it, and
35

35

00:02:50.220  -->  00:02:52.440
then we acquired this data frame.
36

36

00:02:52.440  -->  00:02:55.750
If we take a look at the actual website,
so
37

37

00:02:55.750  -->  00:02:59.260
we'll copy and paste this into my browser.
38

38

00:03:03.900  -->  00:03:07.910
So we just copied this list right here,
this failed bank list.
39

39

00:03:09.200  -->  00:03:09.700
Cool.
40

40

00:03:11.930  -->  00:03:12.900
Now we got that going.
41

41

00:03:14.240  -->  00:03:16.690
Notice how we have null values where
42

42

00:03:16.690  -->  00:03:19.350
Pandas wasn't able to
find any other values.
43

43

00:03:20.540  -->  00:03:23.450
So let's say you just
wanna know the columns.
44

44

00:03:23.450  -->  00:03:29.530
We can just, as we've learned before,
just ask for the column values.
45

45

00:03:29.530  -->  00:03:31.070
And let's see what we got.
46

46

00:03:31.070  -->  00:03:37.430
So we got the bank name, the city,
the state, CERT, acquiring institution,
47

47

00:03:37.430  -->  00:03:42.530
etcetera, etcetera, all the way
to the Closing and Updated Date.
48

48

00:03:42.530  -->  00:03:46.060
So we got all that information and
it's now in a data frame.
49

49

00:03:46.060  -->  00:03:48.270
So we can do a bunch of stuff with it.
50

50

00:03:48.270  -->  00:03:51.780
What we've learned in the past
on working with data frames or
51

51

00:03:51.780  -->  00:03:56.170
whatever you really want to
do with this information.
52

52

00:03:56.170  -->  00:04:00.850
So that's how you open up HTML
files with pandas in python.
53

53

00:04:00.850  -->  00:04:05.511
The main take aways here are just
you're gonna need to use read_html,
54

54

00:04:05.511  -->  00:04:10.580
using pd.io.html.read_html on
55

55

00:04:10.580  -->  00:04:16.320
whatever that URL you decided to use
that happened to be in HTML, and then
56

56

00:04:16.320  -->  00:04:20.830
that will get you a list and you can grab
from that list to create your data frame.
57

57

00:04:22.300  -->  00:04:27.921
And then just make sure that you have
installed beautiful soup, and HTML5 LIB.
58

58

00:04:29.230  -->  00:04:30.640
Okay, that's it for this lecture.
59

59

00:04:30.640  -->  00:04:34.680
Next we're going to learn how
to work with Excel files.
60

60

00:04:34.680  -->  00:04:35.180
I'll see you there.
