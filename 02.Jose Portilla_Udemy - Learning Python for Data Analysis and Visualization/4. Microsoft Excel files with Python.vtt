00:00:01.200  -->  00:00:03.370
Hey guys, welcome to lecture 28.
2

2

00:00:03.370  -->  00:00:09.190
In this lecture, we're gonna learn how to
use Excel files with Python and pandas.
3

3

00:00:09.190  -->  00:00:13.030
So I'm just gonna start off
by importing pandas as pd.
4

4

00:00:13.030  -->  00:00:17.385
And then the important thing to know
here is you're gonna need to install two
5

5

00:00:17.385  -->  00:00:20.391
modules either using pip install or
conda install.
6

6

00:00:20.391  -->  00:00:27.398
Pip installs pretty easy just go to your
command line like you've done before and
7

7

00:00:27.398  -->  00:00:32.240
just type in pip install xlrd
is what we're gonna need,
8

8

00:00:32.240  -->  00:00:36.920
and we're also going to need
a pip install openpixl.
9

9

00:00:36.920  -->  00:00:40.710
So once you've pip installed
those guys in your command line
10

10

00:00:40.710  -->  00:00:42.540
you can use pandas with Excel.
11

11

00:00:42.540  -->  00:00:46.020
So how do we open an Excel file?
12

12

00:00:46.020  -->  00:00:50.410
Well I've made an Excel file, so you can
ahead and open up Excel and make a file.
13

13

00:00:50.410  -->  00:00:57.350
In this file I've just put on the first
row and first column, This is a test.
14

14

00:00:57.350  -->  00:01:03.010
And then I just made a five
by three set of numbers.
15

15

00:01:03.010  -->  00:01:04.420
Just random numbers, it doesn't matter.
16

16

00:01:04.420  -->  00:01:06.418
I'm just gonna go ahead and save this.
17

17

00:01:06.418  -->  00:01:12.863
It's called lec_28_test, and
I only have information on sheet one.
18

18

00:01:15.505  -->  00:01:19.370
And I just saved that in the same folder,
where my IPython notebooks are stored.
19

19

00:01:20.960  -->  00:01:23.180
So go ahead and make an Excel file, or
20

20

00:01:23.180  -->  00:01:27.660
download one, store it in the same
place where your IPython notebooks are.
21

21

00:01:27.660  -->  00:01:33.552
Once you've done that, you can go
ahead and name an object xlsfile.
22

22

00:01:38.376  -->  00:01:40.827
And then using pd.excelfile
23

23

00:01:44.947  -->  00:01:54.020
We can type in the name of that file,
xlsx.
24

24

00:01:55.570  -->  00:01:58.119
Really similar to how
we imported csv files.
25

25

00:01:58.119  -->  00:02:00.950
Whoops, Lec.
26

26

00:02:02.830  -->  00:02:05.590
There we go,
that's what I called the file, and
27

27

00:02:05.590  -->  00:02:10.190
then we can set a dframe to parse that.
28

28

00:02:10.190  -->  00:02:15.490
So we can say xlsfile.parse and we're just
29

29

00:02:15.490  -->  00:02:19.960
gonna parse that first sheet in
the Excel file, which was called Sheet1.
30

30

00:02:19.960  -->  00:02:25.100
And let's go ahead and
look at what that dframe looks like.
31

31

00:02:26.520  -->  00:02:27.220
And there we have it.
32

32

00:02:27.220  -->  00:02:31.090
So we have that This is a test
as that first column name.
33

33

00:02:31.090  -->  00:02:34.680
It's automatically indexed all the rows,
0 through 4.
34

34

00:02:34.680  -->  00:02:37.670
It's put our numbers where we
didn't have named columns.
35

35

00:02:37.670  -->  00:02:41.476
It just left them as Unnamed: 1,
Unnamed: 2, etc.
36

36

00:02:41.476  -->  00:02:45.810
And that's how you import
Excel files using pandas.
37

37

00:02:45.810  -->  00:02:47.860
There's a lot of extra
features you can use,
38

38

00:02:47.860  -->  00:02:52.200
if you wanted to open up a certain
amount of columns or rows.
39

39

00:02:52.200  -->  00:02:57.300
If you want to learn more about that, you
can just go to the pandas documentation.
40

40

00:02:57.300  -->  00:02:59.429
There's a lot of different
arguments you can pass.
41

41

00:02:59.429  -->  00:03:02.306
You can pass headers,
you can say skip rows,
42

42

00:03:02.306  -->  00:03:07.045
you can index the columns in a certain
manner, you can parse the columns.
43

43

00:03:07.045  -->  00:03:10.800
So there's a lot of options you can do.
44

44

00:03:10.800  -->  00:03:12.994
At this point it would be up to you,
45

45

00:03:12.994  -->  00:03:18.020
depending on what you want to do with
this certain Excel file you're opening.
46

46

00:03:18.020  -->  00:03:23.244
So I'll let you go ahead and check out
the documentation there, but as far
47

47

00:03:23.244  -->  00:03:28.971
as just opening Excel files, all you need
to do is pip install these two modules,
48

48

00:03:28.971  -->  00:03:33.943
xlrd, openpyxl, set an object and
use pd.ExcelFile to open it, and
49

49

00:03:33.943  -->  00:03:38.780
then you can parse through the Excel
file to create your data frame.
50

50

00:03:39.800  -->  00:03:42.523
Okay, that's it for this section.
51

51

00:03:42.523  -->  00:03:46.291
Next up we're going to learn about
a lot of various data frame techniques
52

52

00:03:46.291  -->  00:03:49.380
that we can use on our
data to perform analysis.
53

53

00:03:49.380  -->  00:03:49.890
All right.
54

54

00:03:49.890  -->  00:03:50.410
I'll see you there.
