00:00:02,241  -->  00:00:03,001
Hey, everyone.
2

2

00:00:03,001  -->  00:00:06,181
So in this video, we're just gonna
be looking over the t-distribution.
3

3

00:00:06,181  -->  00:00:09,681
This is just part of
small sampling theory.
4

4

00:00:09,681  -->  00:00:12,821
So before you learn about this, you should
learn about the normal distribution.
5

5

00:00:12,821  -->  00:00:19,542
For previous distributions, your sample
size was assumed large, so N>30.
6

6

00:00:19,542  -->  00:00:23,876
But for sample sizes that are less
than 30, you're gonna have to use
7

7

00:00:23,876  -->  00:00:28,521
a t-distribution, which is sometimes
known as a student distribution.
8

8

00:00:28,521  -->  00:00:34,301
So the t-distribution allows for
a use of small samples.
9

9

00:00:34,301  -->  00:00:38,593
And the reason it can do this is it
does it by sacrificing certainty
10

10

00:00:38,593  -->  00:00:40,818
with a margin of error tradeoff.
11

11

00:00:40,818  -->  00:00:45,633
So the t-distribution takes into account
the sample size using n-1 degrees of
12

12

00:00:45,633  -->  00:00:50,024
freedom, which means there's gonna
be a different t-distribution for
13

13

00:00:50,024  -->  00:00:51,890
every different sample size.
14

14

00:00:51,890  -->  00:00:55,009
So if you see the t-distribution
against the normal distribution,
15

15

00:00:55,009  -->  00:00:58,251
you'll notice the tail ends increase and
the peak gets squished down.
16

16

00:00:58,251  -->  00:01:04,170
Almost as if you have a larger standard
deviation than a normal distribution.
17

17

00:01:05,750  -->  00:01:08,463
So what's really important to
know is that as your end or
18

18

00:01:08,463  -->  00:01:12,565
your number of samples gets larger, the
t-distribution eventually will converge
19

19

00:01:12,565  -->  00:01:14,660
into looking like a normal distribution.
20

20

00:01:14,660  -->  00:01:19,220
And that cutoff occurs at about 30,
which is why when you have less than 30,
21

21

00:01:19,220  -->  00:01:23,801
you should be using t-distribution above
that, it's okay to use the normal.
22

22

00:01:23,801  -->  00:01:25,181
It really depends on your particular case.
23

23

00:01:29,000  -->  00:01:32,045
So to further explain degrees of freedom
and how it relates to t-distribution,
24

24

00:01:32,045  -->  00:01:34,730
you can think of degrees of freedom
as an adjustment to the sample size,
25

25

00:01:34,730  -->  00:01:37,910
such as n-1 and this kind of connected to
the idea that we're estimating something
26

26

00:01:37,910  -->  00:01:38,881
of a larger population.
27

27

00:01:38,881  -->  00:01:47,600
And in practice, it gives us lightly
larger margin of error than the estimate.
28

28

00:01:49,210  -->  00:01:53,156
So if you define this
new variable t as such,
29

29

00:01:53,156  -->  00:01:57,421
it's analogous to the z
statistic given by this
30

30

00:01:57,421  -->  00:02:02,450
equation here that we used
in the normal distribution.
31

31

00:02:02,450  -->  00:02:07,439
So the distribution for a t or
a student distribution can
32

32

00:02:07,439  -->  00:02:12,536
be obtained using this formula and
this gamma function is
33

33

00:02:12,536  -->  00:02:17,525
defined as this here,
(n-1) factorial and v or mu,
34

34

00:02:17,525  -->  00:02:23,999
depending on what you wanna call it is
the number of degrees of freedom and
35

35

00:02:23,999  -->  00:02:28,591
is typically equal to
n-1 in t-distributions.
36

36

00:02:28,591  -->  00:02:31,295
Similar to a Z-score table
with a normal distribution,
37

37

00:02:31,295  -->  00:02:35,014
there is a t-distribution uses a t table
and knowing the degrees of freedom and
38

38

00:02:35,014  -->  00:02:36,891
the desired cumulative probability.
39

39

00:02:36,891  -->  00:02:44,116
For any example,
where your probability is greater than or
40

40

00:02:44,116  -->  00:02:48,891
equal to t, you can find the value of t.
41

41

00:02:48,891  -->  00:02:52,151
So you can,
here's an example of a lookup table link.
42

42

00:02:52,151  -->  00:02:59,650
So if I just click this,
open it in a new tab.
43

43

00:02:59,650  -->  00:03:02,621
This is what it looks like.
So here, you have your one tail or
44

44

00:03:02,621  -->  00:03:03,531
two tails.
45

45

00:03:03,531  -->  00:03:07,491
That just depends if you're looking
at the whole distribution or
46

46

00:03:07,491  -->  00:03:12,099
half of distributions and then your
degrees of freedom on the left column and
47

47

00:03:12,099  -->  00:03:15,852
then your cumulative probability
that you're looking for.
48

48

00:03:15,852  -->  00:03:18,931
So what's your confidence level?
49

49

00:03:18,931  -->  00:03:21,811
Does it fall between 90% of all values?
50

50

00:03:21,811  -->  00:03:22,511
Et cetera, et cetera.
51

51

00:03:22,511  -->  00:03:26,370
And you can use that table or
there's also online calculators.
52

52

00:03:29,571  -->  00:03:31,871
So go ahead and
read up on the t-distribution.
53

53

00:03:31,871  -->  00:03:36,773
If this wasn't enough for you,
you can check out the links down here for
54

54

00:03:36,773  -->  00:03:38,440
the t-distribution.
55

55

00:03:38,440  -->  00:03:39,555
And then real quickly,
56

56

00:03:39,555  -->  00:03:42,970
I'll show you how we can get
the t-distribution in Python using psi pi.
57

57

00:03:42,970  -->  00:03:47,669
So just like before,
I'm gonna import matplotlib.pyplot as PLT,
58

58

00:03:47,669  -->  00:03:52,286
matplotlib in line to see the plots and
then from the stats library,
59

59

00:03:52,286  -->  00:03:54,971
what you're gonna do is import just t.
60

60

00:03:54,971  -->  00:03:56,140
That's all it is.
61

61

00:03:57,480  -->  00:04:01,340
And then from numpy,
let's import numpy's np.
62

62

00:04:01,340  -->  00:04:03,341
So, I'll create the x range.
63

63

00:04:03,341  -->  00:04:06,537
In this case, I'll go from -5 to 5 and
64

64

00:04:06,537  -->  00:04:11,050
I'll do it using linearly
spaced 100 digits there and
65

65

00:04:11,050  -->  00:04:14,921
then I can just create a t
distribution of psi pi.
66

66

00:04:14,921  -->  00:04:17,900
So in this case,
I'll I'll have that value be 3.
67

67

00:04:17,900  -->  00:04:20,583
Three samples there and
68

68

00:04:20,583  -->  00:04:25,821
then I can plot the PDF
versus the x range here.
69

69

00:04:25,821  -->  00:04:31,217
And I do that just by saying, plt.plot
x and then I call that probability
70

70

00:04:31,217  -->  00:04:36,801
density function, the rv, distribution
I just made for all the x values.
71

71

00:04:36,801  -->  00:04:41,141
So go ahead and
take a look further into this.
72

72

00:04:41,141  -->  00:04:42,641
Make sure you understand how it works.
73

73

00:04:42,641  -->  00:04:47,425
And as an exercise to you,
what you should do is plot the normal
74

74

00:04:47,425  -->  00:04:51,014
distribution versus the t-distribution and
75

75

00:04:51,014  -->  00:04:56,361
then test out as you increase
the value of n for the t-distribution.
76

76

00:04:56,361  -->  00:05:00,281
As it goes past 30, go ahead and see how
it converges to the normal distribution.
77

77

00:05:00,281  -->  00:05:05,602
So again, there's additional resources
to be found at the bottom of this link.
78

78

00:05:05,602  -->  00:05:07,701
Go ahead and check it out there.
79

79

00:05:07,701  -->  00:05:09,030
Thanks, guys.
