00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:05,430
In this final video in the HVM L5 section we'll be looking at just a small number of remaining cool

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:11,700
features of HDMI 5 and why we might want to use them to start off one of the biggest philosophical changes

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:19,110
behind HVM L5 is that we're now aiming to make our HDMI out more human readable than it was before and

4
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,750
this has led to a number of changes on the styling front.

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,420
For example changing be too strong but it's also led to some new elements some of which we've actually

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,820
seen in the bootstrap section of the course and in wordpress as well.

7
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:41,400
So one of them is the article which is essentially just a div that's used for article content so it

8
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,140
would be the main content section of a blog post for example.

9
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,400
But then we can style it directly

10
00:00:51,180 --> 00:01:02,080
using article without using any classes or IDs say something like that.

11
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,860
Let's take a look there again.

12
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:17,010
There are a number of other elements which are essentially just divs but renamed to make your HMO more

13
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:27,570
readable and they are header footer Article Section nav and menu.

14
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,760
Again some of which we've seen before.

15
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:37,320
But all of these are essentially divs but we just use these names to make our HMO more standardized

16
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,510
and readable.

17
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:43,890
One small note is that Internet Explorer at the time of recording will by default give these elements

18
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:50,670
a display of in line which means they'll appear to the right of previous elements rather than a display

19
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:58,250
of block which means that they will stretch to the whole width of that container and go into a new line.

20
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,730
And that's normally what we want for these div like elements.

21
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:08,880
So if you're going to be using them it's recommended to put display as blog to make sure that they're

22
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,360
displayed correctly in Internet Explorer.

23
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:18,990
We can even create our own elements which is pretty if I'm using javascript so we can use something

24
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:26,910
like document don't create elements let's say we wanted to call an element a container.

25
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:38,660
And then we could use container in each DML as well.

26
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,900
Which is quite different.

27
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:49,210
What we're talking about new elements is also a new image containing elements called figer

28
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:58,830
and this is designed to help us put captions and connects those with images.

29
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,230
So let's say we've got an image

30
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,280
let's just go and find one quickly

31
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,960
let's have Maggie Simpson

32
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,180
so we'll just feed that image.

33
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,670
Every gay copy you are al great.

34
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,170
Just make sure that is displaying properly that we get.

35
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:38,490
And while we're out in an image it's worth stating that in HCM L5 for an image to be direct HTL it has

36
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:46,310
to have an old tag so all images should have all tags in H.A. five.

37
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:51,580
And then if you want to have our caption we use fake caption

38
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:06,440
and then just put something like Mike Simpson and then if we have a look and see that the caption is

39
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:12,530
nicely aligned to the image obviously we probably want to style that to make it display how we want.

40
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:18,230
But again the aim is really to make each DML readable and to see that this is definitely supposed to

41
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:22,300
be a caption related to this particular image.

42
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:28,970
While we're talking about new tags This one's not exactly new.

43
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:35,890
That has been redefined and we can now use small to display some small text

44
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:47,980
if I wanted to quote the location of this image source then I could do that easily using small.

45
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:57,810
And the last new one I'll show you is Mark which essentially highlights your text.

46
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,650
Take a look that we get.

47
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:07,780
We've seen this next one before particularly in the mobile app section but we can now add data attributes

48
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,630
with anything we like.

49
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:16,490
So I might want to add data description and then use baby or something like that.

50
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,820
This would be perfectly valid.

51
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,520
Tim L..

52
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:24,680
I can put whatever word I like in there and then if I want to access that and get the value of that

53
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,490
tag at some point I can do that easily with javascript

54
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,730
which I remember I don't need the type variable and they enabled him at 5.

55
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,070
I'll just get this an ID

56
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,400
so to access the data description.

57
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:57,150
I use document to get element by id and then get the element by its ID and then get attribute and attribute

58
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:03,640
that I want to get is data description and then for now I could just let that

59
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,410
should I let you be.

60
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,100
Everything or just comment that out find out.

61
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,890
And now there's just two more things left.

62
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,110
I'd like to show you.

63
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:21,110
The first is a new type of input called range

64
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:26,410
which is very simply a slider.

65
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,850
You can see it on the bottom there and we can slide from left to right to choose value.

66
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,130
We can specify some options as well.

67
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:38,240
So we could specify what the minimum value is.

68
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:42,280
So we if from zero there what the maximum value is.

69
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:47,160
So maybe 100 and we can also specify the step value.

70
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:55,440
So we might want it to go up in tens or ones depending on our form and then that doesn't change the

71
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,530
look of the slider.

72
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:03,090
But it does if we change the step to something high you'll notice that we can any of them pick particular

73
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:03,960
values.

74
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:11,280
So it jumps up and down and then we can get a result of that either through javascript's using Vau or

75
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,870
through our form when it's submitted via page pate.

76
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:15,700
Excellent.

77
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:25,530
So one more thing and I've saved one of the best features to last and this one is the content editable

78
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,900
feature which essentially makes any content on your Web site editable by the user.

79
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:43,110
So if I just add some code here or just some straightforward text and we then refresh the page as the

80
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,400
user.

81
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:52,420
I can now go in and edit that text directly.

82
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:58,930
So you could use that to create a diary or interactive coding application.

83
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:05,800
And one advantage over say text areas is that we can use this on any element type so if we wanted to

84
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:16,870
create a to do list app for example we could make the UL content editable or just put an example list

85
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,210
element in there.

86
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,470
And then if we take a look.

87
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,630
So we can now edit

88
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:32,980
the options that are there but we can also add options of our own and the formatting is maintained.

89
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:38,340
So we're getting a new list item as we add a new item on our to do list.

90
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:44,860
So that takes us to the end of what we're going to look at from HDMI 5.

91
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:49,730
Now it's time to look at one of the major new specifications that goes along with it and that's CSSA

92
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:50,240
3.
