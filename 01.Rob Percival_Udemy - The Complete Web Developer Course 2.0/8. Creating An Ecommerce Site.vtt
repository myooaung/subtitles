00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.610
The second sort of site I'm going to show you how to set up with Wordpress is an e-commerce site or

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.560
an online shop like a blog.

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.850
This is the sort of site that if you're coding from scratch it actually takes you a really long time

4
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:12.670
to set up.

5
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.240
You've got to have a system for adding and managing products integrating payment systems and managing

6
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.090
customer accounts with wordpress though it's really simple.

7
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.780
Now what we're doing here is not actually specific to the extreme you could use anything to do this

8
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.910
but the X theme does support the plug in that we're about to use very well.

9
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.490
So we're going to add a new plug in.

10
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:40.390
There are a number of online shop plug ins that we could use but there's one that's become almost the

11
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:49.310
standard and that is wu Comus so it's free to use at the basic level but it has all the options that

12
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.130
you would want in an online shop.

13
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.170
So there it is good ratings over a million installs.

14
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.140
It's very widely used.

15
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:07.070
So definitely what I would recommend if you want to set up an online shop if you're not sure that you

16
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.320
would want to set up an online shop by the way.

17
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.500
I really would encourage you to sell something on your Web site.

18
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.890
I really don't mind what it is.

19
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.480
And you might feel that you don't have anything worth selling but it's a really good experience to start

20
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.320
selling something small online.

21
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.880
It might be that you could write a book explaining how to do something you could create art and sell

22
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.100
that or even create a WordPress theme or plug in and sell that on your site as well.

23
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.200
It's a really great experience to create and market a product I really recommend you give it a go if

24
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.420
you can think of anything at all you might want to create.

25
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.960
All right.

26
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.600
So we've got we come up plug in installed.

27
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.450
Let's activate it and see how we set it up.

28
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.240
Here we go.

29
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.870
So we has got a really nice and friendly set up process.

30
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.960
So first off it creates these default pages for us.

31
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.320
So the shopping page Baskett check out my account again.

32
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.790
Just imagine how much work it would be to set all of this up if you weren't using some sort of plug

33
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.480
in like this.

34
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.340
Then we just put in some options for our shop.

35
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:26.210
I'll keep those defaults and then shipping and tax those are up to you.

36
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.220
I'd definitely recommend selling digital products if you possibly can just because they're so much less

37
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.190
hassle than physical ones.

38
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.080
Now here you can add your paypal email address.

39
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.560
I would recommend Paypal is a simple way of accepting payments online and I would avoid these options

40
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.040
unless you really have to offer them for some reason.

41
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.680
I'll skip that for now though.

42
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.570
And again I'm going to allow us to take some diagnostic data.

43
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.550
Seems only fair.

44
00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:07.480
And then I'm going to create my first product so let's imagine that I've written a book on how to create

45
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.990
an online shop with commerce

46
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.450
excellent.

47
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.870
Yes.

48
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.030
Thank you very much.

49
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.710
So a quick description

50
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.560
we get the idea.

51
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:47.260
So you can offer product categories put in a price and even schedule various sale options put in the

52
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.700
description.

53
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.320
If you're working with physical products then you can manage the stock there as well.

54
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.410
Work out what you're going to charge for shipping.

55
00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.240
You can even link products in a sort of recommended way.

56
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.200
So if they're looking at buying this book they might want to buy a similar book that you've written

57
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.050
and you can change some other settings for products as well.

58
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:18.810
You can also add an image choose categories in just the same way that we have post categories and then

59
00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:26.630
you can publish your product.

60
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.220
Here we go and let's have a look.

61
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.980
Have the products in action.

62
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.250
There it is.

63
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:42.830
So you can see we've got a review system set up and it already looks pretty nice and I can then add

64
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:43.640
it to my basket

65
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.900
then view my basket.

66
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.220
You can get out coupon codes if you want.

67
00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:05.270
Proceed to check out putting your in details and then place order.

68
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.910
So within just a few clicks you've got a complete shopping system set up on your Web site.

69
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:17.290
You'll notice that the shop doesn't appear automatically on the menu on the site there so it will need

70
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.430
to add that.

71
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.310
Let's get back to the dashboard

72
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:30.150
and then we'll look at appearance and menus.

73
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.630
And here's our menu down the left there.

74
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:48.990
So I want to add the shop to it so I just click on the shop page at the menu and save menu as well as

75
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.140
using cornerstone to edit our pages.

76
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:57.080
We can still use all of the standard theme editing options as well.

77
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.680
So now if we refresh that we should see the shop in the menu.

78
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:05.950
There we go.

79
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:11.870
And this is where all of our products would display with Ideally some nice pretty images as well.

80
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.520
And that's pretty much all there is to it.

81
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:20.060
The great advantage of using something like Wordpress along with a premium plugin like X and an online

82
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:26.700
shop plug in like commerce is that it enables you to set up the bones of a standard site very very easily.

83
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.860
So you can spend your time doing more interesting things like creating great products for people to

84
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.030
buy or great blog posts for people to read in their next video.

85
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.350
I'll set you the challenge for this section.

86
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.040
I think you might be able to anticipate what it's going to be.
