Local storage is a way of stored data permanently for your website or mobile app on the user's computer

2
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:08.570
or phone.

3
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.910
It's pretty easy to use.

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.700
And I'm just going to get rid of all our code here to avoid any confusion because what we're doing here

5
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:24.880
is not unique to us by any means but I am going to keep the Zapato.

6
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.220
J.S. so that we can use the jey query features

7
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.210
that we get so

8
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:53.010
let's just show that and that should be closed script with a type of text javascript.

9
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.570
All right so the first thing that you should do before using local storage is check that the browser

10
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.560
supports it because some browsers don't and you don't want to be assuming that you'll use a browser

11
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.380
does and then have your app not work properly.

12
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:16.240
So we check that it works using IF and then typeof and then we look at the storage

13
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.550
variable.

14
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.790
And if that's not equal to undefined

15
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.900
then we get to go.

16
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.580
So for now I would just alert local storage is guy

17
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:49.600
and if it's not supported then you might want to alert something please upgrade your browser or something

18
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.770
like that to let the user know that the local storage features of your app are not going to work.

19
00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:58.500
So let's have a look.

20
00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.020
Local storage is go fantastic.

21
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.630
That should certainly be the case for pretty much any modern browser that you use.

22
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:13.920
So then how do we use local storage as I say it's pretty straightforward to save an item in local storage.

23
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.700
We just use set item.

24
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:23.940
So local storage with a capital S does set item and then we might want to set the user's name

25
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.900
to be Rob.

26
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.970
Simple as that.

27
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:43.570
And then if we want to get it back we just use local storage to get item and then name.

28
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.590
Let's take a look.

29
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:46.270
Should a.

30
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.880
Rob.

31
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:55.940
That's great but it's nothing too special until we comment out that first line and then we run the app

32
00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:06.260
again and it still knows who I am and indeed we can even shut the browser tab down open it up again.

33
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.950
And it still knows who I am.

34
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.020
So this is really a permanent story.

35
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.480
Unless your user actively cleans their browser cache which they can't actually do if you're working

36
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.110
in a mobile app anyway then you really can assume that this is permanent storage.

37
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:32.380
So that's pretty much all there is to it except you might want to do arrays in local storage and that's

38
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.710
not that straightforward.

39
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.990
So I'm going to set you a challenge to go online and figure out how to store and retrieve an array in

40
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.090
local storage for

41
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.430
have you managed it.

42
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:52.780
Let's do a quick Google.

43
00:03:52.830 --> 00:04:03.490
So I'd give something like local storage save Auray And here we go javascript how to store an array

44
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.040
in local storage so local storage only supports strings.

45
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:17.090
So we'd need to essentially convert our right to Jaison and convert it back in order to save it in local

46
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.940
storage.

47
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.440
So this looks pretty good.

48
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.430
Let's use this code so Cummins out both of those lines.

49
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:37.200
So we're setting up an empty array called names and then we're creating a prompt that we haven't actually

50
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.880
used before.

51
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.650
But this is just like an alert that it allows the user to enter some data and it sets that equal to

52
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.940
the first item in the array.

53
00:04:50.010 --> 00:05:00.240
And then it sets the item names within local storage to Jaison version of the array names and then to

54
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.410
get it back.

55
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:10.740
We use store names Jason pass so that converts it from Jason to an array and then we just use local

56
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:19.920
storage get item and then the Jason kind of names and then to check that that's worked.

57
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.700
Let's get names.

58
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:24.680
Zero.

59
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:31.100
So that should be equal to the name.

60
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.830
I'm just about to enter.

61
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.660
OK here we go.

62
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.000
So let's have a different name just for fun.

63
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.790
Kirsten and then it's saved it as customer.

64
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:52.720
And then let's just alert store names 0 just to prove to ourselves that we have indeed gotten it right

65
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:58.140
here and that the zero value is what I'm just about to enter.

66
00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.310
So let's have a look.

67
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.180
I'll put in Keston and there we go.

68
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:13.800
That's looking promising but of course the real proof of the pudding is that if we comment out the code

69
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:21.650
to save the array and we just retrieve it we still get the data back.

70
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:24.630
Wonderful.

71
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:29.720
So that's how we use local storage to save and retrieve variables and arrays.

72
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.230
We are now in a position to create our email client app.
