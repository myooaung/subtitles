00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.360
Right now we've seen how to fade in and out content.

2
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.320
We're going to start animating our content.

3
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.420
So we're going to get some great looking stuff moving all over the place.

4
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.330
So I'm going to quickly go back to my green circle

5
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:37.150
guy we get add the CSSA back in say with of 150 pixels height to 150 pixels for a radius 50 percent

6
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.430
and background color

7
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.080
that we get.

8
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.310
So let's animate this circle.

9
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.060
First off once again to make sure that it's completely in your head can you set up a function that does

10
00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.030
something I don't care what when the circle is clicked go for it.

11
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.490
All right.

12
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:16.930
You should have had a string and then are selected for the circle hash circle and then click and we

13
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.750
want to add a function with parentheses and then

14
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.100
I'll just do a quick test with something like that.

15
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.290
All right there we get it all connected up nicely.

16
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.820
So how does the J queery animate function work.

17
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.070
Well it's much like you would expect but there's a couple of slight complications to it.

18
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:50.390
So first off let's say we want to use this as a selector just to remind ourselves that exists.

19
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.550
And of course if we click on the circle then this is going to be the circle and if we want to animate

20
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.360
it fast it's easy enough.

21
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:05.600
We use the animate function and then we have to put some properties in.

22
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.810
First off the CSSA properties that we wanted to have at the end of the animation.

23
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.090
So let's say we want to increase it's with 400 pixels.

24
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:25.740
Gradually as the process of an animation the what we would do is we'd give the width and we then state

25
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.440
in quotes what we wanted that to be.

26
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.020
So 400 pixels like that.

27
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.690
However because this could be one of a number of different CSSA properties we could have several here

28
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.610
in one go as we will do in a minute.

29
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.770
We need this to be an array and to define it as an array.

30
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.960
We put it in brackets like that.

31
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.350
So that doesn't mean that this is a function or anything.

32
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:58.330
It means that this is one of potentially many CSSA instructions that we could put in that.

33
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.940
And in a minute we'll see how we can add other ones as well.

34
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.050
And then the other property that we need to give the animate function is the amount of time that we

35
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.510
want to take the animation.

36
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.070
So it's in milliseconds.

37
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:17.430
So let's go for something like 2000 milliseconds which would be two seconds all right.

38
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.490
So that will increase the width to 400 over to two seconds.

39
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.930
Let's take a look.

40
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.200
There it goes.

41
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.640
Nice notice because we've set the border radius to 50 percent.

42
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.540
It's still not quite circular as such but the border is at least all the way round it doesn't become

43
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.770
a rounded rectangle.

44
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.360
All right so let's have some real fun.

45
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.000
What if we wanted to change some more CSSA properties at the same time.

46
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.220
Well let's say we wanted to change the height to 400 pixels as well.

47
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.840
We put a comma in there and then we specify that we want the height to be and in quite spot wherever

48
00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.260
we want it to be.

49
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.410
So again 400 pixels.

50
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.070
Let's have a look at that area.

51
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.930
It's an hour grows in both width and height.

52
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.000
Now if we add many more of these it's going to get a bit confusing having them all on the same line

53
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.630
running on after each other.

54
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:23.110
So the general convention is to put our different attributes on different lines

55
00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.450
like that.

56
00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.150
And that's just a lot easier to read.

57
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.850
We can see the different attributes that we're changing and add them or remove them very quickly as

58
00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.750
necessary.

59
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.380
So remember you always need a camera in front of them.

60
00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.100
Let's say we wanted to move it around a little bit as well.

61
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:43.990
So we'll change the margins.

62
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:55.230
Now we use the javascript names for DSS properties here not the CSX names so instead of Marge dash left

63
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.670
we use margin and then left with a capital L.

64
00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.090
They're pretty easy to translate just whenever you see a hyphen or a dash.

65
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.830
Take it away and then capitalize the word after it.

66
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.410
So I imagine left let's change that to 100 pixels

67
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:19.600
and let's add in Margene top of 100 pixels as well.

68
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.260
All right let's take a look.

69
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.170
Every guy is moving and growing at the same time.

70
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.580
All right.

71
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.720
So feel free to mess around with that and change the animations as you wish.

72
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:40.320
One final little challenge for you is can you figure out a way to say change the background color of

73
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.240
this circle to read the moment the animation completes.

74
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:52.810
Go for it.

75
00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.060
All right did you figure that one out.

76
00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.840
Not super easy.

77
00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:05.120
We can add a callback function in the animate function just as we have done with fading in and out.

78
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:13.010
So we had it as an extra property in the function call and then function and parentheses

79
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:22.510
and then our curly brackets to contain whatever code we want to happen when the animation is complete.

80
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:30.150
And the things we want to do is to set the background of this thing to read say selected again using

81
00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.860
this.

82
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:42.540
And we set the background to read using SS and background color and rate.

83
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:43.890
Simple as that.

84
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.520
Let's take a look.

85
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:49.720
Wonderful.

86
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.770
So hopefully you could imagine using that on your website if you want to provide a bit of interactivity

87
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.210
and allow things to move or change size when they're clicked on.

88
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:04.420
And why not do it with a little bit of animation to make a web site that bit more fun to use.

89
00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:10.640
Now talking of fun to use one huge innovation in recent years on the web is the creation of web apps

90
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:17.210
and the primary differentiator of a web app is one way you can control and do a number of different

91
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:22.400
things on the page without reloading the page or clicking on a link to go on a new page.

92
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:27.710
And the vast majority of that happens using a technology called Ajax and that's what we're going to

93
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:29.300
look at in the next video.
