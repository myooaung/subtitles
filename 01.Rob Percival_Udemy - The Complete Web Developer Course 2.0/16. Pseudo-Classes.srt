1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,150
So you have actually seen a few pseudo classes before.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:10,530
Mostly we've use them when it comes to links.

3
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:23,120
So for example we've used a Coleman Hulver to perhaps add underlining to a link

4
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:36,530
when it's hovered over just like that but there's a lot more we can do than just style links.

5
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:42,210
We can also style inputs when they're focused

6
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:57,820
say for example I might change the background color see blue when my input comes under focus see how

7
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,390
that works out.

8
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:02,580
So there's my input and clicking on it then we'll turn it blue.

9
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,530
While we're on form elements.

10
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:19,880
We can also style form elements on the basis of whether they're enabled or disabled.

11
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,330
So I won't show you an example this time but you get the idea.

12
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,500
So normally that faded out by the browser if they're disabled.

13
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:33,180
I mean we might want to change that in some way and we can use this pseudo selector to select all disabled

14
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,270
inputs and style them in some way.

15
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:44,230
We can even look at checkboxes or radio elements and style them in a certain way when they're checked.

16
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:50,130
So that's a way of selecting form elements based on their status.

17
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,600
But we can also select elements based on their location.

18
00:01:53,820 --> 00:02:00,900
And one common way of selecting elements is using first child.

19
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,040
So this actually replicates something that we saw in the previous video and it enables us to select

20
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:11,820
the first paragraph in each of them containing elements so in this case the first paragraph in each

21
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,800
div.

22
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:22,960
So if we add another color to that's that's go for the lovely aquamarine then only the paragraphs that

23
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,600
are the first element will be selected.

24
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,550
We can do the same with last child

25
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,060
so let's make that one bigger again.

26
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,180
Here's a question for you.

27
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:48,370
Will that match any element in our page.

28
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:55,950
The answer is yes it will match this one because it's both the first child and the last child.

29
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,920
So it will be bigger and aquamarine.

30
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,960
And of course if I move this paragraph to the end of that div it will match that wanty

31
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:24,010
they have a set up here is we can look at only child maybe we'll make that one bold on that one as you

32
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:30,400
can imagine we'll style the elements which are the only elements within that container.

33
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:37,250
So in this case once again it's that one is that the first child doesn't select.

34
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:42,960
This paragraph here even though it's the first paragraph within the div because it's not the first element

35
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:51,720
within the div So if we wanted to select the first paragraph regardless of where it was we can use first

36
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,670
of type

37
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,870
and let's underline that one

38
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:13,550
so this will then underline all three of those because they're all the first of that type in that container.

39
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:19,780
So not just that selected this one as well because it's the first of its type in the body element even

40
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:24,860
though there are paragraph tags that come before it's there not directly inside the body.

41
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,710
So they don't count.

42
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,810
We can also use as you might imagine

43
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,580
last of type

44
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,850
and only of type

45
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,720
to select the last of each type in the container.

46
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:52,930
And the only type in the container as well I'm sure you can imagine how they work.

47
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,530
So I'll leave that as a comment.

48
00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:01,860
Now here we're going to get really fancy and we can select for example if we look at a table row we

49
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,820
could select every other table we're using.

50
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,690
And child.

51
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,040
And the rule is for any child you have to provide your rule.

52
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,390
So now you're going to need some mats for this I'm afraid.

53
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:24,090
But if you want to select every other row then your statement would be to N because you're selecting

54
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,300
rows 2 4 6 8 etc..

55
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:35,600
If you wanted to select every other row starting at the first one you could use two and minus 1 and

56
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,820
that would then select 1 3 5 et cetera.

57
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,710
So let's just quickly see that in action if we make ourselves a table

58
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,850
and then a table where I

59
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:04,060
it's not going to be a table full of me it's going to be my usual suspects.

60
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:08,870
There we go.

61
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:14,230
And then if we wanted to make every other one to have a green background

62
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,550
that's how we do it.

63
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,850
There we go.

64
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:30,000
So it's particularly useful for styling things like lists or tables where you want to separate out the

65
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,940
item from the one below.

66
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,310
There's a couple of other options here as well.

67
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:42,810
You can use and last child and that will then count backwards.

68
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:51,660
So instead of counting from the first to the last it will count from the last back to the first.

69
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:57,600
Similarly you can use and of type to only count

70
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,890
the elements of that type.

71
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:12,970
So for example here if we were doing the selecting within this div and of type we'd only select the

72
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,050
piece.

73
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:19,000
And the child itself looks at all of the children regardless of their type.

74
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,060
Usually that's not an issue because we're looking at either table rows or list items or something like

75
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:29,530
that so they're not interspersed with other elements but if they were then you could use that instead.

76
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:30,850
OK.

77
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,460
Few more for you.

78
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:36,160
First off we could select all the empty divs

79
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:46,820
so we might for example see just hide them so that there's no styling shade.

80
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:55,400
If they don't have any content we can use the not pseudo selector to select for example all the paragraphs

81
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,290
that are not of a class of green.

82
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,130
Maybe we want to make those plea

83
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:18,950
and we could use the C to select on its own to select say everything was not a div.

84
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:19,690
OK.

85
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:24,400
Your brain is probably exploding with pseudo classes right now but I'll just show you a couple more

86
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,090
things that we can do.

87
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:34,820
And one of those is to select the first letter of each.

88
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,700
Say paragraph or maybe you want to make that a little bit bigger.

89
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,370
And that will then select just the first letter.

90
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,660
We can also use fast line

91
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,570
and we're almost there.

92
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:08,210
The last suit I select I want to show you is actually a pseudo element which is essentially some content

93
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,930
or styles that we can create at the end of an element.

94
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:20,290
So for example if we wanted the linked location to appear after every link in our code.

95
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,030
I'll just add nature here.

96
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,000
So we get the idea.

97
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:26,280
Let's use that

98
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,270
we can use a colon after

99
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,230
to add some content.

100
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:45,270
And this could even be something like.

101
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:51,970
This is a link and if we look at that you see it's added that content there.

102
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,460
Or we could create some dynamic content

103
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,000
by putting

104
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,430
ITTL for attribute and then Streff

105
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:15,180
and that would then put the actual link itself after that link to make it make a bit more sense.

106
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:22,090
You might want to put this in brackets and baps at a space

107
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,030
so that it reads better.

108
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:36,040
You could even style that part of it different by putting the styles in here if you wanted.

109
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:41,020
So I think that's probably enough for you to recall for now is hopefully given you an idea of all the

110
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:45,300
different ways that we can select objects using pseudo selectors.

111
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,510
You can always come back to this point as a reference.

112
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:51,670
You don't need to keep all of these in your head but it's good to know that they're available when you

113
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,500
find yourself needing something like that.

114
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,970
While building a web site.

115
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,700
OK if all of that was a little bit dry for you we're going to look at something a bit more visual now.

116
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:02,860
And that is gradients and shadows.
