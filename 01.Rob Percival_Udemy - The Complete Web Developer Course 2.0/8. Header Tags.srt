1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,180
So now we have our first Web page up and running.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:09,420
We're going to look at some specific TNL tags that we can use to make our Web sites look like something

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,680
other than just plain text.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,580
And in this video we'll be looking at head attacks so I'm going to get rid of the text that my first

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,390
web page and I'm going to do my first head attack.

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:26,660
Now do you remember how we do that from the example dot com that we looked at a couple of years ago.

7
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,850
If so then try putting it ahead a tag go for it.

8
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,600
I managed it.

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,790
If not don't worry we open a tag in the normal way with our angle brackets and then the first header

10
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:46,780
tag we can to use is each one and then my text editor gives me the closing tag as well which is very

11
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,420
handy if yours doesn't then just write it out manually.

12
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,350
It's not a problem.

13
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:54,700
And I'm going to type.

14
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,800
This is a big head.

15
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,820
And let's have a look.

16
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,430
Will say that.

17
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:02,440
And take a look.

18
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,110
There we go.

19
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:09,010
So you can see this is what an H1 tag looks like with no custom styling.

20
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:14,400
It's a nice big bold header and that's about it.

21
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:18,140
That's all we can do with an H1 tag with an H2 tag

22
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:25,830
as you might guess.

23
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,540
It's quite a big header not quite as big as H-1 But let's have a look.

24
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:32,600
There we go.

25
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:36,910
So it's bigger than normal text and bold but smaller than an H1.

26
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,720
So you can probably see where this is going.

27
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,370
We can have an H-3

28
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:55,340
and it's getting smaller and smaller as we go on and I'm actually just going to copy and paste so you

29
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,380
don't have to see me type out each one.

30
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,600
So that's going to be an H for.

31
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,500
Let's have a quick look at that.

32
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:10,920
So obviously we're getting smaller and smaller every time and we can keep going.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,020
So 5

34
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:21,730
smaller again we're actually getting smaller than normal text here and we can keep going.

35
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,890
We can have an eight six header as well.

36
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,690
I must say at this point they very rarely use the 8:06 head.

37
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,720
I don't think I've ever gone beyond an H for in any of the Web sites that I've used.

38
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,690
So it's very unlikely you'll use an 8.

39
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:41,630
But just to point out if we try and use an 8 7 header

40
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,110
we get back to normal text.

41
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:54,220
So there is actually not an 8 7 header because H7 doesn't exist so we can't use an 87 head.

42
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:59,470
If we try to do it it'll just give us normal text as if it hasn't recognized the tag so headers go all

43
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,470
the way from 8 1 to 6.

44
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:08,380
But to be honest you're probably only use H1 H2 and maybe H-3 in your documents and occasionally possibly

45
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,020
age 4.

46
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:16,000
But as I say I've never used an H5 or an 86 but head attacks are very useful and are also good for getting

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,800
your site listed in Google.

48
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:23,590
If you put your important keywords that is the words that you want your site to appear for in Google

49
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:28,780
in an H1 tag then they're much more likely to appear higher up the Google search results than if you

50
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,430
just put them in normal text.

51
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:35,890
So I definitely recommend using H-1 tags on all your pages and probably H-2 tags as well.

52
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,540
If you've got some slightly smaller headings that you want to use.

53
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:44,620
All right so now you're an expert in head of tags in the next video we're going to look at paragraph

54
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:49,790
tags which was the other formatting tags that we saw in the example dot com Web site.
