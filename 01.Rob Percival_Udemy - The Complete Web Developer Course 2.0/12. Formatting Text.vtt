00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:00.770
Right.

2
00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.910
So now you're familiar with paragraph tags and line breaks we're going to see if we can customize the

3
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.730
look of our text a little bit more.

4
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.880
As you might have guessed we're going to use a range of tags to do that.

5
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.980
So first off we're going to look at how to make some text bold.

6
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.180
And there are two ways that we can do that.

7
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:24.050
The first that I'll show you is the B tag which as you might imagine is short for bold.

8
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.110
So if we just pop B and then slash be around a certain letter or a string of letters then we have a

9
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:31.730
look at that.

10
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.930
That will come out bold.

11
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.640
Fantastic.

12
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.210
Simple as that.

13
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.790
The B tag is perfectly valid.

14
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:38.760
H t m l.

15
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:47.490
But generally it's encouraged to use the strong tag instead which does exactly the same thing but is

16
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:48.890
a little bit easier to read.

17
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.750
So it's strong just makes it clear in your email that you want this to be displayed strongly and clearly

18
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.160
and boldly.

19
00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.540
So you're welcome to use be all strong and you will see both of those when you're looking at the code

20
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.370
of other sites.

21
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.330
I recommend using strong if you've got the choice.

22
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.280
Next we'll look at it taluk text.

23
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.230
And similarly we've got two tags that we can use.

24
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.490
The first one just like the bold tag is I.

25
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.770
So there is some italic text.

26
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.760
Let's have a look.

27
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.140
There it is so nice and italic and the second one.

28
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.940
So instead of strong we've got E-M which is short for emphasis.

29
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.110
There we go.

30
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.190
And again it looks exactly the same but is generally considered better form to use E-M which is slightly

31
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.920
clearer than I in terms of its meaning but you will see both when you're looking at the code of existing

32
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.870
web sites and you can use either in HCM L5.

33
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.310
Next we'll look at underlining some text.

34
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:54.710
So we'll get rid of our line break and we'll look at some underlined text as you might guess we can

35
00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:01.440
use the you tag the underlined text to have a little look.

36
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.040
That's the underlined text like that.

37
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.990
Now the tag has an interesting history and was actually removed from HVM L in inversion for point 0

38
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.790
1 but then brought back in version 5.

39
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:20.840
You can use it is valid HDL but it's generally preferred that we use ints which is short for inserted

40
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.620
to imply that I underlined text has been inserted into our paragraph.

41
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.610
Now once again you can use you and you'll see it everywhere but it is inserted.

42
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.390
And that's what's generally preferred.

43
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.420
OK just a couple more.

44
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.400
We'll have some superscript.

45
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.680
So just the same.

46
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.410
So superscript means high up in the air.

47
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:53.310
And we use the sup short obviously for superscript tag to do that.

48
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.690
OK quick challenge for you.

49
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.850
Can you work out how to do some subscript text.

50
00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.640
Go for it.

51
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.690
You managed to get that one.

52
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.420
It's just exactly the same.

53
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.950
But sub instead of SUP.

54
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.390
So subscript is slightly below the line and there it is.

55
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.590
All right the last one I'm going to show you is some struck out text and we're going to do that using

56
00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.270
the DTL tag short for delete it

57
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.380
there we go.

58
00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.330
So now we have some crossed out text there that used to be strike NHT a metaphor but that has actually

59
00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.340
been deprecated in HCM L5 and we now use that DDL tag.

60
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.080
But you may see strike used in Web sites that you're looking at last.

61
00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:54.730
I'm going to show you a completely separate tag which I'm quite keen on which is the horizontal rule.

62
00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.090
So again it's a self-closing tag.

63
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:03.710
It doesn't have a closing element but it just draws a nice horizontal line so it's good for adding sections

64
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:04.530
to a page.

65
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:11.850
If we put it in here for example we might want to separate the first three from the last three and that's

66
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.480
a very nice way to do it.

67
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.270
So again self-closing in HMO 5 you don't need the closing element if for some reason you're doing sh

68
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.680
t m l then you would put the closing bit in like that and you might well see it like that in some websites

69
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:33.380
but fraiche Tim L5 you should just have the H.R. if you want to find a few more different Starling's

70
00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:41.060
that you can do with DML then just go to Google and very quickly you can get this with DML formatting

71
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.820
and just click on the top result which will take you to a Web site called W3 schools which has got a

72
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:55.240
lot of information on basic HD l tags and down here they've got a bunch of formatting elements.

73
00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.660
So we've seen quite a few of those but there's a few even that we haven't seen further down.

74
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:07.340
So we've got small market which is highlighted there inserted which we saw subscript and superscript

75
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.190
et cetera.

76
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:15.390
So if you want to look more into HMO formatting you can but we're actually going to move on and look

77
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.220
at lists in HCM El.
