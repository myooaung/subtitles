1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,940
So congratulations once again on making it to the end of the CSSA section of this course.

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:12,270
You've gone from almost no knowledge of CSI as to exactly how to implement it into your pages and then

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:19,170
some really quite advanced CSSA techniques involving pseudo classes layouts selectors like classes and

4
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,160
ideas and a lot more.

5
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:26,630
So now's your chance to use all of those skills and create something real.

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,980
The challenge I'm about to set will definitely be the toughest challenge that you've had so far in this

7
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,480
course

8
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,410
but I hope that you'll learn the most from it as well.

9
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,990
So what we're going to be doing is cloning this page.

10
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:50,610
The BBC News website and I've chosen the tech page not because I don't like Asda but as a upcoming web

11
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,240
developer you should definitely be keeping up with the latest tech developments.

12
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,460
So creating something like this is definitely not going to be easy.

13
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,920
But the more effort you put into figuring stuff out yourself the more you'll learn from it.

14
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,830
So one option is to follow along with me as I recreate this page which is perfectly fine but I would

15
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,890
certainly recommend at least attempting recreating parts of it on your own.

16
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,370
You've got all the skill and techniques that you need and if you've forgotten any or want to try something

17
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:21,090
else there's always Google to figure out something more advanced.

18
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,910
So if you possibly can have a go at it yourself before you watch the videos and follow along with me

19
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,660
one word of warning don't necessarily be too fussy.

20
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:36,630
We're not going to use the exact same font and some of our layouts might not be exactly the same as

21
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,980
this site but it'll be close enough that the layman probably couldn't tell the difference.

22
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,810
Least a first glance.

23
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,530
One final thing before we begin.

24
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:48,800
Of course the news on whatever day you are doing this is going to be different to what I'm seeing here.

25
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:54,060
I think that's a plus and it will give you the opportunity to do something slightly different to what

26
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,670
I've done.

27
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:01,050
But if you want the exact same page that I'm going to be working with then you can jump to complete

28
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:06,870
web developer course com slash clone and we're going to be doing it without the cookie message at the

29
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,660
top.

30
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,850
So this is the exact page and this is not going to change.

31
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,760
I'm going to go as far as about this line here so where that gray line is all the way along because

32
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,170
I don't think you don't necessarily want to watch me for hours and hours recreating the whole page will

33
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,670
just do that top up there.

34
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:29,310
If you want to be super creative Feel free to choose another Web site to clone or do this one and then

35
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,030
do a different one.

36
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,880
But I think the BBC site is a great looking site.

37
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,720
You'll learn a huge amount by attempting to copy it as well.

38
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:45,210
One final word of warning don't attempt to try and recreate the responsiveness of the site so the BBC

39
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:52,550
website is responsive which means that it looks different and lays out nicely regardless of the screen

40
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,230
with.

41
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,330
We're not going to try and recreate that at this stage we don't have the techniques but we will be covering

42
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,100
them later on in the course.

43
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:04,230
So all you're aiming to do is create something that looks like this.

44
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:09,150
I also wouldn't worry too much about making it look exactly right in every browser because I'm getting

45
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:09,630
it right.

46
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:15,230
In Crime and your cross-browser development skills will come along as the course goes on.

47
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,290
All right then so good luck.

48
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,050
I hope you enjoy the challenge and when you've done it do come back and watch me give it a shot.

49
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,620
OK here we go them.

50
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,910
So I'm going to start by creating a new page

51
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:44,440
so I'm going to do that within brackets so I will get a file save as a leader in your text editor and

52
00:03:44,440 --> 00:04:00,170
then just call it BBC HMO save it then and then get rid of the style from the previous video and will

53
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:05,410
change the title so that that match is technology dash BBC News.

54
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,950
I've just copied that from up there.

55
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,510
And then

56
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,950
and then let's jump over and change this so that we're looking at the right page

57
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,500
in a browser.

58
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,760
OK and a quick check is always good.

59
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,360
There we go.

60
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,310
And we've got the rights Web site title as well.

61
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,330
All right then here we go.

62
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,640
Deep breath.

63
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:38,600
I'm going to essentially start from the top left and work my way along.

64
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:45,460
And that bar at the top definitely looks to me like a good place to start with a div definitely.

65
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:50,030
That's a section of the page which is different to everything else.

66
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,550
So let's start there and we'll create our div

67
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:05,210
and I'm going to give it an ID of top bar because it's the bar at the top of the page.

68
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,870
Now it's got a white background or at least it looks white to me.

69
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:12,720
I'm going to use the color picker just to check that it is.

70
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,090
Yes it is.

71
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,740
So all those F's in the middle are a complete white so I don't need to give it a particular background.

72
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:26,360
What I do need to do is center it so you can see that it could have fixed width but it is centered in

73
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:33,160
the page so as far as my clone is concerned I could forget that sintered bit but I would quite like

74
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:33,890
to do it.

75
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:40,240
So let's have a quick google to see if we can work out how to center a div within the page.

76
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:50,150
Well there again Center div in page that looks good that takes us to Stack Overflow Dockum.

77
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,290
If you haven't discovered stack overflow don't come yet.

78
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,590
Then you haven't been Googling enough to work out how to do things because it comes up all the time.

79
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:03,070
It's a great site so it looks to me that we can send to outlive by giving it a fixed width and then

80
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,720
setting the margin to zero and auto.

81
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:11,890
So that's going to be a zero margin at the top and the bottom and an auto margin on the left and right

82
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,450
so that should Senza it for us.

83
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,230
Great.

84
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,140
So let's do that

85
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,910
so for our top bar.

86
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,530
Can you use hash and then

87
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,090
top bar and will experiment a bit with the width.

88
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:41,940
I think about 1000 pixels is likely to be about right and then as we saw we want margin 0 and then auto

89
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,870
and I'm actually just going to give it a temporary background color.

90
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:54,390
So that I can see how wide it is and I think we'll need to give it a height as well.

91
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,710
So I will experiment with that.

92
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:59,460
My guess would be around 40 pixels.

93
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,790
OK let's take a look.

94
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,690
So there we go.

95
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,140
Excellent.

96
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,890
So I think that looks good.

97
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:13,280
It's about the right width and height but we do have this bar at the top there which I want to get rid

98
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,140
of.

99
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,920
We did see how that town to do that

100
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:19,810
a few videos ago.

101
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:30,420
I wonder if you can remember it's just a matter of setting the body margin and padding to zero.

102
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:38,270
So that should now align it to the very top left that we get to the very top anyway left only if it

103
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,540
happens to be smaller than a hundred pixels.

104
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,530
OK.

105
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:53,950
So now we can get rid of background color and the first thing we're going to want is this BBC logo.

106
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:58,360
So I'm just going to steal it directly from the page by right clicking or control clicking and then

107
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:05,180
save image as then I'm actually going to create a new folder called images.

108
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:10,410
You don't have to do this but it's quite a neat way of keeping all your images separate from your HMO

109
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,830
files.

110
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,760
And I'm going to call this BBC logo

111
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,310
OK.

112
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,840
So now we've got BBC logo dot PNB.

113
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,210
So let's pop it in and see what it looks like.

114
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:37,820
So we add an image using EMG and then we went to SLC and it's going to be an image is slash and I even

115
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,920
get that nice auto predicts that brilliant.

116
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,480
Let's take a look.

117
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,040
Fantastic sir.

118
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,260
I'm very happy with that.

119
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:57,680
But it is at the top of the page and we want it down slightly so I'm going to give it a margin at the

120
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,710
top.

121
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:14,300
So let's give it an ID of Logo Stephanie and ID because there's only one logo.

122
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:24,890
And then with the logo I want to set a margin top of let's say five pixels.

123
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,820
Let's have a look at that.

124
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:29,340
OK.

125
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,800
I think we could make it a little bit more than that.

126
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:39,670
Maybe eight number we're going to bring about purely pixel perfect hair but that looks about right.

127
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,930
It is a bit smaller by default as well.

128
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:48,810
So I'm going to stretch it out a bit let's try giving it a width of maybe 120 pixels.

129
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,200
OK.

130
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,730
A little too big.

131
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,500
That's true.

132
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,890
100 pixels.

133
00:09:59,270 --> 00:09:59,830
OK.

134
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,970
That looks about right to me.

135
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:02,350
All right.

136
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,140
So now we've got our logo the bit to the right of here.

137
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:11,440
We want a nice vertical border there and we've actually got those to separate out each of these.

138
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:20,590
So I'm going to create a class for those with a border on the left so we'll need to float the logo to

139
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:26,900
the left because we're going to want to put other things to the right of it.

140
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:35,760
And then let's create this sign in Dave so we're still inside the talk by hand.

141
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:43,350
And we'll call it seinen.

142
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:43,650
Dave

143
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,470
we going.

144
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:55,810
Now we want it floated left and we want it with a border to the left and we're going to want that for

145
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:58,790
all of the top bar sections here.

146
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:06,940
So I'm going to create a class of top bar section and then

147
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,180
I'm going to assign those styles to that.

148
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:24,090
So we don't want them all to float left and we want this border left and let's try one pick's Gray.

149
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,680
Solve it.

150
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,180
See how that looks.

151
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,540
And there's nothing there that's interesting.

152
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:36,420
I suspect that's because we don't have a height yet.

153
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:43,970
So let's make it a height of 100 percent so it will completely fill the top bar.

154
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,270
And there we go.

155
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,880
So now we can see it.

156
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,060
It needs a bit of work.

157
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:56,110
So I think I'm going to add a margin to the right of my BBC image.

158
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:03,840
So that logo here just to spread that out and let's have a look how why do we want this to be

159
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,140
about the same as the distance from the top.

160
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:15,630
So let's try a margin right of eight pixels.

161
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:18,450
OK.

162
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,530
That looks pretty good.

163
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,950
We haven't got the color right.

164
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:34,910
So let's use our color picker to pick a color from the page and then try and isolate the color that

165
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,240
we want.

166
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:42,010
It's pretty tricky to do at this scale so I'm going to zoom in as much as I can and we can see that

167
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,760
it's one pixel here.

168
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:49,220
It's tricky to get it just right.

169
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:56,720
But I think it's that CCCC see that looks like the right sort of gray to me.

170
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:06,960
So let's jump back and change the border color from gray to hash.

171
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:12,740
C c c c c c it's Take a look.

172
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,030
OK that looks much better.

173
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:16,440
Great.

174
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:20,960
I'm going to fix the height later on because I want to put some content in first.

175
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:27,040
So let's zoom out again so we've got two things here.

176
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,610
We've got this image and then we've got the sign in text.

177
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:38,440
So let's zoom in and if we right click on this image you'll see that we can actually download it directly.

178
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:44,890
So I'm actually going to use the screen grab tool on the Mac which has command shift 4.

179
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:56,730
And that will allow me to select the image and save it to my desktop.

180
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:01,470
If you're on Windows you can use the snipping tool to do the same thing or if you have problems with

181
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:01,860
that.

182
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:06,570
You can always download it from the zip at the end of this section which gives you the whole of my version

183
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,860
of the BBC page.

184
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,240
So I'm going to go back over to find out.

185
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:21,470
And there's the file size screen shot and then the date and time I'm going to change that to sign an

186
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:30,500
image and then I'm going to copy it to the clipboard and pop it in my images folder.

187
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:42,680
So now let's jump back here either and add that in.

188
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:53,540
So we're going to put this in the sign in Dave and it's an image with an S or C of images and then

189
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,020
sign

190
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,270
sign an image tompion G.

191
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,470
And we go OK let's have a look.

192
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,250
All right.

193
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,240
So we've got it.

194
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,090
It's a little larger than we need.

195
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:29,530
So let's give it an ID of sign an image and then use a bit of CSSA to customize that.

196
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:37,250
So I will create a sign an image selector and then will set the width.

197
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:41,090
Let's try 10 pixels.

198
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,790
Little bit small.

199
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,290
Forty pixels but too big.

200
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,950
Thirty pixels.

201
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,270
Zoom out again.

202
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,750
I think that looks about right.

203
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,490
We want the same kind of height as the BBC logo.

204
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,800
Sir I like that.

205
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,540
And we'll need some margin for it as well.

206
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,780
We want a top margin and a left margin.

207
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:10,440
So let's see if we can imagine all the way around.

208
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,640
Let's try 8 pixels.

209
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,300
OK that looks pretty good.

210
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:26,830
I think that is about right although the left margin is actually a little bit more.

211
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,370
So I'm going to change that.

212
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:34,910
So 8 pixels at the top and maybe 15 pixels on the left

213
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:42,360
let's just have a look at that.

214
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,680
There we go.

215
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,960
I think that looks a little better.

216
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,400
It's maybe a bit large.

217
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,680
So let's make it slightly smaller.

218
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:05,680
And give it more of a margin at the top.

219
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:13,960
OK that looks better a touch more margin at the top I think.

220
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,990
Bring it down a little bit.

221
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,230
OK.

222
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:21,700
So next bit is the sign in text.

223
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,920
So we're going to need to change the font and make it bold.

224
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,360
So let's add in

225
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:38,940
that's just make sure I get the capitalization right set sign in with a small I

226
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,680
every game.

227
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:55,460
OK so we definitely want to float this image to the left so that it's to the left of our sign in text.

228
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,130
So let's just add that in

229
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:05,540
that sped up and now let's get this fund right.

230
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,220
Now I'm going to show you a little trick.

231
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:14,190
Think we'll use the same font throughout.

232
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:22,410
So if we select a certain bit of text right click or control click in Chrome and then inspect.

233
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:30,300
This will give us a bit of information about that particular text and the computed section is particularly

234
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:38,400
useful because it gives you a bit of information about that text so that can be really handy.

235
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,920
We're going to particularly focus focus on the font family.

236
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,260
There we go so the font family is something called helmet.

237
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:48,490
I think I'm going to go for just this last bit here.

238
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:52,760
So Helvetica Aeriel and sans serif.

239
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:58,490
I suspect these ones are custom fonts for the BBC site.

240
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:04,410
So let's see if we can change the font and we're going to want to change the font for pretty much everything.

241
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,760
So let's do that within our body tag.

242
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:16,270
And we want to set the font family to Helvetica Aeriel and then San Sarath if we can't get either of

243
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:20,320
those so let's have a look.

244
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,300
That should change the font of our sign in.

245
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,910
Fantastic.

246
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,960
So I think this can be a span

247
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:35,040
because it's not quite a paragraph on its own.

248
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:44,560
So we'll call it sign in text and we don't need to do a lot with it.

249
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:51,070
We need to make it bold maybe change the size and then move it down a touch.

250
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:59,840
I'm actually looking at the sign in image that I think should be slightly higher if that looks better.

251
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:04,080
So let's take a sign in

252
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:11,260
text selector and we want font weight.

253
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,580
Bold.

254
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,010
I'm going to make it a touch smaller font size.

255
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,450
That's try 90 percent and then

256
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:28,580
try moving it down around 11 pixels

257
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:31,900
OK.

258
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:34,940
I'm liking the size and weight.

259
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,730
It's not liking my Margene top 5.

260
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:42,320
So I suspect that's because it doesn't want to apply a margin to a span.

261
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:45,910
So let's try doing it with positioning instead.

262
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:55,660
So we'll give it a relative positioning with a top of 11 percent 11 pixels sorry that we get that looks

263
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:05,340
good it's moving down I think we need to make it a bit further 15 pixels slightly to fall 14.

264
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,660
Ok I'm liking that

265
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:16,440
OK.

266
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,360
That looks pretty similar.

267
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:25,210
You'll notice that there is this nice color that appears on mouseover here.

268
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,600
We're not going to be recreating that.

269
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,000
We didn't have the skills for that yet I'm afraid.

270
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,590
If you want to check out how to do that with javascript's then feel free.

271
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,980
It's not too tricky but it's definitely beyond our abilities right now.

272
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:45,880
Next time we've got this slightly strange wiggly line then I'm going to use command shift 4 again to

273
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,980
take a screenshot of that.

274
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,640
I'll try and get it accurately as I can.

275
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:56,580
And I recommend doing the same thing with the snipping to down to the bottom.

276
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,680
And while I'm here I'll do the same thing for the bell

277
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,760
we get.

278
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:10,220
So let's find though is that so.

279
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,780
So rename this one.

280
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:13,210
Bell

281
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:24,100
and I'll call this one wiggly line.

282
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,680
Now you can see I've copied some of the top of the screen there.

283
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:30,460
If you're on a Mac there's an easy way to fix that.

284
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:41,280
You can just double click on your image and then zoom in and select the bit that you want to keep and

285
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:47,250
then use command OK to crop and then you're left with just the bit that you want.

286
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,500
So that's really useful.

287
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,710
You'll need to use an image editor if you're on a PC to do the same thing.

288
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:59,370
Or you could just use the images in the zip file at the end of this section if you'd rather say let's

289
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:06,480
select wiggly line and bell and then copy them back into our images folder.

290
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,200
All right.

291
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:12,850
So our wiggly line is going to go somewhat to the right of sign and then

292
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,730
so I think it deserves it.

293
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,660
I mean Dave

294
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:29,940
which is going to be here so we're still inside top bar but we're not in sign in at the moment.

295
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:35,980
I'll call this one bell Dave.

296
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:38,550
OK.

297
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:47,790
And then first thing that we're going to want in hour belive is our image which is going to be our wiggly

298
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:50,230
line top PMG.

299
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,540
So I'll just have a little look about that.

300
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,700
OK that's fine but it's obviously a little bit large.

301
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:00,630
I suspect we'll need to mess around with that later.

302
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,450
But let's just give it a height for the moment.

303
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:13,750
I'll give it an idea of wiggly line which is probably not the sort of professional sounding ID that

304
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,030
you'd want to use.

305
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,060
And a final page but it will do for our purposes.

306
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:33,430
So wiggly line we're going to want to float it left and let's give it a height of for now we can put

307
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:40,250
40 pixels which is the same height that we gave the top bar originally.

308
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:44,680
So that will do for now we might need to perfect it when we've got everything in place.

309
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,750
Obviously it's pretty close to signing that.

310
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:52,340
So what I'm going to do to fix that is give my sign and text span.

311
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,190
I write padding all of let's say 50 pixels.

312
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,530
See how that works.

313
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:00,480
OK.

314
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,660
I'm happy with that.

315
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:04,250
I think that's about the right sort of distance.

316
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:12,960
Along right now we're going to bring in our bell.

317
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:16,550
So that's just going to go next to our wiggly line

318
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,200
so image

319
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:30,400
we'll call it Bell SIRC his images and then I'll

320
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,190
have a look.

321
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:35,550
I'm

322
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:43,130
happy with that but obviously we need to make it a little bit smaller.

323
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:51,470
So let's try a height of 15 pixels.

324
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:56,730
See how that looks cool a little bit too small maybe 25 pixels.

325
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:57,860
Yep I like that.

326
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:04,020
And then let's give it high margin.

327
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:14,980
So let's try a top margin of around 12 pixels and I left and right margin that's about the same 12 pixels

328
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,200
as well.

329
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,420
OK that's definitely a little bit too much

330
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:25,090
maybe 10 maybe nine

331
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,750
OK.

332
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:34,620
I will tell you this a little bit far from the weekly line as well so let's make that 10

333
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,470
maybe still too far.

334
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,750
Try it.

335
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,710
OK.

336
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,890
We can play with that and see how it looks.

337
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:53,780
Now we're going to have our relatively easy bits hopefully Newspoll whether I play or et cetera.

338
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,020
So let's bring in

339
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:07,930
a new class for those after the bell Dave I did float the bell.

340
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:11,520
They've left did I know I didn't see that

341
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:24,410
day that means everything will be to the left of it.

342
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:30,500
Now these ones I think don't need a specific idea because they're all the same but they will need a

343
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,070
specific class that they might need two classes.

344
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:38,900
They all have a margin left and they're all going to be floated left.

345
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:44,140
So we can use the Tabar section class for all of them.

346
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,700
Okay.

347
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:59,180
And then that first one that is just news.

348
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,910
Let's see how that looks.

349
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,720
OK.

350
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:07,580
So it looks fine but I think we're going to need to make it bold maybe a touch smaller and we're going

351
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,960
to need to add some margins to it.

352
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:16,250
So that's cool this top bar menu as well.

353
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:22,480
So go to classes and then specifically to top our menu.

354
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:34,650
We all have a font weight of both and I font size of let's try 90 percent.

355
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,250
We might not need it.

356
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:42,140
And then we'll have a margin of what we have before.

357
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,380
Actually what worked for the sign in text

358
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:55,020
14 pixels.

359
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:01,440
Let's try that's And we'll try 15 left and right as well.

360
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:02,880
OK.

361
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,390
Yes.

362
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,510
I didn't mean margin.

363
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,820
I definitely meant padding.

364
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:10,380
OK.

365
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,340
So yeah we're getting there.

366
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:19,800
We've got much too much left margin there and I think we need to move it up maybe just a touch to try

367
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,260
13 pixels there.

368
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:27,970
15 because let's have zero padding at the bottom but then keep out 15 pixels on the right.

369
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,420
See how that looks.

370
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,200
OK.

371
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:37,630
That hasn't helped our problem with our lines so let's try specifying a particular height.

372
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,010
Remember the height is going to be Plus the padding.

373
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:46,310
So if we want the whole height of this thing to be 40 pixels then we need to take away the padding at

374
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,460
the top which is 13 pixels.

375
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:54,350
So that leaves us with 27 pixels.

376
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,690
So let's have a look.

377
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,490
OK.

378
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,710
That looks a lot better.

379
00:29:58,010 --> 00:29:58,480
Great.

380
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:01,190
We might have to fiddle around with that a little bit later on.

381
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,810
But that looks good enough for now.

382
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,520
All right so now we got some easy bits.

383
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:12,110
We just need to add sport whether I play a TV and more.

384
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:23,630
So let's do that by copying these divs so see if I can remember them sport.

385
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:31,260
I can't support whether I play a

386
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:38,060
TV and more

387
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,310
go.

388
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:46,250
Let's have a look.

389
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,000
All right.

390
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,750
I think for the first time it's starting to take shape.

391
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:55,360
I'm liking that we do need a little down hour there.

392
00:30:55,460 --> 00:31:04,790
We're not going to bring in this fancy menu there but I will put down our I suspect we'll need to do

393
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:07,180
a little screen shot of it should be fine.

394
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,590
OK.

395
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,570
So same as before.

396
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,290
If you can't get that for whatever reason

397
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,500
then just grab it from the zip at the end of the section.

398
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,350
So there's the more let's bring that into

399
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:43,820
images that we get and then that's just going to go after more.

400
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,300
So let's bring that in.

401
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:56,430
Image with a source and then image is more.

402
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,180
There it is.

403
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,070
So we want it moved along a little bit.

404
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:00,840
And of course

405
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,410
the right size.

406
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,800
So I'm liking the position actually that works quite well.

407
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:19,490
So I give it a more hour ID.

408
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:26,040
And then I think we need to change the size First of all.

409
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:37,390
So let's try a width of six pixels and we definitely want this high margin left of let's say 15 pixels

410
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:47,300
and a little bit small 16 pixels.

411
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:47,810
OK.

412
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:49,330
Yeah that looks better.

413
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,330
And

414
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:56,120
maybe 20 pixels there space it out a little bit.

415
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,320
Great.

416
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,790
All right so that was looking good.

417
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:03,320
Let's jump back over and see what we need to make next.

418
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,710
So we've actually got left.

419
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:11,090
So we've actually got left in this top bar is the search box here which is going to be a text input

420
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:14,120
with a little bit of styling to get that image in the background.

421
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,950
All right so let's see if we can pull that off.

422
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:19,750
We definitely need a new section.

423
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:32,190
So let's create a new Dave with a class of top section

424
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:42,160
and then we'll start off just by putting in input with a type of text

425
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:49,120
and seeing how that looks in itself.

426
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:53,070
OK so we've got the input but that's not quite what we're after.

427
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:58,680
So let's do a little bit of work to try and make it look like that.

428
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:05,410
So we're going to need to make it why don't we get I need to set the background to that gray color.

429
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:11,820
And it's and we're going to need the magnifying glass image.

430
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:16,720
So while I'm here I'm going to use command shift 4 again.

431
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:26,440
You can use a snippet tool if you're on Windows and I'm just going to copy that to the desktop and there

432
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,660
it is.

433
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:39,580
So I call it magnifying glass and then I've just copied it again to Komansky Control-C and I'm going

434
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,950
to paste it into the images folder.

435
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,910
With all our other images I would get

436
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:58,110
so lets start by thinking about the right shape and size and that background.

437
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:01,400
I think I've just lost the background color again.

438
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:08,840
I guess I grab it again to the clipboard.

439
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,340
So let's give this.

440
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,670
And Heidi all such books

441
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:24,830
and then create some styles to make it look how we want.

442
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,110
So we'll start off with a background color that's in the Clipboard.

443
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:32,530
And that's going to be

444
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:38,470
number that looks about right.

445
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,060
We don't want any border here.

446
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,400
So I'm just going to put in border none.

447
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:47,470
OK.

448
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:55,290
We definitely wanted a little bit taller than it currently is but we might achieve that with padding.

449
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,070
Let's have a look.

450
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:05,280
Just putting some text in them.

451
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,880
So we definitely want to style that text a little bit

452
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:16,220
try bold font white.

453
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:19,560
First of all and I think a little bit bigger.

454
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:20,490
Yes.

455
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:31,280
So let's try a fun size of.

456
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,720
Start off with 14 pixels.

457
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,190
I think that looks about right.

458
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:44,930
And then we'll have a little bit of padding try out five pixels.

459
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,210
OK.

460
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,570
I'm liking that.

461
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,460
I think that's about close enough.

462
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:04,440
We then definitely want a bit of margin OK.

463
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,710
That looks pretty good.

464
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:11,680
I think that's about right.

465
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:16,150
You can obviously play with those depending on how much of a perfectionist you are.

466
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:17,170
All right.

467
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,890
So just before we add that image in.

468
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:24,090
Let's have another quick look at how it actually works.

469
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:29,900
If we take a look at this search box here and drag the mouse over it we can actually see that the image

470
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,590
is separate to the search box itself.

471
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:39,470
So what we actually want to do is get our image to appear on the right of the search box and it will

472
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:44,990
be nice to do it in such a way that clicking on the magnifying glass does the actual search for us.

473
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:47,710
Obviously we're not going to create a functional search engine here.

474
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:50,570
We can do that last bit quite easily.

475
00:37:51,230 --> 00:38:01,520
So let's see how we achieve that IDF away if we just had an image would be just after the impetus to

476
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:07,940
have an image with an SLC of images and then magnifying glass

477
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:15,790
we'll give that an idea of magnifying glass

478
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:29,470
that we gave and we're going to need to add a flight left to the search box to make that flight nicely.

479
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:30,870
And then

480
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:39,710
find out let's just leave that blank and see how that looks.

481
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:45,740
OK so we've overlapped our 800 or so pixels.

482
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,020
I think that's fine.

483
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:49,070
Let's make it a little bit smaller.

484
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:56,450
And we're also going to want to remove the margin from the right of the search box as well.

485
00:38:56,450 --> 00:39:05,840
So let's change our margin to 5 pixels and then zero and then five pixels five pixels and that should

486
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,970
remove that margin.

487
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:10,870
So the nice thing to get up now I'm not happy with the coloring.

488
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:12,280
It doesn't seem to match up.

489
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:18,690
So let's try that again just grabbing the right color.

490
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,280
Doesn't seem to be working too well for me here.

491
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:38,690
OK let's try that's for evil

492
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:48,250
OK.

493
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,890
That's a lot better.

494
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,510
Excellent.

495
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:58,990
So let's get this hyped right sort of at around 15 pixels.

496
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,900
OK that's handy.

497
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,180
We're now in the right range

498
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,700
but we need to make it a little bit bigger.

499
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:15,540
So let's go for 25 and let's add a margin top of five pixels as well.

500
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:16,510
OK.

501
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,000
Now we're looking good.

502
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:21,420
So I think we need a couple more pixels in the Heights.

503
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:25,800
Let's go for 27.

504
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:26,740
There we go.

505
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:28,610
OK.

506
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,480
That looks great.

507
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,790
Now what we can do at the moment is what I mentioned earlier which is click on that image but I'm going

508
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:37,980
to show you a nice and easy way that we can do that.

509
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:51,180
We need to do is change our image to an input with a type of image and then that will make it clickable.

510
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:55,680
And if we had a proper form that would actually submit the form as well.

511
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:01,140
So you can see that that's now clickable and effectively does the same thing as a submit button because

512
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:02,560
we don't have a form here.

513
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,790
When actually submit.

514
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:08,990
But if it did we would say that's as far as we're going to go on this video.

515
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:15,330
Our top law is now more or less complete in the next video we're going to create the news section there

516
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:17,830
in red and then the menu underneath.

517
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:21,810
I hope you are staying with me and that you're learning a lot at the same time.

518
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:22,620
I'll see you in the next video.
