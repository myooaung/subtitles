1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:06,400
All right so now we've looked at modals popovers and tool tips.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,540
I'm going to challenge you to complete the set up of a reasonably complicated bootstrap component and

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,250
that is scroll spy.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,350
So the object of this challenge is for you to put together everything that we've learned in the last

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:25,530
few videos and find the information on the component work out first of what it does and then recreate

6
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,800
that in your own HVM l page.

7
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,440
As always if you have any problems I'll go through the process after the pause.

8
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,930
So good luck.

9
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:40,160
Just got to find the information about scroll spy on the bootstrap Web site and set it up in your bootstrap

10
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,470
toward HCM help web page.

11
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,110
Good luck.

12
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:52,380
All right.

13
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:53,630
Did you manage it.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,360
I hope so.

15
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,490
I'm going to get the information from here.

16
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:00,870
So let's.

17
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:06,450
First off try and figure out what on earth skirl spy does.

18
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,410
Generally speaking an example is the best thing for it.

19
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:14,540
There's calls for a operation is automatically updating Naftogaz based on the scroll position.

20
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:15,610
OK.

21
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:27,350
So if we scroll down this window you can see that it's moving along the nav bar at the top.

22
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,020
Great.

23
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,660
OK so hopefully that's something that you can see would be quite useful.

24
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:37,730
One of the reasons that I chose the scroll spy plug in for you to attempt is that at the time of writing

25
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:42,510
there's no copy and paste code on the bootstrap site.

26
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:43,650
That may well be different for you.

27
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:47,310
And if you are able to copy and paste it and get it working absolutely fine.

28
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:53,150
But we're going to try and figure it out how it works without just copying pasting an example.

29
00:01:53,150 --> 00:02:00,620
Obviously worth mentioning that we could view the page source and find the code and probably copy and

30
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:06,210
paste that but attempt to do it another way just to show you how we could do it.

31
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:14,250
So trying to figure out how on earth this plugin works so we can see we're going to need a Nav. at the

32
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:19,160
top and then we're going to need some content and some Wow we need a way of connecting up the nav and

33
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,170
the content.

34
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:30,140
So let's start by putting a nav in to go to link that to the boot strap nav component.

35
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,210
Here we go.

36
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:38,140
I think this inline one will do fine for us.

37
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,280
So let's get rid of this script code because we don't need any of that.

38
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,580
And also we don't need tether anymore either.

39
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,780
And get rid of all of our code there.

40
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,160
So let's put the novel first off and just check that that's displaying correctly.

41
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,680
There we go.

42
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,660
And then let's go back and see how we going to connect this up.

43
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:15,830
So first off we need to apply relative positioning to our body tag.

44
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,920
So let's do that.

45
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,500
So I'll do that with I in line style or internal Zari style

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,780
command every game.

47
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:49,250
And then we apply the data spy and data target elements to our body tag.

48
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:55,930
So that makes sense we're setting up the body tag to be the thing that is spied on as we're scrolling

49
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:04,470
and we're setting up the nav bar example div to be the thing that gets updated when the user is scrolling.

50
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:10,140
So let's add an ID here to our NAV.

51
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:16,220
We might as well use the same one and it looks to me like we'll need a UL

52
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:29,040
with those classes Nav. and laptops with a roll of tab list.

53
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,670
So let's set up our links as Elyse

54
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,540
OK and just close those allies off to the links

55
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,320
right we'll just have a look.

56
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,340
Make sure it still looks like an ass.

57
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:57,520
Yep great.

58
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,090
We've lost our in line but that's OK.

59
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,540
And I think I'll get rid of the disabled one as well.

60
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,740
OK.

61
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:13,970
So the question I'm wondering is how we connect up each of these links to its respective point on the

62
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:14,740
page.

63
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,560
Ah.

64
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:24,530
Now this is looking like the answer now if Pollocks must have a resolvable ID targets so we need a link

65
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:32,100
that goes to an ID on the page and then we need a div that ID on the page.

66
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:32,960
OK.

67
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:37,650
So that makes sense I'll just put the names of the sections in.

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,510
So I'll just go for one two three and four.

69
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:52,230
And then we'll have an NHT with an ID of one

70
00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:04,830
which will contain Section 1 and then we'll have a div and we'll get some good old Lorem Epson text

71
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,370
in there.

72
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,750
To fill out our page

73
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:21,790
lovely and then we'll do the same for sections 2 3 and 4.

74
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,530
And then just go back and rename those

75
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,100
Section 3

76
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,020
to

77
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,630
ones already there.

78
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:48,060
And one thing to note is that we will need the nav to be fixed.

79
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,890
So I'm going to just change that to a nav bar.

80
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,450
With a different styling and

81
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,980
we'll make it fixed to the top.

82
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,260
All right fingers crossed.

83
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,060
Let's have a look.

84
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,650
All right so it doesn't look great but that's ok.

85
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,250
Scroll down and see if we get the effect.

86
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:23,220
There it is say it is indeed updating our scroll spy is working.

87
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,830
We could definitely do with a little bit of tidying up here though.

88
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:29,620
So first off let's give this a background.

89
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,960
So it's not transparent which is a bit confusing.

90
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:45,120
And let's add the never item class to our list which should make everything go horizontal rather than

91
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,680
vertical.

92
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:56,650
Not that it really matters but it's a little bit nicer as an example to work with the great so you can

93
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:59,960
see what our NAV bar tabs is doing there.

94
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,760
It's styling it like tabs.

95
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,090
All right.

96
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,090
So we're pretty much done.

97
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:11,280
I do want to just add a bit of a margin there to my section 1.

98
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,190
So that's

99
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:27,420
it's not hidden behind the navigation so let's just add a margin up of let's try 70 pixels that we get

100
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,740
that looks a lot better.

101
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,990
And there is one final issue.

102
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:39,890
If you see where it updates in fact to make it slightly clearer don't just change these to the correct

103
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,760
numbers.

104
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,940
So one the three and four

105
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:57,600
so Section 2 is coming along and it only changes when Section 2 gets right to the top of the page which

106
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,250
is not necessarily what you want it also for us because there's a problem here because it never quite

107
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:07,220
gets to Section 4 because Section 4 is almost at the top of the page but not quite.

108
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,530
But there's a nice easy way round that.

109
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:17,710
And we can actually see it on the scrolls by bootstrap page.

110
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:23,030
We have this data offset attribute that we can add which is pixels to offset from the top.

111
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,600
When calculating position of scroll.

112
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,490
So as we just added a margin top of 70.

113
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:35,530
Let's add a data offset value of 70 as well.

114
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:42,060
And we should find this will give us a more sensible point of switching from one to the other.

115
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,100
So let's have a look.

116
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:50,100
So now switching to Section 2 just there which is great that's when Section 2 is at the top of the visible

117
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:56,140
part of the screen and then Section 3 and Section 4 as well.

118
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:02,990
And of course we can click on the links to jump to the respective parts of the page as well.

119
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:03,450
All right.

120
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,180
So I hope you manage that in the next and final video of the section then we'll be using everything

121
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:14,610
that we've learned in the bootstrap section of this course to put together a beautiful and functional

122
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,460
app landing page.
