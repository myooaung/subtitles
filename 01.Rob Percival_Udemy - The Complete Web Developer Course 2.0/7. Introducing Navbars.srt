1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:05,460
Now that we've mastered the bootstrap grid system we're going to take a look at some of the components

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,000
within the bootstrap CSX.

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,140
And the first of those is Naftogaz.

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:21,440
So if you click on components Let's first have a quick look at these buttons partly because they're

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:28,430
quite nice and pretty but mostly because they give us the standard color scheme of Bootstrap which you

6
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:32,770
can obviously mess with if you want but it's a solid one to at least be aware of.

7
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:38,480
So the names for these buttons follow on into almost every other bootstrap component so if you want

8
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,050
something to be green you give it a class of success.

9
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:49,670
Similarly if you wanted light blue info orange warning danger red primary blue secondary white etc.

10
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:57,230
and see how that works here you give it a class of PTEN to make it a button and then BGN dash primary

11
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,790
to make it a blue button.

12
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:03,080
Similarly with success info warning danger etc..

13
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,550
So we're going to be using that again and again when we want to change the color of things.

14
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:13,900
But let's jump straight on on the right menu here to Nashbar.

15
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:19,710
So you might be used to seeing something like this at the top of Web sites usually it's got a logo or

16
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,160
something at the top left.

17
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,940
Maybe some links maybe a search bar at the top right.

18
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:30,780
Something like that has become pretty standard and the bootstrap nav bar enables us to set one of these

19
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,700
up really easily.

20
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,850
And it looks like that so very pretty.

21
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,040
Let's copy the code.

22
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:46,400
Have a look at it in our bootstraps ranged himself file and then see what's going on and how we can

23
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,960
edit it any way we like.

24
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,790
OK.

25
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,810
There we go.

26
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,230
So there it is in its basic form.

27
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:05,720
It's obviously an attractive and clear navigation bar for your site which could easily have a logo some

28
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:10,680
links and a search box and can be styled in any way.

29
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,100
So let's have a quick look at the code and see what's going on.

30
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,590
And this is the first time that we're really investigating the bootstrap class system.

31
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,270
So I will spend a bit of time on that as we go through the code.

32
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:26,300
So first off we've actually got a new team out element type here and that is Nav..

33
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:32,840
This was new in HCM L5 and it's essentially a div that's used for navigation.

34
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:38,600
So it doesn't have any properties other than that a div has but it does tell the browser that in this

35
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,800
section is going to be contained your navigation links for the Web site.

36
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:50,590
But notice if you replace nav with Divx here it doesn't change a thing.

37
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,260
So it really is just a semantic thing.

38
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,550
It makes your HDMI a little bit clearer.

39
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,110
All right.

40
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,180
Now we've got our string of classes and we'll see this again and again and bootstrap.

41
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:06,000
You have a certain class to define what this component is.

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,940
So in this case and nabÃ» and then you have some customized classes which change the look of the behavior

43
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:12,720
that element.

44
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,650
So here we've got enough power light and background faded so feel free to experiment.

45
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:25,640
If we get rid of background faded then we have the same effect but with no background essentially

46
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:38,520
if we put that back in we might want to change it to background success and that will give us a green

47
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,110
background.

48
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,140
Could you make it a blue background.

49
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,100
Wonder if you managed it there were two options.

50
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:59,230
Info is our light blue background and primary is our dark Hopley background.

51
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:11,570
Then we've got our first link which has a particular class of nav bar brand.

52
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:14,960
So that means it will be considered the logo for the site.

53
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,270
And usually that will be an image.

54
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,370
But in this case it's just some text.

55
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:27,260
Next we have an unordered list with two classes nav and nav bar now I've just set it up to look and

56
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:31,620
behave like a nav bar list of links.

57
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,290
Then our first item has a special class of active.

58
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,880
It's a Naveh item but it's active which makes it a little bit darker.

59
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,550
So that's for just a page that we're on.

60
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:48,320
And then we've got the link itself of a elements and then that has a class of Navesink and hatred of

61
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,290
just hash that means I'll get back to the same page and then text of home.

62
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:58,700
We've also got a span with a class of S.R. only as our short for screen reader.

63
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:04,850
So if we want some text or information to be displayed only for we're using screen readers that is devices

64
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:11,210
for visually impaired people then we can use that class and it will only display on those devices then

65
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:15,890
we've just got a series of links each of which have a class of Nav. item and then the link itself has

66
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:18,250
a class of NAV link.

67
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:23,930
So they form these ones and then we've got a form where we're looking at those in Maudie's out in the

68
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:24,790
next video.

69
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:32,240
And it's a form in line which means that each of the input items are horizontally laid out rather than

70
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:39,890
one about the other and it's pulled to the right and access is one of our options for the screen size

71
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,350
and access if you remember was essentially a zero.

72
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,020
So this means that we pull to the right all the time.

73
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:57,630
If I change that to M.D for medium then it will only be pulled to write for medium and above sized screens

74
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:06,920
and below that it's just displaying normally normally are going to want to pull to the right all the

75
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,540
time and you achieve that with an excess.

76
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:15,110
Then we've got to reform itself will look at that in more detail in the next video when we look at forms

77
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,020
but it's reasonably straightforward.

78
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:17,800
What's going on.

79
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,120
And then we end the forum and then we end the nav.

80
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:26,090
So essentially it's a really simple way of getting a nice looking naff pile which we can easily customize

81
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:31,460
in terms of backgrounds etc. but we don't have to worry about all the floating left the styling the

82
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:39,200
spacing and the fact that it's responsive for different screen sizes says well if the responsive grid

83
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,820
system the components are much of what makes bootstrapped so useful.

84
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,870
Let's have a look at some of the other options of naff but so our brand.

85
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:54,020
We've already seen nav we've already seen that contains They have items themselves.

86
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,440
There are a few other color schemes here.

87
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:03,080
We looked at the background but you can also change the whole theme of the nav bar itself surrogate

88
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,860
for dark at the top and nav bar light.

89
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:12,230
You can see they've set the background to Inv. which means that the text is white rather than dark so

90
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:16,810
it's easier to say on a dark background.

91
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:22,660
Notice I didn't put my Nafa in a container because normally you want your nav bar to stretch all the

92
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,060
way to the end of the screen.

93
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:29,510
You can do if you want but it will look like that which will be a little bit weird.

94
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:32,770
We then got some placement and this one is really useful.

95
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,210
The fixed top.

96
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:43,840
So with just a single class in this case nav bar fixed top you can make it so that your nav bar will

97
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,530
stay at the top of the screen even as the user scrolls down.

98
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,970
So let's see that in action that's really useful.

99
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,930
So let's have a container

100
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,640
and then let's get a bunch of

101
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:05,930
some

102
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,300
get loads of the stuff

103
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:18,500
lovely.

104
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:27,140
So now when we look at events and we scroll down you can see the nav bar stays where it is can be annoying

105
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:31,880
sometimes on certain websites use it carefully but can also be very useful to keep the navigation right

106
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,090
there for the user should they want it.

107
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,030
Now the last thing I want to show you is quite fun.

108
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:43,570
Let's say you wanted to have a button on your nav bar which he had or showed some collapsible contents

109
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:49,090
which maybe had some more navigation links or sign up to a newsletter or something like that.

110
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,710
Then you could use this code.

111
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,910
So let's just try it out.

112
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,230
And see what it does.

113
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:06,330
I'll put it under our existing nav bar and we'll just comment out.

114
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,880
The original nav bar for the moment.

115
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:16,680
So it's still there when you want to check Kate and that really works really nicely.

116
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,460
And let's see what code is doing this.

117
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,110
We've got a div with a class of collapse.

118
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,580
That means we're going to collapse this div by default.

119
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:31,260
So it's not showing by default and it's got a particular ID which will reference later.

120
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:39,920
It's got a class of a background inverse which means it's got this very dark background and pale text.

121
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,770
It's also got a class of P A1 which is a special padding class.

122
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,700
We can actually get rid of that and everything will still work fine.

123
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:57,540
But the A-one essentially allows you to add a bit of padding in without doing that manually yourself.

124
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:04,260
And then we've got to content with another special bootstrap class of text muted to get that to display

125
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,130
a certain way.

126
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:05,840
We have a look at that.

127
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:09,990
Without that class you can see it's muting the text essentially

128
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:17,350
giving that sort of gray gray color.

129
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:23,230
Then we've got our nabÃ» in the same way that we're used to but now this is the clever bit we're creating

130
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:26,710
a button with a certain class of nav bar Tugela.

131
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,550
It's got a type of button and it's got some new attributes that we hadn't seen before.

132
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:38,020
Dator Tuggle and this essentially means that we're going to toggle the collapse class on the data target

133
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:44,450
which is the element with id x collapsing nabÃ».

134
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,160
So what we're essentially doing in the background here there's some javascript connected up to all of

135
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:55,690
this which will find the button with a class of nav bar dash Tugela and then we'll look for the data

136
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:00,080
toggle attribute and then note that as collapse.

137
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:06,100
And then you look at the data target and then it will find the elements that matches that.

138
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:13,100
So in this case the idea of X collapsing nav bar will toggle the collapse class.

139
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,770
So this is the sort of thing that bootstrap is really useful for.

140
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:19,780
If you need to do something like that and it's quite common that you might want to you can do that really

141
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:25,290
easily without having to create custom Jake wari or javascript yourself.

142
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,020
Great.

143
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,790
So that's nerf bars.

144
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:35,330
I'm just going to comment out the collapsible one now so I save it in that form for you.

145
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:39,690
So looks like a more traditional nav bar is there by default.

146
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:45,790
One quick thing to note there is that as this nav bar is now fixed it's not in the flow of the page

147
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,570
anymore.

148
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:53,230
So we need to give the container a bit of padding or margin at the top to move everything down so that

149
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,160
we'd see it.

150
00:11:54,460 --> 00:12:01,890
So I'll do some naughty inline styles just to show you how it might work if we give it a margin top

151
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,990
of 50 pixels for example.

152
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,430
There we go.

153
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,300
And that'll get it exactly on.

154
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:12,490
Probably we want a bit more than that to bring it down a little bit.

155
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,540
Something like that.

156
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:19,030
So I'd recommend doing that with fixed nav bars.

157
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,310
All right.

158
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,540
So that's a new HDMI element that we have met before but bootstrapped does a huge amount for the ones

159
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,260
that we're familiar with as well.

160
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:32,550
And in the next video we're going to look at two of those and that is forms and tables.
