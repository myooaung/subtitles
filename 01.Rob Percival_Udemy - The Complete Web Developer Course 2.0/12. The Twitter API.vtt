WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.270
The third type of API that we're going to be looking at is one that allows you to actually log in to

2
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.700
a web system and then do things within that.

3
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.000
And we're going to be doing that with the Twitter API which allows you to do pretty much anything you

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.650
can do on Twitter so we can read people's tweets.

5
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.290
We can tweet out.

6
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.180
We can send direct messages.

7
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.670
We can do all sorts of things.

8
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.550
So this is a level above the Google Maps API in terms of interactivity.

9
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.420
We're not just pulling information here.

10
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.960
We're actually making things happen as well.

11
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.140
You might imagine it's there for a little bit more complicated but don't worry I'll guide you through

12
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.170
it step by step.

13
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.520
So first off we need to create a Twitter developer account if you don't already have one.

14
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.080
So go to dev dot Twitter dot com and then click sign in.

15
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.420
Now if you have a Twitter account you can sign in there but I'm just going to show you the process from

16
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.460
scratch so you can see the whole thing.

17
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:07.310
So I'll start off with my name and then Rohrback co-star's dot com and then type a password.

18
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.250
All right I'll skip the phone validation for now and then I'll use one of these slightly horrendous

19
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.260
looking suggestions

20
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.340
and I'll just say that one last pass in case I need to come back to it later.

21
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.000
All right so because I've created an account it's taken me back to Twitter.

22
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.760
So I'm now going to go back to a day of dot Twitter dot com.

23
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.940
So this is where you'll be if you already have a Twitter account.

24
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.370
And now we're going to go to developers and documentation.

25
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:51.790
So as always you can spend a bit of time reading this if you want to get more information on how you

26
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.640
can use the Twitter API as you can see there's a number of different ways you can do it.

27
00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.170
The way we're going to be working with is off.

28
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.570
So this essentially allows you to authorize yourself as a Twitter user within your app and that will

29
00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:11.320
allow you to view tweets send tweets and do pretty much anything else within the Twitter ecosystem.

30
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:18.850
And the first thing you need to do to access the Twitter API via oath is create an app and we do that

31
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.930
at apps dot Twitter dot com.

32
00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.720
So if you're logged in then it will take you to the Twitter apps page where you probably won't have

33
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.740
any apps.

34
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:36.550
So we'll create a new one and we're not actually making an app here but we're essentially setting up

35
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.520
credentials for us to be able to log in to the Twitter API.

36
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.810
So we'll just fill in these details.

37
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.180
So I'll just call it my Twitter API app

38
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:59.840
this is a demo app for the Twitter API.

39
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.830
I'll just put a placeholder here.

40
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.730
Twitter app demo dot com.

41
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.920
I don't know if there's a Web site there and we'll leave the callback you Arel blank.

42
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:20.050
We're not going to be using that and we'll agree to the terms and conditions and create our Twitter

43
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.390
application.

44
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.850
And one thing I do need to add my mobile phone number to Twitter and we do that on the main Twitter

45
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:28.700
Web sites.

46
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.630
So I'm just going to go to Twitter dot com

47
00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.650
and then on to my little symbol there.

48
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.630
I'll click Settings and then mobile

49
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.510
and I'll just pause the recording while I answer my my phone number.

50
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.040
And now that's done.

51
00:03:50.040 --> 00:04:01.240
Let's go back over to create an application and attempted again or we're getting very close just need

52
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.270
to put in.

53
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.330
I would just put a random number at the end of that

54
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:08.870
and then we'll try again.

55
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:09.880
And we've got it.

56
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.060
All right.

57
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.100
And the main thing we're interested in here are our keys.

58
00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:24.740
So if we click manage keys and access tokens you can see we've got I can see and I can show you my secrets.

59
00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:32.180
And these are two API keys and this one you can make public if you want but the secret you should very

60
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.970
much keep private because anyone who has access to that will be able to access everything that you can

61
00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.660
do within your app.

62
00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:48.770
So our last thing to do here in the Twitter website is to create an access token which will allow us

63
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:54.040
to access the Twitter API through this app.

64
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.900
And there we go.

65
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.750
So once again we've got a token and a secret.

66
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:03.870
And the reason you have an access token as well as an API key is because you might want to access the

67
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.610
Twitter API from a number of different places from your Web site from your app or from somewhere else

68
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.010
and you might therefore want to have a different access token for each of those ups.

69
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:13.910
OK.

70
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.430
So now we've set up everything that we need for our Twitter app.

71
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.210
We now need to write the code to connect to it.

72
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:26.070
Now fortunately there is a great HP library that we can use to do the hard work of connecting to the

73
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.880
API.

74
00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:33.390
And we can find that by searching for something like Twitter or THP

75
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:45.970
and this will take you to the Twitter page on get help.

76
00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:54.730
As always you can read more about that at the home page Twitter Warth dot com but we're just going to

77
00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.010
download it and make a start with it.

78
00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:02.990
There are basic instructions that in case you have any problems with this particular version.

79
00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:08.400
I've also saved a version on the Web site for this course and there's a link to that in the next lecture

80
00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.970
so you can use that version if you prefer.

81
00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:20.970
But for now we'll just download zip and they'll save it on the desktop and then will unzip it.

82
00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.850
And we'll have a quick look inside.

83
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:27.530
So there we go.

84
00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:33.970
You can see we've got a bunch of p p p files which we will of course need to upload to our server.

85
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:43.850
So back over the fire FTB and I'm just going to click on the to our Warth master folder and then click

86
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:49.300
the arrow to upload everything within that wonderful.

87
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:56.100
So let's have a look then at Twitter Warth dot com and see how we set this up.

88
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.230
We're not using composer here.

89
00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:04.970
So we'll scroll down to the old fashioned way which is just downloading and uploading to our server

90
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:11.520
and then you can see we've got here are two lines of code that will need it's pretty simple.

91
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.520
So we just require which is essentially the same as including

92
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.020
I'm going to get rid of everything here.

93
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:32.570
So it will require that but bear in mind this link is slightly different here so I'm just going to rename

94
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:33.310
that.

95
00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:36.560
So right click and rename.

96
00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.260
So it's just Twitter off

97
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:47.640
and then that should match that and then we'll just use that bit of code.

98
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:55.400
And then it's these two lines of code that we're going to need.

99
00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:04.630
So I'll paste those in and we're going to need to replace these without various access tokens.

100
00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:17.530
So let's get all of those set up what I normally do is set those at the beginning of our code so we

101
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:22.300
don't have them kind of deeply embedded.

102
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.850
So I will start with the consumer key.

103
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:32.940
So that's equal to that and we've got consumer secret

104
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.490
which is equal say this long thing

105
00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:47.150
and we've got access token

106
00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:51.910
which is this

107
00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.240
and access tokens secrets

108
00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:05.030
which is that.

109
00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:12.440
And be careful not to copy but a little space at the end of mine that that's not part of it.

110
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.110
So then I'll just replace these with my variable names.

111
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.620
So I can see I'm a key consumer Secret

112
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:28.560
Access taken

113
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:41.990
access taken secret and there we go.

114
00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:52.010
So the only change I'm going to make here is just to print content there to see what is returned by

115
00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:57.740
the Twitter API when we attempt to verify the credentials and the full notice.

116
00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:01.460
I've actually got a couple of other bit of blank space there.

117
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:06.780
So it's very easy to get by when you're copying and pasting the access codes.

118
00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:16.510
So make sure you've got rid of any spaces and line breaks and then open this up in a new tab and we'll

119
00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:20.630
just jump over to the same page pages before.

120
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:23.160
Keep your fingers crossed and there we go.

121
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:27.200
So if you've done everything right we'll just view the source.

122
00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.600
You should get something that looks like this.

123
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:37.260
So you get the name screen name and a bunch of other information about that particular user.

124
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:38.340
Wonderful.

125
00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:39.890
So all looking good so far.

126
00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.760
Let's see if we can get the tweets of this person.

127
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:51.970
So first off I'm going to jump to Twitter and make a quick tweet so that we've got something on our

128
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:58.500
timeline.

129
00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:02.160
This is my first tweet.

130
00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:03.970
Inspirational stuff.

131
00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:05.390
OK.

132
00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:15.150
So now if we go back to Twitter Warth com we can then scroll down and we can see how it actually works.

133
00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:16.880
So once we've done the overall.

134
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:20.110
It actually works in quite a similar way to the Google Maps API.

135
00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:26.980
Essentially we've got a U R L that we need to access to do something because we're accessing this for

136
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.850
a while so we don't just use file contents.

137
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.280
We use this method here.

138
00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.440
So connection and then get.

139
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:40.050
So let's try that out.

140
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:40.780
So instead of

141
00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:52.960
printing content or print status is and you've got a fairly obvious couple of variables there that count

142
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:55.700
is counted equal to 25 and exclude replies.

143
00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.290
It's true

144
00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:01.980
so let's have a look we.

145
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:02.870
This is looking good.

146
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:10.500
Again move you source to make it a bit clearer and then you can see we've got this is my first tweet

147
00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:10.970
there.

148
00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:16.740
And we've got a bunch of other information about the tweets as well like where it came from the user

149
00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.050
and the date and time as well.

150
00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:21.670
Excellent.

151
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:22.890
So we're looking good.

152
00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:29.270
The last thing I want to show you is how to post to the API and specifically how to send a tweet.

153
00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:30.810
So let's go back to Twitter.

154
00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:31.720
Dot com.

155
00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:35.600
And here we go.

156
00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:40.210
So it's as simple as this.

157
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:48.530
We just post instead of get and we're posting a status update and then we're adding our new status which

158
00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:50.380
is essentially our new tweet.

159
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:56.170
So let's do that just before we get the tweets and then we should be able to see it.

160
00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:00.810
All right.

161
00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:04.370
This came from my Twitter app

162
00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:09.390
wonderful.

163
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.530
All right let's take a look.

164
00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:15.010
Well refresh that's looking promising.

165
00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:16.800
OK so great.

166
00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:17.910
This came from my Twitter app.

167
00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:19.680
Definitely seems to have been returned.

168
00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:25.960
Let's have a look on Twitter itself and with any luck it should be there.

169
00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:27.730
Wonderful.

170
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:34.350
So in just a few minutes we've set up a new app that we can use to connect to Twitter and we can view

171
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.110
the user's timeline and send tweets as well.

172
00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:42.060
And then the next video we're going to put this together to make a small but very functional Twitter

173
00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:42.630
client.
