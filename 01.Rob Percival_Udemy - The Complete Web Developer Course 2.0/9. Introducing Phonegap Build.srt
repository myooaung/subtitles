1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:06,490
Now that we've built our fantastic HMO based app our next challenge is to get it onto the app stores.

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:08,290
And as always there's a number of ways to do this.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:15,430
But the simplest and quickest is to use service called phone gap build and we can find this app build

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:24,000
dot phone gap dot com now phone gap was a system to package HDMI all based apps in a format that could

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,370
be submitted to the major app stores.

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,190
It was then purchased by Adobe and rebranded Cordova and as well as allowing your app to go on the app

7
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:32,730
stores.

8
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:39,960
It also allows you to use plugins to access deeper aspects of the devices functionality like the accelerometer

9
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,180
or the G.P.S. or the microphone.

10
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,760
So if you want to do things like that then have a Google for cord over plugins and see what else there

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,900
is available.

12
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:54,870
We're gonna be focused here though on getting our app in the app stores as quickly as possible so quickly

13
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,850
scrolling down here again feel free to pause and have a read if you want to know more about phone get

14
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:00,510
built.

15
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,740
But we're going to be focusing on the free plan here that allows you to have one app with a maximum

16
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:09,530
size of 50 megabytes and you can use all the major Cordova plug in.

17
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,350
Not that we're going to be actively using any of those today.

18
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,870
So click the completely free button and then you'll need an Adobe I.D..

19
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:31,390
So I'll pretend that I didn't have one and sign up for 1 0 years up to code stuff dot com and then I'll

20
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:35,460
just put in a random password

21
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,250
and then agree to the terms of use

22
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:50,790
and that will then sign us up and take us through to the apps page and you can see we've got the option

23
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,980
to import from github or upload a zip file and we're going to do the latter.

24
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:00,500
So here are my files.

25
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:07,740
I've just got one index file and then I've got a CSX and J.S. and zapped a DOJ s as well so I'm going

26
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:18,420
to right click on those and compress for items and I'll just rename that Abdullah zip okay.

27
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:25,730
And then let's click upload is it and then we should be able to find it in mobile apps and there it

28
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:25,910
is.

29
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,160
So that will then upload the file for you and prepare it.

30
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,740
And I'll call it Rob's email client

31
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:47,450
pretty simple and then click ready to build it will then start producing the various files to deploy

32
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,100
for different platforms.

33
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:55,810
So here you can see the Windows Phone version has already completed so I can actually download that

34
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,470
straight away and run it on my windows phone.

35
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:06,370
Now I can do the same with Android as well so that will download an android file that I will be able

36
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,700
to run on my android phone.

37
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:15,160
It's an AP Okay so if you've used those before they're actually pretty easy to install on your phone.

38
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,500
IOW however is a little bit more complicated.

39
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,460
You don't just get a nice simple download for Iowa you need to do a little bit of work and in fact for

40
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,940
each of these you will need to do something called signing.

41
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:30,340
If you want to submit them to an app store and signing is essentially the process of proving ownership

42
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,510
of your app so that you can submit updates and generally control the app later on.

43
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:38,530
That process is not trivial for either of the two major app stores.

44
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,200
So I'm gonna show you how to do it in the next two videos.

45
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:47,770
We'll start with Android and then I'll show you how to set up your keys and signature files for ISIS.

46
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:53,170
And at the end of that you'll have something that you could completely admit to Google Play or the appstore.
