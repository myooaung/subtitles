00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,980
So welcome back to the complete web developer course as I mentioned in this section we're going to be

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,570
looking at style.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,920
So hopefully you have made a website that looks a little bit like this.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,860
Can see we've got all the kind of cool HDMI elements in there but it doesn't look right.

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,220
We obviously want to be building beautiful websites as well as useful ones and for that we're going

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,960
to need some style and we create style using Cascading Style Sheets or.

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,610
SS So what on earth is a cascading style sheet.

8
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,590
Well we've actually seen one before.

9
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:38,460
When we looked at the code of example dot com which we get from right clicking or control thing and

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,080
then a few page source in crime.

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:48,240
You'll remember that we looked over the style section just then and this is a cascading style sheet

12
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,380
and it's pretty simple how it works.

13
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,480
We get the name of the element that we're styling.

14
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:00,350
So body Dave that could be in each one or UL or an image or anything.

15
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:06,760
And then we have some curly brackets and inside the curly brackets we have some style information.

16
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:12,230
So background color margin padding font family with all sorts of things.

17
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,970
There's a huge number of ways that we can style our page using Cascading Style Sheets.

18
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,230
And the real advantage of them is that they're completely separate from the H TNL itself which is a

19
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:27,200
very useful job then of keeping style and content separate.

20
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,380
This Jemini makes your code more readable.

21
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:35,250
It's easier to update and maintain and it has a really useful feature that you could completely restyle

22
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,360
your website without actually changing the TNL of the content at all.

23
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:47,280
And an example of that can be found if you google CSSA then you can see we've got three schools at the

24
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:47,700
top here.

25
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:54,660
If you click on the second results CSSA introduction then they've got a bit more information about CSSA

26
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,730
if you want to know more than you can read that.

27
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,640
But I'm just going to show you this example home page here with a certain stylesheet.

28
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:08,370
If we then apply a second style sheet to it the page looks completely different even though the TNL

29
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,350
is exactly the same.

30
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,230
We can do that again stylesheet three.

31
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:18,270
And now it looks like the three school's Web site itself stuff for looks completely different again

32
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:24,060
and we can even remove the stylesheet and we get back to the web page that looks more similar to what

33
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,640
we created in the previous section.

34
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:34,080
So to summarize CSSA is a simple and powerful way to apply styling to your websites to make them look

35
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,440
great in the next video then we'll apply a style sheet to our own web page and see in detail how it

36
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,370
works.
