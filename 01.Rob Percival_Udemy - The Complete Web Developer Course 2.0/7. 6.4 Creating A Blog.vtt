00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.700
All right so now I'm going to lead you through the process of setting up X and customizing it to create

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.540
a great looking blog web site.

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.750
If you don't already have a blog or some sort of portfolio site then I'd thoroughly recommend getting

4
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.480
one online whether you use the x theme or not.

5
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.870
There's no better time to start building your online portfolio and growing your profile.

6
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:26.850
But right now so once you've purchased the theme you can download it from the force directly or you

7
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.020
can go to community dot dot co and to an account there.

8
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.420
And that's what I've done.

9
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:38.760
And I'm then going to click download x and obviously you should download whatever the latest version

10
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.420
is.

11
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.660
While we're here as well I should say that there's a really good knowledge base for x which shows you

12
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.940
how to set up the demo content.

13
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:54.220
The child themes were comments and a whole load of other features that come with a theme as well.

14
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.520
This is another big advantage of buying these games because they're so popular.

15
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.320
They come with a huge amount of help and guidance.

16
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.650
And if there's anything that you can't find in the knowledge base you can check out the forum as well.

17
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.360
And each purchase of the theme comes with six month support within the form.

18
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.970
All right.

19
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.910
So we've now got our extort zip folder.

20
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.010
How do we get that into our WordPress installation.

21
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.470
Or we go back to appearance and themes

22
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.240
and then we add a new theme.

23
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:35.200
But this time instead of searching on word presto we're going to upload a theme then we choose the file.

24
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:46.280
So that's XTO zip and install now and that will then upload the file to WordPress and install the theme

25
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.020
for us.

26
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.350
And let's activate it once again.

27
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.490
And here we go.

28
00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:01.670
So we're now installed but we do have an extension to add cornerstone is essentially X's version of

29
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.810
the customize and allows us to customize the page.

30
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.610
But in a more powerful way and we can with the D for Wordpress customize.

31
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.590
So just click install plug in and that will do all the work for you.

32
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.620
And then we get to that's now set up for us.

33
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.940
So now we want to get our site looking good and it's pretty easy to start doing that with x.

34
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:40.380
We just click demo content and that will allow us to set up any of the demos that exist on the same

35
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.440
website.

36
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.860
So your usual process here is likely to be to click through a number of these demos and find the one

37
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.640
which is closest to the sort of site that you want to make.

38
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:52.840
We want to make a blog.

39
00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:00.000
So I quite liked the look of Renu five we saw very briefly in the previous video.

40
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.190
You're very welcome of course to choose a different theme if you like but we'll be working with this

41
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.770
one.

42
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.490
So very straightforward to set up.

43
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:15.540
We just click we knew five and then I would generally recommend if you're starting with a new site to

44
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:23.340
import the posts and the portfolio items I should add as well that X has added some expanded demos which

45
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.740
you can see at the bottom of the demo page.

46
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.360
And the advantage of these is that they contain not just a general layout for your page but all of the

47
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.660
content as well.

48
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.870
So if you're wanting to set up for example a church web site you could use the expanded demo and you

49
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.070
would get all of this content set up for you immediately.

50
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.640
Now there aren't that many expanded demos right now but more are coming.

51
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.090
And if it happens that you want to make a site that looks pretty close to one of those that will definitely

52
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.240
make your life a lot easier.

53
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.230
But we'll focus on the standard demos for the moment.

54
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:08.770
So I'll just click back to renew five and then yep we're happy to have rights.

55
00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.330
Everything that we've set up so far.

56
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.570
I think I'll just clear up my tabs a little bit.

57
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:22.400
And there we go.

58
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:23.540
That's done.

59
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.600
Let's have a look and see what our site looks like now.

60
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.120
And here we go.

61
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:35.210
So you can see that it already has a look and feel of that theme and hopefully you're getting the idea

62
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.010
with wordpress that design and content are completely separated.

63
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:44.390
So we've had three completely different looking sites here pretty much exactly the same content just

64
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.130
by changing the theme.

65
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:52.760
Notice also that with these themes you don't get the images included you will have to add those yourself.

66
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:55.150
All right.

67
00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.340
So let's do a little bit of customization.

68
00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.540
So I've just picked edit with cornerstone in there and here we go.

69
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:08.520
You can see it looks pretty similar to the Wordpress customize but it's got a lot more features.

70
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:14.310
So just like with the Customize that we can select particular sections and then customize customize

71
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.570
them so we can change the name of the section if we really want to.

72
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:25.100
And then this section is made up of two rows so we can edit that first section first row.

73
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.890
We could change

74
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:34.560
the text then

75
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.960
we can change the size of the text

76
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:48.640
change the color

77
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:59.660
alignments and we can specify some specific ID's classes or styles if we want to get a little bit more.

78
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:06.620
Cody and we can do the same thing with all of the elements here just by clicking on them so we could

79
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.780
change that text and

80
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:15.650
maybe I've got a mailing list.

81
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:16.850
I want them to sign up to see

82
00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:27.500
and as before we can change the link and the type of BOTTEN sites et cetera et cetera.

83
00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:35.240
The x theme has a number of icons built in as well so we can change those if we fancy to.

84
00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:41.130
And again we can choose an ID class or style scrolling down.

85
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.830
We can change the image and obviously upload a new image if we want to.

86
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:52.990
Which we do using the standard media library within Wordpress and we can change all the other options

87
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.460
as well.

88
00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.400
So I'm not going to run through everything on this page.

89
00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.490
I'm sure you get the idea how it works but there are a couple of other cool features I'd like to share.

90
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:08.570
We can choose a template from the various options.

91
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.460
So if we want to add a pricing plans page for example

92
00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.750
then we can add that and that will overwrite everything that we've got here.

93
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:30.960
And adds a nice looking pricing plans page with NFA Q At the bottom as well I should point out that

94
00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:36.090
this is responsive to say it will look good on any screen size and you can see here that the menu has

95
00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:44.040
changed into a drop down one because we're on a relatively narrow screen and we can insert any of these

96
00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:51.430
blocks to add some standard layouts to our pages to.

97
00:07:51.630 --> 00:08:02.620
So I'm just going to change that see an about page and you can see that again we've got some nicely

98
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:08.670
laid out the full content which we could get rid of anything that we didn't need and change the text

99
00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.140
and content for anything that we did.

100
00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:17.020
So it's pretty easy to add new content blocks as well within those concept blocks.

101
00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:26.720
If we click on elements then we can add smaller bits of content so say we want alerts pop underneath

102
00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:34.020
our core values so we're familiar with alerts now from Bootstrap X theme alerts have a slightly different

103
00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:40.550
style but you get the idea we can put the title and content on again change the padding and everything

104
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:54.760
else and we can change the type from a success to an information a warning to danger as well.

105
00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:03.630
And even at a closed bottom so that the user can get rid of the lead if they want the say these are

106
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:09.400
the various different elements should be reasonably familiar with most of these element types.

107
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:16.050
But again we can add them just with a simple drag and drop to al-Qaeda.

108
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:24.550
The third option along the top is a search which just allows you to click on anything on the page and

109
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:29.440
then edit it in the way that we've seen.

110
00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:34.420
And the fourth option is settings which allows you to put some custom CSSA and Javascript in there if

111
00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:45.220
you want to but also to change the main settings of the page say I might make that Rupp's block

112
00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:54.990
and we can change various other settings if we want say as well.

113
00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:06.120
Headings two paragraphs.

114
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:10.890
All right so that gives you an overview of how we add content to our site.

115
00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:11.700
Once we've done say

116
00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:26.260
we click the save button which will then updates everything to our live site and if we take a look we

117
00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:31.580
should be able to see all of that in practice.

118
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:39.740
So if I was making this my home page I'd keep things pretty simple so I'd get rid of that.

119
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:44.130
Let's just by clicking delete

120
00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:58.370
and then change the text see something more relevant and then update

121
00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:04.730
the content here.

122
00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:13.030
To whatever I wanted and I would recommend doing something similar if you are going to create a portfolio

123
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:17.390
page of your own to talk about what you do and what you're interested in.

124
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:26.580
And then you can just say that and you've spent therefore a very minimal amount of time setting up your

125
00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:32.130
site which means you can spend a lot more time on your content which is where you should really focus

126
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.810
your efforts so you can see the blog already looks pretty good.

127
00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:40.070
We've got a few demo blog posts in there already.

128
00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:48.940
And of course if you want to edit those you do that in the standard WordPress way.

129
00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:53.900
So you just go to posts and then you can edit them here.

130
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:57.840
And the nice thing about these demos is that you can use them essentially as templates.

131
00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:04.480
So if you want to have a video post then you could start with that one and copy it or at least see how

132
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:13.940
it set up with the video and then edit its to change it to whatever content you want.

133
00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:19.150
And the final thing to show you then is we've got a new option down the side here.

134
00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.780
Portfolio.

135
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:25.050
So the X theme has portfolios built in.

136
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:30.580
And of course if you want to show off your web design or app development skills aport failure is a great

137
00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:31.620
way to do it.

138
00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:41.450
You can see we've got a portfolio here on the left in this demo and we need to add some content before

139
00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:42.820
those will display.

140
00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:50.080
But essentially each of these would be a picture of a Web site you've made or a photograph you've taken

141
00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:55.000
or a song that you've written whatever it is that you're trying to show others that you can do really

142
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:55.680
well.

143
00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.840
So that's pretty much it.

144
00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:03.730
There's an obvious challenge from this video that is go and build a portfolio or blog Web site of your

145
00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:04.330
own.

146
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:05.110
It's pretty easy.

147
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:08.100
It doesn't take that long and it's well worth having online.

148
00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:13.330
Regardless of whether you want to be a web developer or an artist or an accountant online portfolio

149
00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:18.280
of your own to tell the world about who you are and what you can do is an extremely valuable thing.

150
00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.310
So go and make one.

151
00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:23.360
And when you've done it let me know about it on Twitter and I'll read you to the world.

152
00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:24.680
Have fun.
