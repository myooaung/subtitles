1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:05,440
So we've moved away a little bit from programming in the last couple of sections of the course looking

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,650
at bootstrap and Wordpress which are really useful tools for web developers of all types but now we're

3
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,020
going to very much go back and start coding once again.

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:21,010
And in this section we're going to be looking at a language called HP before I tell you specifically

5
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,110
what BHP is.

6
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:26,950
I want to give you a quick summary of how the various languages that you have learned and are going

7
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:28,830
to learn in this course fit together.

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,410
So this is how a basic web site works.

9
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:37,570
We've got the web browser here which works on a computer's machine and all the languages that we've

10
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,840
learned so far work within the web browsers.

11
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,750
HTL is processed by the web browser as is.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,120
C Ss for styling and Javascript and Jay Querrey both run within the browser as well.

13
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:54,450
So those are great languages but there's a number of things that we can do in the browser.

14
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:01,090
We can't store users information permanently on the browser because the browser gets closed down and

15
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:07,930
we want a way to store that data somewhere centrally so the user can access it anywhere on the web.

16
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:13,870
So the web browser of course connects to the Internet and the Internet gets all its information for

17
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:20,290
a particular Web site from a web server so you can think of this essentially as a computer we're part

18
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:25,160
of a big gigantic computer that is sitting in a server farm somewhere.

19
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:30,400
And every time your website gets sequestered essentially what happens is the server does something to

20
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:37,630
generate the HD MLC SS and Javascript and then sends that to the user's browser where those three get

21
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,470
processed.

22
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,360
So there are languages that work on the web server and allow us to do web service specific things like

23
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,680
logging a user in overturning their tweets or saving their progress in a game.

24
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,670
And by far the most popular language on the Web today is HP.

25
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,560
So that's why we're starting with that one.

26
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,070
HP actually powers over 80 percent of the web at the time of making this course.

27
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:07,890
And although it's not the most popular or fashionable language to learn it is a really useful one and

28
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,750
I still recommend it as the first server side language that a web developer should learn.

29
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,560
It's also the language that WordPress is built in learning.

30
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:21,780
HP will enable you to create WordPress plugins customize WordPress themes and essentially do whatever

31
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:28,470
you want within WordPress page B is also associated strongly with the my Esky Well database type which

32
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,970
again is the most popular database type on the web and that's what we're going to be seeing how to work

33
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,700
with in the next section.

34
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:39,660
So a very quick introduction to HP then we're going to be working with the latest version of HP which

35
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,030
is actually HP 7.

36
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:49,050
And as you can see from this introduction on W3 schools ph stands for PH P hypertext preprocessor.

37
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:56,670
Essentially that means we're processing the hypertext or the HTL before providing that to the user's

38
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,430
browser.

39
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:03,820
It's completely free and open source and a page file that we'll see in the next video as the don't pay

40
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:10,710
HP extension and it can contain ph p h t m l c s s and javascript's so we can use all four languages

41
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:16,500
together in the one file type if you want to learn a bit more about HP and feel free to just go to this

42
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,950
page on three schools or Google ph introduction something like that.

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,250
The last thing I just want to show you is historically ph is a pretty old language.

44
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:30,930
It was developed in 1994 and that's another reason to learn it first because there's a huge amount of

45
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,370
help for HP on line and anything that you will want to do.

46
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,510
Someone will have asked how to do it before.

47
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,080
Usually on stack overflow and the answers will be right there in Google for you.

48
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,430
So that's reason enough for you to learn HP in the next video.

49
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,960
We'll go on to create our first hello world page in DHP.
