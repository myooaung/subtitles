1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,930
So we're getting quite close.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:06,310
The user can now follow or unfollow specific users.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:15,430
And then when they do those uses tweets appear in the time line and also we can see their tweets on

4
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:20,620
the main page and see whether they're following or not following that particular person.

5
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,420
So there's not that much left to do.

6
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:28,540
We need to allow the user to post tweets which is what we're getting today in this video and then we're

7
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:35,520
just going to enable public profiles and searching of tweets in the final video coming out next.

8
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,710
So posting tweets is actually pretty straightforward.

9
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:44,070
We just need to call AJ queery method.

10
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:54,670
When the posting tweets button is clicked and here we need to set

11
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,730
ad ID for that.

12
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:07,020
I posted tweet button should do and remember we'll need the tweet Content ID as well.

13
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:15,230
So either in Foote's it up HP set this up in the usual way.

14
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,960
So weve got an ID.

15
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,470
You want to set a click to its

16
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:34,100
Lets get a little bit further than just letting Halo and this time will put tweet content don't foul.

17
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,270
So just to make sure that we can get the tweet content

18
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,150
and something's gone a little wrong there.

19
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:56,770
I think first off we might need to switch from a form to a div because once again we're not actually

20
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,450
wanting to submit the form.

21
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,100
And let's get rid of that type submit there as well.

22
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:09,870
And let's make sure that we've saved fitted up AHP.

23
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,930
OK that should work.

24
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,650
There we go.

25
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:14,940
It's empty.

26
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,200
I put some text in there we go.

27
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:25,960
So of course we want to submit that to actions don't pay HP.

28
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:35,780
So let's grab some code to do that and the action is going to be post tweet

29
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:45,440
and all we need is tweet content.

30
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,130
And that's going to be

31
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,540
tweet content dot

32
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,100
I came.

33
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:11,820
Now we're getting familiar with how to set this up so we can just do a check to see if action is equal.

34
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:19,470
See now actually forgotten what it was let's just go and check and floated up AHP post tweet

35
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:37,210
then as before we just print all the post variables and then unfits it up here.

36
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:42,110
Well a alert the result.

37
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,980
OK so now put some alleys in there.

38
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,100
Tweak content is a SDF

39
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:03,640
so we should probably do a check to make sure that there is some content

40
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,610
say so if that isn't

41
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:19,280
the content will echo your tweet is empty

42
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:30,500
and let's just make sure we spell that right and we should check that the string is not too long as

43
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,480
well.

44
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,570
So let's just see how we get the length of a string.

45
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:42,050
String get length that looks promising.

46
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:56,380
So as TR Eliot perfect.

47
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:06,440
I think I've actually started writing my ph P in the wrong place so let's just paste that in.

48
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:12,260
Copy that and undo all of that deary me.

49
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:17,360
We'll save that for a pitch P And We should be working actions stop HP here.

50
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,630
OK that's better.

51
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:31,620
So if there's no sweet content will echo your tweets is empty.

52
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,790
Else if the tweet content

53
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,920
is greater than 140 characters

54
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:52,920
them will echo your tweet is too long.

55
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,010
And Else we'll post it

56
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,690
say let's just check first off your tweets Dempsey.

57
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,410
Excellent.

58
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:18,610
And if I put tons and tons and tons and tons of characters in it's to be 140 Surely your tweets too

59
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:19,290
long.

60
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,470
Perfect.

61
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:26,030
And if I just put four characters in we get a empty response.

62
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:36,100
William So what we need today is an insets So I'm just going to copy the code from that and we want

63
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:44,130
to insert into tweets let's remind ourselves what tweets looks like.

64
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:51,230
So we've got an idea which we don't need to set tweet which we do user ID and date time

65
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,200
say tweet

66
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,080
user ID.

67
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:12,140
I think with a lower case i and date time and then some values.

68
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,080
So the tweet

69
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:19,910
itself is going to copy that.

70
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:27,660
So the tweet needs need to be in single quotes and this is going to be the post variable

71
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:37,630
tweet content and then we'll have the user id which is the current user.

72
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,790
So session id and date time

73
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:50,450
we can actually insert directly using my secure well with now

74
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,300
and then our turn 1

75
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,540
OK.

76
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,090
This is a test

77
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:14,780
one looking promising let's just go back to the home page.

78
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,450
We should have there it is.

79
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:22,340
This is the test has now been tweeted We do get this s s effect.

80
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:29,390
Because I shortened seconds to just X

81
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,710
let's use SCC.

82
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:42,820
OK that's great so I think all that remains is to show the user a message to say whether it's been successful

83
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,110
or not

84
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:56,530
say when we display the tweet box we'll have a couple of hidden divs.

85
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:07,170
So we'll have tweet success which you have a class of let's

86
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,760
let success

87
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:25,220
and he or tweet was posted successfully.

88
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,470
We'll also have a Dave with an ID of tweet fail.

89
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:36,750
That's going to have a class of alert and alert danger.

90
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:47,430
And we'll close the day because we can add the content to that ourselves.

91
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,040
So tweet success and tweet fail.

92
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,290
We both want a big hidden.

93
00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:06,450
So let's advise them to tweet success display none.

94
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:11,660
You could obviously have all these in a single decoration if you like.

95
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,480
I'm going to keep them separate.

96
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:20,700
So that we can style them separately if we want to.

97
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,380
And then back that sea footed up here HP

98
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,830
if we get a result of one

99
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:45,540
then we want to find tweet success and show it simple as that.

100
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,940
I think I will just check to make sure that result

101
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,710
is not empty.

102
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:04,030
Because we might get an error back or something.

103
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:16,730
Then in this case we'll be using tweet fail and we'll set the HMO to whatever the error messages.

104
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:21,900
And then again we'll show it.

105
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:26,610
We should also hide tweet success

106
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,240
when there's been a failure.

107
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:42,750
And vice versa we should hide tweet fail when there's been a success

108
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:47,790
OK.

109
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,860
Well look another test come.

110
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,600
Fingers crossed.

111
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:00,300
I knew I shouldn't of written so much as a test.

112
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:06,040
Let's have a look see if something's gone wrong thing in the javascript console

113
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:10,960
OK.

114
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,210
Let's have a look.

115
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,570
Results.

116
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:23,990
Just check Yeah we are echoing one that we should get a response of some sort.

117
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:31,760
OK so we got your tweet is empty.

118
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,460
Is there an issue with.

119
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,200
Tweet fail

120
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,830
Kid B tell you what let's test that by

121
00:12:53,670 --> 00:13:00,580
taking out the display is hidden for Tweet file and we should be able to see it at the start.

122
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,350
There we go.

123
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:05,620
So empty tweet OK.

124
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,180
That worked.

125
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:15,670
What if I want to tweet tweet fail we get a one on everything does seem to be fine.

126
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,960
So let's put that back in.

127
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,260
Maybe it just hadn't quite saved

128
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:35,120
does sometimes get that error if it hasn't saved the file properly.

129
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,040
Tweet fail so we feel we should now

130
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,530
post tweet success Hurrah.

131
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,140
OK and let's just get rid of the alert now that we don't need it.

132
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:57,610
Brilliant.

133
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:00,730
So now the user can post tweets.

134
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:07,040
We're in a position to set up your tweets page which we'll do in the same way we set up the timeline

135
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,440
page.

136
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:19,100
So back over to T-P and create a file called your tweet stoppie HP.

137
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,800
Open that up before we edit it

138
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:24,850
at

139
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:33,030
an if statement for that so your tweets

140
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,310
and we want to open your tweets top.

141
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:52,420
P which will say our usual greetings high that clicks click your tweets that begin wonderful.

142
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,940
So now we've added that page let's copy over

143
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:05,260
the home page code and we'll just change that to your tweets

144
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:21,870
and we'll call the display tweets function again but we'll set the type to your tweets.

145
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:29,020
So back I have it two functions duppy HP.

146
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,650
And then this is going to be a much more straightforward.

147
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:48,480
If type is equal say your tweets then where clause in this case is just going to equal where user ID

148
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:52,660
is equal to a.

149
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:53,710
And then we want.

150
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:58,860
Q Well I real escape

151
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:07,580
string and session ID

152
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:18,050
and that should find all the tweets from our user that have a look

153
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:28,780
OK let's cheat again and comb out the query to see what's going wrong.

154
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:38,240
So it's like stuffing tweets where a user ID equals and then nothing well that's interesting.

155
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:41,870
Let's just see what they type.

156
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,780
Variable is a type is indeed your tweets

157
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:56,410
so to make sure we're in the right place I go out

158
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,360
just the where clause

159
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:09,930
Yep.

160
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,180
Let's get rid of that.

161
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:14,860
OK.

162
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,400
And

163
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:25,760
might be very obvious what's going wrong but it's not clear to me.

164
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:31,860
Let's have a look at the session variable it is empty.

165
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:38,000
OK so somehow in all of that we've got logged out shouldn't have happened because at the beginning of

166
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:48,200
functions ph P We have sessions starts it could possibly be that's when we were saving functions or

167
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,780
Ph HP that didn't get opened.

168
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,760
So the session didn't get started.

169
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:54,040
So we got logged out.

170
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:58,150
So let's look back in as we're up 3 at Rob dot com

171
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,210
that's looking better.

172
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,990
So now back over to your tweets.

173
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,030
There we go.

174
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:13,490
So now we do have a session id of nine but it's still not putting it in the WHERE clause.

175
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:14,270
For some reason

176
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,250
yes.

177
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,360
There we go.

178
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:27,040
Say being logged out was a bit of a red herring because mostly I'd forgotten to put a link in the

179
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,510
there we go.

180
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,530
So there's Rob three at Rob dot coms.

181
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:35,850
Wonderful tweets

182
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:41,920
and we can now get rid of the WHERE clause

183
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:49,790
great so users can now tweet and view their own tweets if they want to.

184
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:55,400
There's two more things that are needed then and one is a search and the other is being able to view

185
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,620
public profiles and we'll set up both of those in the next and final video.
