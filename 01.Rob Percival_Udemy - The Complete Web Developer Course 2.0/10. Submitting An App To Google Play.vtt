00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.060
This video I'm going to show you the process for signing your app to get it ready for putting it on

2
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.600
the Google Play Android App Store.

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.040
Please note two things.

4
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.770
Firstly you will need to be a paid member of the Google Play developer console in order to get your

5
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.880
app on the Google Play store and that cost $25 a year.

6
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.880
And secondly the instructions that I'm about to show you do update quite regularly.

7
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.760
So please consider this a general guide and you might have to do a little bit of googling to get everything

8
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.770
working in your particular set up.

9
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.840
Having said that will cover all of the main principles and the process once you know what's going on

10
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.650
is not too complicated.

11
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.810
So I'm going to be following along with the phone gap build guide which you can get by searching for

12
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.760
something like phone gap build Android signing.

13
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.590
That's what we want to do we want to sign our apps to use for Android.

14
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.740
And that first result there is what I want.

15
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.960
So you should be on a page that looks like this.

16
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.540
And the main thing that we want to do here is generate a private key which essentially proves ownership

17
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.260
of the app to us and as a prerequisite for putting the app on Google Play.

18
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.770
So step one that is you can see download and install Java.

19
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.080
So you may well have Java installed.

20
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:24.220
I don't at the moment so I'm going to agree and start the download.

21
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.470
It's exactly the same process by the way on Windows.

22
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.570
And then I'm going to open up that file that's downloaded and on my system here I have to double click

23
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:44.260
on that icon put in my password and then just click through the set up steps and then we get continue

24
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.580
and close.

25
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.280
Note that we can't test Java on Chrome but we've completed the installation process so hopefully we

26
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.930
should be fine.

27
00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:02.480
Then we need to set the Java home directory so follow the instructions here as two sets of instructions

28
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.560
one for Unix systems and one for Windows systems.

29
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:16.730
I'm on a Mac here so I'm going to click that first link to download the Java JDK which is the Java development

30
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.720
kit which is slightly different to the version of Java that we just downloaded.

31
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.710
Both are needed in this case.

32
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:33.110
So I would download that first option then and then you'll need to accept the license agreement and

33
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.270
then choose your operating system.

34
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.120
So if you're on OSX then you'll click that one if you're on Windows.

35
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.970
If you've got a 32 bit machine then you want the S-ICD 6 version and if you're on a 64 bit machine you

36
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.550
want the windows x 64 version.

37
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:56.630
If you're not sure whether you're on 32 bit or 64 bit Windows then just open Windows Explorer and right

38
00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:04.760
click on the computer icon and then click properties then click the system tab and that will tell you

39
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.820
whether you're in 64 or 32 bit Windows.

40
00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.250
If you really can't find out then go for the 32 bit version because that will work on both 32 and 64

41
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.410
bit systems.

42
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.410
Now I already have this installed so I'm not going to go through this process.

43
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.930
But again it is just a matter of downloading it and then clicking through the installation windows and

44
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.410
then you need to set the Java home directory.

45
00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:35.180
So if you're on a Mac you need to do command space to open up a spotlight and then terminal to open

46
00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.630
up a terminal window and then you use these commands here.

47
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.470
So export Java equals.

48
00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.480
And then you put the directory where it's installed.

49
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.320
So it's probably that one or something very similar to it.

50
00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.770
And you said that to your Java home variable.

51
00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:06.120
I'm not going to do that because I've already set this up and then use that second line to set up the

52
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.520
Java path on Windows.

53
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:10.980
You do it slightly differently.

54
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.660
You right click my computer and select Properties and then on the Advanced tappy select environment

55
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.720
variables and then edit Java home to point to wherever you installed the JDK which will probably be

56
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.010
something like that.

57
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.500
All right.

58
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.380
Now it's time to generate our key.

59
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.240
So on a Mac go back to the terminal window.

60
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.640
On Windows you need to open a command prompt which you do this by clicking the start button and then

61
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:40.210
typing.

62
00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.940
C M D.

63
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.430
That's C M D in the box that appears to have a command and that will get you something that looks very

64
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.090
similar to this but in fact it's a little bit more like that.

65
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.640
All right I'm sorry we're nearly there.

66
00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:04.000
Then you copy this command not including the string part at the beginning and paste that into either

67
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.080
your terminal window or your command prompt depending on whether you're on Mac or Windows.

68
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.700
And then we just need to change these variables here.

69
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:25.960
So I'll just put something fairly generic in my alias name for the alias and then jumping through the

70
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.600
and then keeps store 9 to Keystone for the Keystone.

71
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:41.060
If you are going to call your app something like email app might call this email app store and email

72
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.630
app alias or something like that.

73
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.160
Then you press enter and it will ask you for a password.

74
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:56.280
So I put in a nice secure one there I'm just going to put in something fairly simple for now and then

75
00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.980
you put in details about yourself

76
00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.790
it doesn't matter too much what the answers to these questions are.

77
00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.880
But you should be able to repeat them later on.

78
00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.810
So keep them noted down somewhere.

79
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.390
If you need to then just type.

80
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:29.770
Yes it will generate the key still for you and you can enter a new password for this particular alias

81
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.990
if you want to.

82
00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.370
I'm just going to leave it the same.

83
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.140
So I'm going to answer.

84
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:35.280
And there we go.

85
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.220
So that's now Stuart the key still for me

86
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.160
heading down here.

87
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.150
You can see we're now ready to submit our key to phone get built.

88
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:55.670
So let's jump back over there and we're going to need to click signing keys.

89
00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.720
So let's go to the dropdown at the top and then it is a count

90
00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:09.000
and then signing keys and we want to add a key for Android

91
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.450
and the title can be whatever you like.

92
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:18.160
So email app key and the alias.

93
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:24.850
I'd recommend having the same as the alias that you chose.

94
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:31.820
So my alias name then we're going to choose file to upload our Keystone file.

95
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:39.680
If you're on a Mac you can get a desktop and then click command up to get to your root directory which

96
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.930
is likely where the key store is saved unless you saved it somewhere specific.

97
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:50.900
On Windows it will be saved in whatever directory you had

98
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:58.170
open when you started the command tool.

99
00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:03.310
So in this case it will be C-Drive slash uses a mere slash desktop slash TNP.

100
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:06.950
Go back and check in your command window if you want to know what that was.

101
00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:08.720
So then going back either here.

102
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:19.330
We'll choose file again and we have to go back there again so from the desktop backup command up and

103
00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:31.560
then Keystone name Pistone and then submit key and that's done and then looking down at the options

104
00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:31.990
here.

105
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:37.250
We then need to unlock our key to prove that we own it.

106
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:40.330
So we can do that.

107
00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:45.180
Clicking the lock there and then

108
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:55.220
putting the password in that we entered when we created the key and then submit and if you get that

109
00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:59.380
right it should turn into a little unlocked padlock symbol.

110
00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:12.100
So now we can go back over to our apps or just the one app and click on Android and then we can click

111
00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:21.700
on the email client name and then we can on the Android version choose the key that we've just unlocked

112
00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.090
and then it will just verify that everything's OK.

113
00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:32.080
And if it is then we'll be able to download a version of the app which is signed with that particular

114
00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.500
key and there we go.

115
00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:35.300
Looking good.

116
00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:41.120
So then we just download the IP K as we did before.

117
00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:47.110
And you'll notice that when it's downloaded it's got the release name in here.

118
00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:51.350
So this is a version of the app that we could put on the Google Play Store.

119
00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:53.950
OK.

120
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.730
So now we have our JPK.

121
00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:01.420
We're no longer doing anything specifically with phone bills.

122
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:08.810
We just want to submit our app to google play so we can search for instructions to do that.

123
00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:13.200
That launch checklist is very useful because you all need to do a lot of checking and debugging to make

124
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:18.990
sure your app works properly on different devices as well as having things like icon images and launch

125
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.300
images ready.

126
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:25.340
But we're going to jump straight to the Google Play develop a console.

127
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:29.560
And here is where we can add a new application.

128
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:34.980
Note that if you don't have an active Google Play publisher account you'll be prompted to pay the $25

129
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.280
to get one.

130
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.290
And here you just put in the title of your app.

131
00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:52.190
So e-mail up by Rob and we'll start with uploading the IP k.

132
00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:52.790
Here we go.

133
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:55.210
Upload your first AP K to production.

134
00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.080
Exciting stuff.

135
00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.440
And then let's browse and there it is.

136
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:08.270
The AP file release version so that it will upload that and verify all of the keys and make sure that

137
00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:10.050
it's a valid IP.

138
00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.900
That can go on the on Google Play.

139
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:14.160
Yes.

140
00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:15.850
And there is something I've forgotten here.

141
00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:21.240
We do need to put a package name in what we can do that pretty easily.

142
00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:27.010
We just go back to Bill and click Settings and then scroll down.

143
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:32.060
We can put in custom icon file here as well which would definitely be a good idea if you're releasing

144
00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.020
a real app.

145
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.450
And then he is where we put the package name.

146
00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.870
And this is usually something like chrome dots.

147
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.420
And then your company name or your name.

148
00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:48.540
So I'm going to go for code styles and then the app name.

149
00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:52.800
So email client by Rob.

150
00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:58.910
That's like the reverse of the web address starts with com then has company name or your name and then

151
00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:05.150
the package name should all be lowercase and shouldn't include any strange characters and I'll call

152
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:08.140
it Version 1.0 as well.

153
00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:14.860
And I'll just pop something in the description your description of course should be more detailed than

154
00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:19.050
that.

155
00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:20.300
And then we'll save that

156
00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:28.840
and it will produce a new version which we'll be able to download.

157
00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:34.250
And the more we attempt the upload and with any luck it will work this time.

158
00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:35.380
And there we go.

159
00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:38.000
So let's now download the AP Okay.

160
00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:47.730
Again same but with a one after it and we'll now go back to Google Play upload another AP k.

161
00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:51.110
Choose the version that was just downloaded.

162
00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:52.880
Open that.

163
00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:54.670
Keep your fingers crossed.

164
00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.190
And there we go.
