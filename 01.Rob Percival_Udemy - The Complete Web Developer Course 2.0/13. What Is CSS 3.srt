00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,820
Having looks at HVM L5 in some detail we're now going to examine the new features in CSSA three CSSA

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:13,800
three is the latest version of the cascading style sheets language and it brings a lot of new and cool

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,810
features that we're going to be examining in the next few videos.

4
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:22,470
We're going to start by looking at advanced selectors and pseudo classes which allow us to access particular

5
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,460
elements very easily then we're going to look at how we can do calculations within CSSA.

6
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,400
So for example we could change the width of one column of a page relative to the screen size without

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,550
using javascript.

8
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:39,840
Then we'll look at the more graphical sites including gradients shadows transformations and animations.

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,900
And finally we'll look at some of the new layout features specific to CSSA three to get you a little

10
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,090
bit excited though I thought I'd show you a few of the cool things that we can do.

11
00:00:51,540 --> 00:01:03,780
So we can do all sorts of fading effects and transitions using C-s three we can do cool tech shadowing

12
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:15,090
like bats and even make it interactive as the user can move the light source around we can make a cube

13
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,540
which has text on all sides and we can rotate around with the arrow keys.

14
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:30,490
And we got this nice cool parallax effect as well where we can effectively have depth to our images

15
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:34,260
and then animate them completely using CSSA.

16
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,620
So there are a lot of cool stuff we can do.

17
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,910
We'll start in the next video.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,190
Looking at selectors.
