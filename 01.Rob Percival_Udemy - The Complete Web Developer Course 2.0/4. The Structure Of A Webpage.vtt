00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.850
So what is this HTL that I've been talking about so much.

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.800
Well it stands for HyperText Markup Language And essentially it's the language of the web it's the language

3
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.760
that every web page is written in.

4
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.430
If you want to learn more about it just google what is HDMI.

5
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.770
And there's some great explanations there that have a bit more detail.

6
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:24.670
But for now I'm going to show you some HDMI L and that's what we're going to be working with.

7
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.960
So we're going to go to a very nice web site called example dot com which is very much what it says

8
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.630
on the tin.

9
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.380
It's an example Web site.

10
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.300
It's a nice easy way to get used to what aged mail is and how it works.

11
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.940
So this is what exampled dot com looks like what we want to do is to look at the HCM L that creates

12
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.780
this page and we can do that very easily in crime by control clicking or right clicking on the page

13
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.380
and clicking view page source.

14
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.120
You can do it in most other browsers as well but this is it.

15
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:05.000
So this is the page source or the HTL mail that creates this page.

16
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.710
So let's have a little look and see what's going on here.

17
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.980
First off you'll notice that quite a few things have these angle brackets around them.

18
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:21.120
These are called tags and they are special keywords that tell the browser something about the code that's

19
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.480
being written.

20
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.070
So here you can see at the very top we've got a doctype which just tells the browser the document type

21
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.810
that we're working with here which is of course HGL then we've got a second tag which says it's DML

22
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.680
and that's where the TNL begins.

23
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.750
Now if I jump right to the end of the document down here you can see we've got the same thing but with

24
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.190
a slash before it here.

25
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.360
And so that means that is where the L ends.

26
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.480
So the tag at the top here is known as the opening tag because it's where the HVM l begins and then

27
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.160
the tag at the end is the ending tag or closing tag because it's where the HDMI ends.

28
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.010
Then moving down we've got the head or head of the document.

29
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:15.340
So this part is where information about the documents such as its title and some other special information

30
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.320
is stored.

31
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.300
We'll look at that a little bit more detail in a minute but just notice we've got a closing tag there

32
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.380
with head in it.

33
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.200
So that's where the head ends.

34
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.800
So this bit here.

35
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.320
Is the head of the page.

36
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.530
I'm going to ignore the contents of the head for the moment because I'm a little bit more complicated

37
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.050
and just go straight to the body.

38
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.700
So after the head comes the body and there's the clothes intact for the body.

39
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.830
So this is the body part of the page which as you might guess contains the main content of the page.

40
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.060
Then after the body we have a DIV tag.

41
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.790
Dave here is short for division or section of a Web site.

42
00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:03.350
So we might divide the different sections up into different divisions and we do that using Dave tags.

43
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.780
So from the day of starting time to the day of ending tag is the div section.

44
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.140
Now we're almost at the first bit of content here.

45
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:18.600
But just before that we've got another type which is H-1 and that's known as a header tag and it's header

46
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:19.350
one.

47
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.260
So this is the main header for the page.

48
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.760
And there you can see it's closing tag.

49
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.360
So this is the each part of the domain.

50
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:36.230
And essentially what that does is it takes the text example domain and makes it nice and big and bold.

51
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:43.000
So the browser knows to make example domain big and bold because it's inside these H-1 tags here.

52
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.300
Next we've got PPI which is short for paragraph.

53
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.580
So this is the paragraph tag and this section here is therefore a paragraph and paragraph just means

54
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.070
normal text really.

55
00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.790
So as you can see this text is just displayed normally it's not particularly big and bold.

56
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:10.770
And then underneath that we've got a second paragraph section which has inside it a link We're going

57
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.420
to be talking more about links later on so I won't go into exactly how this works.

58
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.250
But as you might guess this link if you click on it will lead to this page here.

59
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.420
So IANA dot org slash domains slash example.

60
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.000
Not sure if I pronounce that right.

61
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.400
Hopefully you get the idea.

62
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.270
So that's the actual content of the page which is contained within the body tags there.

63
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.080
And that's why it ends up looking like that.

64
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.790
But there's a little bit more style that we haven't looked at yet we've got this gray background and

65
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.020
we've got this curvy white box here as well.

66
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.560
So where is that encoded in the l.

67
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.440
Well this is why we need to look in the head section.

68
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.370
So now let's have a quick look and see if we can get to grips with this.

69
00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:00.940
So first off we've got a title which is example the name and the title is what appears in the browser

70
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:01.930
tab up here.

71
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:08.460
You can actually see it anywhere in the page itself but it's what appears in that tab up there.

72
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.330
Then we have a char set or character set UTF 8 is the standard character set.

73
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.410
If you want to check out exactly what UTF 8 is feel free to have a quick Google.

74
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.970
But for now we just need to know that our standard character set that we're going to be using is UTF.

75
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.720
Then we have a second metor tag which is Content-Type.

76
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.140
So this tells the browser again what the type of content is that we have here.

77
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:42.100
And it's just text H.J. email and UTF 8 just reinforces what we've seen up here.

78
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:50.260
Then we have a viewport a tag which defines the width of our page which is just set to a device with

79
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.610
and the initial scale is one which makes sense with optically want to zoom in or zoom out.

80
00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:01.670
When we load the page and then finally we've got this style section.

81
00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:08.440
So this is CSX or cascading style sheets which we'll be looking at in much more detail in the next section.

82
00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:13.020
But for now we can just have a look at some of it and see what it might be doing.

83
00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:19.360
So first of all we've got a body here which matches our body tag down there and we've got a background

84
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:26.350
color and then a special code and this code actually matches the gray of this background color.

85
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.320
So if you had a different code here you'd have a different background color.

86
00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.250
And we've got a margin in paddings settings and we've got a font settings as well.

87
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:38.700
So there's a number of different fonts that might be used on this page.

88
00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:45.840
And then we've got some styling instructions for the DIV tag which you'll remember is that section there.

89
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:53.130
So it's good to with in a certain number of pixels a margin some padding a background color and a border

90
00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.250
radius.

91
00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:01.350
So that's what sets up this white box to be the width that it is and to have those nice curvy borders

92
00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:02.120
there.

93
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:12.080
And finally we've got our link color which just sets the color of the link to this blue here and the

94
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.100
text decoration.

95
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:13.970
None.

96
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:20.790
Tells it not to be underlined because normally links are underlined but on this Web site they are not.

97
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:26.540
And this last bit here I won't go into much detail but really it's just some special stylings that only

98
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.900
happen if the width is less than 700 pixels.

99
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.460
I probably you're looking at it on a phone.

100
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.720
So that's it.

101
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.850
We'll be looking at this in much more detail in the next video.

102
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:45.140
But all you need to remember at this stage is that we have tags in each L which open and close and there

103
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:52.970
are certain special tags that divide up the sections of our code so the header and then the body and

104
00:07:52.970 --> 00:08:01.190
then within those sections we have more tags that allow us to adjust the style and the contents of the

105
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.470
page that we're creating.

106
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:04.180
Got that.

107
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:10.100
I hope so in the next video then we'll go back to your text editor and we'll start creating a website

108
00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:11.360
for ourselves.
