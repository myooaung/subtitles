00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:08.280
So now we're going to move on from shadows and gradients to transformations and animations.

2
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:16.380
So this you can really use to do some pretty cool stuff but we'll start off with something pretty simple.

3
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:25.790
So let's start with a div with an ID of box and then we'll take our books and we'll give it a width

4
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:40.040
of 100 pixels and a height of 100 pixels a background color of red and just for fun we use the CSSA

5
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:50.750
property border radius of 10 pixels to give it slightly rounded corners.

6
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.900
And then we're going to see how we can apply a number of different transformations to this box some

7
00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.700
of which may seem pretty trivial but when they get combined with an animation that's when you'll see

8
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.460
the power of them.

9
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:13.090
So we apply the transformation with transform and then a nice simple one would be translate and we might

10
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:20.400
want to make it 50 pixels to the right and 50 pixels down.

11
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.910
And that just shifts it right and down.

12
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:34.630
Now that might look pretty boring in itself but when we combine it with a box of a pseudo class and

13
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:42.250
we put the transformation in the pseudo class and we apply a transition

14
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.370
property to the box itself and a classic here would be one second.

15
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:58.190
And then ease in out and we'll look at what exactly is going on there in a moment.

16
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.410
But let's just see this in action.

17
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.090
So now we've got no transformation but when we hover the box slowly moves

18
00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:18.490
from the animated state to its previous state and this is the key of how we do animation with CSSA transformations.

19
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:30.680
So obviously the one second here just describes the time it takes to do the transition the easy way

20
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.620
out means that it starts off slowly then gets a little bit quicker and then slows down a bit at the

21
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.830
end so just gives it sort of slightly more bouncy feel if you don't want that bouncy feel then you can

22
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:53.770
have a linear transition and that will then move without changing speed from one to the other.

23
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.740
If for some reason you want the transition

24
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:06.740
to be quick at the beginning and then ease in and then a linear one after that you can use AZN.

25
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.060
But for the vast majority probably easing out is going to look the best

26
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:15.360
All right.

27
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.380
So once you've got that figured out it's just a matter of practicing the other types of transformation

28
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.840
so we can do rotations using transform rotate.

29
00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:42.440
So maybe we want to rotate 40 degrees we use 40 deg and then that will then apply on the hover.

30
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:50.470
You can of course apply the transformation to the box itself and just have it appear like that by default

31
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.170
if you want to.

32
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.960
We don't have to do animations here.

33
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.490
It's just a bit more fun when you're practicing to use animations.

34
00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:05.000
We can make things bigger or smaller using transform scale.

35
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:13.080
So we give the X transform so maybe we want to double the size in the horizontal direction and maybe

36
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.710
we want to quadruple the size in the vertical direction see that happen.

37
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.410
There we go.

38
00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.590
So you can see it's keeping the center the same there but it's stretching it out.

39
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.620
Horizontally and twice as much vertically.

40
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.700
And the last one I'll show you is a skew

41
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.790
where you can stretch it out different amounts in both directions.

42
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.330
So if we try 20 degrees and 30 degrees

43
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.700
see what that looks like get this sort of weird stretch effect.

44
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.440
So again it's the sort of thing you want to use Sutley you don't want probably to have a big effect

45
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:12.730
like that but it can just give a user a nice feeling if your buttons respond to that clicks in a nice

46
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:13.390
way.

47
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.890
And the scaling can be useful as well if you've got a lot of information on the page and the user hovers

48
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.930
over something you might want to make that thing a little bigger to make it easier for them to read.

49
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.020
So those are two the transformations that we can even do 3D transformations.

50
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.810
So to make this a little bit clearer We'll put some text in there this time.

51
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.770
And we'll have an aerial funt

52
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.840
and we'll send to

53
00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.810
horizontally.

54
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.290
And because we're using Z-axis 3 Let's get a vertical alignment in there as well and we can do that

55
00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:11.850
using display is flex to use a flex box which will look at more detail in the next video.

56
00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:23.530
But once we've defined the display is Flex we can use a line items to center to apply a vertical centering.

57
00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:31.470
But if we do that then instead of using text to line center we'll need to use justify content center

58
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.340
to get our horizontal centering.

59
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:41.710
And of course that should be font family the style arrogant.

60
00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:42.580
That's better.

61
00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:43.980
Maybe just make it a touch bigger

62
00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.260
maybe even 200.

63
00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.830
So let's apply a 3D transformation now.

64
00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.510
First movies will be very tight.

65
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:22.010
X. So this rotates around the X or horizontal axis and that's try 180 degrees see what that looks like.

66
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:29.380
You can see we get this flip effect right.

67
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:33.850
Even rotates the text as well.

68
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:37.560
Of course we can do a rotate y to rotate around the vertical axis

69
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:51.560
like that and rotate that rotates around the imaginary axis coming out of the screen.

70
00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:54.180
There we go.

71
00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:56.020
And that's the basis of it.

72
00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:01.690
You can do of course a lot more with CSSA three transformations and animations but that's as far as

73
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:02.950
we're going to take it here.

74
00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.880
I've given several late in the document at the end of this chapter if you want to investigate more.

75
00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:11.710
And if you do have an anti-Semite and want to start creating fancy animations or recreating complex

76
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:17.830
logos in CSSA which is a popular pastime for many then those links would be a good place to start.

77
00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.950
For us though we're nearly done with CSSA three.

78
00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:25.330
I've just got a few more things to show you and we'll do that in the final video of the section when

79
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:26.970
we look at the layout.
