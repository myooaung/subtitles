1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:07.080
So now that we spent the time building and the C like framework for our Twitter web app and we've got

2
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.720
log in and sign up working well doing the rest should be relatively straightforward.

3
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.800
Let's hope so.

4
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:22.170
We're going to start by creating the home page for our Twitter web app and to do that we'll need some

5
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.660
actual tweets.

6
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.110
So I'm going to go over to the database and create a new table

7
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.400
which will be tweets and that's going to be fairly simple.

8
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:47.660
We're going to start with an ID which will also be our primary key and then we'll have the tweets itself.

9
00:00:49.490 --> 00:01:04.440
The user ID which will be an IT AND the date time which will be a date time

10
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:08.350
every day.

11
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.600
That's all I need to know about my tweets.

12
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.540
So just click save.

13
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.010
And then let's add a couple of random tweets.

14
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:32.820
Just before we do that we'll check a couple of user IDs so I'll go for 7 and 8 as being my user IDs.

15
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:44.930
So let's insert loving this Web site from user ID number 7 and will use now for the date time

16
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.470
and something similar.

17
00:01:51.470 --> 00:02:00.990
This is great for a user ID number 8 and will use now again there we go.

18
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.810
So we've added those.

19
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.900
I'm just going to change the time a little bit on that second one to make it a little bit earlier.

20
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.830
Just so that we've got two different times to compare.

21
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.290
OK.

22
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:24.990
So now this code is mostly going to be going in home dot ph P and I want to set it up so that we've

23
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.750
got two columns with a main column with a bunch of tweets in it and then a right hand column where the

24
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.500
user can search tweets and post a new one as well.

25
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:41.910
So let's just remind ourselves how to do that either on the bootstrap site.

26
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.560
So we'll go back to lay out

27
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.580
and then great

28
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.080
and find something fairly similar to what we're after.

29
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:04.160
So that second option there eight and four it's pretty perfect.

30
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:15.630
So let's copy that Eva Yeah and just check that it looks about right.

31
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.970
Yeah.

32
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.580
Wonderful.

33
00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.250
OK.

34
00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.290
So in this column we're going to have

35
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.160
recent tweets.

36
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.940
I think I'll make a quick extra class for this container.

37
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.560
So let's add in a little bit of padding for its

38
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.080
just try and overhaul padding of 20 pixels which feels about right.

39
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.520
And there we go much better.

40
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.230
OK.

41
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.270
So now we want to generate some tweets.

42
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:17.010
I'm going to do that with a P P function but I'm not going to write the code here because this is a

43
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:17.970
view.

44
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:28.560
So I'm just going to have a simple function call display tweets and I'm going to specify that we want

45
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.000
all public tweets displayed here.

46
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.120
And then I'm going to get into functions or page pay.

47
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.930
And this is where I'm going to create the

48
00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:44.900
display tweets

49
00:04:53.210 --> 00:05:05.330
function so you can see what we're doing that is separating the lay out in home up HP and the code into

50
00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.380
functions Doppie HP.

51
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.520
So first off let's just check everything is connected up.

52
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.250
So we should get Puplick there.

53
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:19.330
There we go.

54
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.090
So if

55
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:31.250
type is equal to a public then we're going to want to set a specific query then I'm going to have a

56
00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:39.500
variable called Where clause and with public it's just going to be empty and we'll see why that is in

57
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:47.540
a minute because then we're going to create our query which will be select stuff from tweets

58
00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.990
and that is where we're going to have a WHERE clause.

59
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.360
So in other cases it might only pick up tweets from a particular user but here we want all the tweets.

60
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.540
So we don't actually need a WHERE clause at all.

61
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.910
But we will order by the

62
00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.640
time which I remember is date time

63
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:32.640
and we want the newest at the top say descending and I'll have a limit of 10 as well.

64
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:39.250
So I'll just by diethyl display 10 tweets then we'll get our results.

65
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.680
It's going to be my ask you Ally Querrey

66
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:52.210
link and Querrey.

67
00:06:52.280 --> 00:07:02.540
Then let's check to see that we've got some results that will check for my ask you rely around use of

68
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.170
results.

69
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:04.250
And I'll actually check.

70
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:12.470
First off to see if we don't have any results and if that's the case we'll just.

71
00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:13.580
OK.

72
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:17.680
There are no tweets to display

73
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:29.880
so I'm actually going to check if that's working just by putting an error in my query and we should

74
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.550
get there are no tweets to display.

75
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.400
Great.

76
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:43.100
And then when I remove the I should get rid of that era but it doesn't.

77
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:53.940
And that's because we need to be able to access the link variable inside this function here and we can

78
00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:59.100
do that by making it global like that.

79
00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:05.230
So this just says we want to be able to access the link variable from inside this function.

80
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:10.290
If we now run that yep that disappears which means we are getting some results.

81
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:21.850
So if that's the case let's loop through our results we'll do that using while we'll create a re variable

82
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:26.940
he called T minus Q L fetch.

83
00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:36.620
Associated rose and want to do that for.

84
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:37.800
Result.

85
00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:42.030
And initially we'll just echo

86
00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:48.410
the tweet before we run.

87
00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:52.870
Let's make the mistake of forgetting that there.

88
00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:54.830
Take a look.

89
00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:57.650
Excellent.

90
00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.140
So loving this Web site.

91
00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:00.930
And this is great.

92
00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:05.330
So let's start getting this tweet displayed correctly.

93
00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:12.290
We'll start off by getting the user's information so we'll need a nother query

94
00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:19.600
which is going to be selecting stuff from uses

95
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.300
where ID is equal to the

96
00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:35.340
and we're going to ask you Will I escape

97
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:38.440
string.

98
00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:39.560
Not to forget the real

99
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:48.000
link and the row.

100
00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:51.100
I think we call that user ID.

101
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:52.060
Let's have a look.

102
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.020
Yep.

103
00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:08.640
One and actually that's cool this use of Querrey

104
00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:25.390
then we'll get use a query result it's going to be my ask your rely queery link use equerry

105
00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.390
and we'll have a user

106
00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.400
which is equal to a cure.

107
00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:37.690
I fetch

108
00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:49.870
a sock and use a query result

109
00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:58.230
and just to check that everything is working well.

110
00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.740
Display the user information.

111
00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:03.330
Let's take a look.

112
00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:09.910
OK.

113
00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:12.840
So I'm going to carry

114
00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:25.910
P and then they use the e-mail address to start off with

115
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:33.860
we haven't asked them to choose a specific username so I'm going to use the e-mail address as their

116
00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.970
kind of identifier.

117
00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.560
Next we want the time.

118
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:43.700
Now Twitter has a nice feature that instead of just giving the date and time it says two minutes ago

119
00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:46.610
or four seconds ago or something like that.

120
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:48.480
So let's see if we can find out a way to do that.

121
00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:49.340
MP HP

122
00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.520
I'm just going to touch forget two minutes ago.

123
00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:57.980
OK.

124
00:11:57.980 --> 00:11:58.940
There we go.

125
00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.380
First result

126
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:05.120
seems pretty good.

127
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:07.820
And this result looks pretty good.

128
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:13.620
So it looks like it's going to create what we want.

129
00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:16.100
So let's copy it over into our

130
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:21.950
functions dot page.

131
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.160
Now we can use time since

132
00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:44.290
to convert our time and we'll need to do it using the current time minus the time stamp which we get

133
00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:58.900
from SDR to time from the date time column which is the date and time that the tweet was posted.

134
00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:02.170
So let's have a look at that.

135
00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:03.760
Fantastic.

136
00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:07.520
So that's working correctly we got 31 minutes and an hour which looks about right.

137
00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:14.640
I'm just going to change it slightly.

138
00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:22.100
So we have men yes just to keep that a bit shorter.

139
00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:26.050
And then let's also put a space in there.

140
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:40.010
And I'm going to add a span with a class of time so we can style that a little bit and we'll add.

141
00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:41.550
And I'd go as well.

142
00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:53.340
And then for our time classless just try something like color

143
00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:57.320
light gray

144
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:07.560
began great and I'm going to pit's

145
00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:19.970
a colon on the end of that as well and then we'll have our tweet and I'll put that in paragraph tags

146
00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:21.060
actually.

147
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:27.090
And then

148
00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:39.950
at the very end we'll put full or unfollowed at the moment.

149
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:44.970
I'll just put follow because we haven't built a following system yet.

150
00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:54.940
Excellent.

151
00:14:54.990 --> 00:15:02.830
One other thing I'm going to add is just to put a div around the whole thing with a class of tweet

152
00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:09.690
just so we can style it a little bit more.

153
00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:12.370
Not that I'm particularly worried about styling here.

154
00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:22.150
Say I'm going to try a border of one pick's solid gray

155
00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:30.440
a border radius of five x

156
00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:39.810
padding of five x and a margin of 5 as well

157
00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:50.880
OK something's going wrong there let's have a look at what it is.

158
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:57.610
So hasn't saved my changes things.

159
00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:04.170
Easily done go back and functions and say that's fresh again.

160
00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:05.050
There we go.

161
00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:06.470
Wonderful.

162
00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:11.470
Now as a developer I'm not going to go further on the design front but you definitely can.

163
00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:17.940
And obviously this is a pretty minimal design with no pictures or anything particularly fancy like that.

164
00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.830
So we're nearly there on the home page.

165
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:23.990
I'm just going to add two boxes on the right.

166
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.580
First is going to be a search box and then underneath that if the user is logged in we're going to give

167
00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:31.710
them a tweet box as well.

168
00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:35.340
So let's add those in.

169
00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:43.500
This is going to be her top HP.

170
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:48.430
Now the search box I suspect we're going to be using several times

171
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:59.160
so I'm going to write it as a P P function like that and then over and functions dot p p

172
00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.590
will create that function

173
00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:10.950
say display Sache

174
00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:19.970
will display that here we don't need any parameters.

175
00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:23.180
In fact it's just going to be a fairly straightforward eco statement.

176
00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:29.610
And it's going to be a simple bootstrap form as well.

177
00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:31.590
So let's get back to components.

178
00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:34.930
And forms

179
00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:56.620
and we'll have a simple inline form like this.

180
00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.230
In fact I use single quite stamp

181
00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:09.290
and then this is going to be a label for search.

182
00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:12.080
In fact we're not going to have a label at all

183
00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:18.040
which is have I place holder of Sache

184
00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:24.540
and that's going to remain the same and then we'll have how button

185
00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:37.400
for Sache tweets doesn't need to have a type.

186
00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:45.010
In fact this can just be a div because we're going to submit it by Ajax anyway.

187
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:46.980
OK let's take a look.

188
00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:48.310
Excellent.

189
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:49.610
Happy with that.

190
00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.070
And then

191
00:18:55.950 --> 00:19:03.470
underneath that we'll have display tweet box

192
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:09.240
we get.

193
00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:11.500
And again we'll have this as a function

194
00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:21.620
and we only want to do this if the user is logged in.

195
00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:28.730
So if there is a session id and it's greater than zero.

196
00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:41.620
Then we'll Echo more or less the same form as before.

197
00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:53.670
But we're going to want a textarea So let's just scroll up to get a textarea example.

198
00:19:53.680 --> 00:20:02.310
In fact I can use Command F or control f on Windows and textarea.

199
00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:03.000
We go.

200
00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.840
So it's pretty straightforward.

201
00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.230
Just use textarea instead of input

202
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:16.080
I'll call it tweet content.

203
00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:25.250
You want use a placeholder and we'll have to close that textarea

204
00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:32.820
and I'll change that to paste tweet

205
00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:42.270
K that doesn't display because he's not logged in.

206
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:49.290
So let's just quickly in fact will create a new account to get our own Rob 3D now.

207
00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:56.200
Sign up and there we go.

208
00:20:56.670 --> 00:21:01.920
So we now logged in still displaying our search box.

209
00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:03.900
Let's just do a quick check

210
00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:13.310
to see out session variable in action.

211
00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:15.070
Now it doesn't seem to be calling the

212
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:21.540
function at to just save that.

213
00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.740
Make sure it is calling it.

214
00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:24.520
There we go.

215
00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:30.850
Much better than that.

216
00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:32.560
Get rid of that now.

217
00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:38.520
And in fact I'm going to get rid of form in line for this one.

218
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.620
I would get much better.

219
00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:54.730
But I think we need something to divide is to say let's try a horizontal rule

220
00:21:58.110 --> 00:21:59.390
wonderful.

221
00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:01.440
So there's a few directions we could go now.

222
00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:07.800
We need to get following and following sort it we need to allow the user to post tweets.

223
00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:15.150
We need to allow the search tweet function and then we need to activate these three pages.

224
00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:20.300
I'm going to start in the next video with following and on following see if there.
