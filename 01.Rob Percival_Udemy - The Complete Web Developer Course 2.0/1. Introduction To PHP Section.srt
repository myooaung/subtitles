Welcome to Section 8 of the complete web developer course I have you enjoyed working with Wordpress

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:13,440
and you've already started building a shop or a blog or some other site using the platform and this

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:20,790
section will be returning to the more serious coding side of PH P ph pay as I said a language which

4
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,710
means it does a lot more than javascript can.

5
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:29,720
It can do things like send emails or connect to a database or process a contact form.

6
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,050
We'll start off by looking at the basics of programming in HP.

7
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,280
So that is things like for loops variables and arrays and if statements and then we'll be looking at

8
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,110
some of those specific features.

9
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,110
Moving on to creating a weather scraper where the user will be able to type in their location and get

10
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,900
the weather for that location.

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,040
So there's a lot to learn.

12
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,780
It's an exciting section and I hope you enjoy working with HP.
