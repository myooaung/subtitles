00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.310
Now that we've seen how to respond to a click and Jay query Let's see how we can update our Web site

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.280
content with it.

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.160
So I'm going to get rid of our squares for the moment and we'll get rid of that CSSA as well and we'll

4
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:22.700
sort of with a good old paragraph which is to say something boring like this is some text

5
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.760
OK.

6
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:34.880
And then what we want to do is change the text here when the green circle has been clicked.

7
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:42.280
So you'll remember hopefully that's to do something with the green circle is clicked.

8
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:50.510
We use hash to represent an ID and then circle for the ID name.

9
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.250
So how do we change HVM L with javascript.

10
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.940
It's actually really easy.

11
00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:07.190
We first select the element so I'm going to use string again to invoke J query and then in the parentheses

12
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.380
and quoits.

13
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.310
I'm just going to use p because it's only one paragraph so I might as well just use that rather than

14
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.470
go through the hassle of giving it a class or an ID.

15
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:24.000
So to change the HVM l of an element we use the L function.

16
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:31.570
Just select the paragraphs and then hatred you know and then whatever new content we want to put in

17
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.780
that

18
00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.070
this text has changed.

19
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:40.850
That's it.

20
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:41.810
Simple as that.

21
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.430
So let's click on that the text has changed.

22
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.410
Fabula So this don't aged HMO is the equivalent of the HDMI L from javascript.

23
00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:01.780
And we can also use it to actually get the contents of an element.

24
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.060
So if I use it in this form I could alert

25
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:19.530
that and this says get the element with a paragraph tag and get the DML contents of it and then alert

26
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.290
them.

27
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.710
So this should alert.

28
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:32.150
This is some text that we get so we can use the dot h d m l either to change the age DML of an element

29
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.840
or to get the HVM l of an element.

30
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.440
We can also very easily.

31
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:45.010
Instead of working with klick we could do something when the mouse hovers over the circle.

32
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.990
Now any ideas how we might do that with Jake Ri-Ri.

33
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.220
I wonder if you got it.

34
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.310
It's simply a matter of changing.

35
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.030
Click to dot hover.

36
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:09.000
Now when we hover over the page we don't have to click the alert pops up and it does it a few times

37
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.290
because as I move it does it again.

38
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.910
But you get the idea.

39
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.580
So again Jay Querrey super easy to change your code to work in a slightly different way.

40
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:26.070
We can also change all sorts of things about an HDMI element and exactly the same way.

41
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:34.580
So if we get rid of that mini challenge for you can you create an I-frame with the contents of CNN dot

42
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.470
com in it.

43
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.030
Durford

44
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.680
OK.

45
00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.210
I hope you manage that.

46
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:55.200
It's just a matter of creating an I-frame and then giving it an S or C or a source of HTP on double

47
00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.750
slash of it w w c and dot com

48
00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.500
OK let's have a look.

49
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.630
There we go.

50
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:15.840
So if I want to change the contents of this I-frame I could do that pretty easily with Jay query.

51
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.290
So first I'd have to select my I-frame.

52
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:19.090
Can you do that.

53
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:28.150
If you managed it it's just a string and then inside the quotes type.

54
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.000
I-frame that will select all the frames on the page.

55
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.080
But we've obviously only got one and then we want to change an attribute of the I-frame.

56
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:46.990
So we use 80 t r and this essentially allows me to change anything inside the tank here.

57
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:56.620
So if I want to change the SIRC I just put SIRC into the first pair of quotes and then a comma and then

58
00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.360
whatever I want to change it to in a second pair of quites.

59
00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:12.650
So possibly everyone's favorite web hosting company web posting our current UK Let's have a look.

60
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.850
So now it should load the CNN page.

61
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:22.410
And then when I hover over the green circle it will change the content and download go with hosting

62
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.060
current UK instead.

63
00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.590
And there it is.

64
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:33.440
So hopefully you're getting the idea that Jay query is very succinct and pretty intuitive.

65
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:39.450
So it's pretty easy to see what's going on here and easy to change your code from site click to hover

66
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.080
or update the source of an I frame.

67
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.230
All right so now we've changed web site content.

68
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.530
Let's see how we change styles with Jake.
