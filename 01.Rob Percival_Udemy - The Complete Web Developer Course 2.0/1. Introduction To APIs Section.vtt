00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:08.440
Welcome to Section 10 of the complete web developer course you've now covered HMO CSSA javascript on

2
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.610
the client side and ph pay my escrow on the service side.

3
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.970
So that's pretty much everything you need to build any web website that's currently in existence.

4
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:24.750
But there are a lot of powerful web services that you can hook your website into without having to build

5
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.470
your own systems.

6
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.680
And we do this using API eyes and that's what we'll be looking at in this section.

7
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.190
We'll start off by crafting our weather app to use an official API which has a number of advantages

8
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.700
over the scrapin method that we used a couple of sections ago.

9
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.380
Then we'll see how to use the Google Maps API to display maps in our apps and get immediate results

10
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.070
for for example postcodes or other location data.

11
00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.020
Then we'll use a third type of API to access a real Twitter account and this will enable us to send

12
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.910
tweets to view the users tweets and also to send and receive direct messages.

13
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.630
Once we learn how to do that we can put it all together by building our own Twitter clients IPs are

14
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:20.650
hugely powerful and allow you to leverage the content and data that some of these massive web services

15
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.130
like Twitter and Google Maps can provide.

16
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.800
So as always be thinking about how you could use one of these IPs in Web sites that you are developing.

17
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.800
And I hope you enjoy this section.
