00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.170
So welcome to the first of our two page ph challenges.

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.670
This is the smaller of the two.

3
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.780
But it should give you an opportunity to practice pretty much everything that we've covered especially

4
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.970
the post variables and sending e-mails and ph.

5
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.420
And it will also use our bootstrap skills and a little bit of Jey query as well.

6
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.330
So this is what we're after.

7
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.280
We want a nice looking bootstrap based contact form.

8
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.410
So this is what we're after.

9
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.000
We want a nice bootstrap based form which asks for the user's e-mail address the subject of the message

10
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.960
and the content of their message.

11
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.050
We then want some jay query validation.

12
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.700
So if we try and submit the form incorrectly it gets us messages telling us what we need to fix and

13
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:53.400
then if we submit the form supposedly correctly at least as far as the computer can tell then it sends

14
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.330
the message and we're actually doing ph P server side validation as well.

15
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.570
So we're checking that the email address is valid.

16
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.860
We're checking the subject and content are there.

17
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.880
The e-mail address is there as well.

18
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.310
And that's important because you can't just do javascript validation because someone may have javascript

19
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.530
turned off for example or be posting to your form directly and then you do need to validate on the server

20
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.370
side with HP as well.

21
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.110
So that's it.

22
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.930
You've definitely got almost all those skills that just a couple of small bits that we haven't covered.

23
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.490
But you can definitely get those with a very quick bit of googling.

24
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.210
So as always give it a good go yourself.

25
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.570
And then I'll go through it afterwards.

26
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.550
Best of luck.

27
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.760
All right.

28
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:54.470
I've got one well I'm going to start by getting our boot strap templates which I'm going to find by

29
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.190
searching for P-trap for.

30
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.070
And that takes me to this page.

31
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.410
It will take you to a different page if bootstrap is in a later version by the time you're watching

32
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.450
this course.

33
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.180
And then I'm going to click download bootstrap and introduction

34
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.520
and then find the starter template

35
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:26.930
and we get.

36
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.580
So let's just save that and make sure we've got something that looks bootstrapping.

37
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.150
There it is wonderful.

38
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.040
So let's pop that into a container div

39
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.660
and we'll change the H-1 see

40
00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.780
get in touch.

41
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:01.980
Wonderful.

42
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.700
Now we're going to want a bootstrap form.

43
00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.740
So I'm going to go back over to bootstrap and find the form which is under components

44
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:21.430
and then we get and we'll copy and paste the code of the most similar form that we're after.

45
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.340
That's that top one should work just fine.

46
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.980
And there's no shame in copying and pasting.

47
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.080
In fact you're less likely to make mistakes or forget things.

48
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.800
If you copy and paste from templates as long as you remain.

49
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.050
Remember to update all of the code to what you need.

50
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.010
That's absolutely fine.

51
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.220
All right let's see.

52
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.360
So there's our very nice looking form rather more than we need.

53
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.440
So let's start customizing it.

54
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.520
So we're going to keep this form pretty simple.

55
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:07.270
We're going to need an email address a subject line and then a text area for them to put the main content

56
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.300
of what they want to get in touch about.

57
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.140
So I'm going see

58
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:21.670
Keep the email address and the password which will become our subject line and then we'll get rid of

59
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:28.840
the selects and everything up to the textarea will keep the text area

60
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.540
and then we'll get rid of everything else.

61
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.070
All the way down to the submit button.

62
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.410
So let's have a look at that should be a bit more manageable.

63
00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.430
That looks great.

64
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.030
So that first one I want to get rid of all of the examples.

65
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:58.450
So I'm just going to call this email and we'll leave that as it is ID.

66
00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.080
It's going to be email

67
00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.750
and I'm just going to change that to enter your email address.

68
00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:09.160
We'll leave.

69
00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.500
They will never share your email with anyone else that's generally a good idea.

70
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.480
To say that and then

71
00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.420
I'll change password to subject.

72
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:35.080
And this is going to be a subject and the type now is just text with an ID of subject.

73
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.340
And I think we won't have a placeholder for that one

74
00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:43.680
let's have a look.

75
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:44.040
Exham

76
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.620
and for the label for the textarea

77
00:05:53.330 --> 00:06:02.670
Well that's something like what would you'd like to ask us something like that and I'll call that content.

78
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.800
And three raise is fine.

79
00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.630
There we go.

80
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.590
So that's all looking Now let's add a little bit of validation.

81
00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:23.440
So the on the javascript side the email address will already be validated that's taken care of within

82
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.280
the bootstrap.

83
00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:29.170
But we want to insist upon the subject and the content fields to be filled in.

84
00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.090
So let's add an ID to our button

85
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:41.820
we'll just call it submit and then we want to run some query ran when the button is clicked.

86
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:51.010
So I'll add that down here underneath the bootstrap and Jay query.

87
00:06:51.980 --> 00:07:00.430
So we'll have a script with a type of text slash Javascript.

88
00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:07.420
So at the moment when we click the submit button it of course submit the form and we want to stop that

89
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:11.420
happening so that we can do our validation and then submit the form manually.

90
00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.390
If it passes the validation.

91
00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:15.680
So we haven't done that before.

92
00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:24.220
So let's do a quick google something like Stop form submitting query

93
00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.810
OK so we could look at the Submit API documentation.

94
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:39.420
I think this second route is going to be quick and I stopped form submitting using Jay Querrey Caylus

95
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:40.240
have a look.

96
00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:43.010
Aha.

97
00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:44.760
So what we've got here.

98
00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:53.520
It's selecting the form and then it's doing something on submit and then we've got this function either

99
00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:57.900
prevent default which stops it from submitting the form.

100
00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:03.430
So that looks like it's perfect from our point of view.

101
00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:14.850
So let's just add in the close parentheses them and then let's take a look if we now submit you can

102
00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:20.450
see it's not refreshing the page.

103
00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:27.960
So now let's do our validation and we'll do that in just the same way that we did before.

104
00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:36.570
So we'll set the error string initially to an empty string and then we'll check for the values of the

105
00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:38.620
subject and content fields.

106
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:42.370
And if they're empty then we'll add to the error string.

107
00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:45.390
So if

108
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:55.620
subject failed to that dollar and then subjects that gets the subject field we want to get the value

109
00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:56.700
of the subject field.

110
00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:02.640
And we want to check to see if that's equal to an empty string if it's empty.

111
00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:13.320
And if it is we want to append to the error string so we can do that with either error plus equals or

112
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:19.640
error equals error plus and then something plus equals is a little bit neater.

113
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:31.700
So we'll get to that one and we'll have something like the subject field is required

114
00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.030
and then I'll do the same for content.

115
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:37.980
In a moment.

116
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:41.040
But I want to check that it's all working properly fast.

117
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:45.320
So let's add an empty area.

118
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:45.680
Dave

119
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:55.020
which is where we're going to contain our era and then we'll select that

120
00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:00.100
just like that.

121
00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:04.690
And then we want to set the HVM of the narrative to our

122
00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:08.340
guess.

123
00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:11.440
OK so let's just check see if that works.

124
00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.930
Excellent subject what is required.

125
00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:19.620
And if there is a subject then that becomes empty.

126
00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:20.710
William.

127
00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:27.420
So let's just copy and paste all of that because it's very similar for the content div.

128
00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.620
So you just change subjects to content

129
00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:38.230
and then just change the error message as well to the content filter is required.

130
00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:41.780
Let's have a look.

131
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:42.860
Excellent.

132
00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:43.590
OK.

133
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:44.640
Now that's nice.

134
00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:50.690
But I think we can make it even nicer by using the bootstrap alerts.

135
00:10:51.070 --> 00:11:06.680
So let's go back to bootstrap and find those alerts in the documentation and component's and there we

136
00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:11.190
get there let's say it's perfect for this sort of thing.

137
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.570
I think a danger alert that right one at the bottom there would be perfect for us

138
00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:22.130
OK.

139
00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:28.270
So we want to surround our error message with these live classes.

140
00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:35.760
So what we'll do is we'll check first of to see if there is an error message.

141
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.540
So if the error message if the error variable is not empty

142
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.020
then we don't just want to set the team to error.

143
00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:51.900
We want to set the HVM to

144
00:11:56.470 --> 00:12:00.520
a string with the error message in the middle.

145
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:04.270
So first off there's our string.

146
00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:07.330
Now one issue we might have here is that it's going over several lines

147
00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:15.980
which is not great for javascript because that will think that it's the end of the command and second

148
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:23.870
unit is of used single quotes to define our div text and that's because there are double quotes inside

149
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:25.030
the div itself.

150
00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:32.450
So if I try and use double quotes then you will see that it expects this to be the end of the string

151
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:39.500
which of course is not the other option there is to use backslash as we have seen earlier on in the

152
00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:46.370
course and that is a way of saying that we actually want to include this double quote in our string.

153
00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:54.020
It's not the end of the string but I think it's simpler to just use single quotes around the edge and

154
00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.720
then double quotes in the middle.

155
00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:57.550
OK.

156
00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:05.960
So now let's add some text to this.

157
00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:16.940
We can say there were errors either one or two in your form and then

158
00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:25.370
we can include the error message

159
00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:32.990
that we get.

160
00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:38.950
So we've now got the alert div content which should make it look a bit prettier.

161
00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:40.010
Let's have a look.

162
00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.590
So here we go.

163
00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.110
If I put nothing in there we go.

164
00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:50.920
So that's a much clearer and prettier way of showing the user's error messages.

165
00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:56.510
I think one thing I might alter slightly is just the layout of them because I don't like that these

166
00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:58.470
are two separated.

167
00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:09.890
So I think what I'll try is putting the strong error message inside paragraph tags and then just using

168
00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:16.930
B are to separate these two.

169
00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:19.940
So I put a B R in there.

170
00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:26.700
We don't need one at the end of the second one so let's have a look.

171
00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:27.250
There we go.

172
00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:29.430
I think that's a little bit each of them what we had before.

173
00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:34.940
You can of course play with the spacings and margins or paddings if you want to.

174
00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:36.300
Great.

175
00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:41.100
So now we want to submit the form if there are no errors.

176
00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.330
So how do we do that.

177
00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:43.680
Let's go back to our

178
00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:53.360
Jay query form submitting a question that we looked at on stack overflow because that was doing exactly

179
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.640
what we want to do.

180
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:59.360
Let's see if we can figure it out from this answer.

181
00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:06.000
And now looking at the bottom of this answer I think we've got what I need just here.

182
00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.000
So this does quite an interesting thing.

183
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.730
We have seen the bind command before.

184
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:15.050
But the problem that we have is if we just submit the form then that's going to go through this whole

185
00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.140
validation again.

186
00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:19.910
This is going to become recursive and it will never actually do the submission.

187
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:27.320
So what we actually need to do is unbind the function that we've attached to the Submit of that form

188
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:29.060
and then submit it.

189
00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:32.260
So we're basically saying don't do the validation any more because we've already done it once.

190
00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:45.920
But do the normal form submission so let's grab that and pop it in just so unbinding the submit would

191
00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:50.460
still work with single quotes but I like to have everything the same.

192
00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:52.530
So let's have a look.

193
00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:54.330
So let's just put in a subject.

194
00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:55.760
OK great.

195
00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:58.610
That works fine if we put in content as well.

196
00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:01.190
Then the form gets submitted.

197
00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.390
At least it looks like it does.

198
00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.240
Wonderful one slideshow.

199
00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:12.170
You may have noticed is that if the user leaves the email address blank then we don't get the Jaker

200
00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.190
validation.

201
00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:18.690
So we do actually need to check to see if there's an e-mail address as well.

202
00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:20.560
So that's easy enough.

203
00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:22.950
We just

204
00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:29.370
change that so that we're now checking for e-mail as well.

205
00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:31.920
Curlers have a look.

206
00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:37.400
Soon after we put in subject and content still hasn't work because we still need the email field.

207
00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.330
So then we put a full e-mail that doesn't work.

208
00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:46.740
So we really have to be pretty on our game and actually fill everything in correctly to get a submission

209
00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:55.250
that we gay rights and that were done on the javascript and Jay queery front.

210
00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:58.900
So now it's time to process our ph.

211
00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:03.240
So I'm going to do that as usual at the very top of our script.

212
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:11.740
And we'll start by just displaying the post variables.

213
00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:13.600
So let's see.

214
00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:17.310
Now interestingly you see we've got an empty array here.

215
00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:18.930
There is a good reason for that.

216
00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:24.740
And that is even though we've given these inputs IDs we haven't given them names.

217
00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:31.780
And it's actually the name that is passed through to the post variable on the server.

218
00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:35.060
So we need to go through and just give them

219
00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:50.170
the same name as the ID.

220
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:58.870
And just before we test that we'll also need to change the form method to post.

221
00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:02.430
Otherwise we won't see anything OK.

222
00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:09.130
So let's reload that page and then put in some dummy content and take a look.

223
00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:11.650
There we go.

224
00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:12.520
All right.

225
00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:17.990
Now that we've got our demo content we need to do our server side validation as well.

226
00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:22.630
It might seem like overkill but you definitely shouldn't rely just on Javascript validation because

227
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:28.440
someone could easily have the javascript turned off or they might post your script in some other way.

228
00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:34.720
So you should definitely do server side validation as well as the javascript stuff so that we need to

229
00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:38.760
set up in much the same way as we did before.

230
00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:44.650
So we'll do a check first off see if there are any post variables.

231
00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:49.180
Then we'll set our error to an empty string

232
00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:59.760
or checked to see if the e-mail address is empty.

233
00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:04.980
And there's actually quite an easy way to do that in Page Pate we can put an exclamation mark in front

234
00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:13.560
of it so that checks to see either if there's no e-mail post variable at all or that the POST variable

235
00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:14.990
is empty.

236
00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:21.360
So then we'll append to error using Dopp this time rather than Plus because we're in HP

237
00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:29.240
we'll have an email address is required.

238
00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.600
And again we'll have PR as well.

239
00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.030
And then we'll do the same

240
00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:40.240
for

241
00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:43.780
content

242
00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:49.040
the content field is required.

243
00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:51.970
And for subject

244
00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:59.280
and it we be worth validating the email address again as well.

245
00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.820
Let's see if we can find a way to do that.

246
00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:14.490
We've validated an e-mail address in Jay queery before but this looks pretty perfect.

247
00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:18.090
Validate email filter that we get.

248
00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:21.840
So we've actually got a built in function in HP to do that.

249
00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:29.540
We don't have to create the nasty validation string that we did in Jey query.

250
00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:32.740
So let's pop this in here.

251
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:38.010
So the e-mail address that we're validating is the post email

252
00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:43.380
we only care if it's not valid.

253
00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:50.880
So we take away this exclamation mark then I should check to see if the filter is false and therefore

254
00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:51.970
it's not valid.

255
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:03.010
There we go.

256
00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:07.610
So we don't just want to echo that error.

257
00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:12.210
We want to add it to the error string.

258
00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:17.970
So the e-mail address is in valid OK.

259
00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:23.170
And then we want to do something very similar to what we did here.

260
00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:28.670
If there's an error message then we want to create some HVM al

261
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:46.390
say if every string is no longer empty then this is the bit that we need to essentially copy and paste

262
00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:56.160
what we'll do is we'll take our and we'll set it equal say all of that.

263
00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:58.120
Let's do this properly.

264
00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.760
That is and close the command.

265
00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:08.520
Now we've got our complete error.

266
00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:10.840
Now how do we get that onto our page.

267
00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.700
Well it actually carries down this variable throughout the script.

268
00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:24.890
So what we can do is right here in our area Dave we can just echo era

269
00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:34.370
if it's empty it won't echo anything which is fine but if there's an error then it will display it there.

270
00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:36.730
OK just to check this out.

271
00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:44.040
I'm just going to temporarily cut the code from the script.

272
00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:53.010
So that we can stop the Java JavaScript validation and trap the page validation.

273
00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:57.080
We all notice an undefined variable there.

274
00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:00.850
It's not an error but it is a notice so we get to fix it.

275
00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:07.840
And that's because I've only created my error variable.

276
00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:16.150
If there's a post so if I define it either way then that notice should go away.

277
00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:16.980
Great.

278
00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:22.490
OK so let's just put some content in them and then submit then.

279
00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:23.050
Excellent.

280
00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.820
The required subject is required.

281
00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.580
And the e-mail address is invalid.

282
00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:29.780
Now that is not entirely true.

283
00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:33.210
They didn't put in an e-mail address so it's not quite invalid.

284
00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:38.140
So I think we'll just add this to check if

285
00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:50.790
there is an email address and it's doesn't pass the validation then it's invalid so let's resubmit that

286
00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:52.400
everywhere.

287
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:58.900
So we get an e-mail address is required but we don't get it's invalid if it's not OK.

288
00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:02.940
We're getting close.

289
00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:08.430
So we've now got our server side and our client side validation in place.

290
00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:13.450
You might wonder why we need the javascript validation if we're going to do the service validation anyway.

291
00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:17.740
The simple reason is it makes our script a bit nicer to use.

292
00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:24.090
So they don't have to wait for the form to submit the page to reload to get the error message.

293
00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:31.760
So now that we've got all our validation all that remains is to send out a form so we're going to do

294
00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:35.620
this if there's no error message.

295
00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:38.930
And let's set all the variables as necessary.

296
00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.190
So email t.

297
00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:46.570
That's just going to be me at my domain dot come

298
00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:50.580
subject.

299
00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:56.970
I was say equal say the subject the user entered

300
00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.450
content.

301
00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:03.630
Again all set equal say

302
00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:21.180
the content of the user entered and the headers you remember from and also equal to the users e-mail.

303
00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:25.560
That means that when this email pops up in your mailbox you'll be able to reply to it straight away

304
00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:29.590
to get back to the customer or user or whoever they are.

305
00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:31.270
And then

306
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:46.660
we'll try and send it say mail email to subject content heddes

307
00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:54.510
and if that works what we want to have a success message.

308
00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:56.450
So let's have

309
00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:08.340
success message is you could say it's going to be very similar to this except instead of a danger we're

310
00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:09.930
going to have a success.

311
00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.310
So it's nice and green.

312
00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:19.380
I must say something like your message was sent.

313
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:22.270
We'll get back to you.

314
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:23.820
Yes.

315
00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:33.040
And notice we've got a single quote in there so I'm going to put a backslash in to escape that.

316
00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:38.430
So it means it will just be displayed rather than think of it as the end of the string.

317
00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:47.110
And then what we can do is just display success message along with the error message

318
00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:53.170
because we're never going to get both once either it's going to be successful or it's not

319
00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:01.870
of course there's the option that it won't work.

320
00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:08.830
So in this case we'll have an error message.

321
00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:17.310
I'll just have something generic like your message couldn't be sent.

322
00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:20.240
Please try again later.

323
00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:27.320
And again a backslash then OK.

324
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.910
So let's have a look.

325
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:35.280
Well just refresh that's what we call an undefined variable again.

326
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:36.930
Yep.

327
00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:42.060
So we'll need to just make a success message

328
00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.820
an empty string there as well.

329
00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:50.350
OK.

330
00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:55.110
So let's put our generic information in and take a look.

331
00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.240
Wonderful message was sent.

332
00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.190
We'll get back to you ASAP.

333
00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:07.540
And just to check that's the area here would work.

334
00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:13.160
Let's resubmit that and.

335
00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:14.410
Excellent.

336
00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:20.690
So the message couldn't be sent info is being sent there as well.

337
00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:22.470
I think that's a little bit too dark.

338
00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:24.600
Let's get rid of the Strongs.

339
00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:29.160
Wonderful.

340
00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:31.590
So that's as far as we're going to go with this.

341
00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:34.180
There's a lot more that you could do with a contact phone.

342
00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:36.160
But this has got the basics up and running.

343
00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:41.110
And that brings us more or less to the end of the HP section of this course except of course for our

344
00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:45.920
big picture challenge where we're going to be making a weather web app.

345
00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:47.780
We'll see that in the next video.

346
00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:52.790
Actually before we finish I just want to show you one slight issue with the script in its current form.

347
00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:59.230
If you've tried it out you may notice that once we get everything right we actually have to press the

348
00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:01.510
submit button twice.

349
00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:06.660
So once there and then again to submit it that's obviously not a great solution.

350
00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:11.650
So I'm going to show you a different way of submitting and not submitting the form which doesn't have

351
00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:13.230
that problem.

352
00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:17.380
So first off let's get rid of our unbinding and then submitting.

353
00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:24.570
I'm also going to get rid of the prevent default and all we're going to do is we're going to have the

354
00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:31.350
code return false if there is an error and return false.

355
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:35.670
It's essentially the javascript way of saying in this case something's gone wrong.

356
00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:37.990
So we don't want to submit the form.

357
00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:45.550
In this case however we do want to submit the form so we'll return true and that does the same job as

358
00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:50.490
before but it doesn't have the problem of having to click twice.

359
00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:53.210
So just to check we still get the validation.

360
00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:59.890
But when we enter everything correctly it works fast quick.

361
00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:05.210
So I'd recommend doing things that way rather than using the unbinding and submit method.

362
00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:07.700
All right onto the weather scraper.
