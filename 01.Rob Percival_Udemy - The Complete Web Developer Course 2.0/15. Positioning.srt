1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,940
So carrying on our investigation of how we can position our elements ever we want them on the page we're

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,000
going to move away from floating and look at positioning.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,300
So floating has the advantage of being pretty flexible.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,820
It will float to the edge of the page however wide the user's screen is which can often be very useful.

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,890
Sometimes you need a bit more precision and you want to know exactly where your elements are and that's

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,140
where positioning comes in.

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,500
So first off I'm going to get rid of all our floating

8
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:37,050
so that we know where everything is to start with and so we don't need our clear float anymore.

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,900
And let's just check that that brings us back to where we were before.

10
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,350
Wonderful.

11
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:50,480
So maybe I want to take this green box and move it a little bit to the right when it quite after the

12
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,130
page for some reason I want to indent it a little bit.

13
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,890
So there are several ways to do that but we're going to do that now with positioning.

14
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,460
So I remember the first box is our first section here.

15
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,890
So first off we tell the Browns are we going to be positioning this Dave.

16
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:18,260
And we do that by setting the position to relative relative positioning means that we're going to be

17
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,400
positioning it relative to where it would otherwise be.

18
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,930
So at the moment if we just take a look at that that doesn't change anything at all because it is where

19
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:27,710
it was.

20
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,220
If you know what I mean.

21
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:36,410
But if we wanted to move it relative to where it currently is we would then add something like left

22
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:45,200
and then say 200 pixels and let's have a look and see what effect that has.

23
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,080
So that now moves it 200 pixels in the horizontal direction.

24
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:54,760
You might be slightly surprised that we've said left 200 and it's actually moved it to the right.

25
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:59,460
But you could think of it as having almost a 200 pixel margin on the left there.

26
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,040
And that's why we move to the right.

27
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:09,620
If we wanted to move it to the left we just do the same thing but with a negative number of pixels.

28
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,560
So let's try moving it to the left.

29
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,690
Fix 50 pixels and there you go.

30
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:20,070
You can see we've even moved it off the screen and we can move off the screen completely if we want

31
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,510
five hundred pixels you might wonder why we might want to do that.

32
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,330
It can actually be quite useful because we we might want to slide it in in some sort of fancy animation

33
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,310
later on which will see how to do in the Jay Querrey chapter.

34
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:41,350
But for now the main thing is we can move it left and right by having positive or negative numbers that

35
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:48,660
we can also move it up and down by adding a top property.

36
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,970
Again you can think of this a bit of a bit like having a margin at the top.

37
00:02:53,040 --> 00:03:02,960
So if we have a 100 pixel margin then that will mean that 100 pixels down and that we get.

38
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:03,910
So let's just

39
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,850
in fact we'll have a hundred pixels there.

40
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:16,050
So it's now 100 pixels to the right and 100 pixels down of where it would otherwise be.

41
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:22,470
So this is what this relative positioning is all about with positioning relative to where it was so

42
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,500
quick challenge for you.

43
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,160
Can you move the blue box.

44
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:32,190
So it's 100 pixels to the right and 100 pixels up of where it is now under pixels to the right 100 pixels

45
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:39,440
up it.

46
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:39,880
All right.

47
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,440
How do you manage that.

48
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:52,840
Well we needed to do was set the position to relative again and then 100 pixels right means left 100

49
00:03:52,840 --> 00:04:02,020
pixels and then for 100 pixels up we're going to use a top of minus one hundred pixels.

50
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:06,730
If we use 100 pixels there that would of course move it 100 pixels down.

51
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,250
Let's just check.

52
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,670
Wonderful.

53
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:16,690
It's now going 100 pixels right and 100 pixels up and we can use this relative positioning on any element

54
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,890
doesn't have to be a box.

55
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:22,340
It doesn't have to be a div we could do it on the paragraph or a table or an image or anything that

56
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,040
we wanted to be moved around in some way.

57
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,370
Great.

58
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,600
So I'm going to show you a different type of positioning in a moment but first I just want to move the

59
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:37,090
second section back and just show you how when you've got two elements overlapping like this you might

60
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:40,830
want to change which one appears in front of the other.

61
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,430
So by default the green box is in front of the blue one.

62
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:51,310
But if we wanted it to be the other way round we could change that with Zed index to that index works

63
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:57,190
in this way can set the Zed index of any element we like.

64
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,320
So whether it be a div or a paragraph or whatever.

65
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,540
And then the one with the highest Zed index will appear at the front.

66
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:15,040
So if I give this one that say a zed index of 1 and this one is an index of two.

67
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:21,130
The second one is the blue one should appear in front of the green one that won't quite work as it is

68
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:31,760
though because 0 said Index require a position of relative or there are a couple of other position types

69
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,260
that will work.

70
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,110
But we've only seen relative to so far.

71
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,140
So it will stick with that to work.

72
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:38,390
Let's have a look.

73
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,870
Now there we go.

74
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,760
So now the blue one is in front of the green one.

75
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:49,130
So Zed indexes are really handy if you won't have overlapping elements and you want to be very clear

76
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:53,570
as to which is going to be in the front and you can set the set index whatever you like so you could

77
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:58,310
have 100 different values if you had 100 different things overlapping each other which I probably wouldn't

78
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,590
recommend but you could do it if you wanted.

79
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:04,370
One other little cheeky thing I'm going to show you is really to do with positioning.

80
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,070
But while we're talking about layering it's quite nice.

81
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,960
You might want to have an element in the front which is a little bit C-3.

82
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,430
So you can actually see the element behind it and that's pretty easy to achieve.

83
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:19,030
So at the moment second section is in the front.

84
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:29,450
So if we set the opacity which is how opaque The object is a and opacity of one means that it will be

85
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:38,000
completely solid as it is now a curve and opacity of zero means that it will be completely invisible

86
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:48,040
and it's there but we can't see it and then opacity of say nought point five means that it will be there

87
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,400
but see through.

88
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:53,480
So you can choose whatever passes you like on a scale of zero to one.

89
00:06:53,570 --> 00:07:01,040
And the bigger the number the less see through it is so that can be really nice especially if you're

90
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,020
working with images of a sort of slightly faded image behind your text or something like that however

91
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,960
you wanted to do it all right.

92
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,620
So we've had a lot of fun with relative positioning.

93
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:15,430
I'm now going to show you a couple of other types of positioning which can be really useful as well.

94
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:25,520
So if we go back to our default with no positioning at all I'm going to start with a position of absolute.

95
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:32,010
So instead of relative we're now talking absolute and this is now quite different to how we were working

96
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:37,200
before with relative positioning and let's just see how that affects the page.

97
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,220
Ha.

98
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,780
The second section is now completely disappeared.

99
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:46,200
While it hasn't actually disappeared what's happened it's gone behind the first section.

100
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:51,630
So if we change the width of that one to 400 You can see it's actually still there as is the paragraph

101
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:57,960
underneath but they're behind it and that's because absolute positioning then takes the object that

102
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,950
you're positioning out of the flow of the page.

103
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:07,200
So basically all the other elements Dishan themselves as if this green box isn't there at all.

104
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:11,610
So that can be really useful if you want something to be on top of everything else and for everything

105
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:18,100
else to ignore that and here then the positioning is relative to the top left of the page.

106
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,580
So

107
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:29,250
we can do similar things that we did before we could move it 500 pixels to the right and we could move

108
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:37,140
it say 200 pixels down and that would move it around in exactly the same way as we had before.

109
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:43,790
But the main point of absolute positioning is it takes the element out of the flow of the page.

110
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:49,320
So if you want something to position itself over the top of everything else that's the way to do it.

111
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:50,870
All right.

112
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,140
So that's absolute positioning.

113
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,750
Take it back to them now.

114
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:02,210
So the last one I want to show you is a position of fixed.

115
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,780
Now how could this be different to the others you wonder.

116
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:09,400
Well let's find out if we have a look at how that looks.

117
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:14,320
By itself it's exactly the same as absolutes so fixed is out of the flow of the page.

118
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,540
Just like absolute and we can move it around.

119
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,850
Just like absolute.

120
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,810
So how is it different.

121
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:23,520
Absolute Well we can see this very clearly.

122
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:31,180
If for example I changed the height of my second section which is the blue div here and made it really

123
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:36,490
big say something like 5000 pixels.

124
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:44,950
And we've now got a really long page and watch what happens if I start to scroll down here we get the

125
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,880
green box stays in position.

126
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:55,090
So that's how fixed is different to absolute absolute will move when the page is scrolled fixed will

127
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,390
not.

128
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:01,630
So a typical example for a fixed position Dave might be if you want to have a menu at the top of your

129
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:05,970
page and you want that to appear even as the user scrolls down the page.

130
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,800
Then you might use a fixed position for that.

131
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,500
And there we go.

132
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,810
So there's several different types of positioning then.

133
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:18,910
I'll give you a quick summary member relative positioning means we can move the element relative to

134
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,370
where it would otherwise be in the page.

135
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:27,430
Absolute positioning takes the element out of the flow of the page and allows us to move it around relative

136
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:33,580
to the top left of the page and fixed positioning does the same thing but it keeps the element fixed

137
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,240
even when we scroll down the page.

138
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:45,820
And for all three of those types we can use left and top to move it left and right and up and down get

139
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,760
exactly where we wanted.

140
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,520
We also saw how to use opacity to change a see through an object is.

141
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:59,020
And Zed index to help make clear which object goes in front when you've got two overlapping ones.

142
00:10:59,190 --> 00:10:59,580
Great.

143
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,170
So lots of new information there.

144
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:06,450
As always do you have a play around and see what you can make happen with these different positions.

145
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,310
We're going to move on to something slightly different.

146
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,790
And that is margin's.
