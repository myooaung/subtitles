00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:06,900
Now that you have all the FRONT-END DEVELOPER skills for building web sites in HD and CSSA with javascript

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:13,950
NJ Querrey and also the backend developer skills coding server side scripts in HP and communicating

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:20,100
with databases via my Eskew Well all that really remains to add power and functionality to your apps

4
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:27,060
is to be able to connect to existing web services like Google Maps Facebook and Twitter and do something

5
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:34,350
cool with those services for your users and the web standard for doing that is an application programming

6
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,590
interface or API.

7
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,550
And it might sound a bit scary but it's actually pretty simple and I've got a nice easy diagram to get

8
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,240
the idea of how it works.

9
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,150
Essentially we've got your app or website running on your web server.

10
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:55,770
That makes a request to another provider's web server via an API which then returns some data to your

11
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,750
app for you to do something with it.

12
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,580
So for example if you knew the location of your user and you wanted to find some local businesses or

13
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:08,370
restaurants near to them you could send the location of the user to the Google Maps API.

14
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,220
And that would then return some local businesses in a format that you could then process and display

15
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,600
for your users.

16
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:22,260
So it's a really powerful easy and at the lower end for a way of getting access to the Web services

17
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,330
provided by the world's biggest companies.

18
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:26,940
So API are pretty cool.

19
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,380
And we're going to be looking at a few of them in this section to give you an idea about how they work

20
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,700
and how you can integrate them into your websites.

21
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:41,850
And we'll be starting using open weather maps to talk to rewrite out what the weather web app that we

22
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:47,690
made in the HP chapter in a much better and more efficient way and we'll do that in the next video.
