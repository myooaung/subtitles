00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:08.250
So in the two previous videos we saw the two basic ways to store information in javascript using variables

2
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.370
and arrays in the next few videos.

3
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.720
We're going to see how we can use javascript to affect the logic of the application i.e. what it does.

4
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.950
The code that we've written so far is going to do the same thing every time.

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.230
What if we want our code to do different things depending on different situations.

6
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.190
Well for that we use an IF statement.

7
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.240
So let's get rid of the code we've got so far.

8
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.630
And can you set up a variable for me called X with a value of 1 different

9
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:50.360
IP manage that var to create a variable x to name the variable and then equals one to give it that value.

10
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.370
So what we're going to do with this is create an if statement which depends on the value of x.

11
00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:58.880
And this looks like this.

12
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:06.380
So we start with if and then in parentheses we put our condition that we want to be true.

13
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.340
And I'm going to test for whether or not x is equal to 1.

14
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.350
That might seem a bit crazy when I know that x is equal to 1 but just stay with me for the moment.

15
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:23.770
Now we test whether x is equal to 1 using x and then double equals 1.

16
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.200
Now that can be quite confusing for new programmers but it actually makes a lot of sense when you see

17
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.090
a single equals in a program.

18
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.890
It means that you're setting the value of something to something else.

19
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:42.230
When you see a double equals means we're testing whether or not those two things are the same.

20
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.630
So it's a logical difference and therefore there's a different symbol.

21
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.750
So it's two equal signs but it is a very common beginner mistake to just put one equal sign there and

22
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:59.170
then what you'll find is this will set X's equal to 1 and say that the statement is true which is very

23
00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.120
rarely what you want to happen.

24
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:09.070
So always put two equal signs in in an if statement and then just like with functions that we saw a

25
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:18.700
few videos ago we have curly brackets to contain whatever code we want to happen if X is one.

26
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.270
So we might for example just alert X is 1.

27
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.030
Hurrah.

28
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.010
So let's just check see what happens x is indeed one.

29
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:44.420
What would happen then in this program if I changed x to be to what would happen when I run it.

30
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.960
Have you got the answer which is absolutely nothing because X is not one anymore.

31
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:58.790
So it's not going to alert that we can actually have an else statement at the end of our IF statement

32
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.160
which will do something.

33
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.000
If this is not true.

34
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.940
So if x is 1 then we're going to let that.

35
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.710
If it's not we'll alert X is not one.

36
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:13.580
Simple as that.

37
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.640
So now when we run it we get X is not one.

38
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.590
And of course if we change it back to 1 we'll get X's equal to 1.

39
00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.690
So this is obviously a very simplistic example and may seem a little bit inane.

40
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.770
So let's try and link it with something that we might have in a real web page.

41
00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.830
So something that almost every web app needs to do at some point is to log you in.

42
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.870
And obviously if statements are absolutely crucial to that so you can expect the user to enter a username

43
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.490
and password and then you're going to use an IF statement to see if the user name is correct and the

44
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:47.560
password is correct.

45
00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.950
Then load the user in if not give them some sort of error message.

46
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:58.010
So are we going to create a very minimal in system and I'm actually going to get to see this as a challenge

47
00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.870
rather than have a user name and a password.

48
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.270
We're going to have a magic word.

49
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.530
Now you can set that magic word to be whatever you like but what I want is for our page to say what

50
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.750
is the magic word and then have a text input for the user to enter it and a button when they're done

51
00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.920
and then an alert to tell them whether or not they've got it right.

52
00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.070
Simple as that.

53
00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.810
Go for it.

54
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.140
All right.

55
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.680
Hope you managed it.

56
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:34.580
So let's have a paragraph tag saying what is the magic word.

57
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:46.650
And then on the next line we'll have an input with a type of text and an ID of

58
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.170
a magic word.

59
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.530
And then on the final line we'll have our button

60
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.770
with an ID of check.

61
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.950
Magic word.

62
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.010
That's what we're going to do when the button is pressed.

63
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:22.830
And we'll have to on our button we go up and we still get our code running say X is still one.

64
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.950
Excellent.

65
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.460
That looks good.

66
00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.580
So now we've written the content of our page.

67
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.030
Let's write the logic.

68
00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.640
So we only want logic to happen when the button is pressed.

69
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:41.320
So we know how to do that now hopefully document does get element by ID.

70
00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:53.820
The idea of the button is check the magic word and we want to set on click to be equal to a function

71
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.490
that we are going to make and then we put that function in brackets.

72
00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:06.030
So first off as always I'm just going to let something just to make sure that everything is connected

73
00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:06.810
up right.

74
00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.870
That we get.

75
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.800
So definitely recommend always writing your javascript.

76
00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.630
Step by step like this not doing it all in one go.

77
00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:21.780
So now what we're going to need to do is get the value of whatever the user has typed so we can check

78
00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.580
it against our magic word.

79
00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.240
So let's create a variable for that.

80
00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.900
And I'm going to call it magic word and

81
00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:39.490
and I'm going to set that equal to the value of this text input.

82
00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.840
So remember the text input as an ID of magic word.

83
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.110
So we'll use document don't get element by id

84
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:56.660
magic word and we want to get the value of that to as we did in the previous video datt value to get

85
00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.070
the value of that.

86
00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:04.670
And once again because I like things happening really step by step I'm just going to alert the value

87
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:09.440
of that to make sure that everything once again is wired up correctly.

88
00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:16.220
So let's just put in I SDF SDF brilliant step by step is much less likely to go wrong.

89
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.410
Much easier to fix it if you do go wrong.

90
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:20.830
All right.

91
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:27.890
The second variable I'm going to create is the actual magic word because I want to keep this not kind

92
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:29.540
of embedded deeply in my code.

93
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:38.210
I might want to change it at some point so I'm going to have abra cadabra as my magic word for obvious

94
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:39.160
reasons.

95
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:47.290
And now what we want to do is set up how if statement and it's pretty straightforward hopefully.

96
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:50.820
So if and then parentheses.

97
00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:57.940
If a magic word entered is equal to and remember we need the double equals because with checking whether

98
00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:59.280
or not is equal to.

99
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:04.530
Rather than setting it equal to if that's equal to magic word

100
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:13.280
we'll just alert something like You got it.

101
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:19.180
And then obviously if this was a real kind of Web page we did add some logic for either logging the

102
00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:24.460
user in or doing whatever it is that this page is supposed to do when the user get gets the magic word

103
00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.260
correct.

104
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:33.650
And if it's not we'll alert no try again.

105
00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:37.190
There we go.

106
00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:38.560
So that should do it.

107
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.360
Let's find out.

108
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:42.130
Let's get it right.

109
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:47.940
First of Bora Bora and you got it.

110
00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:49.190
Fantastic.

111
00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:53.910
And then if we end to anything else.

112
00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:57.760
Nope try again.

113
00:08:57.950 --> 00:08:58.260
Brilliant.

114
00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.600
So I hope you manage to do that more or less by yourself.

115
00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:04.960
Hopefully this gives you a clear idea of why if statements are so important.

116
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.720
Essentially they allow us to do something on a certain condition happening and that's absolutely central

117
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.140
to the idea of programming.

118
00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:19.160
And in fact now that we know about if statements were capable of building some basic javascript games

119
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:25.070
and we're going to do that in the next video where we'll make a simple game called how many fingers.
