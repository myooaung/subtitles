00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.750
files which enable you to create great looking Responsive Web sites responsive meaning they look completely

5
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.540
different depending on the size of the user screen that's really important for web developers at the

6
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.600
moment because the use of mobile is increasing very rapidly.

7
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.430
But desktop certainly isn't going away anytime soon.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.770
But really the features are make a lot more sense as we work through them in this chapter.

11
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.610
There's a huge number of Web sites that are built with bootstrap over seven million of them in fact.

12
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:05.190
And if you go to Expo you get bootstrap to come then you'll see a few of the hand-picked examples and

13
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.850
I'll just show you some of them really quickly.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:08.730

23
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.110
of CSSA and Javascript components that you can use to make websites your users will love.
