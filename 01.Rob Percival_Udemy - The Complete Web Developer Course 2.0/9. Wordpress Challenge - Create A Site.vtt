I think you can probably guess what the challenge for this section is going to be.

2
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:10.250
I've shown you how to set up a simple site with the X theme and also with the free Zera theme.

3
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:18.220
And then we've seen how to customize that and then add a blog and a portfolio and even an online shop.

4
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.740
So my challenge for you is to create customize a real site of your own.

5
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.220
Now this could be a site for you.

6
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.580
Perhaps a blog about something that you're interested in perhaps a portfolio of your artwork or music

7
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.650
or a site to sell a digital product that you've made.

8
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.490
Or if there's really nothing that comes to mind that you'd like to share with the world ask around.

9
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.080
Help a friend create a web website or help someone you know build a web site for their business or charity

10
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.610
or local organization.

11
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.370
It's not about getting paid for it at this point.

12
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.930
It's about learning the ropes adding to your portfolio.

13
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.490
There's nothing like the pressure of having to create something the world will see.

14
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.210
To learn how to do things well.

15
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.190
And as always when you're done send me a tweet about it and I'll pass on the word.

16
00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.240
Good luck.
