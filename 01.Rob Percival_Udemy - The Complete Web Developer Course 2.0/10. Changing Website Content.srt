1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,190
All right we're now going to take our javascript's to the next level by seeing how we can not only just

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:13,260
change the content of an element but we can also append content to it which means take whatever's there

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:20,510
and then add some extra text to it and we can make a whole element appear out of nothing.

4
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,020
So let's get cracking.

5
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,060
Let's add a second paragraph and I'm going to put in the words.

6
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,970
Javascript is.

7
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,190
And then dot dot dot

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,100
and we'll give this an ID of a second.

9
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:47,760
Paragraph and here's a little challenge can you add some code.

10
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:54,970
And a second button so that when that second button is clicked the content of this paragraph changes

11
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:55,550
too.

12
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,010
Hello Rob.

13
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,830
So exactly like the first button behaves.

14
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:05,740
So add a new button so that when you press that button content of this paragraph changes to hello.

15
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,610
Well go for it.

16
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:14,900
I managed it.

17
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,130
It's just a bit of code copy and paste really is all we need.

18
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,680
So let's copy the button code

19
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:24,950
I'm going to change

20
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:35,270
change text to append text so append means adding something to the end of it and we'll call this second

21
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:35,750
button.

22
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:38,640
And it's just have a look.

23
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,140
OK.

24
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:39,410
Yes.

25
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,280
That all looks fine.

26
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,340
Obviously a pen text at the moment doesn't do anything.

27
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:50,230
So we need to set up some javascript to connect that to some code.

28
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,330
So again I'm going to copy and paste

29
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:01,080
and all we need to do is change the necessary bits so that it does what we want.

30
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:07,190
So we want it so that when the second button is clicked it updates the content of second paragraph too.

31
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,490
Hello Rob.

32
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,090
So a second button of course has the ID of a second button.

33
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:20,580
So we want to make this function happen when second button is clicked.

34
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:27,950
I would do that using Document or get element by id second button on click equals and then function.

35
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,420
So a very quick question.

36
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:35,530
What would happen if I ran this code now and then click the second button.

37
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,240
What will happen.

38
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,720
You got it right.

39
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:42,260
It should update hello world too.

40
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,360
Hello Rob.

41
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,700
Every It does because it's just doing the same thing as what the first button did.

42
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:53,890
Updating the elements with ID text which is this one too.

43
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,530
Hello Rob.

44
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:06,270
So we wanted to make it so that it updated javascript is and the ID for that paragraph is second paragraph

45
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,030
and that's it.

46
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,110
So that's going to update second paragraph too.

47
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:13,680
Hello Rob.

48
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,010
With any luck.

49
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,030
Fantastic.

50
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:16,930
OK.

51
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,480
So that was the mini challenge and how I expected you to do it.

52
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:27,400
Let's see how we achieve what we originally wanted which was how to append some content to this.

53
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:36,030
So first off the content that I want to append is going to be awesome.

54
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:42,770
So we end up with javascript is awesome the way I'm going to do it and it's going to take quite a long

55
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:43,300
line of text.

56
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:50,270
I'm just going to extend this out so we can do it all in one line is by copying and pasting all of this

57
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:58,940
and then popping it in there and adding a plus symbol.

58
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:04,020
And before I explain how that works just take a moment to have a look at that and see if you can work

59
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:10,160
out why that will append awesome to the content of second paragraph.

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,210
I hope you got it.

61
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:20,350
What we're essentially doing here is we're taking the HD M-L of second paragraph which is javascript

62
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:27,400
is dot dot dot and then we're setting that equal to the end of second paragraph which is javascript

63
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:34,590
is and then we're adding that to awesome or we're adding awesome to that.

64
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,730
So we're setting the enraged him out of the second paragraph to whatever it is.

65
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,150
Plus the word awesome.

66
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:48,130
So we're essentially adding the word awesome to the end or in programming terms were appending the word

67
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,250
awesome to whatever the content was before.

68
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,700
So let's take a look see if that does what we want.

69
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:03,170
So I refresh a pen text pen text and there we go.

70
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:12,650
Javascript is awesome so another teeny challenge then could you append something else to this line and

71
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:18,410
make it so that it becomes I think javascript is awesome.

72
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:25,130
Go for it.

73
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:25,660
All right.

74
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,010
I hope you manage that.

75
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:35,350
All we need to do is before we get the contents of the second paragraph we're going to add I think in

76
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,330
double quotes with a space at the end.

77
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:41,800
Otherwise it's going to be all one word and then plus again.

78
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,660
And this means I think.

79
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:49,750
And then whatever the content is and then the word awesome.

80
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,370
So let's have a look

81
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:55,810
javascript is.

82
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,430
And I think javascript is awesome.

83
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:02,180
I agree.

84
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,080
All right.

85
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:08,930
So finally then how could we make some content appear out of thin air out of nowhere.

86
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,350
I'm actually going to set this as a challenge.

87
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,760
See if you can figure it out.

88
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,040
So how can we have no content here just a button.

89
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:21,650
And then when you click that button you get some text whatever you want that to be go for it.

90
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,880
Did you manage it.

91
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,650
OK.

92
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,510
It was a pretty tough challenge but well done if you got there.

93
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:44,350
Well I'm going to do it is have a paragraph with an ID of empty paragraph and then that is of course

94
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,230
just an empty paragraph.

95
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,570
It's just blank.

96
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,790
Nothing will display on the screen.

97
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,570
And then I'm going to have a button with an ID of create

98
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,810
paragraph

99
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,940
and then I'll have the words create text on it.

100
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:15,100
And rather than copying and pasting this time I'll create the code from scratch just gives us an opportunity

101
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,550
to see it and talk it through once again.

102
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:24,140
So we want something to happen when the person with ID create a paragraph is clicked.

103
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:30,820
So that means we need to get that button first off and we do that using document to say that we want

104
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:37,990
something within this document and then we say we want to get the element by its ID then in brackets

105
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,890
and quites we give the ID.

106
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:57,560
So that create paragraph and then we set on click to be a function and then we have curly brackets in

107
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,020
which we're going to put the code for our function.

108
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:04,770
So that means whatever I write in here will happen when that button is clicked.

109
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:12,670
And then all we need to do is make it so that we select the paragraph with ID empty paragraph and put

110
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,170
some content in it.

111
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:20,650
So it's exactly the same as what we had up here when we changed the content just in this case we're

112
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:25,290
changing it from blank to some text.

113
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:31,430
So let's say that an action document or get element by ID.

114
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:44,730
And the idea this time is empty paragraph and then we want to set in each L to say hi there.

115
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,210
And that's it.

116
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,060
Let's take a look.

117
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:53,870
So refresh that said create text.

118
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,670
Nothing's happening.

119
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,780
Let's have a look.

120
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,010
Find out what's going wrong.

121
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,600
It must be an error in my code somewhere.

122
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:06,270
Maybe you can see what it is but let's have a look at the console document or get an ID.

123
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,650
Each is not a function.

124
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,210
Aha of course a line 42 this line here.

125
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:21,050
What I've done of course as you probably noticed was I tried to pass the string high there to enrich

126
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:29,870
DML and as it says enriched him is not a function it's a value it's the content of empty paragraph.

127
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:34,350
So what I should have done is set it equal to and then.

128
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,960
Hi there.

129
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,610
All right no worries.

130
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,150
Good use of the console.

131
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:43,930
Let's have another look.

132
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,150
Create text now.

133
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,380
And there it is.

134
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,580
Brilliant.

135
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:53,000
So we've created something from nothing there which is particularly useful if you've got an error message

136
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:56,330
or something you want to display to the user.

137
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:00,530
Once they've done something a very quick thing to say is that this can be any age.

138
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:05,690
Tim L we've only used tech so far but you can bet HCM L right in here.

139
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,060
As well.

140
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,920
So let's have a look now.

141
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:17,900
We've created a heading so you can put lipstick and performs in there you can put whole chunks of text

142
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,550
if you want to any HD M-L will do.

143
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:22,430
All right.

144
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:23,980
I hope you enjoy those challenges.

145
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:28,520
We're going to have an even bigger challenge in the next video where we're going to create the first

146
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,620
part of our reaction game that will make at the end of this section.

147
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,740
And this first part is called disappearing circles.
