1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:01,140
All right.

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:06,180
So we've seen how we can use bootstrap to customize our forms and tables to make them look beautiful

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,270
and make them a lot more fun to use.

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,300
We're now going to whiz through a few of the components that bootstrap provides.

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,550
You'll want to use in your web sites because they look great and add a lot of functionality as well.

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:24,620
So back on the bootstrap Web site click on components and then we've already got two buttons.

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,760
We know how they work.

8
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:35,250
So I'm going to move on to the excellently named Jumbotron which is essentially a big rectangle that

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:40,960
is designed to go at the top of the home page of your site and be a real attention grabbing thing.

10
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,920
So you've probably seen this before.

11
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:51,810
If you go to almost any big news startup web site such as you but up come you'll see that very commonly

12
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:57,350
use some kind of big image bit of text and then a big call to action.

13
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,520
So the idea of that really is that it funnels the user where they want them to go.

14
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,220
So what is it you but want you to do when you go to their Web site.

15
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,330
They want you to sign up.

16
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,330
That's the big thing.

17
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,910
So there's a nice big image there.

18
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,030
Simple bit of text.

19
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,100
And then the call to action.

20
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,740
And that's what the JumboTron is for.

21
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,810
So let's again copy the code and take a look at it.

22
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,980
On our own page I'm going to get rid of the container for the moment because JumboTron is one of those

23
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:35,120
things you probably want to stretch right to the edge of the screen and there it is.

24
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,520
So we've got no background image there but that's pretty easy to add.

25
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:44,790
But what we do have is a readymade element to catch the user's attention and get them to do something

26
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:45,650
with the button.

27
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,420
The code is pretty simple.

28
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:58,010
All we've got is a div with a class of Jumbotron just indent it nicely.

29
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:02,950
We've got a custom class for the one which we don't really need.

30
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:11,940
It just makes it a bigger thinner text as you can see them so we can leave that in if you like.

31
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,250
And then we've got a little bit of text paragraph with a class of lead So it's a bigger more spaced

32
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:22,260
out text than usual and we've got a horizontal rule and normal paragraph.

33
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,690
And then our call to action button.

34
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,890
So nice and simple but very useful.

35
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,790
Just the same.

36
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:35,080
We've known from the Jumbotron like she alerts which I've used in a number of sites.

37
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:40,680
There are a great way of getting simple messages displayed to the user.

38
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,570
And they look like this.

39
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:47,850
So essentially if the users just filled in a form to send you an e-mail or something like that you might

40
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:53,550
want to have this green one to show them a success or a warning they didn't fill out one of the boxes

41
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:58,840
for example or read in your message if something actually went wrong.

42
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:09,520
So let's copy the warning one over and you can see that this is pretty straightforward.

43
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,160
We've got our Dave with a class of alert and an alert warning to clarify that this is going to be the

44
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,480
red one.

45
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,560
We've got a semantic role is equal to alert.

46
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:24,330
Again if we remove that it wouldn't make any difference but it makes each day mail clearer.

47
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:29,950
And then we've just got some content which could be anything we like is in there.

48
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,450
So there we go.

49
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,170
There's a warning.

50
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:42,510
We've also got a special alert link color which just makes the link if there is going to be one in your

51
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,900
alert fit in better the background and text color.

52
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,610
And I really like this feature.

53
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:59,730
You can just add an alert dismissable class to your alert and you just need to add a button which again

54
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,710
will copy the code for and then see what's going on.

55
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:09,920
And you add that inside your alert and then you've got a button here with a type of button.

56
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:16,150
A class is equal to close which means that it will have some javascript attached to it so it will close

57
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,410
the alert that it's in when it's clicked.

58
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,580
The thing that is going to dismiss the data dismiss is the alert.

59
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,230
And then you've got this thing called an aria label.

60
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:31,330
Now a RIAA stands for accessible rich Internet applications which is another one of these things that

61
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:34,060
makes your Web site easier to use.

62
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,950
For those with disabilities which is yet another reason for using bootstrap because these things are

63
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:39,610
built in.

64
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,590
So if a user was using a screen reader for example or had accessibility options switched on in their

65
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:48,060
browser they may see a message called close there.

66
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:57,280
And then we've got our present times semi-colon which is our way of getting that X symbol and an area

67
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:03,250
hidden is equal to true means that the X won't be displayed if the user is on a screen reader because

68
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,370
they will see clothes instead.

69
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,340
OK so let's just see that in action.

70
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:08,660
There we go.

71
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:12,510
So you can see the X now and if I click that it disappears.

72
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,900
Wonderful alerts which are really useful.

73
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:21,910
You can also work with the javascript if you want to make them do something fancy but we're not going

74
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,600
to look at that right now.

75
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,390
OK.

76
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,490
So there are two more components that I want to show you in this video.

77
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:36,910
And the first is the progress component which is a really handy way of showing the user's progress in

78
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,020
something.

79
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,460
So it's pretty straightforward.

80
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:49,990
We use the progress HDMI 5 Element give it a class give it a value a maximum and then some text if you

81
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:54,520
want that will display.

82
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,750
So let's have a look.

83
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,870
So let's just change the value to say 35 percent.

84
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:06,120
We might as well change this one as well.

85
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,130
And we're going to go to a very simple progress bar which you can update using javascript if you want

86
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,870
but it might just be a static way of showing how far before through your sign up process for example

87
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,680
something like that.

88
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,740
And we can add nice colors.

89
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,180
So let's do that let's give our

90
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:30,120
progress a class of progress success.

91
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,970
And why not give it a Strypes effect as well.

92
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:43,780
Which of course we are using progress striped OK let's take a look.

93
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,590
There we go.

94
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,470
Very nice.

95
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:57,570
The last one then is a new component for bootstrap 4 which is very flexible and has replaced a number

96
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:58,410
of other components.

97
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,440
And that is the card.

98
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,590
So it will be pretty clear what it is when you see it.

99
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,030
Something like this.

100
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,920
So it's kind of an image and then a title and then some information and the call to action.

101
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:17,850
So let's have a little look to see how that looks in our site.

102
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,890
It's just indent everything nicely.

103
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:27,860
There we go.

104
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:33,450
So we've got I thought with one there of course we don't actually have an image so let's pop in a quick

105
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:40,140
image from Wikipedia just so we've got something to work with.

106
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:49,700
We've had Homer and Marge say let's have one of Simpson.

107
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,580
So I will click on him

108
00:07:54,650 --> 00:08:03,590
and then I'm just going to control click and copy image address and then paste that straight into the

109
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:15,660
SIRC for our image and then we just want a standard SIRC as we're used to here source so ill only use

110
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,640
data as I see if you're doing something quite fancy with images.

111
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,110
We're just loading one up.

112
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:24,480
So it's just SIRC that we use.

113
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:25,440
OK.

114
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,220
So that looks pretty good but it's obviously stretched out right to the edge of the screen.

115
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,910
Often what you're going to want to use this for is if for example you want to show three features of

116
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:40,160
your brilliant app then you might want to have an image and then some information about that feature

117
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,510
and then a call to action to do with that feature.

118
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,490
And that's what these are generally designed for.

119
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:52,340
So let's have a quick look see how we do that as obviously some other content types that we can add

120
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,130
to them.

121
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:58,070
You can play around with those if you like but I'm going to focus on layout here.

122
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,860
So to change the layout we need to do is add some columns as we've seen before.

123
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,690
So we just add a class of row and then a class of call.

124
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:13,050
And then however many many columns we want the width of that object to be.

125
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,180
So here's a challenge for you.

126
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:21,530
Can you make it so that there are four cards each with the same content going from left to right on

127
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:22,380
the screen.

128
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,490
Go for it.

129
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:32,530
OK.

130
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,930
I hope you manage that.

131
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:44,710
All you needed was a div with a class of rho to contain all of our lives.

132
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:57,100
And then we can contain each of the cards in a div with a class of call for column S-M because we want

133
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,890
to stack when it gets onto a phone screen.

134
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,900
And then we want four of them 12 divided by four is three.

135
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:13,020
So they're going to be three columns each.

136
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,790
And you can see that there's an extra class of card block here as well which provides some nice styles

137
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:27,040
it will work without it but it just had some nice spacing for the cards as they go from left to right.

138
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:35,080
Can I just get indenting all nice.

139
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:47,540
So that's one two three four and then have a look.

140
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,560
Wonderful.

141
00:10:49,140 --> 00:11:02,480
So are four cards going along and they will remain as they are until we hit the phone screen size and

142
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,170
then they will stack.

143
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:09,980
So as always cards I've got a bunch of different options which you might want to check out if you're

144
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:17,900
going to be using them in your site various layouts headers footers etc. but that's as far as we're

145
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:23,390
going to go in this video in the next video we're going to look at bootstrap modals which is a more

146
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:28,700
interactive feature of bootstrap and we'll use that as an opportunity to see how we can interact with

147
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,640
the javascript bootstrap as well.

148
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:32,490
See that.
