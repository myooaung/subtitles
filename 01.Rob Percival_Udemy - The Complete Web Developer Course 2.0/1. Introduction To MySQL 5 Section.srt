00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:06,870
Congratulations on making it to Section 9 of the complete web developer of course I hope you enjoyed

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,280
working with HP.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,080
I managed to get the weather scraper projects a good guy at the end of the previous section.

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:20,730
Now BHP is a very powerful language but it's limited in what it can do without connecting it to a database.

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,250
And that's what we're going to be doing in this section.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,340
So we'll be learning the Maya skew wealth database language and seeing how it integrates with THP.

7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:35,040
My school is extremely widely used and a very standard database language so it's a great first one to

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,640
learn it will allow you to store things like your users usernames and passwords as well as actual content

9
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,370
for your website.

10
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,820
So there's a lot to learn here.

11
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:49,980
But once you've got to the end of the section a combination of PH P and my s u l on the server side

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:58,140
and HCM L C Ss and javascript on the client side will actually allow you to build any web site in existence.

13
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,240
So you really should be looking at Web sites that you can build for friends and family or be looking

14
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,550
for work that you can get on freelance Web sites if you want to go that way.

15
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,350
As always I'm really keen to see what you're making.

16
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:16,050
So please do tweet me a link to whatever you've built and I'll send it on to the world.

17
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:20,120
Enjoy learning about my school and I'll see you at the beginning of Section 10.
