00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.550
In this video I'm going to show you how to download and install the two bits of free software that you

2
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.330
need for this cause on a Mac.

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.790
If you're not working on a Mac then just jump straight on to the next video.

4
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.770
Now as I've mentioned before we're going to be using Chrome as our browser for this course if you use

5
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.870
a different browser such as Firefox Internet Explorer or Safari then you're welcome to carry on with

6
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:22.480
that browser.

7
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.330
But I'd recommend switching to Chrome because then you'll see exactly the same as what I'm showing you

8
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.240
here on the videos.

9
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:37.230
So to get chrome just type download chrome into Google and click on the top result and you'll get to

10
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.610
this page.

11
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:46.560
Click on the blue download chrome button and then accept and install that will then download the file

12
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.330
to install Chrome and then you just click on that and go through the process.

13
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.130
I can't do that for you because I've already got chrome installed but it's pretty straightforward.

14
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.110
All right so now you've got chrome up and running.

15
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:04.290
We're going to install our second bit of software which is called brackets and this is our text editor

16
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.450
that we're going to be using very much to edit text so you can see what it looks like there.

17
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.460
We've got some very nicely indented and colored code there and we can be writing code that looks just

18
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.170
like that.

19
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.430
As with crime there are a number of different text that is out there.

20
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.860
And if you use a different one and you like that one then just stick with it.

21
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.210
But if you've never used it before then use brackets.

22
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.630
It's a very good one and it's what I'll be using in the course so to download it just go to bracket's

23
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.780
dot I-O in your browser and I would click the download brackets without extract button.

24
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.030
You probably don't want to extract have a little scroll down and see what extract does.

25
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.980
If you want see it's free but we won't be using it in this call so to keep things simple I'd go for

26
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:55.040
the without extract option and then as before when it's completed the download which is going to click

27
00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.410
on that and run through the install process it doesn't take very long.

28
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.130
So we're just verifying the DMG file which is going to install the app for us.

29
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.720
And then when it's done you should get the option to drag brackets into your applications which will

30
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.230
then complete the install process.

31
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.490
It doesn't take very long.

32
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.060
All right.

33
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.910
Now that's completed.

34
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.710
I'm going to use command space to open up spotlight and just start typing brackets and it should pop

35
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:28.540
up.

36
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.990
There it is.

37
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.940
So there's brackets.

38
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.690
And here it is.

39
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.530
So this is our text that is that we're going to be working with.

40
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:45.890
And here's a sample file that it starts off with and a note about usage statistics which I personally

41
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:46.910
think is fine.

42
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.670
And here we've just got a sample HGL file which we can ignore for now.

43
00:02:51.920 --> 00:03:00.260
And one change I'm going to make before we start writing some HDMI out is to get rid of this sidebar

44
00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.120
on the left so I'm going to do that using Heit sidebar and that just gives me a bit more room to work

45
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.700
with you can do the same if you like.

46
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.630
If you want to look exactly the same as me I'd recommend that.

47
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.390
But there we go you have chrome and brackets which are the only two bits of software that you need for

48
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.090
this course.

49
00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.930
And we'll start from an empty page on brackets in the next lecture.

50
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.250
So you.
