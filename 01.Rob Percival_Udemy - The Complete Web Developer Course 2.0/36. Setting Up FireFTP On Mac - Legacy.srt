1
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:10,330
So in this video we're going to see how to set up FTB on a Mac and we're going to be using the same

2
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,090
software as in Windows.

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,850
So that is Firefox and Faia FTB.

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:26,260
So first off in Chrome if you haven't already got it then Google download Firefox and just click on

5
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:33,700
the top result there and click the big free download button and I'm just going to download it here to

6
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,890
my desktop.

7
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,270
It shouldn't take too long.

8
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,980
But while we're waiting I'll just tell you that if you haven't used it before Firefox is an alternative

9
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:42,710
browser.

10
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,080
It's quite highly used so it's worth having on your system to be able to check to make sure your web

11
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,790
sites look good in Firefox as well as chrome.

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,090
But one of the best things about it is it has a huge add on and a plugin ecosystem and one of my favorite

13
00:00:55,180 --> 00:01:00,950
plugins is fire FTB which allows you to connect to your web sites using FDCPA.

14
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,850
So that's now downloaded.

15
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:12,070
So click on the DMD file that's downloaded and that will open up the Firefox installer and you'll be

16
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:16,990
able to go through the installation process and then you'll get something like this and you just need

17
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:21,270
to drag Firefox over into your applications.

18
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:27,590
Now I'm not actually going to do that because I already have Firefox installed but it's a very straightforward

19
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,370
process from there.

20
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:29,390
Just click next.

21
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:35,150
And then when it finishes installing I open up Firefox and you'll be presented with something like this.

22
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:41,000
So it looks like many other browsers that we've seen before and it obviously works in the same way but

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,400
we're going to jump straight to downloading fire FTB.

24
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:50,020
So I would give that a quick google and then click on the top result.

25
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,130
I don't stalk muzzleloader at all.

26
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:57,100
And then click on the green add to Firefox button.

27
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:01,490
Now once again I've already got five T.P. installed on my system so I can't go through the installation

28
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,140
process.

29
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,630
But again it's just a matter of clicking next.

30
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,060
You may have to restart Firefox to finish the installation.

31
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:08,490
All right.

32
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:09,430
We're almost there.

33
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,780
So now that you've installed fire FTB we can add it to our menu bar up here.

34
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:24,280
So you need to control click on the toolbar area not on any one of the actual icons and then click customize.

35
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:29,340
And this gives you the option to customize the icons that appear up here.

36
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:38,510
And I'm going to take five pay and drag it up to the top that then click exit customize at the bottom

37
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:43,830
and you should be back in Firefox but with the five T.P. icons showing.

38
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,600
So now we're going to click on fire FTB and you should see something like this.

39
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,650
So on the left here we've got a directory on your computer.

40
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:57,920
For me it's my desktop and on the right is where we'll see the files on our server when we connect to

41
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,530
it.

42
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,730
So how do we connect.

43
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,920
Well you've got create an account selected in the dropdown menu then.

44
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:11,060
So just click connect and you should see the account manager pop up and this is where we put the details

45
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:21,550
of our FGP connection in and we can get those from our control panel so on the right underneath unlock

46
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:28,270
pay go down and look at the T-P details.

47
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,540
So the user name is just the domain name.

48
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,960
So in my case we're Percival's test hosting package dot com.

49
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:45,910
So back over half of that as the log in the password you click on the link there and then select the

50
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,450
password.

51
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:53,710
Paste that in and the host is FDCPA dot stack C.P. dot com.

52
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,610
We'll type that in there.

53
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:02,440
And I would actually put the domain name in as the account name as well so that you can refer to it

54
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,470
later on.

55
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,080
And that's it.

56
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,950
So then click OK.

57
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:13,160
There is one more thing we need to do before we can connect and that is unlock FCPA.

58
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:19,810
Now eco web hosting have a security feature that FCP is locked automatically after a certain time to

59
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,660
prevent anyone else getting access to your files.

60
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:28,900
So we either have to unlock FTB by time and obviously the longer you choose here the more risky it is

61
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,860
in terms of someone else getting hold of your FTB log in details and being able to access your files.

62
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:40,930
Or we can unlock by IP address which you can use if you know you have a fixed IP address on your computer.

63
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,560
You can check with your internet provider whether that's the case.

64
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:48,940
But for now I'm just going to unlock for one hour there we go.

65
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:55,220
And now we go back over to fire and click connect.

66
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,240
And here we go.

67
00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:00,730
So now you can see the files that we saw in the file manager in the previous video.

68
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:08,150
And if we look at public page DML we can see we've got our index file in there.

69
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:14,570
Now one thing you may have noticed about our Hello World page is that the image didn't display.

70
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:21,350
Now that's because we didn't upload the image file to our web hosting so let's do that now using FGP

71
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:31,170
so I'm going to go into the complete web develop a course folder and then number one HVM L and there's

72
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:39,320
my earth dot J pedofile so I'm going to click the right way to upload it and then it's now on the server.

73
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,080
So if I go back over and refresh the page using command.

74
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:49,420
I can now with any luck see the image there it is.

75
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:55,110
So we're almost done but there's one more thing I'd like to show you and that's the real reason that

76
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:59,770
I recommend using fire FTB over the other available FGP clients out there.

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,570
So the FTC allows you to edit files directly on the server which means you can click Save in your text

78
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:13,310
that is and it will save directly on the server which makes creating an editing websites much easier.

79
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:18,870
There is a very small risk involved with that that if you have a flaky connection occasionally Icesave

80
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,700
won't be registered and you'll actually lose the content of the page.

81
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:26,880
But that's only happened to me very rarely and I find it doesn't outweigh the convenience of being able

82
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,960
to add it this way.

83
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,610
Having said that you should always have a backup of your website files so that if you do lose something

84
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,040
you can just upload without losing all your work.

85
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,920
So how do we open a file.

86
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:40,210
Now text that is from fire FTB.

87
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,560
Well it's very easy.

88
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:46,510
But before we do so we have to make sure that the file extension.

89
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,850
So in this case dark HVM L is associated with text that is on our computer.

90
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:57,060
So that means if we double clicked on the page T.M. l file in the Finder would it open it up in our

91
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:05,940
text editor and to make sure that that's the case go over to Finder and find any HMO page doesn't matter

92
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,050
which one it is.

93
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:10,010
It doesn't matter which.

94
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:18,190
So I'm going to take my web page mail and then control click on that web page and click get info.

95
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:26,370
And then in the open with section you manage to click on the hierarchy to open it up.

96
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:31,680
You can select the programs that you want to open it up with and if you haven't added to your system

97
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,150
before it's probably going to be Chrome Firefox or Safari.

98
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,700
So you need to make sure that you've selected brackets.

99
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:44,750
Or if you've chosen a different text then you've chosen that text added to that and then you just click

100
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:55,500
change all of that will then change all files with an extension of HVM else open in your text as a right.

101
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:04,690
So now that we've done that we can go back to Firefox and click command you to open the file and control

102
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:15,430
click and open or we can also use command and O to open the file in our text editor and there it is.

103
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:22,060
So now if we want to edit this file live on the Web for example if I want to put a full stop at the

104
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:29,590
end of that H-2 then we just use command s to save and you can see it's updating live on the Web site

105
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,190
itself.

106
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:36,430
And if we go back over to crime and refresh the page you can see that that change has happened live

107
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:37,420
on the web.

108
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,320
So that's how I do most of my website editing.

109
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,680
And I recommend that's how you do it too.

110
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:49,540
Bear in mind that when you start using other file extensions such as Dot CSSA or dot HP you'll need

111
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:55,780
to go through the same process in Finder and make sure that you've controlled collect get info and then

112
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,690
make sure that they're all opening with brackets.

113
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:05,470
Otherwise when you use control click and open they won't necessarily open in the right editor and that's

114
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,250
it.

115
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:12,040
So now if you like you can actually work for the whole course live on the web.

116
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:20,270
And use this set up to edit your page live on the web on the right and view the output on the left.

117
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:24,370
I'm going to carry on working on the desktop just because it's a little bit faster but you've got the

118
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,470
power to work life.

119
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,140
Now if you want to.

120
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,080
Great.

121
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:35,140
So I hope you're clear on how FCP works and how we can use fire FGP to upload and update files on our

122
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,290
web space immediately and without further ado.

123
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,450
Let's get back to the code and learn some CSX.
