00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:07.220
This video we're going to see how to set up pay on a Windows machine.

2
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.560
A number of different FGP programs that you can use.

3
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:17.770
But I'm going to recommend that you use a browser called Firefox and a plug in called Fire FGP once

4
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:18.820
that's up and running.

5
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.760
I'll show you the reasons why I prefer that particular FTB program.

6
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.980
If you want to use a different one that you're comfortable with them for free.

7
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:37.230
But if not and follow along in crime will create a new type and then we'll search for Firefox Firefox.

8
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.880
If you haven't heard of it is a browser much like chrome or Internet Explorer and it's freely available

9
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.580
and it's quite widely used.

10
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:51.130
It's well worth getting comfortable with it because you'll probably be checking back your web sites

11
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.970
to look good on it at some point as well.

12
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.590
So it's a good thing to have on your system anyway.

13
00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:06.140
But it has a very robust plugin ecosystem including I think the best FGP software fire FGP which is

14
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.370
an add on for Firefox.

15
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:17.220
So yes and then click install that will then download Firefox and install it on your machine.

16
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.960
And there we go.

17
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:28.440
I would probably go for they don't import anything just to keep things simple and then click next.

18
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.630
And here we go.

19
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.860
So Firefox is now set up.

20
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.870
I'm not going to set it as my default browser.

21
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.690
And you're welcome to create a Firefox account but I'm going to leave that out for now.

22
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.210
But I'm going to dig.

23
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.200
Is click the three bars over here to get the menu and then click add ons.

24
00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:05.650
And I'm going to add the five FCP add on by searching in the box at the top right for fire FTB.

25
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:16.860
And there it is top of the list that fire FGP just click install that will then install it as an addon

26
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:25.100
within Firefox so you'll need to open Firefox to access fire FTB we go.

27
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:36.360
Now we need to restart Firefox to install the fire A.P. ad on that we're going that's now Adam and if

28
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:43.840
we click in the my add ons box there you can see that fire FGP has now been added for us.

29
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:50.640
One thing I want to do before we actually use fire FTB is added to our bookmarks bar up here.

30
00:02:51.110 --> 00:03:02.450
So just right click on the toolbar and scroll down to customize and then you'll see the fire T.P. icon

31
00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.990
there as an option to add to the toolbar so just drag it and add it wherever you like or just pop it

32
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.190
right there.

33
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.720
And then the big green exit Customize button.

34
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.090
Fantastic.

35
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:26.650
Now you'll be able to click the fire button to get your file FGP page open.

36
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.650
And this is it.

37
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.050
This is what fire FGP looks like on the left hand side.

38
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.930
We've got files on your local machine and on the right hand side at the moment it's blank.

39
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.730
But when we connect to our server we'll see all the files on the server and we'll be able to edit and

40
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.030
upload to them.

41
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:53.000
So on my machine I want to have my desktop open again and I want to create an account.

42
00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:01.090
I just going to click Create an account and and in order to have an FPP account I need to know the details

43
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.700
and I can get those in the control panel for my hosting package.

44
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.200
So we noted those down here.

45
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.900
Here we go that and the FTB details and I'll copy the user name.

46
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:23.370
First of all I just copy that and use Control-C to copy it to the clipboard it's just the domain name.

47
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:33.140
And then I'm going to switch back to a Firefox and the login is just the domain name.

48
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:40.280
And I'm going to add that for the account name as well so that I can refer to it in 550 page and click

49
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.160
here to show next to the password.

50
00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:51.100
Select that's Control-C to copy and pasted into the password.

51
00:04:51.130 --> 00:05:05.330
And finally we're going to use the FTB server FTB dot stack C.P dot com.

52
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.020
You can use the IP server but only if you purchase the domain name

53
00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.100
under-vote and click OK.

54
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:22.730
One more thing we need to do before we can connect is we'll need to unlock FGP.

55
00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:29.000
Now whether I sting has a security feature whereby FTB locks automatically after a certain amount of

56
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.830
time and that means that someone can't access your files even if they managed to track down your password

57
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:36.990
somehow.

58
00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.360
So I'm going to unlock FGP for just an hour.

59
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.800
Obviously the longer you unlock it for the more risky it is but the more convenient it is.

60
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:51.100
So it's a balance between the two that are going to unlock.

61
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.990
You will need to be unlocked before you try and connect.

62
00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.860
Otherwise it won't work.

63
00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:57.860
All right.

64
00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.520
Now back over to fire FCPA.

65
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.910
Keep your fingers crossed and then we'll click connect and there we go.

66
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.760
So we're now connected and you can see the folder that we're now reasonably familiar with public HCO

67
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.230
mail and also the cgi bin the way ignoring for the moment as well.

68
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:23.080
So just double click public HGL and you can see we've got our index HGL file right there.

69
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:32.180
So one of the things you may have noticed when we opened up our Hello World page was that the picture

70
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:38.810
didn't work and that's because the picture file isn't actually there on the server.

71
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.970
We only had it on our own computer.

72
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:49.600
So what I can do is take the duct tape file from my computer and click the arrow to the right there

73
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.520
and upload it to my server.

74
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.320
Now stop JPAC will be on the server.

75
00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:01.970
So if I go back over to crime and refresh the page by pressing F5.

76
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:08.270
And we now get the Dutch JPEG file appearing.

77
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:14.300
So that's how easy it is to use my FGP to upload files to our server.

78
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:17.760
We can download files as well if we want to using the the error.

79
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:25.350
But the real great feature of fire FGP is that it allows you to edit files right there on the server.

80
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.400
And that's what I want to show you have to do now.

81
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:34.400
But before we can do it we'll need to make sure that the file that we want to edit actually opens up

82
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:41.660
in our notepad plus plus or which ever text editor you're using at the moment you can see we've got

83
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.640
a little e Internet Explorer or edge browser.

84
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:50.250
So at the moment if I try and open that it's going to open in the browser which is not what I want.

85
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:57.200
So I'm going to go to my desktop and find any HDMI file.

86
00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.560
So I've got a file here web page to.

87
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.290
Him.

88
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:05.840
You should have a bunch of files in your complete web developer course folder many of which will be

89
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:14.300
dot HD AML files so it doesn't matter which one find any DML file right click on it and then click open

90
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:20.850
with and then go down and choose another app.

91
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:27.980
And this is the point at which we are going to choose the app to open our HMO file and you may see your

92
00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:29.500
browser in that list.

93
00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:37.110
I don't in this case so I'm going to click more apps and then we've got Notepad is no good.

94
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:45.030
Still I haven't found no paragraph Plus I look for another app on this PC notepad plus plus which is

95
00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:53.980
in if you've installed in the default location C. drive and then Program Files Exide 6 notepad plus

96
00:08:53.980 --> 00:09:00.570
plus And then my pet plus plus and there it is.

97
00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:02.400
So now we can click.

98
00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:11.760
Always use this app to open HDMI files select notepad plus plus and click OK and what we've done there

99
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:18.130
is with associated notepad plus plus with all H.A. files on a machine.

100
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:29.750
So now if I go back see Firefox and fire FTB and right click on indexed or AGM L and then open it will

101
00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:38.110
open in the full program which will be notepad plus plus you can see where it is right there.

102
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:44.680
And the great thing here is that we can edit our index DML file right here.

103
00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:49.040
No purpose plus and any changes that we make will be saved automatically.

104
00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.420
On the server.

105
00:09:50.920 --> 00:10:00.000
So if I want to remove this period the end of that sentence for some reason and if I do that and then

106
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:07.920
save that save will be communicated to the server straight away and then if I refresh the page again

107
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:10.950
you can see the full stop is gone.

108
00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:19.790
So that means that we can edit our files right there on the server using Notepad plus plus immediately

109
00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.890
which is a really handy thing to be able to do.

110
00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:26.410
So that's the set up for fire F-Type.

111
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:32.630
Remember when you start editing any other type of file like a dot CSSA file or later on in the course

112
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:34.240
ADOT BHP file.

113
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:41.030
You'll need to go through the process of setting those files to open with notepad plus plus in your

114
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:42.030
Windows machine.

115
00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.540
And the prices will be exactly the same as what we've just done here.

116
00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:48.100
OK that's it.

117
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:55.890
So now you can upload your own Hello World page to your own web hosting package.

118
00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.240
Mike if you edits and see those changes happen immediately on line and use that you are able to share

119
00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:05.630
the page with me and your friends and family.

120
00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:11.660
Congratulate yourself on making a great website and let's move on and learn a bit of CSSA.
