1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:06,150
All right so having looked at probables we're going to look at two of the career you I widgets before

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,710
we make our code play player project.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,390
So the first one is accordion.

4
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:13,030
Let's have a quick look.

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,640
First off and see what that means.

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,580
And then I'll challenge you to make one yourself.

7
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,190
So accordions are pretty simple.

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:34,870
They look like this they're a way of condensing a large amount of information into a relatively small

9
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:35,310
space.

10
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:41,080
And then the user can select which bit they're interested in reading at any one time so they're quite

11
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,020
useful.

12
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:48,850
Our challenge then is just to recreate this more or less but do it ourselves without even text.

13
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,420
So I'm going to give that to you.

14
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,180
Go for it.

15
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:03,440
All right let's have a look then see how they've done it.

16
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,310
So the jey query looks pretty straightforward.

17
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:10,420
We just apply the accordion to the accordion div..

18
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:19,510
The div then contains obviously an ID of accordion and then an H 3 and then a div within it.

19
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:22,110
And it looks like that's what we need.

20
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,990
So let's try and recreate that structure.

21
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,920
See if we can make it work.

22
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:40,350
So we have a div ID of whatever we like but accordion makes sense.

23
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,680
And then within the accordion we have an H-3

24
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,680
which I just call title.

25
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,490
And then we have a div with some content in it.

26
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:07,640
I'm going to have some Lorem Ipsum which you may remember is some Latin that we can use to generate

27
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:18,440
some random text which just makes our sample websites look good before a client has given us their website

28
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,670
copy.

29
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,310
All right let's copy and paste that then.

30
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:31,020
So we've got a few more times and let's have a look.

31
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,310
Oh that's very good.

32
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,380
Of course I've forgotten my bit of Javascript here

33
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,770
should be pretty simple.

34
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:52,570
We just want to take the accordion element and apply the accordion function to it.

35
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:59,460
And just before I run that you might have noticed that I've managed to spell accordion wrong and each

36
00:02:59,460 --> 00:02:59,850
of those

37
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:08,430
easily done and would result in absolutely nothing happening because you have to spell the accordion

38
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,780
function correctly.

39
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,350
Let's take a look.

40
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:13,590
All right.

41
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:14,360
There we go.

42
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,120
So it was indeed as simple as that.

43
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:26,850
And with just one line of inquiry we've got a really nice accordion effect then it's worth speaking

44
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,690
briefly about these styles.

45
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:37,290
These are the default Jacquier UI styles but you can apply different styles using the Jacquier UI themes

46
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:45,870
so you can see here for example they've applied the smooth smoothness theme and if you do a quick search

47
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:51,030
for Jake where UI themes there are a number of them out there that you can use or you could actually

48
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:57,190
start with something like this and create your own if you wanted something completely custom.

49
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:04,410
Your final challenge then before we move on to our code our project is to create a sortable list using

50
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,820
Jacquier UI.

51
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,030
Simple as that.

52
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,710
Go for it.

53
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,160
All right.

54
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,670
How you manage it.

55
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:22,910
Let's see how we do it up here where it says sortable

56
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:33,930
and very simply we can just sort out elements into a certain order.

57
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,660
I've actually used this in a few web sites.

58
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,740
It's a nice user interaction model.

59
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,760
So let's have a quick look at the source

60
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,920
so we've got two instructions here.

61
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:53,620
The first one makes sense with setting it to be sortable using the sortable function and then we're

62
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,350
doing the slightly strange disable selection.

63
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:01,960
So let's Firstly do things without that see how it works and then see why disable selection might be

64
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,310
important.

65
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,050
OK.

66
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:09,730
And then we've got a unordered list and a bunch of allies with a bunch of span's and classes which I

67
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,710
don't think we need.

68
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,510
So I'm going to try it without them.

69
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,270
So let's do it under my accordion.

70
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,240
We'll have a well again with an idea of

71
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,730
sortable.

72
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,650
And let's just put in some list items.

73
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:38,210
I use my usual list items for upcast and

74
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:41,680
Salmi

75
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,990
and Ralphy.

76
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:47,830
All right.

77
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:52,080
And then we just run our javascript's Rajai query.

78
00:05:54,750 --> 00:06:00,030
We're going to apply to the sortable Dave.

79
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,890
The function sortable.

80
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,300
All right let's refresh and take a look.

81
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:13,410
So you've got a very normal looking list there but we can indeed sort it

82
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:22,210
wonderful and I trust then that you can also extend that and if you wanted something to happen when

83
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:28,300
the user has resorted then you could do that with a callback function which you would find in the API

84
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,360
documentation.

85
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:36,510
OK so that's as far as we're going to go looking into the various different interactions from widgets.

86
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:41,090
But there really are a bunch of very very useful widgets here.

87
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,210
The data pick picker for example.

88
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:51,170
It's something that's you've probably seen on several Web sites and is really useful autocomplete.

89
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:57,050
That's something I mentioned again at the beginning of this chapter that's a really useful thing to

90
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:02,390
be able to do and you can do it just straight away with Jake where you live and feel free to have a

91
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:09,450
click around and see how you might use some of these in the sites that you're working on.

92
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:12,990
So that takes us to the end of our J query UI too.

93
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,740
And indeed to the Jay queery section.

94
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:21,320
So all that remains is to make what will probably be the biggest project so far and that is code player.

95
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:25,760
Let's find out what it is and how you're going to make it in the next video.
