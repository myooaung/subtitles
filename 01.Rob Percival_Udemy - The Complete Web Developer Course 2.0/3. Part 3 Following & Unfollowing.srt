1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:00,680
All right.

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,190
So we're making pretty good progress.

3
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,610
We can now view the latest public tweets.

4
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:11,390
And of course we've got our logging system working well and we've got our code.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,120
If not the actual functions for searching tweets and posting tweets.

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:22,570
So in this video we're going to see how to set up following and unfollow in specific users.

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,290
Let's get the model set up first.

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,310
So we'll be creating a new table in our Twitter database.

9
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:35,700
And this is going to be able to keep track of who's following who.

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,210
So I'm going to call it is following

11
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,900
and as usual we'll have an I.D. for each relationship

12
00:00:50,540 --> 00:01:01,440
and we'll have follower and is following and they'll both be integers because they're going to refer

13
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,760
to the user IDs

14
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:15,120
and then if we look back over on our recent tweets page we've got a follow instruction that.

15
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:20,160
So that's where we're going to write our code for following a user.

16
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:24,180
It's all going to be nice and fancy with AJAX.

17
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:31,020
So let's set up a link here which is not going to go anywhere.

18
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:47,590
But it will have a class of I'll call it toggle follow and I'm going to add to that a data variable

19
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,790
of user ID.

20
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,330
Which is going to be equal say

21
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,540
the

22
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,110
user id of the post to

23
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:12,290
which is what I use or Id

24
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:18,450
like that.

25
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:22,680
And remember we can access any data variable we like using query

26
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:26,780
OK.

27
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,860
So let's just check that that's worked.

28
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:31,600
Here we go.

29
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:36,030
It's a link and then we quickly view the source.

30
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,330
We should be able to just see that the data attribute is the

31
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:46,230
data user ID is 7 and 8 that

32
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,590
wonderful.

33
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:54,230
So now let's write some query to do something when the toggle follow

34
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,190
links are clicked and we'll write that in footer top HP

35
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:14,730
say let's set up how toggle follow links to have a click function.

36
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:23,710
And initially I'm going to set up my click function to be alert and I'm going to try and get the value

37
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:32,950
of that attribute which we do using dot ITTL and then the name of the attribute which is data Dasch

38
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,030
user ID.

39
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:41,280
So let's just have a look and see if everything is connected up right.

40
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:46,480
We should get a 7 and an 8 let it in our

41
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,050
excellent.

42
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:57,770
So then we're going to need to to either follow the user up or unfollow the user depending on whether

43
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,230
the user is currently followed or not.

44
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,890
So let's do that with a bit of Ajax

45
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,600
so I'm just going to copy that down.

46
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:18,560
As before and we're going to post two actions Doppie HP but this time the action is going to be Tuggle

47
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,400
follow.

48
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:32,830
And the only data that we need is the user id and that's going to be equal to this attribute here.

49
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,570
There we go and as before

50
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:51,050
we will do something else with this later on.

51
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,100
But for now we'll just let results

52
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,930
great.

53
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:06,190
So we're looking for an action value of toggle follow now.

54
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:12,670
So let's go see the actions that HP check for the existence of that

55
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:30,630
action is equal to Toko follow them will be as before and just display the post variables again to make

56
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,460
sure that everything is connected up right.

57
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,080
Let's take a look.

58
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,460
Something has gone horribly wrong.

59
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:48,330
Let's have a quick inspect right in the car so AZT is not defined.

60
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,590
OK let's have a look and fit it up there.

61
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:59,230
Oh yes that's because I've forgotten this.

62
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,270
Fair enough.

63
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,260
Let's have another go.

64
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:07,470
That's great.

65
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:15,850
So I was getting the response from actioned up HP and it's receiving the user ID.

66
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:22,740
So now the first thing we're going to need to do is to check whether our current user is following this

67
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,710
particular user or not.

68
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:32,010
So we can do that with a query which is going to be something pretty similar to what we've got up here.

69
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,020
So I'm going to just copy that down.

70
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:44,130
That by this time we're going to select from the following table

71
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:56,110
and we want to select where our user is following the other user.

72
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:07,100
So we want to check that the follower is our current user and is following is the user that we're checking

73
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,730
said the user ID.

74
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,490
So we want

75
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:20,790
the follower to be our current user.

76
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,300
I'm going to use

77
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:30,850
my ask you apply real escape string link and then

78
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:43,860
session id and we want is following to be quilty.

79
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,300
And we want to check that.

80
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:56,590
But this time we're checking post user ID

81
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:07,870
and I'm just going to cheat slightly and comment that out I'm just echoing my query which is a nice

82
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:13,380
trick to make sure that everything is working ok.

83
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,240
I select staff from it's following with fulva is 9 and is following is 7 limit.

84
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,420
1 great

85
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,640
let's get rid of that.

86
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:32,590
So if the number of hours of the result is greater than zero then that means that they are following.

87
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,520
So we need to follow them.

88
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,600
So let's make that happen.

89
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:41,970
Essentially we just need to delete the entry from the database.

90
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:52,700
So we're going to need to get the ID of the entry which will be using Why is my your ally fetch a stock

91
00:08:53,250 --> 00:09:10,220
result and then we're going to my secure ally query link and then delete from

92
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,930
is following

93
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:24,070
where ID is equal to and then we once

94
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,550
a real escape stirring again.

95
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:35,660
This time we want ID

96
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,710
and we'll pop a limit one on the end.

97
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,030
Always a good idea when you are deleting

98
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:51,120
and then I'm going to echo one.

99
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:56,680
So one in this parlance is going to mean that we've unfollowed the use of

100
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:04,640
the other option of course is that we're going to follow the user set else

101
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,780
this time.

102
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:13,680
I'm just going to copy those bits down instead of deleting.

103
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:23,550
We're going to insert into is following and we want to set the follow up.

104
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:28,420
And is following

105
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,210
we want to set the values

106
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,570
to

107
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:55,920
the follower we want to be our current user say session id

108
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:03,880
and then we want is following a

109
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,980
they post

110
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:14,470
user ID.

111
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,740
Right now I've done quite a lot.

112
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,330
I'm going to change that to a T.

113
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,010
Let's try this out see what happens.

114
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,020
OK we've got a see.

115
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,320
That's promising.

116
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:35,700
Let's go back and have a look in the database and say yep we do indeed have our followers and is following

117
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:43,920
a relationship set up which means of course if I press it again we should get one and that should mean

118
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,950
the relationship has been deleted.

119
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,700
Wonderful.

120
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:54,650
And then a two and a one etc..

121
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,220
Brilliant.

122
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,440
So the backend part is now working.

123
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,960
Let's just update footed up HP

124
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:13,510
site if result is equal to 1.

125
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:26,060
Remember one means they've been unfollowed and what we want to do here is check to see if results is

126
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,750
equal to 1.

127
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:33,050
And remember one means that we've unfollowed.

128
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:40,050
So we want to change all the links for that particular user ID to follow.

129
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:47,560
So I think what we'll do here is update this code to have an ID

130
00:12:52,420 --> 00:13:04,460
which is equal to the user ID that we're being followed and then here we'll find all the links that

131
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:11,940
have a data user id of

132
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,250
get this right Id

133
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,940
think I need that one there actually.

134
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,920
And we want to set there each team to follow

135
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:41,250
and

136
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:53,540
if the result is too we want to do the same thing set then hated him DML to follow.

137
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,830
All right let's take a look.

138
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,500
Say reichlich follow them at changes to unfollowed.

139
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,190
Fantastic.

140
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:04,580
And if I check unfollowed it changes back to full.

141
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:08,300
And same with that link.

142
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,990
They're brilliant.

143
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:16,120
So now that we've got following set up I'm just going to follow one user here and then we're in a position

144
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:19,460
to set up the timeline.

145
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:23,930
So if you remember we called that page timeline.

146
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:36,790
So I'm going to go back over to T.P. and interviews creates a file called Timeline top HP open that

147
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:43,810
up and then not forgetting an index top page to check to see if

148
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:53,350
we get a page of timeline

149
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:02,670
then will include views slash timeline dot page.

150
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:12,180
And we're going to have a string of those and if none of them are true we'll include the home page

151
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:15,800
Okay.

152
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,810
So then

153
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,860
I'll just put a little bit of text on timeline that page.

154
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:30,130
And we should now be able to click on your timeline and see that little bit of text in the middle of

155
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,170
our page.

156
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,020
There it is.

157
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,760
Wonderful So let's

158
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:46,760
copy over our code from home to APHC to time lined up page.

159
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:49,060
Because things are going to be fairly similar here.

160
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:57,520
The only real difference is that I'm going to put tweets for you here.

161
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:06,540
And I'm going to change display tweets to is following.

162
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:13,760
So that means we only want the tweets of the people that user is following.

163
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:21,860
And to do that we're going to need to build a WHERE clause.

164
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:31,870
So we'll do this in the case that type is equal to is following.

165
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:43,510
And what we're going to need to do is check the following table for the IDs of the users that our user

166
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:48,830
is following and then constructs a query string based on those.

167
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:59,570
So we can grab a bit of code from actions to Page Pate Tabari for that.

168
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:07,240
And now we want to select everything from is following where the follower is our current user and that's

169
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,180
all we care about.

170
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:17,490
And we want all of them and then we're going to get the results.

171
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:21,980
We don't really have a need to check whether there are any.

172
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:26,940
We're just going to leap through any results that they're raw.

173
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:33,630
So let's initially set how where clause to be empty.

174
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:46,680
And then we need to be careful here to construct the right where clause so if where clause is empty

175
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,630
then we'll set it equal.

176
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:50,900
See

177
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:54,340
where

178
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,950
user id Senatus with searching tweets.

179
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,310
Now

180
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,970
and tweets stores that has user ID with a small as it happens.

181
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:23,590
That's not great but it will be fine where user ID is equal to the row and then we want the user ID

182
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:38,480
that our user is following which is following and if where clause is not empty then we won't see a penny

183
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,500
to it.

184
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,240
All

185
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,970
and then user ID et cetera.

186
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:58,660
So in fact what the is if it's empty I'll say that the cruelty where

187
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:09,910
if it's not I'll append all and then either way or add to append

188
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,930
user ID is equal to a and then is following.

189
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:24,800
So that should construct a potentially quite large string which starts with a where and then has a user

190
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,920
id equal to.

191
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:32,020
And then one of the followings or it's equal to something else or is equal to something else.

192
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:40,970
It should essentially generate all the tweets of the users that I use the following.

193
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:45,200
So fingers crossed something's gone horribly wrong.

194
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,120
Sometimes a refresh fixes it.

195
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,940
OK so it wasn't that bad but it hasn't generated what we want.

196
00:19:54,460 --> 00:20:03,190
I'll tell you what let's cheat again and just echo out the query to see if there's an error in our Escudo

197
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,600
select staff from tweets where it user ID.

198
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,740
Aha I think we're missing a space

199
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:16,540
easily done.

200
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,660
I have another look.

201
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,270
There we go.

202
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:25,200
William So now we can get rid of the query.

203
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:30,720
And we're just seeing that one tweet that.

204
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,500
But that does remind me that we've got the option here to follow.

205
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:39,890
Which isn't right because we're already following this user site.

206
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:48,320
We're going to need to update functions dot ph HP to check here whether the user is following that user.

207
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:59,400
And if they all select follow and if not select on the follow say let's change that see and then and

208
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:07,470
then we'll have a second echo afterwards and then we want to check the user is following this other

209
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:17,540
user so we can actually use very similar code to what we had that say select stuff from following where

210
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:24,280
follower is our current user and is following is this time row.

211
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:30,270
User ID rather than post them at.

212
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:34,000
And then we get our results.

213
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,390
But I think we want to rename those.

214
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:40,890
So we did confuse the main string.

215
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:45,000
So let's have is following query

216
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,450
and then is following query result.

217
00:21:54,910 --> 00:22:08,930
And that and that and is following query and then so if the number of rows is greater than zero.

218
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:19,330
We didn't actually need to get the result we just need to write on full light because that means that

219
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:20,530
they are being followed

220
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,990
else.

221
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:28,990
I follow it because they're not following that use.

222
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,320
OK.

223
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,370
Let's take a look.

224
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:40,730
We should now see unfollow appear that and there we go.

225
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,850
Fantastic.

226
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:47,080
And if we link back to the home page as well we should see that we're following one of them but not

227
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,970
the other problem.

228
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:53,040
And of course we can choose to follow both if we want.

229
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:57,760
And that means that they'll buy appear on our timeline.

230
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,590
There we go.

231
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,680
So that's following and unfaltering sorted.

232
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:05,890
The next challenge is for the use of themselves to be able to post a tweet.

233
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,520
And that's what we're going to see in the next video.
