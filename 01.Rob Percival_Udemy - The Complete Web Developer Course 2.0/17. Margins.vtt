00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.160
So now that we've looked at positioning and several different types of it to see how we can use them

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.620
to change the layout of our page we're going to see how we can do that slightly differently with margins.

3
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.760
So I'm just going to change our code to get rid of that big high there and change the position here

4
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.450
back to relative.

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.670
So I hope you remember that in itself doesn't make any difference.

6
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:32.360
But remember also that we can do things like this once we've set the position to be relative.

7
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:39.980
We can set the Left property to 100 pixels and that effectively gives it a margin to the left of 100

8
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.820
pixels.

9
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.400
So what's the difference then between using relative positioning and using margins.

10
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.260
Well let's find out.

11
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.270
So first of all you have got rid of the positioning completely here.

12
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.440
So we're not doing positioning we're using margins.

13
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.480
And initially I'm going to set the margin to 100 pixels.

14
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.540
So what does that do.

15
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.990
Aha.

16
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.850
So now we've got a margin of 100 pixels all the way round the box.

17
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.760
So obviously at the top left bottom and right.

18
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.210
So hopefully you can see straightaway that this is different to positioning even though the effect might

19
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.680
be we're moving it to the right and down.

20
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.710
We are actually creating a margin all the way around which we can actually do with positioning.

21
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:36.230
Now if we wanted our blue box here to be to the right of that then we would just float them both to

22
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:44.890
the left and I'll just do that quickly to show you that we do indeed have a margin all the way round.

23
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:45.590
So there you go.

24
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.530
If we stretch that out you can see we've got the margin here and now because these two are floated left

25
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.530
this blue box is now to the right of the green one.

26
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.890
But it has this margin in between it.

27
00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.090
So that's the main difference really between positioning and margins.

28
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.950
And you can use them in some cases for the same thing but they are a little bit different.

29
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.220
So let's just look at margins and a bit more detail and see what else we can do with them.

30
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.740
So here we've got a margin of 100 pixels all the way round what if we wanted to have a different margin

31
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.700
on each edge.

32
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.490
Well that's pretty easy.

33
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.410
We could have 100 pixels and then

34
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.290
50 pixels.

35
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.280
Now let's see what that does.

36
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.430
OK.

37
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.440
So that moves it over to the left.

38
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.800
What we've effectively done there is we've set the top and bottom margins to 100 pixels and we've set

39
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.570
to the left and right margins to 50 pixels.

40
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.220
So if you want to pause the video and test by floating those two left you'll see that the blue one ends

41
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.720
up around there.

42
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.730
It's about 50 pixels to the right.

43
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.780
So that's a really handy way of setting the top and bottom ones different to the left and right ones.

44
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.860
But you could also set them all to something different.

45
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.220
So let's have something like 20 pixels and 10 pixels.

46
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.740
And then let's have a look.

47
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.120
So what's going on here is this starts at the top and then goes round clockwise.

48
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.300
So the top margin is 100 pixels up there.

49
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.640
Then if we could see it the right margin is 50 pixels.

50
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.340
And then the bottom margin is 20 pixels and then the left margin is 10 pixels.

51
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.410
You might not be able see that left margin very clearly.

52
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:41.440
So let's just convince you by taking that back up to 100 pixels and that now changes the left margin.

53
00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.230
So that's how you set each of the margins.

54
00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.100
Top right bottom and left individually.

55
00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.360
One last thing that you might want to do is only set one particular margin and leave the rest as whatever

56
00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:05.480
they are and you can do that using margin dash and then bottom left right top depending on which one

57
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.560
you want to change.

58
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.440
So if you wanted to set margin left to be know 150 pixels

59
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:20.970
then that would just set the left margin and it would leave the others as whatever they are.

60
00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:22.820
And that's pretty much it.

61
00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.440
So generally you would use margins when you wanted your element to remain in the flow of the page and

62
00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.950
to spread everything out relative to it and you would use positioning if you wanted to take your element

63
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:39.230
out of the flow of the page and move it around on top of oller and other elements and that sort of thing.

64
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.600
Very quick challenge then to give you an opportunity to practice margins.

65
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:49.070
Can you take the blue div and make it so that it has margins of 50 pixels on the top and the bottom

66
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:56.870
and 20 pixels left and right and bonus points if you can do that in two different ways.

67
00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.090
So 50 pixels top and bottom 20 pixels left and right go for it.

68
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.630
I get that worked out for you.

69
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.440
I'm going to show you a few different ways to do it.

70
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.890
In fact there were three different ways.

71
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.730
So the first one I'll show you is a single margin.

72
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:26.900
So we said 50 pixels top and bottom and 20 pixels left and right.

73
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.980
Let's have a look.

74
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:29.910
There we go.

75
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.590
Fifty 50 pixels at the top and the bottom and 20 left.

76
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.220
And if we could see it they'd be 20 on the right as well.

77
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.000
So that's one way of doing it that's probably the simplest solution.

78
00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:46.540
Another solution is to set all of them manually like that.

79
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.310
And if you just have a look at that that does exactly the same thing.

80
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.390
So that was solution number two.

81
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.610
There is however a third solution.

82
00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.110
So a super bonus marks if you got this one as well.

83
00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:05.320
We could set the margin top as being 50 pixels.

84
00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:11.450
I'm going to save my typing a little bit set the bottom to be 50 pixels as well.

85
00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:17.130
Set the left to be 20 pixels.

86
00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:23.920
And of course the right to be 20 pixels too.

87
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.860
And that's another way to do it.

88
00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:32.980
Even though it's a little bit more long winded than the first two solutions that we had.

89
00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:33.490
All right.

90
00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.820
So that's how we use margins to move our elements around the page.

91
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:43.120
We're now going to see how we can use something very similar called padding to provide a much needed

92
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:49.450
bit of space between the edge of one element and the beginning of something inside it we'll be looking

93
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.110
at that in the next video.
