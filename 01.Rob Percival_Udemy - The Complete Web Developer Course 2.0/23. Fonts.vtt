00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:06.210
So the last few videos of this section we're going to be moving on from lay out and color and focusing

2
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.610
on text.

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.440
So let's get rid of all our styles and indeed our content so far.

4
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:20.510
And we're going to start by seeing how we can change the format or typeface of our text.

5
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.350
So let's start by adding a little bit of text.

6
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.910
I'm going to use the minimally boring.

7
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.310
This is some text.

8
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.940
But you can use something even more exciting than that if you like.

9
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:40.210
Now of course to style that probably the easiest way is to set up some styles for how the tags.

10
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.580
And before I do anything new and fancy I always like just to check that everything's kind of connected

11
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.190
up right.

12
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:52.620
So you might do something like font size 200 percent and then just have a look.

13
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.330
There we go.

14
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.620
So this CSSA is definitely connecting to this content.

15
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.380
So even if I have a problem with my font changing CSSA I know that it's not down to an issue that I've

16
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.340
spelt style like that or something like that.

17
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.080
So that's a good trick.

18
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.420
I always use before doing something new.

19
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.090
So changing the font with CSSA is pretty straightforward.

20
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.540
We use the property font family.

21
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.730
Now the challenge with farm family is that you have to remember what the font families are.

22
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:31.470
Now fortunately my text as it has given me a few that I can work with.

23
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.920
So let's go for fantasy to get something that hopefully will look completely different to plain old

24
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.190
text.

25
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.200
And there we go.

26
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.990
You can see this is definitely a different sort of font than what we would have got without it.

27
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.810
So now we've changed the font but how do we know what fonts are available other than the ones that happened

28
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.830
to appear in the dropdown list.

29
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:58.480
Well I would do a quick google of web safe fonts and then the top result for me is this W3 schools dot

30
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.670
com link which is perfect.

31
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.430
And then this will give you a list of the fonts that are pretty safe to use.

32
00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.340
That means they're supported by most browsers.

33
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.850
So we've got Georgia here.

34
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:21.030
Palatino linotype Times New Roman and Sunseri if that means without little ticks.

35
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:28.090
So aerial aerial black comics and et cetera and a couple of monospace fonts as well in which all of

36
00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.810
the characters have the same width.

37
00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:30.820
They're particularly good.

38
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.650
If you want to display code on your website so you can try some of those out.

39
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.870
Let's just pop them one.

40
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:45.340
We'll try Aeriel just because it looks different once again them what we have say Ariel

41
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.330
we go let's refresh there again.

42
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.230
So that's what Ariel looks like now you know to stay that quiet.

43
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.730
Most of these in fact have not just one but they have several different ones.

44
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.000
Most have three times new roman times and Sarath.

45
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.790
Now this is actually a really nice feature of CSSA fonts and it's known as fallback.

46
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:14.490
So if the Times New Roman font is available on the system of whoever's looking at your web site then

47
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.090
it will display the text with times new roman font.

48
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.160
If not it'll fall back to the Times font and if it doesn't have that it'll fall back to the standard

49
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.010
Sarath font whatever that is on the machine of your user.

50
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.900
So if you're going to change fonts it's always a good idea to have several different ones so that you

51
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.450
can be sure that you're getting something that looks close to the font that you really want.

52
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.310
Even if they haven't got the perfect font already on their system so you should always have several

53
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.280
different font families but increasingly more general as you go across the comments like that.

54
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.450
So that's pretty much it when it comes to web syphons.

55
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.930
You'll notice that there's not a huge number of these.

56
00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.760
And if you're really picky about what you want your website to look like it might not be one there that's

57
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.310
close enough to vision that you have in mind.

58
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:10.560
So I'm going to show you as well how to use Google fonts which is a huge range of free to use fonts

59
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.250
you can find just by googling Google fonts and then click on the top result should take you to Fahnestock

60
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.510
Google dot com and Google fonts looks like this.

61
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.110
So it's really well organized.

62
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:35.260
You can see how all the fonts look and you can use categories on the left to identify particular types

63
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.780
of font that you're interested in.

64
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.980
And then you can use any one you like in your web pages.

65
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:48.580
So there's a particular one that I like so I'm going to choose the search option and then search for

66
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.780
Shadow and the shadows into light from just the one I'm going to use.

67
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.110
I think it's very nice but the process of getting it onto your web page is exactly the same regardless

68
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.180
of which font you want.

69
00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:04.510
So first off just click the plus button and you'll get this little box appear at the bottom saying one

70
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:10.180
family selected you can select more than one if you want but I'll just keep to the one and then you

71
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.630
can see we've got this embed font section here.

72
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.970
So all we need to do is copy that code.

73
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.550
We'll explain what it means in a minute and then we get back to our

74
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:33.580
HMO page and then you can paste this in anywhere in the head section will actually work anywhere in

75
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:34.050
the document.

76
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:41.740
But normally we put our fonts and other styles in the head section so you can see what this is doing

77
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:49.240
is essentially bringing in a style sheet that is some C S S and it's getting it from this you are real

78
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.500
here Fahnestock Google API or come see us.

79
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.670
And then you can see we've got what's known as a query string that is a question mark and then family

80
00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.740
and then the name of our font family there.

81
00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.360
So that will bring in the font code to our page.

82
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.160
But how do we actually use it or to use it.

83
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:17.200
We go back to Google page and then you can see here they specify in CSSA we've got the CSSA code that

84
00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.880
we need to bring that into our page.

85
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:30.450
So just select that control say or command say and then we just replace our font family fantasy which

86
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:39.320
is what we had before to that code our font family is now going to be chosen to light and cursive so

87
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.220
so that your back over to our Web page.

88
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.790
And when you refresh it you can see we've now got that very nice font.

89
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:49.390
Excellent.

90
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.240
So you can now add any font you like.

91
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:57.630
Feel free to experiment a little and try out some different phones from Google phones or elsewhere.

92
00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:06.020
But for now we're going to move straight on to customizing text in more detail with a styling text in

93
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.130
the next video.
