00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.670
So welcome to the javascript section of the complete web developer because here's your final look at

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.710
the BBC web site that hopefully you created at the end of the last section to remind that everything

3
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.030
that we've done so far has been focused on layout and design and style.

4
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.550
Other than a VERY little bit of interaction with forms I haven't been able to make our Web sites do

5
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.110
anything.

6
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.220
And that's what javascript is all about.

7
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.390
It allows you to make your web websites Interactive which will make the user experience a lot better

8
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.660
and allow you to create things like games apps and web apps that hopefully your users will love.

9
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.530
It's also our first look at proper coding.

10
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.210
What I mean by that is we can start making software and programs that do something rather than just

11
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.340
look a certain way.

12
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.620
So it's a big move.

13
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.360
A big shift a lot to learn but also really exciting.

14
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.690
I'm going to just show you very quickly how easy it is to get started with a little bit of Javascript

15
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.740
and we'll do this in the usual way.

16
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:13.010
So I'm going to say goodbye to my BBC or Tim Page and I'm going to create a new folder Criminal Code

17
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.200
3 javascript

18
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.500
and then

19
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.120
I'll just call it javascript hatred him l and that's the main file that will be working with

20
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.030
every game.

21
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:42.110
So will change the title to javascript's get rid of the style sheet link which won't work now anyway.

22
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:49.120
And then go back to the start almost painful to delete all that occurred.

23
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.400
But it was good fun guys.

24
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.660
A very quick challenge for you.

25
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.030
Can you make this new page appear in your browser.

26
00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.440
You should be a master of that by now.

27
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:04.180
All right.

28
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.100
How you managed it.

29
00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:18.150
Well we need to do is update the RL to 3 dash javascript and then javascript TNL that we go blank page

30
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.280
but you can see the title up there.

31
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.990
All right.

32
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.570
So I'm going to show you a very simple way to get a little bit of Javascript up and running.

33
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.970
And we're going to use a button.

34
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.290
This is an HVM element that we haven't actually seen yet but it does exactly what you might think.

35
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:47.110
So it's much like a submit button that we saw in the forms section of the HD M-L chapter but by default

36
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.310
it doesn't do anything you have to give it some code to make it do something.

37
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.670
So let's tempt our user by putting the words click me into the button.

38
00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.850
Let's have a look.

39
00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.100
There's a button.

40
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.580
So we click it.

41
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.800
And of course nothing happens.

42
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.540
So how do we add javascript.

43
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.610
Well just like with CSSA there's three different ways that we can put javascript into our web sites.

44
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.160
And they're exactly the same three different ways as with CSSA.

45
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.470
So the first that I'm going to show you is the simplest but not the one I'd recommend long term but

46
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.040
it will get us started.

47
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.290
So this is in line javascript's.

48
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:33.730
And instead of you remember we used style before to get some CSSA we use on click to get some Javascript.

49
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:40.010
So this just means that we're going to execute this bit of Javascript when the button is clicked.

50
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.510
Simple as that.

51
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:49.450
And then we put the javascript's that we're going to execute into these quites and a nice simple command

52
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.660
is alert.

53
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.000
And then we have some parentheses or brackets and in single quotes.

54
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.820
I'm going to put high so slightly complicated but you get the idea.

55
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.130
Hopefully this command means alert and then we have some brackets to contain the instructions about

56
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:14.180
what we want to alert and in single quotes there.

57
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.640
I've put the word high with an exclamation mark so this should alert the word high.

58
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.940
What exactly does that mean.

59
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:26.620
Let's run it and find out where it is.

60
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.720
So we get a little pop up that says hi with a load of nonsense at the beginning.

61
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.230
But we can ignore that for now.

62
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.060
So feel free to experiment with that a little bit.

63
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:44.050
You can essentially put any text you like there or numbers or anything else and it will appear when

64
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.360
the button is clicked.

65
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.550
So that's your first teensy bit of Javascript and a little bit of interaction between your user and

66
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:58.600
your website in the next video will switch from in line to internal javascript which is going to be

67
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.850
a move very similar to the one that we made when we did CSSA in the previous chapter.
