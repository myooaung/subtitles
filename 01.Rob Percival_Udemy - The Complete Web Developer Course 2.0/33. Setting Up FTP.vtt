00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:07.110
So in this video we're going to see how to set up FTB to connect to our Web Hosting to transfer and

2
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.780
update files.

3
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.140
There are lots of different FTB programs and they all work much the same way.

4
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.800
And I'm going to show you a couple of different options but the one I'd recommend is free and available

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.050
for all platforms and it's called File Zila.

6
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:29.790
So if you just go to your browser and Google for files Zilah then you'll find the main web site here

7
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.100
and fells ilah is just a program that you can install on your computer to allow you to connect to your

8
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.890
webspace via FTB.

9
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.490
So we want the files Zyla client so click on that one.

10
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.930
If you're on Mac OS as I am then download that one.

11
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.640
If you're on Windows or Linux then it will hopefully give you the appropriate client to download.

12
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.780
If not then click on the windows or linux icons down there.

13
00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.120
OK.

14
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.230
If you're on a Mac you'll get an option to download on the App Store.

15
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.500
But we don't need to do that.

16
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.500
You can if you like but I'm going to go for the straightforward download option.

17
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.760
Ok then find the file that you've downloaded.

18
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.590
Double click on it.

19
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.090
Same process in Windows and Mac and agree to the terms and conditions.

20
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.230
And this will then begin the installation process.

21
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.670
It's pretty quick on a Mac.

22
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.240
I just need to double click again on file Zyla there and open windows.

23
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.580
You'll probably get presented with the installer straight away.

24
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.000
Then we'll click continue.

25
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.090
You probably don't want the Yahoo search off of them so I'd recommend clicking skip unless you want

26
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:51.640
that and again for opera and then it will run through the installation process.

27
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.570
Although click Finish and files it opens up for us.

28
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:04.380
Click OK and this is the file Zella interface which is very similar to other FTB programs.

29
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.000
Not particularly user friendly perhaps but we'll get to grips with it and in a couple of minutes you'll

30
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.720
wonder how you ever lived without it.

31
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:18.920
So you'll see on the left hand side we have our folder structure on my computer here so you need to

32
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.290
find your files that you've been working with.

33
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.990
Minor on the desktop and there we go.

34
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.750
So there's our index this GMO file and at JPL you don't need to worry about these extra files here they're

35
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.950
just default Mac OS files which are going to completely ignore.

36
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.540
All right so now comes the time to connect to our site via FTB.

37
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:45.700
I'm going to use the button on the top left there and create a new site.

38
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:53.900
So we need the settings for our website to connect to FTB which we get over in the control panel.

39
00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.930
And they're down here on the right hand side.

40
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.690
So first off your notice here is currently locked.

41
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.810
This is a security feature of either Web Hosting to prevent other people accessing your files.

42
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.790
You can either unlock FCP by time or by a specific IP address.

43
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.630
If you know that your IP address doesn't change.

44
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.650
So if you know you're on a fixed IP address then click unlock by IP.

45
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.360
If you don't know that then it's probably best to unlock it by time.

46
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.880
And best to pick the shortest time possible so that your FTB is as secure as it can be.

47
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.530
So I'm going to go for one hour and click on.

48
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:34.770
FTB.

49
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.710
OK now it's time to enter the details.

50
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:45.860
So first off we've got our FCP server which is F.T. pay docked stacks EPEAT or comp so I'm going to

51
00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:54.020
select that copy and then head back over to file Zella and put that in the host name.

52
00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:02.450
Back then back over to get the user name which is just the domain name there were pastorals test hosting

53
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.560
package.

54
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.960
You're obviously putting in your own web site details not mine.

55
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:19.660
Here we change the log in type to normal and we place that domain name into the user field.

56
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:26.350
While I've got it in the Clipboard I'm going to add it here in the site name as well.

57
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.870
So I'll paste that in.

58
00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:28.180
Lovely.

59
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.740
So you can have a collection of different sites and you can quickly choose between them within your

60
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.120
FTB software and then the password.

61
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.870
You don't have to include that.

62
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.740
You might want to type it in every time if someone gets hold of your computer and they're able to log

63
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.610
in and you leave the password here then they will be able to access your files.

64
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.570
That's OK I think while you're developing and just testing out an educational site for a more seriously

65
00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.120
secure site you probably want to enter the password each time.

66
00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:00.390
OK.

67
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.050
Then we just click connect.

68
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.890
And as I say I'm going to use save passwords for now.

69
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.820
But you've got a couple of options there.

70
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.020
You might not want to say the password or you won't have a master password which allows you to access

71
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.550
all of the other passwords.

72
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.130
I'll leave that up to you to choose.

73
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:26.930
Make sure that you see stock C.P. dot com in the certificate and then I'd recommend always trusting

74
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.710
that certificate from now on and then clicking OK.

75
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:38.030
And if you've entered all the details correctly you should see public HDMI out there and the logging

76
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.420
in successful message at the top there.

77
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:46.550
So congratulations connected to your site via FGP and the files as we saw in the previous video are

78
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.370
all inside publication.

79
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.030
So I just double clicked on that.

80
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.870
We can spread that out so we can see the full filename.

81
00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.190
So at the moment we've only got the index to the HD and L file.

82
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.420
That's why the image here is not displaying correctly.

83
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.650
So let's for a little bit of practice upload our first file.

84
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.010
Fire FTB it's very easy.

85
00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:16.730
We'll take out Earth JPEG file and then I'm going to control click or right click on Windows and upload

86
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:23.050
and then you can see that has uploaded the DOJ file is now on our server.

87
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:31.380
And if I go back over and refresh this page for all the lovely Earth image displays.

88
00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.880
So we connected to FTB and we've uploaded a file.

89
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.680
Let's just quickly see how we edit files using FTB.

90
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:47.960
So I'm going to take my index [REMOVED] file control click again and view slash edit

91
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:59.850
and this takes me to my editor and you can see I've got the code of my Halliwell's page there.

92
00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:06.830
So just a very simple edit that I want to include other worlds in my announcement there so I will just

93
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:15.820
change that twice and then I use command s to save controls on windows go back over to files Zilah.

94
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:18.800
And you should see that file has been changed.

95
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.530
Do we want to apply this file back to the server.

96
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.010
Yes that will then.

97
00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:28.200
Op laid out edited version of the file.

98
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:34.790
And if I go back and refresh you can see that it has taken place.

99
00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:41.190
So it's as simple as that I should offer a small word of warning editing in that way is very fast and

100
00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:48.090
simple but if you have internet connectivity problems you can on occasion get issues if for example

101
00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:51.550
it tries to upload edited version of the file but it can't.

102
00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:56.700
Then occasionally you'll find that the file will be reduced to a file size of 0.

103
00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:58.050
That has happened to me before.

104
00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:00.550
So you do need to be sure that your internet connection is good.

105
00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:06.790
If you're going to be editing this way to be absolutely sure that that's not going to happen.

106
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:13.650
You can download the file edit it off line then save it and then upload it to just in the same way we

107
00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:15.750
did with the image.

108
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.420
So up to you how you want to do that.

109
00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:21.080
But again when you're learning it's probably best to do things as simply as possible.

110
00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:26.230
So I'd recommend the editing directory method just to get moving as quickly as you can.

111
00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:27.160
All right.

112
00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:33.630
So that's how we set up a Zilah and use it to edit and upload our files in the next couple of videos.

113
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:40.560
I'm going to show you how to use Firefox and Faya FCP is an alternative FTB client which is the one

114
00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.720
I use in future videos.

115
00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:45.140
Sadly this isn't being actively developed anymore.

116
00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.270
Which is why I recommend using files illah.

117
00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:52.440
But if you do want to have everything exactly like it is in the videos while you're learning then do

118
00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.150
feel free to use Firefox and fire FTB.

119
00:08:55.530 --> 00:09:02.700
Otherwise you can jump over the next two lectures and head straight on to the end of chapter quiz for

120
00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:03.620
HVM.

121
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:04.380
Good luck.
