Congratulations on making it to the end of the complete web developer course I hope you've enjoyed the

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.790
experience and I hope you've made the most of the learning opportunities by building real websites and

3
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.090
apps yourself as you've been getting along.

4
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.450
But for now I'm just going to encourage you to keep on building web sites and web apps and getting them

5
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:20.890
out into the world.

6
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:27.000
Who knows you could end up building the next Facebook Twitter or Google and anything you do build send

7
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.460
to me on Twitter and I'll happily tell the world about it.

8
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.080
I hope you've enjoyed the complete web develop of course as much as I enjoyed making it and I wish you

9
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.450
all the best of luck in your coding and web development career.
