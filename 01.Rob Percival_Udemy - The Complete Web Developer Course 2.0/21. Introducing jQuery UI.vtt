00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.350
Now that we mastered form validation we're going to move on to something a little different.

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.990
At the beginning of this section I mentioned that one of the great advantages of using something like

3
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.560
Jey query is the huge number of plugins that are built for it.

4
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.330
And I showed you some of those to whet your appetite.

5
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.900
So for the next few videos we're going to look in a bit more detail.

6
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:26.280
One of those plugins to give you a bit of an idea how you might integrate plugins into your web sites

7
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.610
and use the documentation provided to get set up and to customize your installation exactly how you

8
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.520
need it.

9
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:42.260
So let's start by jumping over to Jay queery UI dot com and just reminding ourselves what it is.

10
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.210
Got a nice finish in there Jaker UI is a curated set of user interface interactions effects and widgets

11
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.520
and themes built on top of Jey query.

12
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.210
So we're just going to go through a few of those.

13
00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.660
Essentially will select some of the most popular options from the left there and we'll look at the documentation

14
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.210
in a little bit of detail to see how you can set up not only the default trackable.

15
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.470
Drop a ball resizable widgets etc. but also customize them to behave exactly how you want them to.

16
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.560
So here's a quick little challenge for you.

17
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.670
Can you work out how to integrate the J queery UI javascript into your web page.

18
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.490
I'll give you a clue.

19
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.110
It's a very similar process to how we integrate it.

20
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.640
Jay query in the first place to think back to that.

21
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:31.410
Best of luck.

22
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:39.380
All right.

23
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.440
Have you managed it.

24
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.000
Or I should have been caught by this quick download option here and I would have recommended going for

25
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.990
the stable download.

26
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:56.410
So I'm going to download it again directly into my query folder.

27
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.270
You can see it's a zip file here.

28
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:05.810
So we're not certain exactly what it's going to contain but I'm going to click on it to unzip it and

29
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:16.010
then this gives us a J.Crew UI folder which has a bunch of DSS and javascript as well as some images

30
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.640
and this index rotated him out.

31
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.920
Looks to me like it will be an example page.

32
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.660
So let's have a look.

33
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.210
Open with Google Chrome.

34
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.690
We'll see what's going on there.

35
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.340
There we go.

36
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.360
So we can see the Jay Querrey UI is installed and working here.

37
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:43.400
So let's have a quick look at the code which we do using right click or control click and view page

38
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.080
source.

39
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.590
So at the top hey you can see that we've got a stylesheet.

40
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.500
Jay Querrey dash you I don't see SS linked there so let's pop that in

41
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.940
code.

42
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:09.000
Remember it's in a subfolder.

43
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.420
So we need to give it the correct location.

44
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:18.660
I'm going to rename that subfolder just so it's a bit simpler to just Jay query dash UI.

45
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.760
So we want Jay query Dasch UI

46
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.680
slash Jay query UI dot C Ss.

47
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.820
OK there's some custom styles there.

48
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.820
We don't need those.

49
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:44.850
What we really want is the Jake rarey UI javascript which I suspect is at the bottom of the page here.

50
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.900
There we go.

51
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.270
So that's pretty straightforward.

52
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.970
This is linking to Jay query which we've already got set up on our page just so we don't need to do

53
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:55.440
that.

54
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.750
But we do need of course the query UI

55
00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:09.590
javascript and I like to keep my javascript together away from my CFS so there's a query we just need

56
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:17.640
to add again the subfolder J query UI and then the javascript.

57
00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.530
OK so notice I figured that out just by looking at the download.

58
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:31.490
There is of course instructions on the site for getting started and you may have found those scrolling

59
00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.290
down a little and then clicking on the getting started guide and that would just lead you through the

60
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.250
process.

61
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.810
Of downloading et cetera.

62
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:46.810
But generally if you're wanting to dive in with NUJ new query plugin My advice is just download it and

63
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.220
look through the files to see if you can get it set up yourself.

64
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.450
OK.

65
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:57.080
So I'm just going to do a final test to see if this is all worked.

66
00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.970
I'm going to get rid of the custom styles.

67
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.130
From my form and everything else down there as well.

68
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.300
We'll leave the script

69
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.750
code there we go.

70
00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.560
So final challenge then to test that this has been set up correctly.

71
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:30.080
Can you set up a J Querrey trackable element.

72
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.400
I'll give you a clue.

73
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:38.580
If you click View Source on Jay Querrey dot com you'll get something that you should be able to copy

74
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.590
and edit to meet your needs.

75
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:50.380
Go for.

76
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.990
All right.

77
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.320
I hope you manage that.

78
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.650
Some of you may have noticed that you could have just copied and pasted this whole code and popped it

79
00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.590
into your DML file but that would have been slightly against the spirit of the thing.

80
00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.380
So let's try and do it ourselves.

81
00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:08.590
It certainly looks to me like the key line that we're interested in here is this one here which looks

82
00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:15.400
to me like it takes the elements with an ID of tractable and makes it draggle by applying the trackable

83
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.680
function to it.

84
00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.190
So let's just copy that line of code.

85
00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.650
And

86
00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.960
paste that into our script tags and then let's just make an ID of draggle

87
00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:36.000
and

88
00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:44.720
I'll just put some text in it and with any luck if we've connected everything up right.

89
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.030
We'll be able to drag that around as we go.

90
00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.960
So that's how easy it is to get started.

91
00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:00.240
As I said in the next couple of videos we'll look at some other where UI features in a bit more detail

92
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:05.760
specifically how we can customize them and remember the main reason for doing this is not to become

93
00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:12.180
Jake where UI experts but it's to see how to use online documentation for things like Jay queery plugins

94
00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:18.410
in order to apply them to your sites to make them more interactive more powerful and more fun to use

95
00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.380
and will be starting with recyclables.
