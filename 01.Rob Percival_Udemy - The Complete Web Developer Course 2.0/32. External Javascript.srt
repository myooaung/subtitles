1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:06,550
So if you can tell yourself away from our addictive reaction time for just a few moments I'd like to

2
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:15,980
show you how we can separate our javascript from our HDL in just the same way that we did with Stiles.

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:22,140
So let's first separate our styles to remind ourselves how we did that at the end of the previous section.

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:31,630
We're going to create a new file and I'm going to call this style dot C Ss in the same folder as the

5
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:41,710
javascript to HVM l file and then I'm just going to open up the javascript to alleged here Melgen to

6
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:51,680
get the styles and cut so command X or control X and then here in brackets I can actually bring out

7
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:57,110
a menu on the left there so that I can see several different files at once.

8
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:03,090
If you're in a different text editor then you can just switch back and forth between the different files

9
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,300
using Windows.

10
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,010
So once I've taken those styles I can put them into style.

11
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:16,220
Dot CSSA to get our indenting right and then back in the HTL file.

12
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:30,010
Hopefully you'll remember that we create a link with a rel relation of style sheet a type of text slash

13
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:42,310
C S S and an H ref with a hyperlink reference of style C S S and that's it.

14
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:47,260
So if we just check that and run it it should look exactly the same.

15
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,280
Fantastic.

16
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,960
Finally then we're going to do the same thing with the javascript's.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,750
So ignoring the script tags for the moment just copy all of the JavaScript out and I'm going to cut

18
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:01,450
that.

19
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:10,050
So command X or control X on Windows and then I'm going to create a new file I'm going to paste all

20
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,730
of my javascript right in there.

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,570
OK.

22
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:24,070
And then I'm going to save that as script dot.

23
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:24,850
J.S.

24
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:36,880
said the J.S. is of course the javascript extension just like Dotsie SS But javascript and then it's

25
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:46,250
just a matter of getting rid of those script tax completely and replacing them with our javascript.

26
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:52,350
Now in most cases you can put javascript at the head or at the end of an AGM document.

27
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:58,140
I generally recommend doing it at the end partly because all of your HMO elements will be in place by

28
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:04,260
then but also because it gives the chance for the browser to load the page before the javascript kicks

29
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:09,450
in which usually allows the user to start reading the instructions or at least looking at something

30
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,890
before the Javascript has to finish.

31
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:16,350
But there are a lot of other considerations as to where you put your javascript which are beyond.

32
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,640
We need to discuss right now.

33
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:27,240
So I'm going to pop it at the end and we do this using scripts as before and as before we give it a

34
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:32,060
type of text slash Javascript.

35
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:37,440
And this time instead of NH ref we give it an S or C short for source.

36
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,280
Just like an image.

37
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,090
And then we select our file.

38
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,350
Script.

39
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:53,290
J.S. and for script tags we need to manually close them like that and like Link tags.

40
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,080
So lets have a look.

41
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:03,340
That should work in exactly the same way as before and it does indeed.

42
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:08,400
So hopefully you can see that especially if you're working with a big Web site.

43
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,460
We've now got everything really nice and neat.

44
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,660
And I've got all my javascript together in one file.

45
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,480
I've got my styles together in another file and I've got my HMO in a third file.

46
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,660
So it's nice and neat.

47
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,650
Fission for browsers.

48
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,700
If they're downloading a number of different pages on your site and pretty straightforward to maintain

49
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,810
as well.

50
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:32,250
So once again congratulations on making it to the end of the JavaScript section of the complete web

51
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,200
developer course.

52
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,010
Go grab a cup of tea and a biscuit but don't take too long because we've got some jay equerry to look

53
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,070
at and you'll be amazed at what we can achieve.

54
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,130
Just a few lines of Jake rary.

55
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,120
See you in the next section.
