00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.200
All right I'd say hey we're going to have a quick challenge which will give you an opportunity to use

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.300
the javascript you've learned so far as well as force you to recall some of the CSSA that we learned

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.050
in the previous section.

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.310
So get yourself back to just a blank page to meld document with your script tax at the bottom and then

5
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:25.050
the challenge is can you create a red blue and yellow circle all next to each other and then set up

6
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.430
javascript so that when any of those circles are clicked it disappears.

7
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.770
So that's a slight step forward from what we've seen so far we haven't seen how to make anything disappear

8
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.260
but hopefully you can work it out at the very least get those circles up and see what you can make them

9
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.900
do.

10
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.290
Good luck.

11
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.690
All right I hope you manage it.

12
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:57.790
There are of course several different ways to solve this problem but I'm going to go for a similar way

13
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.710
as to how we made some circles last time.

14
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:14.200
So I'm going to have a div with a class of circle and an ID of red circle and then I'm going to add

15
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.300
the styles for that first of

16
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.310
it's just in the usual way we get.

17
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:31.680
So all of the circles are going to have certain styles in common so that's why I'm doing that as a class.

18
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:40.740
So will start off by setting the width to be let's say 200 pixels will set the height to be 200 pixels

19
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.310
as well then to make them circular.

20
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.170
We'll set the border radius to 50 percent.

21
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.600
I want them all in a row.

22
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.600
So I'm going to make them float left.

23
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.310
And finally I want a bit of a gap between them.

24
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.200
So I'm going to give them a margin of 50 pixels OK.

25
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.320
And then the only thing different between them is going to be that color.

26
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:15.770
So let's put it in red circle first and that of course is going to have a background color of red.

27
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:24.600
So let's just check make sure we got a nice big red circle that wonderful and then we'll just do the

28
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.050
same

29
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.760
for a blue circle and a yellow circle.

30
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:44.330
And I'm just going to copy and paste the styles for those say for the sake of background color of blue

31
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.700
and yellow circle background color of yellow

32
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.090
wonderful.

33
00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.310
I think they are floating left but it's going off the edge of the page so let's change the width to

34
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.820
100 and see if we can get them all in a row.

35
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.690
Almost.

36
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.500
OK then let's change the margin right to being 50 pixels that we get.

37
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.340
Even then make them a little bit bigger.

38
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.030
Not that big

39
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.190
930

40
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.020
lovely.

41
00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.070
So now we've got our circles we're just going to create a little bit of interactivity now then it's

42
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.590
just a matter of writing a little bit of Javascript.

43
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.060
And that should all be fine.

44
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.590
Let's start with the red circle.

45
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:53.230
So we're going to want to add an on click function to our element with an ID of red circle and we want

46
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.740
to make it so that when it's clicked it disappears.

47
00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.460
So it should be fairly straightforward.

48
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:09.110
Start with document decide that we want to access something in this document and then go get element

49
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:20.330
by ID then we give it the ID of red circle and then on click and we're going to set that equal to a

50
00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:29.380
function which will define in the Kerry brackets and all we want to do is find it again document or

51
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:41.260
get element by id read Dasch circle and then set the style dot display.

52
00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.660
And just as we did in the previous video set that to none.

53
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.550
And that should make it disappear.

54
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.310
Let's have a look.

55
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.040
Click.

56
00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.180
There it goes.

57
00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.560
All right.

58
00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.690
Simple enough.

59
00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.680
Now let's do it for the other team.

60
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.810
So this is going to be very very similar.

61
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:16.330
What we need to do is change yellow circle and yellow circle and circle blue circle and that will just

62
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.340
apply the same code to each circle.

63
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.790
Lugo's yellow goes red goes.

64
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.800
When I click right click it.

65
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.290
All right I hope you managed that challenge.

66
00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:35.530
And we're going to be coming back to this code when we create our reaction testing game at the end of

67
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.760
this section.

68
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:43.900
For now though we're going to move on away from working with HVM Ellon elements.

69
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.690
For now though we're going to move on and away from HD M-L elements and look at some pure javascript

70
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:55.630
which will allow us to be much more powerful things in our web pages and what we've seen so far and

71
00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.230
we're going to start that process by looking at variables.
