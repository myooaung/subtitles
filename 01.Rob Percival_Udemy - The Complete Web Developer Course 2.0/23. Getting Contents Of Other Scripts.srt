00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,210
Just before we start with a scraper I want to show you two ways we can get the contents of other scripts

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,880
inside our script.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,610
And that's a very useful thing to be able to do for two quite different reasons.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:19,410
On the one hand we might want to organize our B complex scripts into lots of mini scripts to help keep

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,350
them organized.

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,540
You might have a database connection script for example that you don't want to have every time but you

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:29,700
want to just save it once and then include it in your scripts.

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:34,290
On the other hand we might have content on different Web sites or servers that we want to access from

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,520
our site and we'll be able to do both of those by the end of this video.

10
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:47,210
So first off I'm going to show you how to include one ph P file in another do that we'll need to create

11
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:48,980
a second HP file.

12
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:55,000
So I'm going to go back over to five FTB and create another page file

13
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:09,070
call it included file page and then I'm just going to use command to open that in brackets and then

14
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,030
I'm just going to put

15
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,090
some simple BHP I'm included file

16
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:22,450
lovely.

17
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,440
That's what we need for that.

18
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:33,120
So these command w o control will be on Windows to shut that down and then all we need to do to include

19
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:41,150
that in our main page file is we use the include command and then we just give the name of the file

20
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,730
included.

21
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,390
I forget what I call it now included filed up HP

22
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:58,220
and then it will run the PH peacoat from that file.

23
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,530
So let's see it in action.

24
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,870
Now we don't want to resubmit the form that we gave.

25
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:08,890
So that might not look like much in terms of what we've done here but it's actually very powerful.

26
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:14,810
And if for example you want to have a site with say 10 pages but all of those pages have got the same

27
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:21,020
header and footer then you might want to have the header and footer as separate page files and then

28
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:26,200
just include those at the top and the bottom of each of your individual pages.

29
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,640
It's quite an efficient way to do it.

30
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:31,250
So you're not replicating code for every page.

31
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:31,610
All right.

32
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:38,360
So that's how to include APHC file from your own server but we can also get the contents of a completely

33
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,570
different site.

34
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:49,670
So for example we wanted to get the contents of everyone's favorite web hosting Web site we can use

35
00:02:49,670 --> 00:03:00,130
file get contents like that with underscore between the word names and then the full you are Elser.

36
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,690
Yes.

37
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:09,930
And I will slash the read every w dot web hosting Tokarev UK you can try any Web site there you like

38
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,580
and it'll take a little while because it has to download it to the server and then display it to us

39
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:23,240
but it will get the HDMI contents and display them to us.

40
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:28,350
And this is actually something that we're going to be using in the weather scraper to get the weather

41
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:35,500
we're going to use an existing weather Web site and get the contents of it using file contents.

42
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,000
And there we go.

43
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:43,020
So it doesn't look great because the links work because we're not running it on eco with Hastings server

44
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,580
but we have got all the HDMI content there.

45
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,670
So those are two really powerful techniques.

46
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:54,280
When you're working with PKP and we're now ready to take on the final project in the HP section of the

47
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,250
complete web developer of course and that is the weather scraper.
