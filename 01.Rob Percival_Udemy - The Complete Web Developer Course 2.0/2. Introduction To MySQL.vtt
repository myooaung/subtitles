WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.130
So now it's time to look at what's really the last piece of the puzzle when it comes to developing for

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.180
the web.

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.600
We've looked at how we can use e-mail and see SS to style our content and then we use javascript and

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.850
Jay query to make our pages interactive and functional within the browser.

5
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.860
Then we looked at HP to see how we could run code on the server side.

6
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:30.210
And finally what we need is a database to allow us to store details of our users or our content or whatever

7
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.110
we want on our website that's going to be updated regularly and we're going to be doing this with my

8
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:42.470
Eskil Eskew L stands for server query language and there are various different types of Escal out there.

9
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.280
We're going to be using my askew L because it's completely free it's open source and it's extremely

10
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.680
widely used.

11
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.040
It's also available very simply on the web hosting that comes with the costs.

12
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:59.030
And also if you've installed your own Apache server so it's well worth learning.

13
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.330
In this video we're going to take a look at how to set up a minuscule database on Eger web hosting.

14
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.380
Obviously if you're using a different host or if you've installed Apache on your own machine you can

15
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.340
follow their instructions to set up the database.

16
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.830
So I'm going to be working on a complete web developer because don't come.

17
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.470
So if you want to set this up and follow along it's easier.

18
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.610
Web hosting Dockerty UK slash C.P. slash list domains that will get a list of all your domain names.

19
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.610
If you haven't set any up yet then go to the hosting set up section of this course and do that first

20
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:39.400
and then when we click on the domain name here that will take us to the C panel where we can do a lot

21
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:48.810
of things but specifically we can set up databases say hey we gave.

22
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.350
Scroll down to web tools and you can see the option inside web tools.

23
00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:01.030
There is my SU Well databases and here we are where we need to do is put in.

24
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.640
I use the name so let's pretend we want to create a database to store our users.

25
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:16.750
So I might call this a user's database and then I'll click Create and that's it.

26
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.420
We've got our database up and running.

27
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:26.390
If I then scroll down you can see that it's created this database here but the database user name is

28
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.700
not what I put in.

29
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.500
This is because the user name is change depending on what server is running on.

30
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.700
So this one is running on C-L 29 and also to keep databases separate.

31
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.380
A random three character string is added on the end there.

32
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.690
That also increases security because your database name is harder to guess.

33
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:50.120
Also make note of the database password which will be displayed just once when you've created your database

34
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.950
will need that to connect to the database in the next lecture.

35
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.700
The password is case sensitive.

36
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.280
All right.

37
00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.120
So that's set up our database.

38
00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:08.390
Let's see how we can manage our database in order to add some tables and some content get taken over

39
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.750
to PH P my admin.

40
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.250
So this is a very common database interaction too.

41
00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.350
And it's pretty good as well.

42
00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.690
I use it all the time.

43
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.490
So we've got some information about our database server versions etc..

44
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.760
Over on the right password options and appearances in the middle of really what we want to do is click

45
00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.280
on the database itself that we want to work with.

46
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:35.930
So I'm going to click over on the left and then because this is an empty database there are no tables

47
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:36.500
in it.

48
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.810
My only option is to create a table.

49
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.870
So the simplest way to think about a database is that it is a collection of tables and each table could

50
00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.820
be imagined to be more or less an Excel spreadsheet with a bunch of rows and columns.

51
00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:57.320
So if I want to store a bunch of uses I might want to create a table or a spreadsheet with the name

52
00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.570
uses unlike an Excel spreadsheet.

53
00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.980
I need to specify how many columns I want my table to have I can change this later on.

54
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:13.090
But I think I want to store an email address a password and an ID number for each of my users.

55
00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:23.150
So I'm going to put in three columns that are right now I need to describe each of my columns and tell

56
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.060
the database what type of variable they're going to contain.

57
00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.460
So I'm going to start off with my ID number.

58
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.370
Now it's a very very good idea to have an ID number in all of your tables.

59
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.570
So it should really be the first thing that you put in every time.

60
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.460
Not only does it make it easy to find a particular record but it also actually makes your database more

61
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.880
efficient and faster.

62
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.790
When it comes to finding information in it.

63
00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.240
So we'll call it ID.

64
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.820
It's going to be an integer.

65
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.270
So just a whole number there.

66
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.500
I don't need to specify any length values daily to give it a default value.

67
00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:04.220
I'm going to miss out those bits there but what I do want to have is I want to set this as the primary

68
00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:11.420
key and then the database knows that this number is going to be a unique key that we can use to refer

69
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.130
to a particular row.

70
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:20.150
And then I'm going to click AI which is short for auto increment and that essentially just means it'll

71
00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.030
add 1 to the ID each time we add a new user.

72
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:25.640
Which is a very useful feature.

73
00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.690
So we don't need to set the ID number manually ourselves.

74
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.130
OK so now we've got our ID number.

75
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:38.950
We're going to have our e-mail address which I'll call e-mail and this time we don't want an integer

76
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.440
because it's not a number.

77
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.710
I'm going to use a text type there.

78
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.360
You can see we've got lots of different types of column similar to the types of variable that we have.

79
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:55.010
But many more we're going to look at several of those later on in this section.

80
00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:00.810
But I'm just going to go for text for my email field.

81
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:08.640
Finally we're going to have password as well and that's going to be text to.

82
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:14.190
We don't need to set default values for any of these or indeed change any of these more complex options

83
00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:20.360
at all we can have some comments if we want but I'm just going to leave that blank and then click Sife

84
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:27.890
and that will then create our table right here and you can see there's a number of things that we can

85
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:33.560
do with that table we can browse the data in it we can change the structure so we could add or remove

86
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:39.910
columns or change the types of certain columns etc. We can search it we can insert data into it.

87
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:44.710
We can make it empty or we can drop it or delete it completely.

88
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:51.170
So as we don't have any data yet let's insert something first of all and then we'll have a quick browse

89
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.710
before we go on to connecting to our database with the script in the next video.

90
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.480
So let's add an email address for Rob.

91
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.610
Rob Percival Tokarev UK.

92
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:14.590
And then I'm going to very securely use my password as a password and then we just click go and then

93
00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:20.710
it runs this as well which we won't look into in that much detail right now but we'll be writing stuff

94
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:26.550
like this in just a couple of videos time you can possibly imagine what this does it says insert into.

95
00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.810
And then there's the database name and the table name.

96
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:35.440
And then we've got the three column names and then the values for each of those names so we've got now

97
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.870
for I.D. because that's autoincrement So it's going to be created by itself and then we've got Roback

98
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:45.160
we're Percival the UK for the email and my password for the password.

99
00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.150
And you can see that's been successful because we've got a tick up there.

100
00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:56.300
Quite so now that we've added a row to our table let's just browse and have a look and you can see now

101
00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:59.900
we've got the table itself with an item in it.

102
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:05.560
So it's got an idea of one because it's the first one could be email there and it's got the password.

103
00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:07.520
So that's pretty much all we're going to look at here.

104
00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:13.330
One very quick word on passwords is that you should never store your user's passwords in plain text

105
00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:15.020
like I'm doing here.

106
00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.590
This is very bad because if you get hacked and someone gets access to your database then they can see

107
00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:24.420
all of your user's passwords so they would be able to access their accounts on your system.

108
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:29.010
But more significantly because people use the same password for many different accounts they might well

109
00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:34.390
be able to access their PayPal account or even their Twitter account and take control over it.

110
00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:37.680
So I'll show you how to properly store passwords later on in the section.

111
00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.940
But for now we're just concentrating on how databases work.

112
00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:42.690
So there we go.

113
00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:46.900
Feel free to have a click around HP my admin and see what else you can do.

114
00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:53.010
But essentially what we've got is a database is a set of tables each of which can be thought of as more

115
00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:56.120
or less an Excel spreadsheet with columns.

116
00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:01.580
In this case Id email and password and then rows with particular values in.

117
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:06.690
In this case an idea of one e-mail of Roback proposal would occur to you OK and then password of my

118
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:11.770
password then we can have as many of these as we like and we can search them we can take them.

119
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:13.670
We can do whatever we like with them.

120
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.560
So databases are extremely powerful.

121
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.960
They're absolutely critical to web development.

122
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:22.320
But of course we don't want to just work with our database in HP my admin.

123
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:28.010
We wanted to run on our Web site and to do that we need to use a server language and we're going to

124
00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:30.040
do that with HP.

125
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:34.530
So we'll see how to connect to our database with HP in the next few.
