00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.980
All right so moving on from links.

2
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.250
We're going to look at HTL entities.

3
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:11.160
So what are HVM our entities are really they're a way of displaying symbols on your page.

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.720
So let's say for example that we were writing a web site teaching people how to code to show them how

5
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.380
to put a link into their web pages.

6
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.030
Well then we'd need to be able to show them the ATAC.

7
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.270
So something like that to start off with but of course if we try and display that on our page nothing

8
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.710
appears.

9
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:41.280
And in fact even if we just have an atack on its own like that the browser won't display it because

10
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.240
it thinks it's a bit of a link.

11
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.770
So to get round that problem and indeed to display any character we want we use HDMI entities.

12
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.520
Now it requires knowing the specific code for the character that you want to display.

13
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.630
I wouldn't recommend learning these.

14
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:04.890
I'd recommend just remembering that you can google HDMI entities and then you've got a big list of all

15
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.220
the ones that you want.

16
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.120
So I'm going to go for the top result here will be three schools as we saw before because it lists some

17
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.520
of the most common ones.

18
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.410
So you can see first of how we get these entities.

19
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.660
So they all happen and symbol at the beginning and then either a name or a number and you can use either.

20
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.950
I generally go for the name because it's a little bit easier to work out what it is rather than remembering

21
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.160
what all the entity numbers are.

22
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.310
So if we wanted to display this then we want to less than sign first of which is and and then less then

23
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.970
and then a semi-colon there.

24
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.530
So I would just replace that with the and symbols so shift 7 or most keyboards I think.

25
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.570
And then you can see very helpfully my text editor actually predicts them for me.

26
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.320
So I could get them there if yours doesn't that's fine we can just type them in.

27
00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.430
So less than LTE and then a colon there.

28
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.380
So a very quick challenge can you replace the symbol the greater than symbol with the appropriate entity

29
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.080
name.

30
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:20.580
If you managed it it simply and and then greater than and then colon you can see a code orange here

31
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.220
because it recognizes that that's the nature of our entity.

32
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:32.630
Let's have a look then finally we've got what we wanted which was this I e-tag there and then of course

33
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:44.030
we could at the age ref equals GTP or dot com something like that if we wanted to.

34
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.810
And then that would all appear very nicely but HDMI and these are not just for coding symbols we can

35
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.580
use them to put copyright symbols in our web pages.

36
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.870
Currency symbols and a bunch more as well.

37
00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.810
If you want to see all of the different entities that we can use that second link there as the mole

38
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.030
and there are many many different entities that we might want to use.

39
00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.300
All right so now you know how to add characters and other symbols to your web pages in the next video

40
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.650
we'll look at something really powerful and that's including content from other web sites in your web

41
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.190
page and you can actually do that really easily using I4 Aimes.
