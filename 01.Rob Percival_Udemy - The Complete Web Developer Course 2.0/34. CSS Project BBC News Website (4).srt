1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,730
Excellence so well done for staying with me.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,180
We've done a lot of work here and we're almost finished.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:12,660
So we've got our nice top bar at the top then we've got our menu bar in two shades of red and then we've

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,660
got our main article content over here.

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:21,710
All we need left now is the section on the right watch slash listen.

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,870
So I should be fairly trivial.

7
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,170
Nothing too tricky in there are just a couple of images and some links.

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,150
So if you have done this whole thing by watching me then that's great but why not take the opportunity

9
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,070
to do this last bit on your own.

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,130
There really is nothing fancy there.

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,780
It's all pretty straightforward.

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,250
Give it a shot if you feel you might be able to.

13
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,540
OK so let's start at the top.

14
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,370
Watch slash listen is what we're after.

15
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,890
And we want to do that in a new day.

16
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,220
So we're still inside any day.

17
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,560
I'm not too sure.

18
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:13,540
You can see the page content gets the page contained was the full 1000 pixels.

19
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:22,140
So this is going to be how Watch and listen Dave and I'll use an H for it just for fun.

20
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,590
Watch slash listen we'll have a quick look.

21
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,620
Just to remind ourselves what style we're going for.

22
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,290
It's a pretty big black.

23
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:40,110
Probably not but old let's take a look.

24
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,340
All right.

25
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:46,810
So not too bad.

26
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,820
I think one thing I'm going to do is

27
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,860
temporarily clear the flights so that I can see it again without having to

28
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,180
change everything.

29
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:07,750
That's probably a good idea to clear them before the day that I want to appear underneath.

30
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,430
So let's do a little bit of styling there.

31
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,540
First off we want to style watch listen.

32
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:19,460
I think all we need is a bit of padding or possibly margin on the left

33
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:30,720
that we'll find out doesn't really matter which we choose to pop in 20 pixels.

34
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:31,490
I would get

35
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,640
and then I really want to age four.

36
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,600
So let's have fun.

37
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:52,510
Whites is normal but font size is maybe 20 pixels try that that looks about right to me.

38
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,800
Unfortunately we are going to have to make this bigger and smaller.

39
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,350
OK.

40
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,830
That looks great.

41
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,870
So let's get these images.

42
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:08,570
One

43
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:17,530
I think I'm going to get all three in one go.

44
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,740
Here we go.

45
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,270
So let's copy these.

46
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:38,280
We'll have Article 1 article t and Article 3.

47
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,450
OK.

48
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,140
Copy them as before.

49
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,660
And then just pop them in images fold up

50
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:51,770
wonderful.

51
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:53,170
OK.

52
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,490
So let's get the image up first.

53
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:08,030
Underneath our age for we're going to have first off our image it's going to an S I'll say of images

54
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:08,730
slash

55
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:22,140
Article 1 and we can do this we can style these all the same when we come to think that we're going

56
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,160
to have this image here as well.

57
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:30,930
So we can't just use all the all the images inside watched watch listen.

58
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,460
So let's give it a special class

59
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:44,150
or call it article sight image because I think I might have used optical image before.

60
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,800
I'm not sure.

61
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,670
So article Syeed

62
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,340
image we definitely wanted to float left

63
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,770
and we're going to want to play with the size a little bit.

64
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,230
I suspect yet because that's pretty big.

65
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,530
So let's try with Paul.

66
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,880
Maybe 70 pixels.

67
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:13,680
Little bit small

68
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,110
Let's try out 90.

69
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,060
See how it looks.

70
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,530
Ok then we've got

71
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:34,840
text there which I copy a.

72
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:35,580
OK.

73
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,530
If I control click or right click that lets me copy it

74
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,550
that's a link again.

75
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,170
But we don't really care where it goes.

76
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:57,910
But we wanted to be definitely black possibly bold and pretty big.

77
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,740
So not very much like that

78
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,300
all the links here are going to be the same.

79
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:15,700
So rather than giving it a separate class that's keep our code lean and mean and just style it using

80
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,730
wash listen.

81
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:24,510
Oh come to think of it we're going to have separate style links there.

82
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:25,890
Maybe we should give it a class

83
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,890
bit messy but probably slightly easier to understand.

84
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,880
So I watched Tash listen Daschle

85
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,740
OK so we definitely want no underlining

86
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,890
we want the color to be black.

87
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:06,090
Well try making the font white Bold and the font size.

88
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,380
Let's try out 18 pixels

89
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,670
OK.

90
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,230
I think that looks pretty good.

91
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:24,690
We then want to make it go blue on the Hulver which we've done before.

92
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:26,890
OK.

93
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,630
So always copy and paste if you can

94
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,940
fewer chances of you making mistakes.

95
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,960
Well it looks like I have made a mistake.

96
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:56,560
So maybe I just need what listen link on Hava have a guy that's been a because of course is not an within

97
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,270
watch lists and link it is Watchlist and.

98
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:07,580
OK we want a bit of a gap between the image and our headline as well.

99
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:14,030
So I think we'll do that as a margin right.

100
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,030
On the image itself.

101
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,570
Every guy looks nice.

102
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:32,190
And let's set the width of our watch listen Dave now so that that wraps up nicely say maybe 300 pixels.

103
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:40,090
BACS let's give it a little bit more if we can.

104
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,380
OK we'll try that out and see if you've got room to fit in there.

105
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,200
I think we have.

106
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:56,630
OK so now we've just got the date which is exactly the same as what we had over here.

107
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:05,270
So we should be able to copy and paste our code which would be nice let's have a look.

108
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,510
Say OK

109
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,610
let's put that inside a paragraph tag

110
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,230
and then we can have another paragraph tag.

111
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:36,350
So we've got our clock image same as before but we're going to need some styling that so let's create

112
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:46,550
a class of clock so that we can steal the styling that we had before and make it not limited to images

113
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:51,350
inside whatever we called it.

114
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:57,240
The article or I think on the article's summary there we go.

115
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:01,050
So instead of article summary image we're now going to have clock

116
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,850
shouldn't change anything over that.

117
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,170
It will just allow us to use it in more than one place.

118
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:17,690
OK.

119
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,940
So here we go we've got our clock.

120
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,600
Now we've got the idea of date.

121
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,280
We're going to want to use that more than once.

122
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,120
Now let's change it from an I.D. to a class

123
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:41,880
and then I'm going to use Command F or control f on Windows to find out on it because it's not there

124
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:46,930
yet it's hashed state and we want to change that to date.

125
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,760
OK let's have a look.

126
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:59,310
Really we didn't actually want the technology this time but we will want to later on.

127
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,420
So let's keep it in for now.

128
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:06,370
One thing you might have noticed is this technology actually goes below the image but it doesn't wrap

129
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,450
round.

130
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:14,250
So what we're going to need to do is create a div here on the right so that it doesn't wrap as it's

131
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,020
doing at the moment

132
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:24,450
underneath the image like that that while I'm looking at that as well I think we might need to get rid

133
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,620
of a little bit of padding.

134
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,780
Oh no that's OK.

135
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,960
Slightly lower down.

136
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,220
That's fine.

137
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,230
OK.

138
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:38,420
So let's create a div around everything to the right of the image.

139
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,120
So I'll just call this side article

140
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:57,670
and then all of this can be indented.

141
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,640
And then we want site article

142
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:08,770
fact I don't know if we actually need any styles all

143
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,840
we certainly need something

144
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:31,540
that's give its a float all right and a fixed width.

145
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,060
All right we're getting that.

146
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:35,580
But let's move that up a little bit.

147
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,380
Try 15 pixels

148
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:51,950
up or down.

149
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:53,280
That's pretty good.

150
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,040
I'm happy with that.

151
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:01,550
Let's before we add all the others let's just get rid of our clear.

152
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:08,910
So it should now be floating right but it's not.

153
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:09,780
I suspect

154
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,350
it's because it's too wide

155
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,840
so let's have a look at it.

156
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:31,850
Change that to 150 pixels fast Ok not quite take out much less than

157
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:38,600
change the way that I can.

158
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:44,240
That's Clasen.

159
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:48,470
Let's add a flake right.

160
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,460
Just to definitely get it up there.

161
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,330
OK.

162
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,690
Brilliant.

163
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,320
So now we're in the right place.

164
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,360
We just need to get our wits sorted out.

165
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:00,900
OK.

166
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,500
Slightly too wide

167
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,970
still slightly too wide.

168
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:10,740
OK.

169
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,180
There we go.

170
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,980
So now we're in position.

171
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:23,380
I think we can make side optical part a little bit wider.

172
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,690
We can move it up a touch more.

173
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,110
So let's just get the coloring right here.

174
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:49,780
We want the span with a class of date so you can command F and search a date to get right them.

175
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:57,160
And I think it's that color that we want the same as the article summary.

176
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,780
That's great.

177
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:04,460
And now here we want that to appear just on its own.

178
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:11,790
And then if we've got a link as we have in the second one we want a pipe there or a bit of border and

179
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:14,890
then our technology on the next line.

180
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,420
So the wildy that is

181
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:38,390
will break our flights or clear our flights there and then copy all of this to get a new article just

182
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:38,890
have a look.

183
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:39,250
Okay.

184
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:44,010
Very nice.

185
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:53,450
So now we can get rid of the topic link from the top one arrogated So that's just nine to the general

186
00:15:53,450 --> 00:16:02,380
2016 now and then we need to edit our code so that this technology appears on the next line.

187
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:07,820
But we also want the border to appear on the right which is a bit of a pain because we've put the border

188
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,460
on the left of the technology link.

189
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:17,040
So let's add another class to the link saying no border.

190
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:22,380
And we'll add another class of the span saying border right

191
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:29,240
and we'll use this to override the existing classes.

192
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,670
So no border

193
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:39,950
we want border left to be none.

194
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,070
And let's just check.

195
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,680
We might need an important there.

196
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:52,910
No that's that's achieved it in itself but it has taken us back to the original.

197
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:56,990
But that's OK that's highlighted an error actually there should be.

198
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,910
Class is topic link and no border and that should be the same.

199
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:03,840
Then up here.

200
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,240
Yes.

201
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:10,030
That should be a class of topic link because we're now using it more than once.

202
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:19,610
So let's find out what link commando control F and then t takes us on I then topic link.

203
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,480
There we go.

204
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,000
So that's now Clauss

205
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,640
abrogate that's better.

206
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:30,170
So I've got the class without the border.

207
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,790
We also don't want the padding there anymore either.

208
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,310
So in our no bored class let's get rid of that padding

209
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:55,790
axiom and then let's add the border in to the right of the span.

210
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,390
So this is the border right.

211
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:57,790
Class.

212
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:58,090
Now

213
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,460
and that's going to be

214
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,850
the same as this one.

215
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,610
But on the right

216
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:27,080
I think it's already got putting right of 10 so that should be OK.

217
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,970
Let's have a look.

218
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,100
OK.

219
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,760
That's great.

220
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,590
We do really want to be on separate lines.

221
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:43,150
So let's see if we can put in a line break.

222
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,900
In between them.

223
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,510
Wonderful.

224
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,620
All right.

225
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,660
That looks pretty good.

226
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,740
So now it's just a matter of updating

227
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:05,820
every day the titles and the images for the other articles.

228
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:15,840
Rid of that and so that's going to be off to go to.

229
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,730
And then we're going to want to clear all of that again

230
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:25,160
and create another side article.

231
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:26,860
Article 3

232
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,730
copy the content than

233
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,850
paste that in.

234
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,290
Get rid of that video.

235
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,400
And finally

236
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:50,770
article for

237
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:59,730
and what is a VPN service very good question.

238
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,590
OK.

239
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:11,140
And I think one of those yet has a different topic.

240
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:20,400
So the second one is science and environment not technology that once very

241
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:33,170
OK let's have a look and then maybe I only copied three optical images.

242
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,050
That's fine.

243
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:36,040
I'll stop at the three.

244
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,080
That was the threshold that we wanted to go down to anyway.

245
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,660
And there we go.

246
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:47,180
I'm sure the perfectionist The monkey or the future of web designers will find lots of small ways to

247
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,370
improve that and get it even closer to the original.

248
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:56,140
But I think to the layman's eye there's not much to obviously see the difference.

249
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,320
So congratulations.

250
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,450
I hope you managed to do a good chunk of it yourself.

251
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,040
But even if you've just followed along with the videos I hope you've learned a great deal and see how

252
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:11,670
you can take the knowledge that you've learned in this section and create a world class web site for

253
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:14,590
many of you that was probably the biggest coding challenge you've ever had.

254
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,140
So welcome once again for making it to the end.

255
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:22,070
Go and have a nice cup of tea and a couple of chocolate digestives and then come back to do some real

256
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:25,210
coding with javascript in the next section.
